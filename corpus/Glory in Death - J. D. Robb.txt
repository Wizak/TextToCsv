j d robb glory in death chapter one the dead were her business she lived with them worked with them studied them she dreamed of them and because that didnt seem to be enough in some deep secret chamber of her heart she mourned for them a decade as a cop had toughened her given her a cold clinical and often cynical eye toward death and its many causes it made scenes such as the one she viewed now on a rainy night on a dark street nasty with litter almost too usual but still she felt murder no longer shocked but it continued to repel the woman had been lovely once long trails of her golden hair spread out like rays on the dirty sidewalk her eyes wide and still with that distressed expression death often left in them were a deep purple against cheeks bloodlessly white and wet with rain shed worn an expensive suit the same rich color as her eyes the jacket was neatly buttoned in contrast to the jerkedup skirt that exposed her trim thighs jewels glittered on her fingers at her ears against the sleek lapel of the jacket a leather bag with a gold clasp lay near her outstretched fingers her throat had been viciously slashed lieutenant eve dallas crouched down beside death and studied it carefully the sights and scents were familiar but each time every time there was something new both victim and killer left their own imprint their own style and made murder personal the scene had already been recorded police sensors and the more intimate touch of the privacy screen were in place to keep the curious barricaded and to preserve the murder site street traffic such as it was in this area had been diverted air traffic was light at this hour of the night and caused little distraction the backbeat from the music of the sex club across the street thrummed busily in the air punctuated by the occasional howl from the celebrants the colored lights from its revolving sign pulsed against the screen splashing garish colors over the victims body eve could have ordered it shut down for the night but it seemed an unnecessary hassle even in with the gun ban even though genetic testing often weeded out the more violent hereditary traits before they could bloom murder happened and it happened with enough regularity that the fun seekers across the street would be miffed at the idea of being moved along for such a minor inconvenience as death a uniform stood by continuing video and audio beside the screen a couple of forensics sweepers huddled against the driving rain and talked shop and sports they hadnt bothered to look at the body yet hadnt recognized her was it worse eve wondered and her eyes hardened as she watched the rain wash through blood when you knew the victim shed had only a professional relationship with prosecuting attorney cicely towers but enough of one to have formed a strong opinion of a strong woman a successful woman eve thought a fighter one who had pursued justice doggedly had she been pursuing it here in this miserable neighborhood with a sigh eve reached over and opened the elegant and expensive bag to corroborate her visual id cicely towers she said for the recorder female age fortyfive divorced resides twentyone thirtytwo east eightythird number sixtyone b no robbery victim still wearing jewelry approximately she flipped through the wallet twenty in hard bills fifty credit tokens six credit cards left at scene no overt signs of struggle or sexual assault she looked back at the woman sprawled on the sidewalk what the hell were you doing out here towers she wondered here away from the power center away from your classy home address and dressed for business she thought eve knew cicely towerss authoritative wardrobe well had admired it in court and at city hall strong colors always camera ready coordinated accessories always with a feminine touch eve rose rubbed absently at the wet knees of her jeans homicide she said briefly bag her o o it was no surprise to eve that the media had caught the scent of murder and were already hunting it down before shed reached the glossy building where cicely towers had lived several remotes and eager reporters were camped on the pristine sidewalk the fact that it was three a m and raining buckets didnt deter them in their eyes eve saw the wolf gleam the story was the prey ratings the trophy she could ignore the cameras that swung in her direction the questions shot out like stinging darts she was almost used to the loss of her anonymity the case she had investigated and closed during the past winter had catapulted her into the public eye the case she thought now as she aimed a steely glance at a reporter who had the nerve to block her path and her relationship with roarke the case had been murder and violent death however exciting soon passed out of the public interest but roarke was always news what do you have lieutenant do you have a suspect is there a motive can you confirm that prosecuting attorney towers was decapitated eve slowed her groundeating stride briefly and swept her gaze over the huddle of soggy feraleyed reporters she was wet tired and revolted but she was careful shed learned that if you gave the media any part of yourself it squeezed it twisted it and wrung it dry the department has no comment at this time other than that the investigation into prosecuting attorney towerss death is proceeding are you in charge of the case im primary she said shortly then swung between the two uniforms guarding the entrance to the building the lobby was full of flowers long banks and flows of fragrant colorful blooms that made her think of spring in some exotic place the island where she had spent three dazzling days with roarke while shed recovered from a bullet wound and exhaustion she didnt take time to smile over the memory as she would have under other circumstances but flashed her badge and moved across the terracotta tiles to the first elevator there were more uniforms inside two were behind the lobby desk handling the computerized security others watched the entrance still others stood by the elevator tubes it was more manpower than necessary but as pa towers had been one of their own her apartments secured eve asked the closest cop yes sir no ones been in or out since your call at oh two ten ill want copies of the security discs she stepped into the elevator for the last twentyfour hours to start she glanced down at the name on his uniform i want a detail of six for doortodoors beginning at seven hundred biggs floor sixtyone she ordered and the elevators clear doors closed silently she stepped out into the sixtyfirsts lush carpet and museum quiet the halls were narrow as they were in most multihabitation buildings erected within the last half century the walls were a flawless creamy white with mirrors at rigid intervals to lend the illusion of space space was no problem within the units eve mused there were only three on the entire floor she decoded the lock on b using her police and security master card and stepped into quiet elegance cicely towers had done well for herself eve decided and she liked to live well as eve took the pocket video from her field kit and clipped it onto her jacket she scanned the living area she recognized two paintings by a prominent twentyfirst century artist hanging on the pale rosetoned wall above a wide ushaped conversation area done in muted stripes of pinks and greens it was her association with roarke that had her identifying the paintings and the easy wealth in the simplicity of decor and selected pieces how much does a pa pull in per year she wondered as the camera recorded the scene everything was tidy meticulously so but then eve reflected from what she knew of towers the woman had been meticulous in her dress in her work in maintaining her privacy so what had an elegant smart and meticulous woman been doing in a nasty neighborhood in the middle of a nasty night eve walked through the room the floor was white wood and shone like a mirror beneath lovely rugs that echoed the dominant colors of the room on a table were framed holograms of children in varying stages of growth from babyhood on through to the college years a boy and girl both pretty both beaming odd eve thought shed worked with towers on countless cases over the years had she known the woman had children with a shake of her head she walked over to the small computer built into a stylish workstation in the corner of the room again she used her master card to engage it list appointments for cicely towers may two eves lips pursed as she read the data an hour at an upscale private health club prior to a full day in court followed by a six oclock with a prominent defense attorney then a dinner engagement eves brow lifted dinner with george hammett roarke had dealings with hammett eve remembered shed met him now twice and knew him to be a charming and canny man who made his rather exorbitant living with transportation and hammett was cicely towerss final appointment of the day print she murmured and tucked the hard copy in her bag she tried the telelink next requesting all incoming and outgoing calls for the past fortyeight hours it was likely she would have to dig deeper but for now she ordered a recording of the calls tucked the disc away and began a long careful search of the apartment by five a m her eyes were gritty and her head ached the single hours sleep she had managed to tuck in between sex and murder was beginning to wear on her according to known information she said wearily for the recorder the victim lived alone no indication from initial investigation to the contrary no indication that the victim left her apartment other than voluntarily and no record of an appointment that would explain why the victim traveled to the location of the murder primary has secured data from her computer and telelink for further investigation doortodoors will begin at oh seven hundred and building security discs will be confiscated primary is leaving victims residence and will be en route to victims offices in city hall lieutenant dallas eve oh five oh eight eve switched off the audio and video secured her field kit and headed out o o it was past ten when she made it back to cop central in concession to her hollow stomach she zipped through the eatery disappointed but not surprised to find most of the good stuff long gone by that hour she settled for a soy muffin and what the eatery liked to pretend was coffee as bad as it was she downed everything before she settled in her office it was just as well as her link beeped instantly lieutenant she bit back a sigh as she stared into whitneys wide grimeyed face commander my office now there wasnt time to close her mouth before the screen went blank the hell with it she thought she scrubbed her hands over her face then through her short choppy brown hair there went any chance of checking her messages of calling roarke to let him know what she was into or of the tenminute catnap shed been fantasizing about she rose again worked out the kinks in her shoulders she did take the time to remove her jacket the leather had protected her shirt but her jeans were still damp philosophically she ignored the discomfort and gathered up what little data she had if she was lucky she might get another cup of cop coffee in the commanders office it only took eve about ten seconds to realize the coffee would have to wait whitney wasnt sitting behind his desk as was his habit he was standing facing the singlewall window that gave him his personal view of the city hed served and protected for more than thirty years his hands were clasped behind his back but the relaxed pose was negated by the white knuckles eve briefly studied the broad shoulders the grizzled dark hair and the wide back of the man who had only months before refused the office of chief to remain in command here commander its stopped raining her eyes narrowed in puzzlement before she carefully made them blank yes sir its a good city all in all dallas its easy to forget that from up here but its a good city all in all im working to remember that right now she said nothing had nothing to say she waited i made you primary on this technically deblinsky was up so i want to know if she gives you any flak deblinskys a good cop yes she is youre better because her brows flew up she was grateful he still had his back to her i appreciate your confidence commander youve earned it i overrode procedure to put you in control for personal reasons i need the best someone wholl go to the wall and over it most of us knew pa towers commander there isnt a cop in new york who wouldnt go to the wall and over it to find who killed her he sighed and the deep inhalation of air rippled through his thick body before he turned for a moment longer he said nothing only studied the woman hed put in charge she was slim deceptively so for he had reason to know she had more stamina than was apparent in that long slender body she was showing some fatigue now in the shadows under her whiskey colored eyes in the pallor of her bony face he couldnt let that worry him not now cicely towers was a personal friend a close personal friend i see eve wondered if she did im sorry commander i knew her for years we started out together a hotdogging cop and an eagerbeaver criminal lawyer my wife and i are godparents to her son he paused a moment and seemed to fight for control ive notified her children my wife is meeting them theyll stay with us until after the memorial he cleared his throat pressed his lips together cicely was one of my oldest friends and above and beyond my professional respect and admiration for her i loved her very much my wife is devastated by this cicelys children are shattered all i could tell them was that i would do everything anything in my power to find the person who did this to her to give her what she worked for most of her life justice now he did sit not with authority but with weariness im telling you this dallas so that you know up front i have no objectivity on this case none because i dont im depending on you i appreciate you being frank commander she hesitated only an instant as a personal friend of the victims itll be necessary to interview you as soon as possible she watched his eyes flicker and harden your wife as well commander if its more comfortable i can conduct the interviews at your home rather than here i see he drew another breath thats why youre primary dallas there arent many cops whod have the nerve to zero in so directly id appreciate it if youd wait until tomorrow perhaps even a day or two longer to see my wife and if youd see her at home ill set it up yes sir what have you got so far i did a recon on the victims residence and her office i have files of the cases she had pending and those that she closed over the last five years i need to crosscheck names to see if anyone she sent up has been released recently their families and associates particularly the violent offenders her batting average was very high cicely was a tiger in the courtroom and i never knew her to miss a detail until now why was she there commander in the middle of the night prelim autopsy puts time of death at one sixteen its a rough neighborhood shakedowns muggings sex joints theres a known chemical trading center a couple of blocks from where she was found i dont know she was a careful woman but she was also arrogant he smiled a little admirably so shed go head to head with the worst this citys got to offer but to put herself in deliberate jeopardy i dont know she was trying a case fluentes murder two strangulation of a lady friend his lawyers using the passion defense but word is towers was going to send him away im checking it out is he on the street or in a cage on the street first violent offense bail was dead low being it was murder he was required to wear a homing bracelet but that doesnt mean diddly if he knew anything about electronics would she have met with him absolutely not it would corrupt her case to meet a defendant out of the courtroom thinking of cicely remembering cicely whitney shook his head that shed never risk but he could have used other means to lure her there like i said im checking it out she had a dinner appointment last night with george hammett do you know him socially they saw each other occasionally nothing serious according to my wife she was always trying to find the perfect man for cicely commander its best if i ask now off the record were you sexually involved with the victim a muscle in his cheek jerked but his eyes stayed level no i wasnt we had a friendship and that friendship was very valuable in essence she was family you wouldnt understand family dallas no her voice was flat i suppose not im sorry for that squeezing his eyes shut whitney rubbed his hands over his face that was uncalled for and unfair and your question was relevant he dropped his hands youve never lost anyone close to you have you dallas not that i remember it shreds you to pieces he murmured she supposed it would in the decade she had known whitney she had seen him furious impatient even coldly cruel but she had never seen him devastated if that was what being close and losing did to a strong man eve supposed she was better off as she was she had no family to lose and only vague ugly flashes of her childhood her life as it was now had begun when she was eight years old and had been found battered and abandoned in texas what had happened before that day didnt matter she told herself constantly that it didnt matter she had made herself into what she was who she was for friendship she had precious few she cared enough for trusted enough in as for more than friendship there was roarke he had whittled away at her until shed given him more enough more to frighten her at odd moments frighten her because she knew he wouldnt be satisfied until he had all if she gave him all then lost him would she be in shreds rather than dwell on it eve dosed herself with coffee and the remains of a candy bar she unearthed in her desk the prospect of lunch was a fantasy right up there with spending a week in the tropics she sipped and munched while she scanned the final autopsy report on her monitor the time of death remained as issued in the prelim the cause a severed jugular and the resulting loss of blood and oxygen the victim had enjoyed a meal of sea scallops and wild greens wine real coffee and fresh fruit with whipped cream ingestion estimated at five hours before death the call had come in quickly cicely towers had been dead only ten minutes before a cab driver brave or desperate enough to work the neighborhood had spotted the body and reported it the first cruiser had arrived three minutes later her killer had moved fast eve mused then again it was easy to fade in a neighborhood like that to slip into a car a doorway a club there would have been blood the jugular gushed and sprayed but the rain would have been an asset washing it from the murderers hands she would have to comb the neighborhood ask questions that were unlikely to receive any sort of viable answers still bribes often worked where procedure or threats wouldnt she was studying the police photo of cicely towers with her necklace of blood when her link beeped dallas homicide a face flashed on her screen young beaming and sly lieutenant whats the word eve didnt swear though she wanted to her opinion of reporters wasnt terribly high but c j morse was on the lowest end of her scale you dont want to hear the word ive got for you morse his round face split with a smile come on dallas the publics right to know remember ive got nothing for you nothing you want me to go on air saying that lieutenant eve dallas the finest of new yorks finest has come up empty in the investigation of the murder of one of the citys most respected most prominent and most visible public figures i could do that dallas he said clicking his tongue i could but it wouldnt look good for you and you figure that matters to me her smile was thin and laser sharp and her finger hovered over the disconnect you figure wrong maybe not to you personally but it would reflect on the department his girlishly long lashes fluttered on commander whitney for pulling strings to put you on as primary and theres the backwash on roarke her finger twitched then curled into her palm cicely towerss murder is a priority with the department with commander whitney and with me ill quote you fucking little bastard and my work with the department has nothing to do with roarke hey browneyes anything that touches you touches roarke now and vice versa and you know the fact that your man had business dealings with the recently deceased her exhusband and her current escort ties it up real pretty her hands balled into fists of frustration roarke has a lot of business dealings with a lot of people i didnt know you were back on the gossip beat c j that wiped the smarmy little smile off his face there was nothing c j morse hated more than being reminded of his roots in gossip and society news especially now that hed wormed his way onto the police beat ive got contacts dallas yeah youve also got a pimple in the middle of your forehead id have that taken care of with that cheap but satisfying shot eve cut him off springing up she paced the small square of her office jamming her hands into her pockets pulling them out again goddamn it why did roarkes name have to come up in connection with the case just how closely was he involved with towerss business dealings and her associates eve dropped into her chair again and scowled at the reports on her desk shed have to find out and quickly at least this time with this murder she knew he had an alibi at the time cicely towers was having her throat slashed roarke had been fucking the hell out of the investigating officer chapter two eve would have preferred to have gone back to the apartment she continued to keep despite the fact that she spent most nights at roarkes there she could have brooded thought slept and walked herself back through the last day of cicely towerss life instead she headed for roarkes she was tired enough to give up the controls and let the auto program maneuver the car through lateevening traffic food was the first thing she needed eve decided and if she could steal ten minutes to clear her mind so much the better spring had decided to come out and play prettily it tempted her to open the windows ignore the sounds of bustling traffic the hum of maxibuses the griping of pedestrians the overhead swish of air traffic to avoid the echoing bellow of the guides from the tourist blimps she veered over toward tenth a shot through midtown and a quick zip up park would have been quicker but she would have been treated to the droning recitation of new yorks attractions the history and tradition of broadway the brilliance of museums the variety of shops and the plug for the blimps own gift emporium as the blimp route skimmed over her apartment shed heard the spiel countless times she didnt care to hear about the convenience of the people glides that connected the sparkling fashion shops from fifth to madison or the empire state buildings newest sky walk a minor traffic snag at fiftysecond had her pondering a billboard where a stunning man and a stunning woman exchanged a passionate kiss sweetened they claimed each time they came up for air by mountain stream breath freshener their vehicles jammed flank to flank a couple of cabbies shouted inventive insults at each other a maxibus overflowing with passengers laid on its horn adding an earstinging screech that had pedestrians on rampways and sidewalks shaking their heads or their fists a traffic hovercraft dipped low blasted out the standard order to proceed or be cited traffic inched uptown full of noise and temper the city changed as she moved from its core to its edges where the wealthy and the privileged made their homes wider cleaner streets the sweep of trees from the islands of parks here the vehicles quieted to a whoosh of movement and those who walked did so in tailored outfits and fine shoes she passed a dog walker who handled a brace of elegant gold hounds with the steady aplomb of a seasoned droid when she came to the gates of roarkes estate her car idled until the program cleared her through his trees were blooming white blossoms flowed along with pink accented by deep rich reds and blues all carpeted by a long sweep of emerald grass the house itself towered up into the deepening sky glass sparkling in the late sun the stone grand and gray it had been months since she had first seen it yet she had never grown used to the grandeur the sumptuousness the simple unadulterated wealth she had yet to stop asking herself what she was doing here here with him she left her car at the base of the granite steps and climbed them she wouldnt knock that was pride and it was ornery roarkes butler despised her and didnt trouble to hide it as expected summerset appeared in the hall like a puff of black smoke his silver hair gleaming a frown of disapproval ready on his long face lieutenant his eyes scraped her making her aware that she was wearing the same clothes shed left in and they were considerably rumpled we were unaware of the time of your return or indeed if you intended to return were we she shrugged and because she knew it offended him peeled off her scarred leather jacket and held it out to his elegant hands is roarke here he is engaged on an interspace transmission the olympus resort summersets mouth puckered like a prune i dont inquire as to roarkes business you know exactly what hes doing and when she thought but turned out of the wide glittery hall toward the curve of the stairs im going up i need a bath she tossed a glance over her shoulder you can let him know where i am when hes finished his transmission she climbed up to the master suite like roarke she rarely used the elevators the moment shed slammed the bedroom door behind her she began to strip leaving a trail of boots jeans shirt and underwear in her wake on the way to the bath she ordered the water at degrees fahrenheit and as an afterthought tossed in some of the salts roarke had brought her back from silas three they foamed into sea green froth that smelled of fairy tale woods she all but roiled into the oversized marble tub all but wept when the heat seeped into her aching bones drawing one deep breath she submerged held herself down for a count of thirty seconds and surfaced with a sigh of sheer sensual pleasure she kept her eyes closed and drifted so he found her most people would have said she was relaxed but then roarke thought most people didnt really know and certainly didnt understand eve dallas he was more intimate with her closer to her mind and heart than he had ever been with another yet there were still pockets of her he had yet to plumb she was always a fascinating learning experience she was naked dipped to her chin in steamy water and perfumed bubbles her face was flushed from the heat her eyes closed but she wasnt relaxed he could see the tension in the hand that was fisted on the wide ledge of the tub in the faint frown between her eyes no eve was thinking he mused and worrying and planning he moved quietly as he had grown up doing in the alleyways of dublin along wharves and the stinking streets of cities everywhere when he sat on the ledge to watch her she didnt stir for several minutes he knew the instant she sensed him beside her her eyes opened the golden brown clear and alert as they latched onto his amused blue as always just the sight of him gave her a quick inner jolt his face was like a painting a depiction in perfect oils of some fallen angel the sheer beauty of it framed by all that rich black hair was forever a surprise to her she cocked a brow tilted her head pervert its my tub watching her still he slid an elegant hand through the bubbles into the water and along the side of her breast youll boil in there i like it hot i needed it hot youve had a difficult day he would know she thought struggling not to resent it he knew everything she only moved her shoulder as he rose and went to the automated bar built into the tiles it hummed briefly as it served up two glasses of wine in faceted crystal he came back sat on the ledge again and handed her a glass you havent slept you havent eaten it goes with the territory the wine tasted like liquid gold nonetheless you worry me lieutenant you worry too easily i love you it flustered her to hear him say it in that lovely voice that hinted of irish mists to know that somehow incredibly it was true since she had no answer to give him she frowned into her wine he said nothing until hed managed to tuck away irritation at her lack of response can you tell me what happened to cicely towers you knew her eve countered not well a light social acquaintance some business dealings mostly through her former husband he sipped his wine watched the steam rise from her bath i found her admirable wise and dangerous eve scooted up until the water lapped at the tops of her breasts dangerous to you not directly his lips curved slightly before he brought the wine to them to nefarious practices to illegalities small and large to the criminal mind she was very like you in that respect its fortunate ive mended my ways eve wasnt entirely sure of that but she let it slide through your business dealings and your light social acquaintance are you aware of anyone who would have wanted her dead he sipped again more deeply is this an interrogation lieutenant it was the smile in his voice that rubbed her wrong it can be she said shortly as you like he rose set his glass aside and began to unbutton his shirt what are you doing getting into the swim so to speak he tossed the shirt aside unhooked his trousers if im going to be questioned by a naked cop in my own tub the least i can do is join her damn it roarke this is murder he winced as the hot water all but scalded him youre telling me he faced her across the sea of froth what is it in me that is so perverse it thrives on ruffling you and he continued before she could give him her short pithy opinion what is it about you that pulls at me even when youre sitting there with an invisible badge pinned to your lovely breast he skimmed a hand under along her ankle her calf and to the spot on the back of her knee he knew weakened her i want you he murmured right now her hand had gone limp on the stem of her glass before she managed to shift away talk to me about cicely towers philosophically roarke settled back he had no intention of letting her out of the tub until he was finished so he could afford patience she her former husband and george hammett were on the board of one of my divisions mercury named after the god of speed importexport for the most part shipping deliveries rapid transports i know what mercury is she said testily dealing with the annoyance of not knowing that too was one of his companies it was a poorly organized and failing business when i acquired it about ten years ago marco angelini cicelys ex invested as did she they were still married at the time i believe or just divorced the termination of their marriage apparently was as amicable as such things can be hammett was also an investor i dont believe he became personally involved with cicely until some years later and this triangle angelini towers hammett was that amicable too it seemed so idly he tapped a tile when it flipped open to reveal the hidden panel he programmed in music something low and weepy if youre worried about my end of it it was business and successful business at that how much smuggling does mercury do his grin flashed really lieutenant water lapped as she sat forward dont play games with me roarke eve its my fondest wish to do just that she gritted her teeth kicked at the hand that was sneaking up her leg cicely towers had a rep for being a nononsense prosecutor dedicated clean as they come if shed discovered any of mercurys dealings skirted the law shed have gone after you with a vengeance so she discovered my perfidy and i had her lured to a dangerous neighborhood and ordered her throat cut his eyes were level and entirely too bland is that what you think lieutenant no damn it you know its not but others might he finished which would put you in a delicate position im not worried about that at the moment she was worried only about him roarke i need to know i need you to tell me if theres anything anything at all that might involve you in the investigation and if there is she went cold inside ill have to turn it over to someone else havent we been through this before its not like the deblass case not anything like that youre not a suspect when he cocked a brow she struggled to put reason rather than irritation in her voice why was everything so complicated when it touched on roarke i dont think you had anything to do with cicely towerss murder is that simple enough you havent finished the thought all right im a cop there are questions i have to ask i have to ask them of you of anyone whos even remotely connected to the victim i cant change that how much do you trust me it has nothing to do with trusting you that doesnt answer the question his eyes went cool remote and she knew shed taken the wrong step if you dont trust me by now believe in me then we have nothing but some rather intriguing sex youre twisting this around she was fighting to stay calm because he was scaring her im not accusing you of anything if i had come into this case without knowing you or caring about you i would have put you on the list on principle but i do know you and thats not what this is about hell she closed her eyes and rubbed wet hands over her face it was miserable for her to try to explain her feelings im trying get answers that will help to keep you as far out of it as i can because i do care and i cant stop trying to think of ways i can use you because of your connection with towers and your connections period its hard for me to do both it shouldnt have been so hard to simply say it he murmured then shook his head mercury is completely legitimate now because theres no need for it to be otherwise it runs well makes an acceptable profit and though you might think im arrogant enough to engage in criminal acts with a prosecuting attorney on my board of directors you should know im not stupid enough to do so because she believed him the tightness that shed carried in her chest for hours broke apart all right therell still be questions she told him and the media has already made the connection i know im sorry for it how difficult are they making it for you they havent even started in one of her rare shows of easy affection she reached for his hand squeezed it im sorry too looks like were in another one i can help he slid forward so that he could bring their joined hands to his lips when she smiled he knew she was finally ready to relax it isnt necessary for you to keep me out of anything i can handle that myself and theres no need to feel guilty or uncomfortable for considering that i could be useful to you in the investigation ill let you know when i figure out how you might be this time she only arched her brows when his free hand snaked up her thigh if you try to pull that off in here were going to need diving equipment he levered himself to her over her so that water sloshed dangerously at the lip of the ledge oh i think we can manage just fine on our own and he covered her grinning mouth with his to prove it o o late in the night when she slept beside him roarke lay awake watching the stars whirl through the sky window over the bed worry he hadnt let her see was in his eyes now their fates had intertwined personally professionally it was murder that had brought them together and murder that would continue to poke fingers into their lives the woman beside him defended the dead as cicely towers had often done he thought and wondered if that representation is what had cost her her own life he made it a point not to worry too much or too often about how eve made her living her career defined her he was very much aware of that both of them had made themselves remade themselves from the little or nothing they had been he was a man who bought and sold who controlled and who enjoyed the power of it and the profit but it occurred to him that there were pockets of his business that would cause her trouble if the shadows came to light it was perfectly true that mercury was clean but it hadnt always been true he had other holdings other interests that dealt in the gray areas he had grown up in the darker portions of those gray areas after all he had a knack for them smuggling both terrestrial and interstellar was a profitable and entertaining business the truly excellent wines of taurus five the stunning blue diamonds mined in the caves of refini the precious transparent porcelain manufactured in the arts colony of mars true he no longer had to bypass the law to live and live well but old habits die hard the problem remained what if he hadnt yet converted mercury into a legitimate operation what he saw as a harmless business diversion would have weighed on eve like a stone added to that was the humbling fact that despite what they had begun to build together she was far from sure of him she murmured something shifted even in sleep he mused she hesitated before turning to him he was having a very difficult time with that changes were going to be necessary soon for both of them for the moment he would deal with what he could control it would be very simple for him to make a few calls and ask a few questions relating to cicely towers it would be less simple and take a bit more time to convert all of those gray areas of his concerns into the light he looked down to study her she was sleeping well her hand open and relaxed on the pillow he knew sometimes she dreamed badly but tonight her mind was quiet trusting it would remain so he slipped out of bed to begin o o eve woke to the fragrance of coffee genuine rich coffee ground from beans cultivated on roarkes plantation in south america the luxury of that was eve could admit one of the first things shed grown accustomed to indeed come to depend on when it came to staying at roarkes her lips were curved before her eyes opened christ heaven couldnt be better than this im glad you think so her eyes might have still been bleary but she managed to focus on him he was fully dressed in one of the dark suits that made him look both capable and dangerous in the sitting area below the raised platform where the bed stood he seemed to be enjoying breakfast and his quick daily scan of the days news on his monitor the gray cat shed named galahad lay like a fat slug on the arm of the chair and studied roarkes plate with bicolored avaricious eyes what time is it she demanded and the bedside clock murmured the answer oh six hundred jesus how long have you been up awhile you didnt say when you had to be in she ran her hands over her face up through her hair ive got a couple hours a slow starter she crawled out of bed and looked groggily around for something to wear roarke watched her a moment it was always a pleasure to watch eve in the morning when she was naked and glassyeyed he gestured toward the robe the bedroom droid had picked up from the floor and hung neatly over the foot of the bed eve groped into it too sleepy yet to be baffled by the feel of silk against her skin roarke poured her a cup of coffee and waited while she settled into the chair across from him and savored it the cat thinking his luck might change thudded onto her lap with enough weight to make her grunt you slept well yeah she drew the coffee in like breath winced only a little as galahad circled her lap and kneaded her thighs with his needle claws i feel close to human again hungry she grunted again eve already knew his kitchen was staffed with artists she took a swanshaped pastry from the silver tray and downed it in three enthusiastic bites when she reached for the coffeepot herself her eyes were fully open and clear feeling generous she broke off a swans head and gave it to galahad its always a pleasure watching you wake up he commented but sometimes i wonder if you want me only for my coffee well she grinned at him and sipped again i really like the food too and the sex isnt bad you seemed to tolerate it fairly well last night i have to be in australia today i may not make it back until tomorrow or the day after oh id like you to stay here while im gone weve been through that i dont feel comfortable perhaps you would if youd consider it your home as well as mine eve he laid a hand on hers before she could speak when are you going to accept what i feel for you look im just more comfortable in my own place when youre away and ive got a lot of work right now you didnt answer the question he murmured never mind ill let you know when ill be back his voice was clipped now cool and he turned the monitor toward her speaking of your work you might like to see what the media is saying eve read the first headline with a kind of weary resignation mouth grim she scanned from paper to paper the banners were all similar enough renowned new york prosecutor murdered police baffled there were images of course of towers inside courtrooms outside courthouses images of her children comments and quotes eve snarled a bit at her own image and the caption that labeled her the top homicide investigator in the city im going to get grief on that she muttered there was more naturally several papers had printed a brief rundown of the case shed closed the previous winter involving a prominent u s senator and three dead whores as expected her relationship with roarke was mentioned in every edition what the hell does it matter who i am or who im with youve leaped into the public arena lieutenant your name now sells media chips im a cop not a socialite fuming she swiveled to the elaborate grillwork along the far wall open viewing screen she ordered channel the grill slid open revealing the screen the sound of the early broadcast filled the room eves eyes narrowed her teeth clenched theres that fangtoothed dickless weasel amused roarke sipped his coffee and watched c j morse give his six oclock report he was well aware that eves disdain for the media had grown into a fullfledged disgust over the last couple of months a disgust that stemmed from the simple fact that she now had to deal with them at every turn of her professional and personal life even without that he didnt think he could blame her for despising morse and so a great career has been cut off cruelly violently a woman of conviction dedication and integrity has been murdered on the streets of this great city left there to bleed in the rain cicely towers will not be forgotten but will be remembered as a woman who fought for justice in a world where we struggle for it even death cant dim her legacy but will her killer be brought to the justice she lived her entire life upholding the police and security department of new york as yet offers no hope primary investigating officer lieutenant eve dallas a jewel of the department is unable to answer that question eve all but growled when her image filled the screen morses voice continued when reached by link lieutenant dallas refused to comment on the murder and the progress of the investigation no denial was issued as to the speculation that a coverup is in process why that smarmyfaced bastard he never asked about a coverup what coverup the slap of her hand on the arm of the chair made galahad leap away to safer ground ive barely had the case for thirty hours ssh roarke said mildly and left her to spring up and stalk the room the long list of prominent names that are linked with prosecutor towers among them commander whitney dallass superior the commander recently refused the offer of the position as chief of police and security a longstanding intimate friend of the victim thats it furious eve slapped the screen off manually im going to slice that worm into pieces where the hell is nadine furst if weve got to have a reporter sniffing up our ass at least shes got a mind i believe shes on penal station omega a story on prison reform you might consider a press conference eve the simplest way to deal with this kind of heat is to toss a wellchosen log on the fire fuck that what was that broadcast anyway a report or an editorial theres little difference since the revised media bill passed thirty years ago a reporter has the right to flavor a story with his opinion as long as its expressed as such i know the damn law the robe brilliant with color swirled around her legs as she turned hes not going to get away with insinuating a coverup whitney runs a clean department i run a clean investigation and hes not going to get away with using your name to cloud it either she continued thats what he was leading up to with that excuse for news that was next he doesnt worry me eve he shouldnt worry you he doesnt worry me he pisses me off she closed her eyes and drew a deep breath to settle herself slowly very slowly and very wickedly she began to smile ive got the perfect payback she opened her eyes again how do you think that little bastard would like it if i contacted furst gave her an exclusive roarke set aside his cup come here why never mind he rose and went to her instead cupping her face in his hands he kissed her hard im crazy about you i take that to mean you think its a pretty good idea my late unlamented father taught me one valuable lesson boy he would say to me in the thick brogue of a champion drunk the only way to fight is to fight dirty the only place to hit is below the belt i have a feeling youll have morse nursing his balls before the days out no he wont be nursing them delighted with herself eve kissed him back because ill have sliced them right off roarke gave a mock shudder vicious women are so attractive did you say you had a couple of hours not anymore i was afraid of that he stepped back took a disc from his pocket you might find this useful what is it some data i put together on towerss ex on hammett files on mercury her fingers chilled as they closed over the disc i didnt ask you to do this no you didnt youd have gotten access to it but it would have taken you longer you know if you require my equipment its available to you she understood he was talking about the room he had the unregistered equipment that the sensors of compuguard couldnt detect i prefer going through proper channels for the moment as you like if you change your mind while im gone summersets aware you have access summerset wishes i had access to hell she muttered excuse me nothing ive got to get dressed she turned away then stopped roarke im working on it on what on accepting what you seem to feel for me he lifted a brow work harder he suggested chapter three eve didnt waste time her first order of business when she hit her office was to contact nadine furst the link buzzed and crackled over the galactic channel sunspots a satellite dink or simply the aging equipment held up the transmission for several minutes finally a picture wavered onto the screen then popped into clear focus eve had the pleasure of seeing nadines pale groggy face she hadnt considered the time difference dallas nadines normally fluid voice was scratchy and weak jesus its the middle of the night here sorry you awake nadine awake enough to hate you have you been getting earth news up there ive been a little busy nadine pushed back her tumbled hair and reached for a cigarette when did you start that with a wince nadine drew in the first drag if you terrestrial cops ever came up here youd give tobacco a shot even this dog shit you can buy in this rat hole and anything else you could get your hands on its a fucking disgrace she hitched in more smoke three people to a cage most of them zoned on smuggled chemicals the medical facilities are like something out of the twentieth century theyre still sewing people up with string and limited video privileges eve finished imagine treating murderers like criminals my hearts breaking you cant get a decent meal anywhere in the entire colony nadine griped what the hell do you want to make you smile nadine how soon will you be finished up there and back on planet depends as she began to waken fully nadines senses sharpened you have something for me prosecuting attorney cicely towers was murdered about thirty hours ago ignoring nadines yelp eve continued briskly her throat was slashed and her body was discovered on the sidewalk of hundred and fortyfourth between ninth and tenth towers jesus wept i had a oneonone with her two months ago after the deblass case hundred and fortyfourth the wheels were already turning mugging no she still had her jewelry and credit tokens a mugging in that neighborhood wouldnt have left her shoes behind no nadine closed her eyes a moment damn she was a hell of a woman youre primary right the first time okay nadine let out a long breath so why is the primary on what has to be the top case in the country contacting me the devil you know nadine your illustrious associate morse is drooling down my neck asshole nadine muttered tamping out the cigarette in quick jerky bumps thats why i didnt get word of it hed have blocked me out you play square with me nadine i play square with you nadines eyes sharpened her nostrils all but quivered exclusive well discuss terms when you get back make it fast im practically on planet eve smiled at the blank screen that ought to stick in your greedy craw c j she mused she was humming as she pushed away from her desk she had people to see o o by nine a m eve was cooling her heels in the plush living area of george hammetts uptown apartment his taste ran to the dramatic she noted huge squares of crimson and white tiles were cool under her boots the tinkling music of water striking rock sang from the audio of the hologram sweeping an entire wall with an image of the tropics the silver cushions of the long low sofa glittered and when she pushed a finger into one it gave like silken flesh she decided shed continue to stand objets dart were placed selectively around the room a carved tower that resembled the ruins of some ancient castle the mask of a womans face embedded in translucent rosecolored glass what appeared to be a bottle that flashed with vivid changing colors with the heat of her hand when hammett entered from an adjoining room eve concluded that he was every bit as dramatic as his surroundings he looked pale heavy eyed but it only increased his stunning looks he was tall and elegantly slim his face was poetically hollowed at the cheeks unlike many of his contemporaries eve knew him to be in his sixties he had opted to let his hair gray naturally an excellent choice for him she thought as his thick lions mane was as gleaming a silver as one of roarkes georgian candlesticks his eyes were the same striking color though they were dulled now with what might have been grief or weariness he crossed to her cupped her hand in both of his eve when his lips brushed her cheek she winced he was making the connection personal she thought they both knew it george she began subtly drawing back i appreciate your time nonsense im sorry i had to keep you waiting a call i had to complete he gestured toward the sofa the sleeves of his casual shirt billowing with the movement eve resigned herself to sitting on it what can i offer you nothing really coffee he smiled a little i recall youre very fond of it i have some of roarkes blend he pressed a button on the arm of the sofa a small screen popped up a pot of argentine gold he ordered two cups then with that faint and sober smile still on his lips he turned back to her itll help me relax he explained im not surprised to find you here this morning eve or perhaps i should be calling you lieutenant dallas under the circumstances then you understand why im here of course cicely i cant get used to it his creamovercream voice shook a little ive heard it countless times on the news ive spoken with her children and with marco but i cant seem to take in the fact that shes gone you saw her the night she was killed a muscle in his cheek jerked yes we had dinner we often did when our schedules allowed once a week at least more if we could manage it we were close he paused as a small server droid glided in with the coffee hammett poured it himself concentrating on the small task almost fiercely how close he murmured and eve saw his hand wasnt quite steady as he lifted his cup intimate wed been lovers exclusive lovers for several years i loved her very much you maintained separate residences yes she we both preferred it that way our tastes aesthetically speaking were very different and the simple truth was we both liked our independence and personal space we enjoyed each other more i think by keeping a certain distance he took a long breath but it was no secret that we had a relationship at least not among our families and friends he let the breath out publicly we both preferred to keep our private lives private i dont expect that will be possible now i doubt it he shook his head it doesnt matter what should matter is finding out who did this to her i just cant seem to work myself up about it nothing can change the fact that shes gone cicely was he said slowly the most admirable woman ive ever known every instinct human and cop told her this was a man in deep mourning but she knew that even killers mourned their dead i need you to tell me what time you last saw her george im recording this yes of course it was about ten oclock we had dinner at roberts on east twelfth we shared a cab after i dropped her off first about ten he repeated i know i got in about quarter after because i had several messages waiting was that your usual routine what oh he snapped himself back from some inner world we really didnt have one often wed come back here or go to her apartment now and again when we felt adventurous wed take a suite at the palace for a night he broke off and his eyes were suddenly blank and devastated as he shoved off the soft silver sofa oh god my god im sorry useless she knew against grief im so sorry im starting to believe it he said in a voice thick and low its worse i realize when you begin to believe it she laughed when she got out of the cab and she blew me a kiss from her fingertips she had such beautiful hands and i went home and forgot about her because i had messages waiting i was in bed by midnight took a mild tranq because i had an early meeting while i was in bed safe she was lying dead in the rain i dont know if i can bear that he turned back his already pale face bloodless now i dont know if i can bear it she couldnt help him even though his pain was so tangible she could feel it herself she couldnt help him i wish i could do this later give you time but i just cant as far as we know youre the last person who saw her alive except her killer he drew himself up unless of course i killed her it would be best for everyone if i ruled that out quickly yes naturally it would lieutenant she accepted the bitterness in his voice and did her job if you could give me the name of the cab company so that i can verify your movements the restaurant called for one i believe it was a rapid did you see or speak with anyone between the hours of midnight and two a m i told you i took a pill and was in bed by midnight alone she could verify that with the building security discs though she had reason to know such things could be doctored can you tell me her mood when you left her she was a bit distracted the case she was prosecuting optimistic about it we talked a bit about her children her daughter in particular mirinas planning on getting married next fall cicely was pleased with the idea and excited because mirina wanted a big wedding with all the oldfashioned trimmings did she mention anything that was worrying her anything or anyone she was concerned about nothing that would apply to this the right wedding gown flowers her hopes that she could swing the maximum sentence in the case did she mention any threats any unusual transmissions messages contacts no he put a hand over his eyes briefly let it drop to his side dont you think id have told you if i had the slightest inkling of why this happened why would she have gone to the upper west side at that time of night i have no idea was she in the habit of meeting snitches sources he opened his mouth then closed it again i dont know he murmured struck by it i wouldnt have thought but she was so stubborn so sure of herself her relationship with her former husband how would you describe it friendly a bit reserved but amiable they were both devoted to the children and that united them he was a little annoyed when we became intimate but hammett broke off stared at eve you cant possibly think with what might have been a laugh he covered his face marco angelini skulking around that neighborhood with a knife plotting to kill his ex no lieutenant he dropped his hands again marco has his flaws but hed never hurt cicely and the sight of blood would offend his sense of propriety hes much too cold much too conservative to resort to violence and hed have no reason no possible motive for wishing her harm that eve thought was for her to decide o o she tripped from one world to another by leaving hammetts apartment and going to the west end here she would find no silvery cushions no tinkling waterfalls instead there were cracked sidewalks ignored by the latest spruceupthecity campaign graffitilaced buildings that invited the onlookers to fuck all manner of man and beast storefronts were covered by security grills which were so much cheaper and less effective than the force fields employed in the posher areas she wouldnt have been surprised to see a few rodents overlooked by the feline droids that roamed the alleyways of the twolegged rodents she saw plenty one chemihead grinned at her toothily and rubbed his crotch proudly a street hawker sized her up quickly and accurately as cop ducked his head under the wreath of feathers he sported around his magenta hair and scurried off to safer pastures a selected list of drugs were still illegal some cops actually bothered to pay attention at the moment eve wasnt one of them unless a little arm twisting helped her get answers the rain had washed most of the blood away the sweepers from the department would have sucked up anything in the immediate area that could be sifted through for evidence but she stood for a moment over the spot where towers had died and she had no trouble envisioning the scene now she needed to work backward had she stood here eve wondered facing her killer most likely did she see the knife before it sliced across her throat possibly but not quickly enough to react with anything more than a jerk a gasp lifting her gaze eve scanned the street her skin prickled but she ignored the stares of those leaning against the buildings or loitering around rusting cars cicely towers had come uptown not by cab there was to date no record of a pickup or dropoff from any of the official companies eve doubted she would have been foolish enough to try a gypsy the subway she deduced it was fast and with the scanners and droid cops safe as a church at least until you hit the street eve spotted the signal for the underground less than half a block away the subway she decided maybe she was in a hurry annoyed to be dragged out on a wet night sure of herself as hammett had said she wouldnt have been afraid she marched up the stairs to the street in her power suit her expensive shoes she stopping eve narrowed her eyes no umbrella where was her damn umbrella a meticulous woman a practical organized woman didnt go out in the rain without protection briskly eve pulled out her recorder and muttered a note to herself to check on it was the killer waiting for her on the street in a room she studied the disintegrating brick of the unrehabbed buildings a bar one of the flesh clubs hey white girl brows knit eve turned at the interruption the man was tall as a house and from the deepness of his complexion a full black he sported as many did in this part of town feathers in his hair his cheek tattoo was vivid green and in the shape of a grinning human skull he wore an open red vest and matching pants snug enough to show the bulge of his cock hey black boy she said in the same casually insulting tone he flashed a wide dazzling grin at her from an unbelievably ugly face you looking for action he jerked his head toward the garish sign of the allnude club across the street you a little skinny but they be hiring dont get many white as you mostly mixed he chucked her under the chin with fingers the width of soy wieners i be the bouncer put in a word for you now why would you do that out of the goodness of my heart and five percent of your tips honeypot a long white girl like you make plenty jiggling her stuff i appreciate the thought but ive got a job almost with regret she pulled out her badge he whistled through his teeth now how come i dont be seeing that white girl you just dont smell like cop must be the new soap im using got a name they just call me crack thats the sound it makes when i bust heads he grinned again and illustrated by bringing his two huge hands together crack get it im catching on were you on the door night before last crack now im sorry to say i was otherwise engaged and missed all the excitement that be my night off and i spent it catching up on cultural events and those events were vampire flick festival down to grammercy with my current young nibble i sure do enjoy watching them bloodsuckers but i hear we had ourselves a show right here got ourselves a dead lawyer big important fancy one too white girl wasnt she just like you honeypot thats right what else do you hear me he trailed a finger down the front of his vest the nail on his index finger was sharpened to a lethal point and painted black im too dignified to listen to street talk i bet you are understanding the rules eve slipped a hundredcredit token from her pocket how about i buy a little of that dignity well the price she looks right his big hand enveloped the tokens and made them disappear i hear she was hanging around in the five moons long about midnight give or take like she was hanging for somebody somebody who dont show then she ditched he glanced down at the sidewalk didnt go far though did she no she didnt did she ask for anyone not sos i heard anyone see her with anyone bad night people stay off the street mostly some chemiheads maybe wander but business going to be slow you know anyone around here who likes to cut plenty carry blades and stickers white girl his eyes rolled in amusement why you going to carry if you aint going to use anybody just likes to cut she repeated somebody who doesnt care about making a score his grin spread again the skull on his cheek seemed to nod with the movement everybody cares about making a score aint you trying to she accepted that who do you know around here whos out of a cage recently his laugh was like mortar fire better if you ask dont i know anybody who aint and your moneys done all right to his disappointment she took a card rather than more tokens out of her pocket there may be more if you hear anything i can use keep it in mind you decide you want to earn a little extra shaking those little white tits you let crack know with this he loped across the street with the surprising grace of an enormous black gazelle eve turned and went in to try her luck at the five moons the dive might have seen better days but she doubted it it was strictly a drinking establishment no dancers no screens no videos booths the clientele who patronized the five moons werent there to socialize from the smell that slapped eve the moment she stepped through the door burning off stomach lining was the order of the day even at this hour the small square room was well populated silent drinkers stood at stingy pedestals knocking back their poison of choice others huddled by the bar closer to the bottles eve rated a few glances as she crossed the sticky floor then people got back to the business of serious drinking the bartender was a droid as most were but she doubted this one had been programmed to listen cheerfully to the customers hard luck stories more likely an arm breaker she mused sizing it up as she sidled up to the bar the manufacturers had given him the tilted eye goldenskinned appearance of a mixed race unlike most of the drinkers the droid didnt sport feathers or beads but a plain white smock over a wrestlers body droids couldnt be bribed she thought with some regret and threats had to be both clever and logical drink the droid demanded his voice had a ping to it a slight echo that indicated overdue maintenance problems no eve wanted to keep her health she showed her badge and had several customers shifting toward corners there was a murder two nights ago not in here but the victim was she was alive then at some signal eve didnt catch the droid took a smudged glass from a drinker midbar poured some noxious looking liquid into it and slid it back you were on duty im a twentyfour seven he told her indicating he was programmed for full operation without required rest or recharge periods did you ever see the victim before in here around the area no who did she meet here no one eve drummed her fingers on the cloudy surface of the bar okay lets just make this simple you tell me what time she came in what she did when she left and how she left i am not required to maintain surveillance on the customers right slowly eve rubbed a finger on the bar when she lifted it she pursed her lips at the smear of gunk staining the tip im homicide but im not required to overlook health violations you know i think if i called the sensor bugs in here and they did a sweep why theyd be shocked so shocked theyd delete the liquor license as threats went she didnt think it was particularly clever but it was logical the droid took a moment to access the probabilities the woman came in at oh sixteen she didnt drink she left at one twelve alone did she speak to anyone she said nothing was she looking for someone i didnt ask eve lifted a brow you observed her did it appear she was looking for someone it appeared but she found no one but she stayed nearly an hour what did she do stood looked frowned checked her watch often left did anyone follow her outside no absently eve scrubbed her soiled finger on her jeans did she have an umbrella the droid looked as surprised by the question as droids were capable of looking yes a purple one the same color as her suit did she leave with it yes it was raining eve nodded then worked her way through the bar questioning unhappy customers o o all she really wanted when she returned to cop central was a long shower an hour in the five moons had left what felt like a thin layer of muck on her skin even her teeth she thought running her tongue over them but the report came first she swung into her office then stopped studying the wiryhaired man sitting at her desk plucking candied almonds from a bag nice work if you can get it feeney crossed the feet hed propped on the edge of her desk good to see you dallas youre a busy lady some of us cops actually work for a living others just play computer games all day you shouldve taken my advice and worked on your comp skills with more affection than annoyance she knocked his feet from the desk and plopped her butt down in the vacated space you just passing by ive come to offer my services old pal generously he held out the bag of nuts she munched and watched him he had a hangdog face one he had never bothered to have enhanced baggy eyes the beginning of jowls ears that were slightly too big for his head she liked it just the way it was why well i got three reasons first the commander made an unofficial request second i had a lot of admiration for the prosecutor whitney called you unofficially feeney explained again he thought that if you had someone with my outstanding skills working the data route with you wed tie this thing up faster never hurts to have a direct line to the electronic detection division she considered it and because she knew feeneys skills were indeed outstanding she approved are you going to sign on the case officially or unofficially thats up to you then lets make it officially feeney he grinned and winked i figured youd say that the first thing i need you to do is run the victims link theres no record either on the log or on the security tapes that she had a visitor the night she was killed so somebody called her arranged a meet good as done and i need a run on everybody she put away everybody he interrupted only slightly appalled everybody her face broke into sunny smiles i figure you can do it in about half the time i could i need relatives loved ones associates too also cases in progress and pending jesus dallas but he rolled his shoulders flexed his fingers like a pianist about to play a concert my wifes going to miss me being married to a cop sucks she said patting his shoulder is that what roarke says she dropped her hand were not married feeney merely hummed in his throat he enjoyed seeing eves quick frown quick nerves so hows he doing hes fine hes in australia her hands found their way into her pockets hes fine uhhuh caught the two of you on the news a few weeks ago at some fancy do at the palace you look real sharp in a dress dallas she shifted uncomfortably caught herself and shrugged i didnt know you took in the gossip channels love them he said unrepentantly must be interesting leading that high life it has its moments she muttered are we going to discuss my social life feeney or investigate a murder well have to make time to do both he rose and stretched ill go run the check on the victims link before i get started on the years of perps she put away ill be in touch feeney when he turned at her door she cocked her head you said there were three reasons you wanted in you only gave me two number three i missed you dallas he grinned damn if i havent missed you she was smiling when she sat down to work damn if she hadnt missed him too chapter four the blue squirrel was one teetering step up from the five moons eve had a cautious affection for it there were times she even enjoyed the noise the press of bodies and the everchanging costumes of the clientele most of the time she enjoyed the stage show the featured singer was one of the rare people eve considered a genuine friend the friendship might have had its roots in eves arrest of mavis freestone several years earlier but it had flowered nonetheless mavis might have gone straight but she would never go ordinary tonight the slim exuberant woman was screeching out her lyrics against the scream of trumpets the brass waved by a threepiece female band on the holoscreen backdrop that and the quality of the single wine eve had risked were enough to make her eyes water for tonights show maviss hair was a stunning emerald green eve knew mavis preferred jewel colors she continued the theme with the single swatch of glistening sapphire material she had somehow draped over herself to cover one generous breast and her crotch her other breast was decorated with shimmering stones with a strategically placed silver star over the nipple one misplaced stud or swatch and the blue squirrel could be fined for exceeding its license the proprietors werent willing to pay the hefty fee for nude class when mavis whirled eve saw that the singers heartshaped butt was similarly decorated on each slim cheek just she mused within the limits of the law the crowd loved her when she stepped from the stage after her set it was to thunderous applause and drunken cheers patrons in the private smoking booths thumped fists enthusiastically on their tiny tables how do you sit down in that eve asked when mavis arrived at her booth slowly carefully and with great discomfort mavis demonstrated then let out a sigh whatd you think of the last number a real crowd pleaser i wrote it no shit eve hadnt understood a single word but pride swelled nonetheless thats great mavis im awed i might have a shot at a recording contract beneath the glitter on her face maviss cheeks flushed and i got a raise well heres to it in toast eve lifted her glass i didnt know you were coming in tonight mavis punched her code into the menu and ordered bubble water she had to baby her throat for the next set im meeting someone roarke maviss eyes currently green shone is he coming ill have to do that last number again hes in australia im meeting nadine furst maviss disappointment at the opportunity to impress roarke shifted quickly to surprise youre meeting a reporter on purpose i can trust her eve lifted a shoulder i can use her if you say so hey you think maybe shed do a piece on me not for worlds would eve have extinguished the light in maviss eyes ill mention it decent listen tomorrows my night off want to catch some dinner or hang someplace if i can manage it but i thought you were seeing that performance artist the one with the pet monkey flicked him off mavis illustrated by brushing a finger over her bare shoulder he was just too static gotta go she slid out of the booth her butt decor making little scraping sounds her emerald hair gleamed in the swirling lights as she edged through the crowd eve decided she didnt want to know what mavis considered too static when her communicator hummed eve pulled it out and punched in her code roarkes face filled the miniscreen her first reaction unbidden was a huge delighted smile lieutenant ive tracked you down apparently so she worked on dimming the smile this is an official channel roarke is it his brow lifted it doesnt sound like official surroundings the blue squirrel im meeting someone hows australia crowded with luck ill be back within thirtysix hours ill find you im not hard to find she smiled again obviously listen to amuse them both she tilted the unit as mavis roared into her next set shes unique roarke managed after several bars give her my best i will ill ah see you when you get back count on it youll think of me sure safe trip roarke eve i love you she let out a baffled breath when his image dissolved well well nadine furst moved from her position behind eves shoulder and slid into the booth opposite wasnt that sweet torn between annoyance and embarrassment eve jammed her communicator back in her pocket i thought you had more class than to eavesdrop any reporter worth her salary eavesdrops lieutenant just like a good cop nadine stretched back in the booth so what does it feel like to have a man like roarke in love with you even if she could have explained it eve wouldnt have thinking of switching from hard news to the romance channel nadine nadine merely held up a hand then let out a sigh when she scanned the club i cant believe you wanted to meet here again the foods terrible but the atmosphere nadine the atmosphere mavis hit a piercing note and nadine shuddered fine its your deal you got back on planet quickly i managed to catch a flash transport one of your boyfriends roarkes not a boy youre telling me anyway nadine waved that away she was obviously tired and a little lagged ive got to eat even if it kills me she scanned the menu and settled dubiously on the stuffed shells supreme what are you drinking number fiftyfour its supposed to be a chardonnay experimentally eve sipped again its at least three steps up from horse piss i recommend it fine nadine programmed her order and sat back again i was able to access all the data available on the towerss homicide on the trip back everything the media has broadcast so far morse know youre back nadines smile was thin and feral oh he knows ive got seniority on the crime beat im in hes out and is he pissed then my mission is a success but its not complete you promised an exclusive and ill deliver eve studied the noodle dish that slid through the serving slot it didnt look half bad under my terms nadine what i feed you you broadcast when i give you the light what else is new nadine sampled the first shell decided it was nearly palatable ill see that you get more data and that you get it ahead of the pack and when youve got a suspect youll get the name first trusting eves word nadine nodded as she forked up another shell plus a oneonone with the suspect and another with you i cant guarantee the suspect you know i cant eve continued before nadine could interrupt the perp has rights to choose his own media or to refuse it all the best i can do is suggest maybe even encourage i want pictures dont tell me you cant guarantee you can find a way to see that i get video of the arrest i want to be on the scene ill weigh that in when the time comes in exchange i want everything you have every tip that comes in every rumor every story lead no broadcast surprises nadine slipped pasta between her lips i cant guarantee she said sweetly my associates have their own agenda what you know when you know it eve said flatly and anything that comes out of intramedia espionage at nadines innocent expression eve snorted stations spy on stations reporters spy on reporters getting the story on air first is the name of the game youve got a good batting average nadine or i wouldnt be bothering with you ill say the same nadine sipped her wine and for the most part i trust you even if you have no taste in wine this is barely one step up from horse piss eve sat back and laughed it felt good it felt easy and when nadine grinned in return they had a deal let me see yours nadine requested and ill let you see mine the biggest thing ive got eve began is a missing umbrella o o eve met feeney at cicely towerss apartment at ten the following morning one look at his hangdog expression and she knew the news wasnt going to be sunny what wall did you hit on the link he waited while eve disarmed the police security on the door then followed her inside she had plenty of transmissions kept the unit on auto record your tag was on the disc thats right i took it into evidence are you trying to tell me no one contacted her to arrange a meet at the five moons im trying to tell you i cant tell you in disgust feeney ran a hand through his wiry hair her last call came in at eleven thirty the transmission ended at eleven fortythree and she erased the recording i can get the times but thats it the communication audio video are zapped she zapped them he continued from this unit she erased the call eve murmured and began to pace why would she do that she had the unit on auto thats standard for law enforcers even for personal calls but she erased this one because she didnt want any record of who called and why she turned back youre sure nobody tampered with the disc after it was in evidence feeney looked pained then insulted dallas was all he said okay okay so she zapped it before she went out that tells me she wasnt afraid personally but was protecting herself or somebody else if it had to do with a case shed have wanted it on record shed have made damn sure it was on record id say so if it was a snitch she could have put a lock on it under her private code but it doesnt make sense to zap it well check her cases anyway all the way back she didnt have to see his face to know feeney was rolling his eyes let me think she muttered she left city hall at nineteen twentysix thats on her log and several witnesses saw her her last stop was the womens lounge where she freshened up for the evening and chatted with an associate the associate tells me her mood was calm but upbeat shed had a good day in court fluentes is going up she laid the groundwork taking her out wont change that he might have thought different well see about that she didnt come back here frowning eve scanned the room she didnt have time so she went straight to the restaurant and met hammett ive been by there his story and his time frame check out with the staff youve been busy times passing the maitre d called them a cab a rapid they were picked up at a twentyone fortyeight it was starting to rain in her mind eve pictured it the handsome couple in the back of the cab chatting maybe brushing fingertips while the cab zipped uptown with raindrops pattering on the roof shed been wearing a red dress and matching jacket according to their server power colors for court that shed dressed up with good pearls and silver heels for the evening the cab dropped her off first eve continued she told hammett not to get out why get wet she was laughing when she ran for the building then turned and blew him a kiss your report said they were tight he loved her more from habit than hunger she dipped a hand into the bag feeney held out doesnt mean he didnt kill her but he loved her according to him they were both happy with their arrangement but she lifted her shoulders if he wasnt and was looking to set up a good alibi he set a nice romantic cozy stage it doesnt work for me but its early yet so she came up eve continued moving to the door her dress is a little damp so she goes to the bedroom to hang it up as she spoke eve followed the projected route walking over the lovely rugs into the spacious bedroom with its quiet colors and lovely antique bed she ordered lights to brighten the area the police shields on the windows not only frustrated the flybys but blocked most of the sunlight to the closet she said and pressed the button that opened the long mirrored sliding doors she hangs up the suit eve pointed to the red dress and jacket neatly arranged in a wardrobe ordered in sweeps of color puts away her shoes puts on a robe eve turned to the bed a long flow of ivory was spread there not folded not neatly arranged as was the rest of the room but rumpled as though it had been impatiently tossed she puts her jewelry in the safe in the side wall of the closet but she doesnt go to bed maybe she goes out to catch the news to have a nightcap with feeney following eve went back to the living area a briefcase neatly closed sat on the table in front of the sofa with a single empty glass beside it shes relaxing maybe thinking over the evening rehearsing her court strategy for the next day or her planning her daughters wedding her link beeps whoever it was whatever they tell her gets her moving shes settled in for the night but she goes back to the bedroom after shes zapped the record she dresses again another power suit shes going to the west end she doesnt want to blend she wants to exude authority confidence she doesnt call a cab thats another record she decides shell take the subway its raining eve moved to a closet tucked into the wall near the front door and pressed it to open inside were jackets wraps a mans overcoat she suspected was hammetts and a fleet of umbrellas in varying colors she takes out the umbrella she bought to match the suit its automatic her mind is on her meet she doesnt take a lot of money so its not a payoff she doesnt call anyone because she wants to handle it herself but when she gets to the five moons nobody meets her she waits nearly an hour impatient checking her watch she leaves a few minutes after one back into the rain shes got her umbrella and starts to walk back to the subway i figure shes steamed classy woman kicking in a dive for an hour for a no show feeney popped another nut yeah steamed would be my take so she heads out its raining pretty hard her umbrellas up she only gets a few feet someones there probably been close by all along waiting for her to come out doesnt want to see her inside feeney put in doesnt want to be seen right they have to talk a couple of minutes according to the time frame maybe they argue not much of an argument there isnt time nobodys on the street nobody whod pay attention anyway a couple of minutes later her throats slashed shes bleeding on the sidewalk did he plan to do her all along lotsa people carry stickers in that area thoughtful feeney rubbed his chin couldnt get premeditated on that by itself but the timing the setup yeah thats how it shakes down to me me too one slice no defensive wounds so she didnt have time to feel threatened the killer doesnt take her jewelry the leather bag her shoes or her credits he just takes her umbrella and he walks away why the umbrella feeney wondered hell its raining i dont know an impulse a souvenir as far as i can see its the only mistake he made ive got grunts out checking a tenblock area to see if he ditched it if he ditched it in that area some chemiheads walking around with a purple parasol yeah a visual of that almost made her smile how could he be sure shed zap the recording feeney he had to be sure threat a pa lives with threats one like towers would shake them off like lint if they were aimed at her he agreed shes got kids he nodded toward the framed holograms she wasnt just a lawyer she was a mother with a frown eve walked over to the holograms curious she picked up one of the boy and girl together as young teenagers a flick of her finger over the back had the audio bubbling out hey big shot happy mothers day this will last longer than the flowers we love you oddly disturbed eve set the frame down again theyre adults now theyre not kids anymore dallas once a parent always a parent you never finish the job hers had she thought a long time finished then i guess my next stop is marco angelini o o angelini had offices in roarkes building on fifth eve stepped into the now familiar lobby with its huge tiles and pricey boutiques the cooing voices of computer guides offered assistance to various locations she scanned one of the moving maps and ignoring the glides hiked her way to the elevators along the south end the glass tube shot her to the fiftyeighth floor then opened onto solemn gray carpet and blinding white walls angelini exports claimed a suite of five offices in this location after one quick scan eve noted that the company was small potatoes in relation to roarke industries then againshe thought with a tight smile what isnt the receptionist in the greeting area showed great respect and not a little nerves at the sight of eves badge she fumbled and swallowed so much eve wondered if the woman had a cache of illegal substances in her desk drawer but the fear of cop had her all but shoving eve into angelinis office after less than ninety seconds of lag time mr angelini i appreciate your time my sympathies for your loss thank you lieutenant dallas please sit he wasnt elegant as hammett was but he was powerful a small man solidly built with jet hair combed slickly back from a prominent widows peak his skin was a pale dusky gold his eyes bright hard marbles of azure under thick brows he had a long nose thin lips and the glitter of a diamond on his hand if he was grieving the former husband of the victim hid it better than her lover had he sat behind a consolestyle desk that was smooth as satin it was absolutely clear but for his still and folded hands behind him was a tinted window that blocked the uv rays while letting in the view of new york youve come about cicely yes i was hoping you could spare some time now to answer some questions you have my full cooperation lieutenant cicely and i were divorced but we remained partners in business and in parenthood i admired and respected her there was a hint of his native country in his voice just a whisper of it it reminded her that according to his dossier marco angelini spent a large part of his time in italy mr angelini can you tell me the last time you saw or spoke with prosecutor towers i saw her on march eighteenth at my home on long island she came to your home yes for my sons twentyfifth birthday we gave him a party together using my estate there as it was most convenient david our son often stays there when he is on the east coast you hadnt seen her since that date no we were both busy but we had planned to meet in the next week or two to discuss plans for mirinas wedding our daughter he cleared his throat gently i was in europe for most of april you called prosecutor towers on the night of her death yes i left a message to see if we could meet for lunch or drinks at her convenience about the wedding eve prompted yes about mirinas wedding had you spoken with prosecutor towers since the day of march eighteenth and the night of her death several times he pulled his fingers apart linked them again as i said we considered ourselves partners we had the children and there were a few business interests including mercury yes his lips curved ever so slightly you are an acquaintance of roarkes thats right did you and your former wife disagree on any of your partnerships personally or professionally naturally we did on both but wed learned as we had been unable to learn during our marriage the value of compromise mr angelini who inherits prosecutor towerss interest in mercury after her death his brow lifted i do lieutenant according to the terms of our business contract there are also a few holdings in some real estate that will revert to me this was an arrangement of our divorce settlement i would guide the interests advise her on investments upon the death of one of us the interests and profits or losses would revert to the other we both agreed you see and trusted that in the end all either of us had of value would go to our children and the rest of her estate her apartment her jewelry whatever possessions that werent part of your agreement would i assume be left to our children i imagine there would be a few bequests to personal friends or charities eve was going to dig quickly to learn just how much towers had tucked away mr angelini you were aware that your exwife was intimately involved with george hammett naturally and this was not a problem a problem do you mean lieutenant did i after nearly twelve years of divorce harbor homicidal jealousy for my exwife and did i slice the throat of the mother of my children and leave her dead on the street in words to that effect mr angelini he said something in italian under his breath something eve suspected uncomplimentary no i did not kill cicely can you tell me your whereabouts on the night of her death she could see his jaw tense and noticed the control it took for him to relax it again but his eyes never flickered she imagined he could stare a hole through steel i was at home in my townhouse from eight oclock on alone yes did you see or speak with anyone who can verify that no i have two domestics and both were out on their night off which was why i was home i wanted quiet and privacy for an evening you made no calls received none during the evening i received a call at about three a m from commander whitney informing me of my wifes death i was in bed alone when the call came in mr angelini your exwife was in a west end dive at one oclock in the morning why i havent any idea no idea at all later when eve stepped into the glass tube to descend she beeped feeney i want to know if marco angelini was in any kind of financial squeeze and how much that squeeze would have loosened at his exwifes sudden death you smell something dallas something she muttered i just dont know what chapter five eve stumbled into her apartment at nearly one a m her head was ringing maviss idea of dinner on her night off had been to take in a rival club already aware she would pay for the evenings entertainment in the morning eve stripped on the way to the bedroom at least the evening out with mavis had pushed the towers case out of her mind eve might have worried she had no mind left but she was too exhausted to think about it she fell naked and facedown on the bed and was asleep in seconds eve woke violently aroused it was roarkes hands on her she knew their texture their rhythm her heart tripped against her ribs then bounded into her throat as his mouth covered hers his was greedy hot giving her no choice really no choice at all but to respond in kind even as she fumbled for him those long clever fingers pierced her diving into her so that she bowed up into the frenzy of orgasm his mouth on her breast sucking teeth scraping his elegant hands relentless so that her cries came out in whimpers of shock and gratitude another staggering climax to layer thick over the first her hands sought purchase in the tangled sheets but nothing could anchor her as she flew up again she gripped him nails scraping down his back up to grab handfuls of his hair god it was the single coherent word she managed as he plunged into her so hard so deep she was amazed she didnt die from the pleasure of it her body bucked helplessly frantically continued to shudder even after hed collapsed on her he let out a long satisfied sigh and lazily nuzzled her ear sorry to wake you roarke oh was that you he bit her she smiled quietly in the dark i didnt think youd be back until tomorrow i got lucky then i followed your trail into the bedroom i was out with mavis we went to a place called armageddon my hearings starting to come back she stroked his back yawned hugely its not morning is it no recognizing the weariness in her voice he shifted gathered her close against him and kissed her temple go to sleep eve okay she obliged him in less than ten seconds o o he woke at first light and left her curled in the middle of the bed in the kitchen he programmed the autochef for coffee and a toasted bagel the bagel was stale but that was to be expected making himself at home he sat by the kitchen monitor and skimmed through the paper to the financial section he couldnt concentrate he was trying not to resent the fact that shed chosen her bed over their bed or what he wanted her to think of as their bed he didnt begrudge her the need for personal space he understood well the need for privacy but his house was large enough that she could have appropriated an entire wing for herself if she wanted it pushing away from the monitor he paced to the window he wasnt used to this struggle this war to balance his needs with someone elses hed grown up thinking of himself first and last hed had to in order to survive and then to succeed one was every bit as important to him as the other the habit was difficult to break or had been until eve it was humiliating to admit even to himself that every time he went away to see to business a seed of fear rooted in his heart that she would have shaken herself loose of him by the time he returned the simple fact was he needed the one thing she had refused him a commitment turning from the window he went back to the monitor and forced himself to read good morning eve said from the doorway her smile was quick and bright as much from the pleasure of seeing him as from the fact that her trip to armageddon didnt have the consequences shed feared she felt terrific your bagels are stale mmm she tested by trying a bite of the one on the table youre right coffee was always a better bet anything in the news i should worry about are you concerned with the treegro takeover eve knuckled one eye as she sipped her first cup of coffee whats treegro and whos taking it over treegros a reforestry company hence the overly adorable name im taking it over she grunted figures i was thinking more of the towers case cicelys memorial service is scheduled for tomorrow she was important enough and catholic enough to warrant st patricks cathedral will you go if i can reschedule a few appointments will you yeah thinking eve leaned back on the counter maybe her killer will be there she studied him as he scanned the monitor he should have looked out of place in her kitchen she mused in his expensive meticulously tailored linen shirt and with the luxurious mane of hair swept back from that remarkable face she kept waiting for him to look out of place there with her problem he murmured well aware that she was staring at him no things on my mind how well do you know angelini marco roarke frowned over something he saw on the monitor took out his notebook entered a memo our paths cross often enough normally a careful businessman always a devoted father prefers spending his time in italy but his power base is here in new york contributes generously to the catholic church he stands to gain financially from towerss death maybe its just a drop in the bucket but feeneys checking it out you could have asked me roarke murmured i would have told you marcos in trouble not desperate trouble he amended when eves eyes sharpened hes made some illadvised acquisitions over the past year or so you said he was careful i said he was normally careful he bought several religious artifacts without having them thoroughly authenticated his zeal got in the way of his business sense they were forgeries and hes taken a hard loss how hard in excess of three million i can get you exact figures if necessary hell recover roarke added with a shrug for three million dollars eve knew she would never get used to he needs to focus and downsize a bit here and there id say his pride was hurt more than his portfolio how much was towerss share of mercury worth on todays market he took out his pocket diary jiggled some numbers somewhere between five and seven million yes roarke said with the faintest hint of a smile of course good christ no wonder she could live like a queen marco made very good investments for her he would have wanted the mother of his children to live comfortably you and i have dramatically different ideas about comfort apparently roarke tucked the diary away and rose to refill his coffee and hers an airbus rumbled by the window chased by a fleet of private shuttles you suspect that marco killed her to recoup his losses moneys a motive that never goes out of style i interviewed him yesterday i knew something didnt quite fit now its beginning to she took the fresh coffee he offered paced to the window where the noise level was rising then away again her robe was slipping off her shoulder casually roarke tucked it back into place bored commuters often carried longrange viewers for just such an opportunity then theres the friendly divorce she went on but whose idea was it divorce is complicated for catholics when there are children involved dont they have to get some sort of clearance dispensation roarke corrected a complex business but both cicely and marco had connections with the hierarchy hes never remarried eve pointed out setting her coffee aside i havent been able to find even a whiff of a steady or serious companion but towers was having a longterm intimate relationship with hammett just how did angelini feel about the mother of his children snuggling with a business partner if it were me id kill the business partner thats you eve said with a quick glance and i imagine youd kill both of them you know me so well he stepped toward her put his hands on her shoulders on the financial end you may want to consider that whatever cicelys share of mercury was angelinis matches it they held equal shares fuck she struggled with it still moneys money i have to follow that scent until i get a new one he continued to stand there his hands cupping her shoulders his eyes on hers what are you looking at the gleam in your eye he touched his lips to hers once then again i have some sympathy for marco you see because i remember what its like to be on the receiving end of that look and that tenacity you hadnt killed anyone she reminded him lately ah but you werent sure of that for a time and still you were drawn now were the beeper on his watch pinged hell he kissed her again quick and distracted well have to reminisce later i have a meeting just as well eve thought hot blood interfered with a clear head ill see you later then at home she fiddled with her coffee cup at your place sure impatience flickered in his eyes as he shrugged into his jacket the slight bulge in the pocket reminded him id nearly forgotten i bought you a present in australia with some reluctance eve took the slim gold box when she opened it reluctance scattered there was no room for it in shocked panic jesus bleeding christ roarke are you insane it was a diamond she knew enough to be sure of that the stone graced a twisted gold chain and glinted fire shaped like a tear it was as long and wide as the first joint of a mans thumb they call it the giants tear he said as he casually took it from the box and draped the chain over her head it was mined about a hundred and fifty years ago it happened to come up for auction while i was in sydney he stepped back and studied its shooting sparks against the plain blue robe she wore yes it suits you i thought it would then he looked at her face and smiled oh i see you were counting on kiwi well perhaps next time when he leaned in to kiss her goodbye he was brought up short by the slap of her hand against his chest problem this is crazy you cant expect me to take something like this you do occasionally wear jewelry to prove his point he flicked a finger at the gold dangling from her ear yeah and i buy it from the street stall on lex i dont he said easily you take this back she started to pull at the chain but he closed his hands over hers it doesnt go with my suit eve a gift is not supposed to make the blood drain out of your cheeks suddenly exasperated he gave her a quick shake it caught my eye and i was thinking of you damn you i always am i bought it because i love you christ jesus when are you going to swallow that youre not going to do this to me she told herself she was calm very calm because she was right very right his temper didnt worry her shed seen it flare before but the stone weighed around her neck and what she feared it represented worried her very much do what to you eve exactly what youre not going to give me diamonds terrified and furious she shoved away from him youre not going to pressure me into taking what i dont want or being what i cant be you think i dont know what youve been doing these past few months do you think im stupid his eyes flashed hard as the stone between her breasts no i dont think youre stupid i think youre a coward her fist came up automatically oh how she would have loved to have used it to wipe that selfrighteous sneer from his face if he hadnt been right she could have so she used other weapons you think you can make me depend on you get used to living in that glorified fortress of yours and wearing silk well i dont give a damn about any of that im well aware of that i dont need your fancy food or your fancy gifts or your fancy words i see the pattern roarke say i love you at regular intervals until she learns to respond like a welltrained pet like a pet he repeated as his fury froze into ice i see im wrong you are stupid you really think this is about power and control have it your way im tired of having you toss my feelings back in my face my mistake for allowing it but that can be rectified i never no you never he interrupted coolly never once risked your pride by saying those words back to me you keep this place as your escape hatch rather than commit to staying with me i let you draw the line eve and now im moving it it wasnt just temper pushing him now nor was it just pain it was the truth i want all he said flatly or i want nothing she wouldnt panic he wouldnt make her panic like a firsttime rookie on a night run what exactly does that mean it means sex isnt enough its not just sex you know no i dont the choice is yours now it always was but now youll have to come to me ultimatums just piss me off thats a pity he gave her one long last look goodbye eve you cant just walk oh yes and he didnt look back i can her mouth dropped open when she heard the door slam for a moment she simply stood rigid the sun glinting off the jewel around her neck then she began to vibrate with fury of course she told herself and ripped the precious diamond off to toss it on the counter he thought she would go crawling after him begging him to stay well he could go on thinking that into the next millennium eve dallas didnt crawl and she didnt beg she closed her eyes against a pain more shocking than a laser strike who the hell is eve dallas she wondered and isnt that the core of it all o o she blocked it out what choice did she have the job came first had to come first if she wasnt a good cop she was nothing she was as empty and as helpless as the child she had been lying broken and traumatized in a dark alley in dallas she could bury herself in work the demands and pressures of it when she was standing in commander whitneys office she was only a cop with murder on her hands she had plenty of enemies commander dont we all his eyes were clear again sharp grief could never outweigh responsibility feeneys run a list of her convictions were breaking them down concentrating on the lifers first family and known associates someone she put in a cage for the duration would have the strongest revenge ratio next down the line are the uncorrected deviants uds sometimes slip through the cracks she put plenty away on mental and some of them are bound to have crawled their way out thats a lot of computer time dallas it was a subtle warning about budgets which she chose to ignore i appreciate you putting feeney on this with me i couldnt get through it without him commander these checks are sop but i dont think this was an attack on the prosecutor he sat back inclined his head waiting i think it was personal she was covering something for herself for somebody else she zapped the link recording i read your report lieutenant are you telling me you believe prosecuting attorney towers was involved in something illegal are you asking me as my friend or as my commander he bared his teeth before he could control himself after a short internal struggle he nodded well put lieutenant as your commander i dont know if it was illegal its my opinion at this stage of the investigation that there was something on that recording the victim wanted kept private it was important enough to have her get dressed and go out again into the rain to meet someone whoever that was was certain she would come alone and that she would leave no record of the contact commander i need to speak with the rest of the victims family her close friends your wife hed accepted that or tried to throughout his career he had worked hard to keep his loved ones out of the often nasty air of his job now he had to expose them you have my address lieutenant ill contact my wife now and tell her to expect you yes sir thank you o o anna whitney had made a fine home from the twolevel house in the quiet street in the suburbs of white plains she had raised her children there and raised them well choosing the profession of mother over a teaching career it wasnt the state salary for fulltime parents that had swayed her it had been the thrill of being in on each and every stage of childhood development shed earned her salary now with her children grown she earned her retirement stipend by putting the same dedication into nurturing her home her husband and her reputation as a hostess whenever she could she filled the house with her grandchildren in the evenings she filled it with dinner parties anna whitney hated solitude but she was alone when eve arrived as always she was perfectly groomed her cosmetics were carefully and expertly applied and her pale blond hair was coiffed in a sweptback style that suited her attractive face she wore a onepiece suit of good american cotton and held out a hand adorned only with a wedding ring to welcome eve lieutenant dallas my husband said you would come im sorry to intrude mrs whitney dont apologize im a cops wife come in ive made some lemonade its tablet im afraid fresh or frozen is so monstrously hard to come by its a little early for lemonade but i had a yen for it today eve let anna chatter as they walked into the formal living area with its stiffbacked chairs and straightedged sofa the lemonade was fine and eve said so after the first sip you know the memorial service is at ten tomorrow yes maam ill be there there are so many flowers already weve made arrangements to have them distributed after but thats not why youre here prosecutor towers was a good friend to you she was a very good friend to me and my husband her children are staying with you yes theyre theyve gone with marco just now to speak with the archbishop about the service theyre close to their father yes mrs whitney why are they staying here rather than with their father we all thought it best the house marcos house holds so many memories cicely lived there when the children were young then theres the media they dont have our address and we wanted to keep the children from dealing with reporters theyve swamped poor marco itll be different tomorrow of course her pretty hands plucked at the knee of her suit then calmed and lay still again theyll have to face it theyre still in shock even randall randall slade mirinas fiance hed gotten very close to cicely hes here as well hed never leave mirina alone at such a time shes a strong young woman lieutenant but even strong women need an arm to lean on now and then eve blocked out the quick image of roarke that popped into her brain as a result of the effort her voice was a bit more formal than usual as she led anna through the routine questions ive asked myself over and over what could have possessed her to go to that neighborhood anna concluded cicely could be stubborn and certainly strong willed but she was rarely impulsive and never foolish she talked to you confided in you we were like sisters would she have told you if she was in trouble of some kind if someone close to her was in trouble i would have thought so she would have handled it herself or tried to first her eyes swam but the tears didnt fall but sooner or later she would have blown off steam with me if shed had time eve thought you can think of nothing she was concerned about before her death nothing major her daughters wedding getting older we joked about her becoming a grandmother no anna said with a laugh as she recognized eves look mirina isnt pregnant though that would have only pleased her mother she was always concerned for david as well would he settle down was he happy and is he another cloud came into her eyes before she lowered them david is a great deal like his father he likes to wheel and deal he does a great deal of traveling for the business always looking for new arenas new opportunities theres no doubt hell take the helm if and when marco decided to turn it over she hesitated as if about to add something then smoothly switched gears mirina on the other hand prefers to live in one spot she manages a boutique in rome thats where she met randall hes a designer her shop handles his line exclusively now hes quite talented this is his she said indicating the slim suit she wore its lovely so as far as you know prosecutor towers had no reason to be concerned for her children nothing she would have felt obliged to smooth out or cover over cover over no of course not theyre both bright successful people and her exhusband hes having some business difficulties marco is he anna shrugged that off im sure hell straighten them out i never shared cicelys interest in business she was involved then in business directly of course cicely insisted on knowing exactly what was going on and having a say in it i never knew how she could keep so many things in her head if marco was having difficulties shed have known and probably have suggested a half dozen ways to right things she was quite brilliant when her voice broke anna pressed a hand to her lips im sorry mrs whitney no its all right im better having her children with me helped so much i feel i can stand for her with them i cant do what you do and look for her killer but i can stand for her with her children theyre very lucky to have you eve murmured surprised to hear herself say it and mean it odd shed always considered anna whitney a mild pain in the ass mrs whitney can you tell me about prosecutor towerss relationship with george hammett anna pokered up they were dear good friends mr hammett has told me they were lovers anna huffed out a breath she was a traditionalist and unashamed of it very well thats true but he wasnt the right man for her why set in his ways im very fond of george and he made an excellent escort for cicely but a woman can hardly be completely happy when she goes home to an empty apartment most nights to an empty bed she needed a mate george wanted it both ways and cicely deluded herself into thinking she wanted that too and she didnt she shouldnt have anna snapped obviously going over an old argument work isnt enough as i pointed out to her many times she simply wasnt serious enough about george to risk risk im speaking of emotional risk anna said impatiently you cops are so literalminded she wanted her life tidy more than she wanted the mess of a fulltime relationship i had the impression that mr hammett regretted that that he loved her very much if he did why didnt he push anna demanded and tears threatened she wouldnt have died alone then would she she wouldnt have been alone o o eve drove out of the quiet suburbs and on impulse she pulled her car over to the curb and slumped down in the seat she needed to think not about roarke she assured herself there was nothing to think about there that was settled on a hunch she called up her computer at her office and had it get to work on david angelini if he was like his father maybe he had also made a few poor investments while she was at it she ordered a run on randall slade and the boutique in rome if anything popped up she would have a scan on the flights from europe to new york damn it a woman who had nothing to worry about didnt leave her warm dry apartment in the middle of the night stubbornly eve retraced all the steps in her head as she thought it through she studied the neighborhood nice old trees spreading shade neat postcardsized yards with oneand twostory fully detached houses what would it have been like to have been raised in a pretty settled community would it make you secure confident the way being dragged from filthy room to filthy room from stinking street to stinking street made her jittery moody maybe there were fathers here who snuck into their little girls bedrooms too but it was hard to believe it the fathers here couldnt smell of bad liquor and sour sweat and have thick fingers that pushed themselves into innocent flesh eve caught herself rocking in the seat and choked back a sob she wouldnt do it she wouldnt remember she wouldnt let herself conjure up that face looming over her in the dark or the taste of that hand clamping over her mouth to smother her screams she wouldnt do it it had all happened to someone else some little girl whose name she couldnt even remember if she tried to if she let herself remember it all she would become that helpless child again and lose eve she laid her head back on the seat and concentrated on calming herself if she hadnt been wallowing in selfpity she would have seen the woman breaking the window at the side of the modified rancher across the street before the first shard fell as it was eve scowled asked herself why shed had to pull over at just this spot and did she really want the hassle of dealing with intrajurisdiction paperwork then she thought about the nice family who would come home that night and find their valuables gone with a longsuffering sigh she got out of the car the woman was half in and half out of the window when eve reached her the security shield had been deactivated by a cheap jammer available at any electronic outlet with a shake of her head for the naivete of suburbanites eve tapped the thief smartly on the butt that was struggling to wiggle through the opening forget your code maam her answer was a hard donkeystyle kick to the left shoulder eve considered herself lucky it had missed her face still she went down crushing some early tulips the perp popped out of the window like a cork and bolted across the lawn if her shoulder hadnt been aching eve might have let her go she caught her quarry in a flying tackle that sent them both sprawling into a bed of sunnyfaced pansies get your fucking hands off me or ill kill you eve thought briefly that it was a possibility the woman outweighed her by a good twenty pounds to ensure it didnt happen she jammed an elbow against the womans windpipe and dug for her badge youre busted the womans dark eyes rolled in disgust what the hells a city cop doing here dont you know where manhattan is asshole looks like im lost eve kept her elbow in place adding just a little more pressure for her own satisfaction while she pulled out her communicator and requested the closest burb cruiser chapter six by the next morning her shoulder was singing as fiercely as mavis on a final set eve admitted the extra hours shed put in with feeney and a night tossing alone in bed hadnt helped it any she was leery of anything but the mildest painkillers and took a single stingy dose before she dressed for the memorial service she and feeney had come across one tasty little tidbit david angelini had withdrawn three large payments from his accounts over the last six months to a grand total of one million six hundred and thirtytwo dollars american that was more than threequarters of his personal savings and hed drawn it in anonymous credit tokens and cash they were still digging on randall slade and mirina but so far they were both clean just a happy young couple on the brink of matrimony god knew how anybody could be happy on the brink eve thought as she located her gray suit the damn button on the jacket was still missing she realized as she started to fasten it and she remembered roarke had it carried it like some sort of superstitious talisman shed been wearing the suit the first time shed seen him at a memorial for the dead she ran a hasty comb through her hair and escaped the apartment and the memories o o st patricks was bulging by the time she arrived uniforms in the best dress blues flanked the perimeter for a full three blocks on fifth a kind of honor guard eve mused for a lawyer who cops had respected both street and air traffic had been diverted from the usually choked avenue and the media was thronged like a busy parade across the wide street after the third uniform stopped her eve attached her badge to her jacket and moved unhampered into the ancient cathedral and the sounds of the dirge she didnt care for churches much they made her feel guilty for reasons she didnt care to explore the scent of candle wax and incense was ripe some rituals she thought as she slipped into a side pew were as timeless as the moon she gave up any hope of speaking directly with cicely towerss family that morning and settled down to watch the show catholic rites had gone back to latin some time in the last decade eve supposed it added a kind of mysticism and a unity the ancient language certainly seemed appropriate to her in the mass for the dead the priests voice boomed out reaching to the lofty ceilings and the congregations responses echoed after silent and watchful eve scanned the crowd dignitaries and politicians sat with bowed heads shed positioned herself just close enough to catch glimpses of the family when feeney slipped in beside her she inclined her head angelini she murmured that would be the daughter beside him with her fiance on her right umhmm eve studied the couple young attractive the woman was of slight build with golden hair like her mother the unrelieved black she wore swept down from a high neck covered her arms to the wrists and skimmed her ankles she wore no veil or shaded glasses to shield her redrimmed puffy eyes grief simple basic and undiluted seemed to shimmer around her beside her randall slade stood tall one long arm supporting her shoulders he had a striking almost brutally handsome face which eve remembered well from the image shed generated on her computer screen large jaw long nose hooded eyes he looked big and tough but the arm around the woman lay gently flanking angelinis other side was his son david stood just a space apart that sort of body language hinted at friction he stared straight ahead his face a blank he stood slightly shorter than his father as dark as his sister was fair and he was alone eve thought very much alone the family pew was completed by george hammett directly behind were the commander his wife and his family she knew roarke was there she had already glimpsed him once at the end of an aisle beside a tearyeyed blond now when eve skimmed a glance his way she saw him lean down to the woman and murmur something that had her turning her face into his shoulder furious at the quick pang of jealousy eve scanned the crowd again her eyes met c j morses howd that little bastard manage to get in feeney a good catholic winced at the use of profanity in church who morse at eight oclock shifting his eyes feeney spotted the reporter a crowd like this i guess some of the slippery ones could slide through security eve debated hauling him out just for the satisfaction of it then decided the scuffle would give him just the kind of attention he craved fuck him feeney made a sound like a man whod been pinched christ jesus dallas youre in st pats if gods going to make little weasels like him shes going to have to listen to complaints have some respect eve looked back to mirina who lifted a hand to her face ive got plenty of respect she murmured plenty with this she stepped around feeney and strode down the side to the exit by the time he caught up with her she was just finishing issuing instructions to one of the uniforms whats the problem i needed some air churches always smelled like the dying or the dead to her and i wanted to get a jump on the weasel smiling now she turned to feeney ive got the uniforms looking out for him theyll confiscate any communication or recording devices hes got on him privacy law youre just going to steam him good he steams me she let out a long breath studying the media horde across the avenue ill be damned if the public has a right to know everything but at least those reporters are playing by the rules and showing some of that respect you were talking about for the family i take it youre done in there theres nothing i can do in there i figured youd be sitting with roarke no feeney nodded slowly and nearly dug into his pocket for his bag of nuts before he remembered the occasion is that the burr up your butt kid i dont know what youre talking about she started to walk without any destination in mind stopped and turned around who the hell was that blonde he was wrapped around i couldnt say he sucked air through his teeth she was a looker though want me to rough him up for you just shut up she jammed her hands in her pockets the commanders wife said they were having a small private memorial at their home how long do you figure this sideshow will take another hour minimum im heading back to cop central ill meet you at the commanders in two hours youre the boss o o small and private meant there were more than a hundred people packed into the commanders suburban home there was food to comfort the living liquor to dull the grieving the perfect hostess anna whitney hurried over the moment she spotted eve she kept her voice down and a carefully pleasant expression on her face lieutenant must you do this now here and now mrs whitney ill be as discreet as i possibly can the sooner i complete the interview stage the sooner well find prosecutor towerss killer her children are devastated poor mirina can barely function it would be more appropriate if youd anna commander whitney laid a hand on his wifes shoulder let lieutenant dallas do her job anna said nothing merely turned and walked stiffly away we said goodbye to a very dear friend today i understand commander ill finish here as quickly as i can be careful with mirina dallas shes very fragile at the moment yes sir perhaps i could speak to her first privately ill see to it when he left her alone eve backed up toward the foyer and turned directly into roarke lieutenant roarke she glanced at the glass of wine in his hand im on duty so i see this wasnt for you eve followed his gaze to the blonde sitting in the corner right she could all but feel the marrow of her bones turn green you move fast before she could step aside he put a hand on her arm his voice like his eyes was carefully neutral suzanna is a mutual friend of mine and cicelys the widow of a cop killed in the line of duty cicely put his murderer away suzanna kimball eve said battling back shame her husband was a good cop so im told with the faintest trace of amusement shadowing his mouth he skimmed a glance down her suit id hoped youd burned that thing grays not your color lieutenant im not making a fashion statement now if youll excuse me the fingers on her arm tightened you might look into randall slades gambling problem he owes considerable sums to several people as does david angelini is that right thats quite right im one of the several her eyes hardened and youve just decided i might be interested ive just discovered my own interest hes worked up a rather impressive debt at one of my casinos on vegas ii then theres a matter of a little scandal some years back involving roulette a redhead and a fatality on an obscure gaming satellite in sector what scandal youre the cop he said and smiled find out he left eve to go to the cops widow and hold her hand i have mirina in my office whitney murmured at eves ear i promised you wouldnt keep her long i wont struggling to smooth the feathers roarke had ruffled she followed the commanders broad back down the hall though his home office wasnt quite as spartan as the one at cop central it was obvious that whitney kept his wifes lush feminine taste at bay here the walls were a plain beige the carpet a deeper tone and the chairs were wide and a practical brown his work counter and console were in the center of the room in the corner by the window mirina angelini waited in her long sweep of mourning black whitney went to her first spoke quietly and squeezed her hand with one warning glance at eve he left them alone ms angelini eve began i knew your mother worked with her admired her im very sorry for your loss everyone is mirina responded in a voice as fragile and pale as her white cheeks her eyes were dark nearly black and glassy except the person who killed her i suppose ill apologize ahead of time if im of little help to you lieutenant dallas i bowed to pressure and let myself be tranqed i am as anyone will tell you taking this rather hard you and your mother were close she was the most wonderful woman ive ever known why should i have to be calm and composed when ive lost her like this eve came closer sat in one of the wide brown chairs i cant think of any reason why you should be my father wants a public show of strength mirina turned her face to the window im letting him down appearances are important to my father was your mother important to him yes their personal and professional lives were twined together the divorce didnt change that hes hurting she drew in a shaky breath he wont show it because hes too proud but hes hurting he loved her we all loved her ms angelini tell me about your mothers mood what you spoke of who you spoke of the last time you had contact the day before she died we were on the link for an hour maybe more wedding plans tears dripped out and spilled over the pale cheeks we were both so full of wedding plans id send her transmissions of dresses wedding dresses motherofthebride ensembles randall was designing them we talked about clothes doesnt that seem shallow lieutenant that the last time ill ever speak with my mother i spoke of fashion no it doesnt seem shallow it seems friendly loving mirina pressed a hand to her lips do you think yes i do what do you talk to your mother about i dont have a mother i never did mirina blinked focused again how odd what does it feel like i there was no way to describe what simply was it wouldnt be the same for you ms angelini eve said gently when you were speaking to your mother did she mention anything anyone who was concerning her no if youre thinking about her work we rarely talked of it i wasnt very interested in the law she was happy excited that i was coming over for a few days we laughed a lot i know she had this image her professional image but with me with the family she was softer looser i teased her about george saying that randy could design her wedding dress while he was doing mine her reaction we just laughed mama liked to laugh she said a little dreamy now as the tranq began to work she said she was having too much fun being mother of the bride to spoil it with the headaches of being a bride herself she was very fond of george and i think they were good together but i dont suppose she loved him dont you why no there was a faint smile on her lips a glassy gleam to her eyes when you love someone you have to be with them dont you to be part of their life to have them be part of yours she wasnt looking for that with george with anyone was mr hammett looking for that with her i dont know if he was he was happy enough to let their relationship drift im drifting now she murmured i dont feel as though im here at all because she needed mirina to hold off on the float a bit longer eve rose to request water from the console carrying the glass back she pushed it into mirinas hands did that relationship cause problems between him and your father between your mother and father it was awkward but not uncomfortable mirina smiled again she was sleepy now so relaxed she could have folded her arms on the window ledge and slipped away that sounds contradictory youd have to know my father he would refuse to let it bother him or at least to let it affect him hes still friendly with george she blinked down at the glass in her hand as if shed just realized it was there and took a delicate sip i dont know how he might have felt if they had decided to marry but well that isnt an issue now are you involved in your fathers business ms angelini in the fashion arm i do all the buying for the shops in rome and milan have the final say as to whats exported to our shops in paris and new york and so forth travel a bit to attend shows though i dont care much for traveling i hate going off planet dont you eve realized she was losing her i havent done it oh its horrid randy likes it says its an adventure what was i saying she pushed a hand through her lovely golden hair and eve rescued the glass before it could tumble to the floor about the buying i like to buy clothes other aspects of the business never interested me your parents and mr hammett were all stockholders in a company called mercury of course we use mercury exclusively for our shipping needs her eyelids drooped its fast dependable there were no problems that you know of in that or any other of your family holdings no none at all it was time to try a different tack was your mother aware of randall slades gambling debts for the first time mirina showed a spark of life and the life was anger flashing in the pale eyes she seemed to snap awake randalls debts were not my mothers concern but his and mine were dealing with them you didnt tell her there was no reason to worry her about something that was being handled randall has a problem with gambling but hes gotten help he doesnt wager anymore the debts are considerable theyre being paid mirina said hollowly arrangements have been made your mother was a wealthy woman in her own right youll inherit a large portion of her estate either the tranqs or grief dulled mirinas wits she seemed oblivious to the implication yes but i wont have my mother will i i wont have mama when i marry randall she wont be there she wont be there she repeated and began to weep quietly o o david angelini wasnt fragile his emotions showed themselves in stiff impatience with undercurrents of chained rage for all appearances this was a man insulted at the very idea that he would be expected to speak to a cop when eve sat across from him in whitneys office he answered her questions briefly in a clipped cultured voice obviously it was some maniac shed prosecuted who did this to her he stated her work brought her entirely too close to violence did you object to her work i didnt understand why she loved it why she needed it he lifted the glass hed brought with him and drank but she did and in the end it killed her when did you see her last on march eighteenth my birthday did you have contact with her since then i spoke with her about a week before she died just a family call we never went more than a week without speaking how would you describe her mood obsessed with mirinas wedding my mother never did things by halves she was planning the wedding as meticulously as she did any of her criminal cases she was hoping it would rub off on me what would the wedding fever my mother was a romantic woman under the prosecutors armor she hoped i would find the right mate and make a family i told her id leave that to mirina and randy and stay married to business awhile youre actively involved in angelini exports youd be aware of the financial difficulties his face tightened theyre blips lieutenant bumps nothing more my information indicates there are more serious difficulties than blips and bumps angelini is solid theres simply a need for some reorganization some diversification which is being done he flicked a hand elegant fingers a sparkle of gold a few key people have made unfortunate mistakes that can and will be rectified and that has nothing to do with my mothers case its my job to explore all angles mr angelini your mothers estate is substantial your father will come into a number of holdings as will you david got to his feet youre speaking of my mother if you suspect that anyone in the family would cause her harm then commander whitney has made a monstrous error in judgment putting you in charge of the investigation youre entitled to your opinion do you gamble mr angelini what business is that of yours since he was going to stand eve rose to face him its a simple question yes i gamble on occasion as do countless others i find it relaxing how much do you owe his fingers tightened on the glass i believe at this point my mother would have advised me to consult counsel thats certainly your right im not accusing you of anything mr angelini im fully aware that you were in paris on the night of your mothers death just as she was fully aware that shuttles skimmed across the atlantic hourly its my job to get a clear picture a full and clear picture youre under no obligation to answer my question but i can with very little trouble access that information the muscles in his jaw worked a moment eight hundred thousand give or take a few dollars are you unable to settle the debt i am neither a welsher nor a pauper lieutenant dallas he said stiffly it can and will be settled shortly was your mother aware of it neither am i a child lieutenant who needs to run to his mother for help whenever he skins a knuckle you and randall slade gambled together we did my sister disapproves so randy has given up the hobby not before he incurred debts of his own his eyes very like his fathers chilled i wouldnt know about that nor would i discuss his business with you oh yes you would eve thought but let it slide for the moment and the trouble in sector a few years ago you were there sector he looked convincingly blank a gambling satellite i often go to vegas ii for a quick weekend but i dont recall patronizing a casino in that sector i dont know what trouble youre referring to do you play roulette no its a fools game randys fond of it i prefer blackjack o o randall slade didnt look like a fool he looked to eve like a man who could knock anything out of his path without breaking stride nor was he her image of a fashion designer he dressed simply his black suit unadorned by any of the studs or braids currently in fashion and his wide hands had the look of a laborer rather than an artist i hope youll be brief he said in the tone of a man used to giving orders mirina is upstairs lying down i dont want to leave her for long then ill be brief eve didnt object when he took out a gold case containing ten slim black cigarettes technically she could have but she waited until hed lighted one what was your relationship with prosecutor towers we were friendly she was soon to become my motherinlaw we shared a deep love for mirina she approved of you i have no reason to believe otherwise your career has benefited quite a lot through your association with angelini exports true he blew out smoke that smelled lightly of lemon mint i like to think angelini has also benefited quite a lot through their association with me he surveyed eves gray suit that cut and color are both incredibly unflattering you might want to take a look at my ontherack line here in new york ill keep it in mind thanks i dislike seeing attractive women in unattractive clothes he smiled and surprised eve with a flare of charm you should wear bolder colors sleeker lines a woman with your build would carry them well so im told she muttered thinking of roarke youre about to marry a very wealthy woman im about to marry the woman i love its a happy coincidence that shes wealthy it is and money is something you have a need for dont we all smooth unoffended again amused you have debts mr slade large outstanding debts in an area that can cause considerable pain in the collecting process thats accurate he drew smoke in again im a gambling addict lieutenant recovering with mirinas help and support ive undergone treatment i havent made a wager in two months five days roulette wasnt it im afraid so and the amount you owe in round figures five hundred thousand and the amount of your fiancees inheritance probably triple that in round figures more considering the stocks and holdings that wouldnt be converted into credit or cash killing my fiancees mother would certainly have been one way to solve my financial difficulties he stubbed his cigarette out thoughtfully then again so would the contract ive just signed for my fall line money isnt important enough to me to kill for it but gambling was important enough gambling was like a beautiful woman desirable exciting capricious i had a choice between her and mirina there was nothing i wouldnt do to keep mirina nothing he understood and inclined his head nothing at all does she know about the scandal in sector his amused faintly smug expression froze and he paled that was nearly ten years ago that has nothing to do with mirina nothing to do with anything you havent told her i didnt know her i was young foolish and i paid for my mistake why dont you explain to me mr slade how you came to make that mistake it has nothing to do with this indulge me damn it it was one night out of my life one night id had too much to drink was stupid enough to mix the liquor with chemicals the woman killed herself it was proven the overdose was selfinflicted interesting eve thought but you were there she hazarded i was zoned id lost more heavily than i could afford at roulette and between us we made a scene i told you i was young i blamed my bad luck on her maybe i did threaten her i just dont remember yes we argued publicly she struck me and i struck her back im not proud of it then i just dont remember dont remember mr slade as i testified the next thing i remember is waking up in some filthy little room we were in bed naked and she was dead i was still groggy security came in i must have called them they took pictures i was assured the pictures were destroyed after the case was closed and i was exonerated i barely knew the woman he continued heating up id picked her up in the bar or thought i had my attorney discovered she was a professional companion unlicensed working the casinos he closed his eyes do you think i want mirina to know that i was however briefly accused of murdering an unlicensed whore no eve said quietly i dont imagine you do and as you said mr slade youd do anything to keep her anything at all o o hammett was waiting for her the moment she stepped out of the commanders office the hollows in his cheeks seemed deeper his skin grayer id hoped to have a moment lieutenant eve she gestured behind her let him slip into the room first then closed the door on the murmurs of conversation this is a difficult day for you george yes very difficult i wanted to ask needed to know is there anything more anything at all the investigations proceeding theres nothing i can tell you that you wouldnt have heard through the media there must be more his voice rose before he could control it something she could feel pity even when there was suspicion everything that can be done is being done youve interviewed marco her children even randy if there is anything they knew anything they told you that might help i have a right to be told nerves she wondered or grief no she said quietly you dont i cant give you any information acquired during an interview or through investigative procedure were talking about the murder of the woman i loved he exploded with it his pale face flushing dark we might have been married were you planning to be married george wed discussed it he passed a hand over his face a hand that shook slightly wed discussed it he repeated and the flush washed away from his skin there was always another case another summation to prepare there was supposed to be plenty of time with his hands balled into fists he turned away from her i apologize for shouting at you im not myself its all right george im very sorry shes gone he said it quietly brokenly shes gone there was nothing left for her to do but give him privacy she closed the door behind her then rubbed a hand at the back of her neck where tension was lodged on her way out eve signaled to feeney need you to do some digging she told him as they headed outside old case about ten years past on one of the gambling hells in sector what you got dallas sex scandal and probable suicide accidental hot damn feeney said mournfully and i was hoping to catch a ball game on the screen tonight this should be just as entertaining she spied roarke helping the blonde into his car hesitated then detoured past him thanks for the tip roarke any time lieutenant feeney he added with a brief nod before he slipped into the car hey feeney said when the car glided away hes really pissed at you he seemed fine to me eve muttered and wrenched open her car door feeney snorted some detective you are pal just dig up the case feeney randall slades the accused she slammed her door and sulked chapter seven feeney knew eve wasnt going to like the data hed unearthed anticipating her reaction and being a wise man he sent it through computer rather than delivering it in person ive got the goods on the slade incident he said when his droopy face blipped onto her monitor im going to send it through im ah going to be stuck here for awhile ive got about twenty percent of towers conviction list eliminated its slow going try to speed it up feeney weve got to narrow the field right ready for transmission his face blinked off in its place was the police report from sector eve frowned over it as the data scrolled there was little more information above what randall slade had already told her suspicious death overdose the victims name was carolle lee age birthplace new chicago colony unemployed the image showed a young blackhaired woman of mixed heritage with exotic eyes and coffeetoned skin randall looked pale his eyes glazed in his mug shot she skimmed through searching for any detail randall might have left out it was bad enough as it was eve mused the murder charges had been dropped but hed copped to soliciting an unlicensed companion possession of illegal chemicals and contributing to a fatality hed been lucky she decided very lucky that the incident had occurred on such an obscure sector in a hellhole that didnt garner much attention but if someone anyone had come across the details had threatened to take them to his pretty fragile fiancee it would have been a real mess had towers known eve wondered that was the big question and if she had how would she have handled it the attorney might have looked at the facts weighed them and dismissed the case as resolved but the mother would the loving mother who chatted about fashion for an hour with her daughter the devoted parent who carved out time to help plan the perfect wedding have accepted the scandal as the wild oats of a young foolish man or would she have stood like a barricade between the older less foolish man and what he wanted most eve narrowed her eyes and continued to scan the documents then she stopped cold when roarkes name jumped out at her son of a bitch she muttered slamming a fist on the desk son of a bitch within fifteen minutes she was striding across the glossy tiles of the lobby of roarkes building in midtown her jaw was set as she accessed the code then slapped her palm onto the handplate of his private elevator she hadnt bothered to call but let righteous fury zip her up to the top floor the receptionist in his elegant outer office started to smile in greeting one look at eves face had her blinking lieutenant dallas tell him im here and that i see him now or down at cop central hes hes in a meeting now ill call through she swiveled and punched a button for private communication she murmured the message and apologies while eve stood fuming if you would wait in his office for a moment lieutenant the receptionist began and rose i know the way eve snapped striding across the plush carpet through the towering double doors and into roarkes new york sanctum there had been a time when she would have helped herself to a cup of coffee or wandered over to admire his view from a hundred fifty stories up today she stood every nerve quivering with temper and beneath that was fear the panel on the east wall slid open silently and he walked through he still wore the dark suit hed chosen for the memorial service as the panel closed behind him he fingered the button in his pocket that belonged on eves gray jacket you were quick he said easily i thought i would finish my board meeting before you came by you think youre clever she shot back giving me just enough to start digging with damn it roarke youre right in the middle of this am i unconcerned he walked to a chair sat stretched out his legs and how is that lieutenant you owned the damn casino where slade was gambling you owned the fucking fleabag hotel where the woman died you had an unlicensed hooker working your hellhole unlicensed companions in sector he smiled a little why im shocked dont get cute with me it connects you mercury was bad enough but this is deeper your statements on record naturally why are you making it so hard for me to keep your name out of this im not interested in making it hard or easy for you lieutenant fine then just fine if he could be cold so could she then well just get the questions and answers out of the way and move on you knew slade actually i didnt not personally actually id forgotten all about it and him until i did some research of my own wouldnt you like some coffee you forgot you were involved in a murder investigation yes idly he steepled his hands it wasnt the first brush id had with the police nor apparently is it the last in the grand scheme of things lieutenant it really didnt concern me didnt concern you she repeated you had slade tossed out of your casino i believe the manager of the casino handled that you were there yes i was there somewhere on the premises in any case dissatisfied clients often become rowdy i didnt pay much attention at that time she took a deep breath if it meant so little and the entire matter slipped your mind why did you sell the casino the hotel everything you owned in sector within fortyeight hours of cicely towerss murder he said nothing for a moment his eyes on hers for personal reasons roarke just tell me so i can put this whole connection to bed i know the sale didnt have anything to do with towerss murder but it looks dicey for personal reasons isnt good enough it was for me at the time tell me lieutenant dallas are you thinking i decided to blackmail cicely over her future soninlaws youthful indiscretion had some henchman in my employ lure her to the west end and when she didnt cooperate slit her throat she wanted to hate him for putting her in the position of having to answer i told you i didnt believe you had anything to do with her death and i meant it youve put me in a position where its a scenario well have to work with one that will take time and manpower away from finding the killer damn you eve he said it quietly so quietly so calmly her throat burned in reaction what do you want from me roarke you said youd help that i could use your connections now because youre pissed about something else youre blocking me i changed my mind his tone was dismissive as he rose and walked behind his desk about several things he added watching her with eyes that sliced at her heart if you would just tell me why you sold the coincidence of that cant be ignored he considered for a moment his decision to reorganize some of his lessthanlegal enterprises and shake loose of what couldnt be changed no he murmured i dont believe i will why are you putting me in this position she demanded is this some sort of punishment he sat leaned back steepled his fingers if you like youre going to be pulled into this just like the last time theres just no need for it driven by frustration she slapped her hands on his desk cant you see that he looked at her face the dark worried eyes the ridiculously chopped hair i know what im doing he hoped he did roarke dont you understand its not enough for me to know you had nothing to do with it now i have to prove it he wanted to touch her so much that his fingers ached from it more than anything at that moment he wished he could hate her for it do you know eve she straightened dropped her hands to her sides it doesnt matter she said and turned and left him but it did matter he thought at the moment it was all that really mattered shaken he shifted forward he could curse her now now that those big whiskeycolored eyes were no longer staring into him he could curse her for bringing him so low he was nearly ready to beg for whatever scraps of her life she was willing to share with him and if he begged if he settled he would probably grow to hate her almost as much as he would hate himself he knew how to outwait a rival how to outmanuever an opponent he certainly knew how to fight for what he wanted or intended to have but he was no longer sure he could outwait outmanuever or fight eve taking the button out of his pocket he toyed with it studied it as though it were some intriguing puzzle to be solved he was an idiot roarke realized it was humiliating to admit what an incredible fool love could make of a man he stood slipped the button back in his pocket he had a board meeting to complete business to take care of and he thought some research to do on whether any details of the slade arrest had left sector and if they had how and why o o eve couldnt put off her appointment with nadine the necessity of it irritated as did the fact she had to schedule the time between nadines evening and late live broadcasts she plopped down at a table at a small cafe near channel called images it was with its quiet corners and leafy trees several large steps away from the blue squirrel eve winced at the prices on the menu broadcasters were paid a great deal more than cops and settled on a classic pepsi you ought to try the muffins nadine told her the place is famous for them i bet it is at about five bucks a rehydrated blueberry eve thought i dont have a lot of time neither do i nadines oncamera makeup was still perfectly in place eve could only wonder how anyone could stand having their pores gunked for hours at a time you go first fine nadine broke open her muffin and it steamed fragrantly obviously the memorial is the big news of the day who came who said what lots of side stories about the family focus is tight on the grieving daughter and her fiance why human interest dallas big splashy wedding plans interrupted by violent murder words leaked that the ceremony will be postponed until the first part of next year nadine took a bite of muffin eve ignored the envious reaction of her stomach juices gossip isnt what im after nadine but it adds color look it was more like a plant than a leak somebody wanted the media to know the weddings been postponed so i wonder if this means therell be a wedding after all what i smell is the scent of trouble in paradise why would mirina turn away from slade at a time like this seems to me theyd have a nice quiet private ceremony so hed be there to comfort her maybe thats the plan exactly and theyre throwing you off the scent its possible anyway without towers as buffer speculations running that angelini and hammett will dissolve their business associations they were very cool to each other never spoke during the service before or after it either how do you know nadine smiled feline and pleased i have my sources angelini needs income and fast roarkes made him an offer for his shares which now include towerss interest in mercury has he you didnt know interesting sly as a cat nadine licked crumbs from her fingertips i thought it was interesting too that you didnt attend the service with roarke i was there in an official capacity eve said shortly lets stick to the point more trouble in paradise nadine murmured then her eyes sobered look dallas i like you i dont know why but i do if you and roarke are having problems im sorry for it buddytobuddy confidences were something eve was never comfortable with she shifted surprised that she was tempted even for an instant to share then she set it down to nadines skill as a reporter the point she repeated okay nadine moved a shoulder and took another bite of muffin nobody knows dick she said briefly weve got speculation angelinis financial difficulties the sons gambling habits the fluentes case you can forget the fluentes case eve interrupted hes going down both he and his lawyer know it the evidence is clean taking towers out wont change a thing he might have been pissed maybe but hes small time he doesnt have the contacts or the money to buy a hit the size of towers it doesnt check out were running everybody she ever put away so far weve got zip youve cooled off on the revenge theory havent you yeah i think it was closer to home anyone in particular no eve shook her head when nadine studied her no she repeated i dont have anything solid yet heres what i want you to look into and i need you to hold it off the air until i clear it that was the deal briefly eve told her of the incident in sector holy shit thats hot and its public record dallas that may be but you wouldnt know where to look unless id tipped you stick with the deal nadine you hold it off air and you poke around see if you can find out if anyone know or cares if theres a connection to the murder ill hand it to you if not i guess itll be up to your conscience whether you want to broadcast something that could ruin the reputation of a man and his relationship with his fiancee low blow dallas depends on where youre standing keep the cover on it nadine umhmm her mind was humming slade was in san francisco the night of the murder she waited a beat wasnt he so the record shows and there are dozens of coasttocoast shuttles public and private running every hour back and forth thats right you keep in touch nadine eve said as she rose and you keep the cover on o o eve made it an early night when her link beeped at one she was screaming her way out of a nightmare sweating shaking she tore off the covers that wrapped around her fought off the hands that were groping over her body she choked back another scream pressed her fingers against her eyes and ordered herself not to be sick she answered the call without turning the lights on and blocked video dallas dispatch voice print verified probable homicide female report five thirtytwo central park south rear of building code yellow acknowledged eve ended the transmission and still trembling from the aftershocks of the dream crawled out of bed it took her twenty minutes shed needed the comfort of a hot shower even if it had only been for thirty seconds it was a trendy neighborhood peopled by residents who patronized fashionable shops and private clubs and who aspired to move just another notch up the social and economic ladder the streets were quiet here though it wasnt quite out of the realm of public taxis and into private transpocars upper middle class all the way she mused as she made her way around to the back of a sleek steel building with its pleasant view of the park then again murder happened everywhere it had certainly happened here the rear of the building couldnt boast a view of the park but the developers had made up for it with a nice plot of green beyond the trim trees was a security wall that separated one building from the next on the narrow stone path through a border of gold petunias the body sprawled facedown female eve noted flashing her badge at the waiting uniforms dark hair dark skin well dressed she studied the stylish redandwhitestriped heel that lay point up on the path death had knocked her out of her shoes pictures yes sir lieutenant me on the way who reported it neighbor came out to let his dog use the facilities weve got him inside do we have a name on her yvonne metcalf lieutenant she lives in eleven twentysix actress eve murmured as the name struck a cord up and coming yes sir one of the uniforms looked down at the body she won an emmy last year been doing the talk show rounds shes pretty famous now shes pretty dead keep the camera running i need to turn her over even before she used the protective spray to seal her hands before she crouched down to turn the body eve knew blood was everywhere someone hissed sharply as the body rolled faceup but it wasnt eve shed been braced for it the throat was cut and the cut was deep yvonnes lovely green eyes stared up at eve two blank questions what the hell did you have to do with cicely towers she murmured same mo one wound to the throat severed jugular no robbery no signs of sexual assault or struggle gently eve lifted one of yvonnes limp hands shone her light at the nails under them they were painted a sparkling scarlet with tiny white stripes and they were perfect no chips no snags no scrapes of flesh or stains of blood under them all dressed up and no place to go eve commented studying the victims flashy redandwhitestriped bodysuit lets find out where shed been or where she was going eve began her head came around as she heard the sound of approaching feet but it wasnt the medical examiner and his team nor was it the sweepers it was she saw with disgust c j morse and a crew from channel get that camera out of here temper vibrating she sprang to her feet instinctively shielding the body this is a crime scene you havent posted it morse said smiling sweetly until you do its public access sherry get a shot of that shoe post the goddamn scene eve ordered a uniform confiscate that camera the recorders you cant confiscate media equipment until the scenes posted c j reminded her as he tried to rubberneck around her to get a good look sherry get me a nice pan then focus on the lieutenants pretty face im going to kick your ass morse oh i wish youd try dallas some of his bubbling resentment simmered into his eyes id love to bring you up on charges and broadcast it after that stunt you pulled on me if youre still on this scene when its posted youll be the one facing charges he only smiled again backing off he calculated he had another fifteen seconds of video time before he ran into trouble channel has a fine team of lawyers detain him and his crew eve flashed a snarl at a uniform off scene until im through interfering with media i bet yours is tasty he continued to grin as he was escorted away when eve came around the building he was doing a sober standup report on the recent homicide without missing a beat he angled himself toward her lieutenant dallas will you confirm that yvonne metcalf the star of tune in has been murdered the department has no comment to make at this time isnt it true that ms metcalf was a resident of this building and that her body was discovered this morning on the rear patio hadnt her throat been cut no comment our viewing audience is waiting lieutenant two prominent women have been violently murdered by the same method and in all likelihood by the same person barely a week apart and you have no comment unlike certain irresponsible reporters the police are more careful and more concerned with facts than speculation or is it that the police are simply unable to solve these crimes quick on his feet he sidestepped came up in her face again arent you concerned about your reputation lieutenant and the connection between the two victims and your close friend roarke my reputation isnt at issue here the investigation is morse turned back to the camera at this hour the investigation headed by lieutenant eve dallas is at an apparent deadlock another murder has taken place less than a hundred yards from where i stand a young woman talented beautiful and full of promise has had her life sliced off by a violent sweep of a knife just as only one week ago the respected and dedicated defender of justice cicely towers had her life brought to an end perhaps the question is not when will the killer be caught but what prominent woman will be next this is c j morse for channel reporting live from central park south he nodded to the camera operator before turning to beam at eve see if youd cooperate dallas i might be able to help you out with public opinion fuck you morse oh well maybe if you asked nice his grin never wavered when she grabbed him by the shirtfront now now dont touch unless you mean it she was a full head taller than he and gave serious thought to pounding him into the sidewalk heres what i want to know morse i want to know how a thirdrate reporter ends up on a crime scene with a crew ten minutes after the primary he smoothed down the front of his shirt sources lieutenant which as you know im under no obligation to share with you his smile dimmed into a sneer and at this stage id say were talking thirdrate primary youd have been better off hooking up with me instead of nadine that was a nasty turn you served helping her bump me off the towers story was it well im glad to hear that c j because i just plain hate your guts it didnt bother you at all did it to go back there camera running and broadcast pictures of that woman you didnt think about her right to a little dignity or the fact that someone who cared about her might not have been notified her family for instance hey you do your job i do mine you didnt look too bothered poking at her what time did you get the tip eve asked briefly he hesitated stringing it out i guess it wouldnt hurt to tell you that it came in on my private line at twelve thirty from nope i protect my sources i called the station drummed up a crew right sherry right the camera operator moved a shoulder the night desk sent us out to meet c j here thats show biz im going to do whatever i can to confiscate your logs morse to bring you in for questioning to make your life hell oh i hope you do his round face gleamed youll give me double my usual airtime and put my popularity quotient through the roof and you know whats going to be fun the side story im going to work up on roarke and his cozy relationship with yvonne metcalf her stomach shuddered but she kept her voice bland watch your step there c j roarkes not nearly as nice as i am keep your crew off scene she warned put one toe on and i confiscate your equipment she turned and when she was far enough away pulled out her communicator she was going outside of procedure risking a reprimand or worse but it had to be done she could tell when roarke answered that he hadnt yet been to bed well lieutenant this is a surprise ive only got a minute tell me what your relationship was with yvonne metcalf he lifted a brow were friends were close at one time you were lovers yes briefly why because shes dead roarke his faint smile faded oh christ how she had her throat cut stay available is that an official request lieutenant he asked and his voice was hard as rock it has to be roarke she hesitated im sorry so am i he ended the transmission chapter eight eve had no problem listing several connections between cicely towers and yvonne metcalf number one was murder the method and the perpetrator they had both been women in the public eye well respected and held in great affection they were successful in their chosen fields and were dedicated to that field they both had families who loved and who mourned yet they had worked and played in dramatically different social and professional circles yvonnes friends had been artists actors and musicians while cicely had socialized with law enforcers businesspeople and politicians cicely had been an organized career woman of impeccable taste who had guarded her privacy fiercely yvonne had been a cheerfully disorganized borderline messy actor who courted the public eye but someone had known them both well enough and felt strongly enough about both to kill them the only name eve found in cicelys tidy address book and yvonnes disordered one that matched was roarke for the third time in an hour eve ran the lists through her computer pushing for a connection a name that clicked with another name an address a profession a personal interest the few connections that came through were so loosely linked she could barely justify taking the next step toward the interview but she would do it because the alternative was roarke while the computer handled the short list she took another pass through yvonnes electronic diary why the hell didnt the woman put in names eve muttered there were times dates occasionally initials often little side notes or symbols of yvonnes mood lunch at the crown room with b c yippee dont be late yvonne and wear the green number with the short skirt he likes prompt women with legs beauty day at paradise thank god should try to hit fitness palace at for workout ugh fancy lunches eve mused pampering in the top salon in the city sweating a little in a luxury gym not a bad life all in all who had wanted to end it she flipped through to the day of the murder power breakfast little blue suit with matching shoes look professional for christs sake yvonne p ps office to discuss contract negotiations maybe sneak in some shopping first shoe sale at saks hot damn lunch skip dessert maybe tell cutie he was wonderful in show no penalty for lying to pals about their acting god wasnt he awful call home hit saks if you missed it earlier ish drinks stick with spring water babe you talk too much when youre loose be bright sparkle push tune in dont forget photo layout in morning and stay away from that wine go home take a nap midnight meeting could be hot stuff wear the redandwhitestriped number and smile smile smile bygones are bygones right never close that door small world and so on what a dumb ass so shed documented the meeting at midnight not who not where not what but shed wanted to be well dressed for it someone shed known had a history with bygones a past problem with lover eve mused she didnt think so yvonne hadnt put little hearts around the notation or told herself to be sexy sexy sexy eve thought she was beginning to understand the woman yvonne had been amused at herself ready for fun enjoying her lifestyle and shed been ambitious wouldnt she have told herself to smile smile smile for a career opportunity a part good press a new script an influential fan what would she have said about roarke eve wondered most likely shed have noted him down with a big boldfaced capital r she would have put hearts around the date or dollar signs or smiles as she had eighteen months before she died eve didnt have to look at yvonnes previous diaries she remembered perfectly the womans last notation on roarke dinner with r yumyum wear the white satin matching teddy be prepared might get lucky the mans body is awesome wish i could figure out his head oh well just think sexy and see what happens eve didnt particularly want to know if yvonne had gotten lucky obviously theyd been lovers roarke had said so himself so why hadnt she put down any more dates with him after the white satin it was something she supposed shed have to find out for investigative purposes only meanwhile she would make another trip to yvonnes apartment try again to reconstruct the last day of her life she had interviews to schedule and as yvonnes parents called her at least once a day eve knew she would have to talk with them again steel herself against their horrible grief and disbelief she didnt mind the fourteen and sixteenhour days in fact at this stage of her life she welcomed them o o four days after yvonne metcalfs murder eve was running on empty she had questioned over three dozen people extensively exhaustively not only had she been unable to discover a single viable motive shed found no one who hadnt adored the victim there wasnt a hint of an obsessed fan yvonnes mail had been mountainous and feeney and his computer were still scanning the correspondence but among the first section there had been no threats veiled or overt no weird or unsavory offers or suggestions there had been a hefty percentage of marriage proposals and other propositions eve culled them out with little hope or enthusiasm there was still a chance that someone who had written to yvonne had written or contacted cicely as time passed the chance became a long shot eve did what was expected in unsolved multiple homicides what departmental procedure called for at this stage of an investigation she made an appointment with the shrink while she waited eve struggled with her mixed feelings for dr mira the woman was brilliant insightful quietly efficient and compassionate those were the precise reasons eve dragged her feet she had to remind herself again that she hadnt come to mira for personal reasons or because the department was sending her for therapy she wasnt going through testing they werent going to discuss her thoughts her feelings or her memory they were going to dissect the mind of a killer still she had to concentrate on keeping her heart rate level her hands still and dry when she was gestured into miras office eve told herself her legs were shaky because she was tired nothing more lieutenant dallas miras pale blue eyes skimmed over eves face noted the fatigue im sorry you had to wait no problem though she would have preferred standing eve took the blue scoop chair beside miras i appreciate you getting to the case so quickly we all do our jobs as best we can mira said in her soothing voice and i had a great deal of respect and affection for cicely towers you knew her we were contemporaries and she consulted me on many cases i often testified for the prosecution as well as the defense she added smiling a little but you knew that just making conversation i also admired yvonne metcalfs talent she brought a lot of happiness to the world shell be missed someone isnt going to miss either of them true enough in her smooth graceful way mira programmed her autochef for tea i realize you might be a bit pressed for time but i work better with a little stimulation and you look as though you could use some im fine recognizing the tightly controlled hostility in the tone mira only lifted a brow overworked as usual it happens to those who are particularly good at their jobs she handed eve a cup of tea in one of the pretty china cups now ive read over your reports the evidence youve gathered and your theories my psychiatric profile she said tapping a sealed disc on the table between them youve completed it eve didnt trouble to mask the irritation you could have transmitted the data and saved me a trip i could have but i preferred to discuss this with you face to face eve youre dealing with something someone very dangerous i think i picked up on that doctor two women have had their throats slashed two women thus far mira said quietly and sat back im very much afraid there will be more and soon because she believed the same eve ignored the quick chill that sprinted up her spine why it was so easy you see and so simple a job well done theres a satisfaction in that theres also the attention factor whoever accomplished the murders can now sit back in his or her home and watch the show the reports the editorials the grieving the services the public arena of the investigation she paused to savor her tea you have your theory eve youre here so that i can corroborate it or argue against it i have several theories only one you believe in mira smiled her wise smile aware that it made eve bristle fame what else did these two women have in common but their public prominence they didnt share the same social circle or professional one knew few of the same people even on a casual level they didnt patronize the same shops health centers or cosmetic experts what they did share was fame public interest and a kind of power which the killer envied i would say exactly that resented as well and wished by killing them to bask in the reflected attention the murders themselves were both vicious and uncommonly clean their faces werent marred nor their bodies one quick slice across the throat according to the me from the front face to face a blade is a personal weapon an extension of the hand it isnt distant like a laser or aloof like poison your murderer wanted the feel of killing the sight of blood the smell of it the full experience that makes him or her one who appreciates having control following through on a plan you dont believe it was a hired hit theres always that possibility eve but im more inclined to see the killer as an active participant rather than a hireling then there are the souvenirs towerss umbrella and metcalfs right shoe youve managed to keep that out of the press barely eve scowled over the memory of morse and his crew invading the murder scene a pro wouldnt have taken a souvenir and the killings were too well thought out to have been planned by a street hit i agree you have an organized mind an ambitious one your murderer is enjoying his work which is why therell be another or hers eve put in the envy factor can be leaned toward a female these two women were what she wanted to be beautiful successful admired famous strong its often the weak who kill yes quite often no it isnt possible to determine gender from the data we have at this point only to access the probability factor that the killer targets females who have reached a high level of public attention what am i supposed to do about that dr mira put a security beeper on every prominent wellknown or successful woman in the city including yourself odd i was thinking more about you me eve jiggled the tea she hadnt touched then set it on the table with a snap thats ridiculous i dont think so youve become a familiar face eve for your work certainly and most particularly since the case last winter youre very respected in your field and she continued before eve could interrupt you also have one more important connection to both victims all of you have had a relationship with roarke eve knew her blood drained from her face that wasnt something she could control but she could keep her voice level and hard roarke had a business partnership a relatively minor one with towers with metcalf the intimate side of their relationship has been over for quite some time yet you feel the need to defend him to me im not defending him eve snapped im stating facts roarkes more than capable of defending himself undoubtedly hes a strong vital and clever man still you worry for him in your professional opinion is roarke the killer absolutely not i have no doubt that were i to analyze him i would find his killer instinct well developed the fact was mira would have loved the opportunity to study roarkes mind but his motive would have to be very defined great love or great hate i doubt there is much else that would push him over the line relax eve mira said quietly youre not in love with a murderer im not in love with anyone and my personal feelings arent at issue here on the contrary the investigators state of mind is always an issue and if im required to give my opinion on yours ill have to say i found you near exhaustion emotionally torn and deeply troubled eve picked up the profile disc and rose then its fortunate youre not going to be required to give your opinion im perfectly capable of doing my job i dont doubt it for a moment but at what cost to yourself the cost would be higher if i didnt do it im going to find who killed these women then itll be up to someone like cicely towers to put them away eve tucked the disk in her bag theres a connection you left out dr mira something these two women had in common eves eyes were hard and cold family both of them had close family that was a large and important part of their lives id say that lets me out as a possible target wouldnt you perhaps have you been thinking of your family eve dont play with me you mentioned it mira pointed out youre always careful in what you say to me so i must assume family is on your mind i dont have family eve shot back and ive got murder on my mind if you want to report to the commander that im unfit for duty thats just fine when are you going to trust me there was impatience for the first time in eves memory in the careful voice is it so impossible for you to believe that i care about you yes i care mira said when eve blinked in surprise and i understand you better than you wish to admit i dont need for you to understand me but there were nerves in eves voice now she heard them herself im not in testing or here for a therapy session there are no recorders on here mira set her tea down with a snap that had eve jamming her hands in her pockets do you think youre the only child who lived with horror and abuse the only woman whos struggled to overcome it i dont have to overcome anything i dont remember my stepfather raped me repeatedly from the time i was twelve until i was fifteen mira said calmly and stopped eves protest cold for those three years i lived never knowing when it would happen only that it would and no one would listen to me shaken sick eve wrapped her arms around her body i dont want to know this why are you telling me this because i look in your eyes and see myself but you have someone wholl listen to you eve eve stood where she was moistened her dry lips why did it stop because i finally found the courage to go to an abuse center tell the counselor everything to submit to the examinations both physical and psychiatric the terror of that the humiliation of that was no longer as huge as the alternative why should i have to remember it eve demanded its over why arent you sleeping the investigation eve the gentle tone had eve closing her eyes it was so hard so trying to fight that quiet compassion flashbacks she murmured hating herself for the weakness nightmares of before you were found in texas just blips just pieces i can help you put them together why should i want to put them together havent you already started to now mira rose you can work with this haunting your subconscious ive watched you do so for years but happiness eludes you and will continue to do so until youve convinced yourself you deserve it it wasnt my fault no mira touched a gentle hand to eves arm no it wasnt your fault tears were threatening and that was a shock and an embarrassment i cant talk about this my dear youve already begun to ill be here when youre ready to do so again she waited until eve had reached the door can i ask you a question you always ask questions why stop now mira said and smiled does roarke make you happy sometimes eve squeezed her eyes shut and swore yes yes he makes me happy unless hes making me miserable thats lovely im very pleased for both of you try to get some sleep eve if you wont take chemicals you might use simple visualization ill keep it in mind eve opened the door kept her back to the room thank you youre welcome o o visualization wouldnt be much help eve decided not after a rescan of autopsy reports the apartment was too quiet too empty she was sorry shed left the cat with roarke at least galahad would have been company because her eyes burned from studying data she pushed away from her desk she didnt have the energy to seek out mavis and she was bored senseless with the video offerings on her screen she ordered music listened for thirty seconds then switched it off food usually worked but when she poked into the kitchen she was reminded she hadnt restocked her autochef in weeks the pickings were slim and she didnt have enough of an appetite to order in determined to relax she tried out the virtual reality goggles mavis had given her for christmas because mavis had used them last they were set for nightclub at full volume after a hurried adjustment and a great deal of swearing eve programmed tropics beach she could feel the grit of hot white sand under her bare feet the punch of the sun on her skin the soft ocean breeze it was lovely to stand in the gentle surf watch the swoop of gulls and sip from an icy drink that carried the zing of rum and fruit there were hands on her bare shoulders rubbing sighing she leaned back into them felt the firm length of male against her back far out on the blue sea a white ship sailed toward the horizon it was easy to turn into the arms that waited for her to lift her mouth to the mouth she wanted and to lie on the hot sand with the body that fit so perfectly with hers the excitement was as sweet as the peace the rhythm as old as the waves that lapped over her skin she let herself be taken shivered as the needs built toward fulfillment his breath was on her face his body linked with her when she groaned out his name roarke furious with herself eve tore off the goggles and heaved them aside he had no right to intrude even here inside her head no right to bring her pain and pleasure when all she wanted was privacy oh he knew what he was doing she thought as she sprang up to pace he knew exactly what he was doing and they were going to settle it once and for all she slammed the apartment door behind her it didnt occur to her until she was speeding through his gates that he might not be alone the idea of that was so infuriating so devastating that she took the stone steps two at a time hit the door with a fresh burst of violent energy summerset was waiting for her lieutenant its one twenty in the morning i know what time it is she bared her teeth when he stepped in front of her to block the staircase lets understand each other pal i hate you you hate me the difference is ive got a badge now get the hell out of my way or ill haul your bony ass in for obstructing an officer dignity coated him like silk do i take that to mean youre here at this hour in an official capacity lieutenant take it any way you want where is he if youll state your business ill be happy to determine roarkes current whereabouts and see if hes available to you out of patience eve jammed an elbow in his gut and skirted his wheezing form ill find him myself she stated as she bounded up the stairs he wasnt in bed alone or otherwise she wasnt entirely sure how she felt about that or what she would have done if shed found him twined around some blonde refusing to think about it she turned on her heel and marched away toward his office with summerset hot on her trail i intend to file a complaint file away she shot back over her shoulder you have no right to intrude on private property in the middle of the night you will not disturb roarke he slapped a hand on the door as she reached it i will not allow it to eves surprise he was out of breath and redfaced his eyes were all but jittering in their sockets it was she decided more emotion than shed believed him capable of this really puts your jocks in a twist doesnt it before he could prevent it she hit the mechanism and the door slid open he made a grab for her and roarke who turned from his study of the city had the curious surprise of watching them grapple put a hand on me again you tightassed son of a bitch and ill deck you she lifted a fist to demonstrate the satisfaction would be worth my badge summerset roarke said mildly i believe she means it leave us alone shes exceeded her authority leave us alone roarke repeated ill deal with this as you wish summerset jerked his starched jacket back into place and strode out with only the slightest of limps if you want to keep me out eve snapped on her march toward the desk youre going to have to do better than that flatassed guard dog roarke merely folded his hands on the desktop if id wanted to keep you out you would no longer be cleared through gate security deliberately he flicked a glance at his watch its a bit late for official interviews im tired of people telling me what time it is well then he leaned back in the chair what can i do for you chapter nine attack was the emotional choice eve could justify it as the logical one as well you were involved with yvonne metcalf as i told you we were friends he opened an antique silver box on the desk and took out a cigarette at one time intimate friends who changed the aspect of your relationship and when who hmmm roarke thought it over as he lighted the cigarette blew out a thin haze of smoke i believe it was a mutual decision her career was rising quickly causing numerous demands on her time and energy you could say we drifted apart you quarreled i dont believe we did yvonne was rarely quarrelsome she found life too amusing would you like a brandy im on duty yes of course you are im not when he rose eve saw the cat spring from his lap galahad examined her with his bicolored eyes before plunking down to wash she was too busy scowling at the cat to note that roarkes hands werent quite steady as he stood at the carved liquor cabinet pouring brandy from decanter to snifter well he said swirling the glass with half the width of the room between them is that all no she thought that was far from all if he wouldnt help her voluntarily she would poke and prod and use his canny brain without mercy and without a qualm the last time youre noted in her diary was a year and a half ago so long roarke murmured he had regret a great deal of it for yvonne but he had his own problems at the moment the biggest of which was standing across the room watching him with turbulent eyes i didnt realize was that the last time you saw her no im sure it wasnt he stared into his brandy remembering her i recall dancing with her at a party last new years eve she came back here with me you slept with her eve said evenly technically no his voice took on a clip of annoyance i had sex with her conversation brunch you resumed your former relationship no he chose a chair and ordered himself to enjoy his brandy and cigarette casually he crossed his feet at the ankles we might have but we were both quite busy with our own projects i didnt hear from her again for six weeks maybe seven and hed brushed her off he recalled casually easily perhaps thoughtlessly i told her i was involved he examined the bright tip of his cigarette at that time i was falling in love with someone else her heartbeat hitched she stared at him jammed her hands in her pockets i cant eliminate you from the list unless you help me cant you well then damn it roarke youre the only one who was involved with both victims and whats my motive lieutenant dont use that tone with me i hate it when you do that cold controlled superior giving up she began to pace i know you didnt have anything to do with the murders and theres no evidence to support your involvement but that doesnt break the link and that makes it difficult for you because your name is in turn linked with mine or was i can handle that then why have you lost weight he demanded why are there shadows under your eyes why do you look so unhappy she yanked out her recorder slapped it on his desk a barrier between them i need you to tell me everything you know about these women every small insignificant detail damn it damn it damn it i need help i have to know why towers would go to the west end in the middle of the night why metcalf would dress herself up and go out to the patio at midnight he tapped out his cigarette then rose slowly youre giving me more credit than i deserve eve i didnt know cicely that well we did business socialized in the most distant of fashions remember my background and her position as to yvonne we were lovers i enjoyed her her energy her zest i know she had ambition she wanted stardom and she earned it deserved it but i cant tell you the minds of either of these women you know people she argued you have a way of getting inside their heads nothing ever surprises you you do he murmured continually she only shook her head tell me why you think yvonne metcalf went out to meet someone on the patio he sipped brandy shrugged for advancement glory excitement love probably in that order she would have dressed carefully because she was vain admirably so the time of the meeting wouldnt have meant anything to her she was impulsive entertainingly so she let out a little breath this was what she needed he could help her see the victims were there other men he was brooding he realized and forced himself to stop she was lovely entertaining bright excellent in bed i imagine there were a great many men in her life jealous men angry men he lifted a brow do you mean someone might have killed her because she wouldnt give him what he wanted needed his eyes stayed steady on hers its a thought a man could do a great deal of damage to a woman for that if he wanted or needed badly enough then again i havent killed you yet this is a murder investigation roarke dont get cute with me cute he stunned them both by flinging the halfempty snifter across the room glass shattered on the wall liquor sprayed you come bursting in here without warning without invitation and expect me to sit cooperatively like a trained dog while you interrogate me you ask me questions about yvonne a woman i cared for and expect me to cheerfully answer them while you imagine me in bed with her shed seen his temper spurt and flash before she usually preferred it to his icy control but at the moment her nerves had shattered along with the glass its not personal and its not an interrogation its a consultation with a useful source im doing my job this has nothing to do with your job and we both know it if theres even a germ of belief in you that i had anything to do with slitting the throats of those two women then ive made even a bigger mistake than id imagined if you want to poke holes in me lieutenant do it on your own time not mine he scooped her recorder off the desk and tossed it to her next time bring a warrant im trying to eliminate you completely havent you done that already he moved back behind his desk and sat wearily get out im done with this she was surprised she didnt stumble on her way to the door the way her heart was pounding and her knees were shaking she fought for breath as she reached for it at the desk roarke cursed himself for a fool and hit the button to engage the locks damn her and damn himself but she wasnt walking out on him he was opening his mouth to speak when she turned inches from the door there was fury on her face now all right goddamn it all right you win im miserable isnt that what you want i cant sleep i cant eat its like somethings broken inside me and i can barely do my job happy now he felt the first tingle of relief loosen the fist around his heart should i be im here arent i im here because i couldnt stay away anymore dragging at the chain under her shirt she strode to him im wearing the damn thing he glanced at the diamond she thrust in his face it flashed at him full of fire and secrets as i said it suits you a lot you know she muttered and swung around it makes me feel like an idiot this whole thing makes me feel like an idiot so fine ill be an idiot ill move in here ill tolerate that insulting robot you call a butler ill wear diamonds just dont she broke covering her face as the sobs took over i cant take this anymore dont for christs sake dont cry im just tired she rocked herself for comfort im just tired thats all call me names he rose shaken and more than a little terrified by the storm of weeping throw something take a swing at me she jerked back when he reached for her dont i need a minute when im making a fool of myself ignoring her he gathered her close she pulled back twice was brought back firmly against him then in a desperate move her arms came around him clutched dont go away she pressed her face to his shoulder dont go away im not going anywhere gently he stroked her back cradled her head was there anything more astounding or more frightening to a man he wondered than a strong woman in tears ive been right here all along i love you eve almost more than i can stand i need you i cant help it i dont want to i know he eased back tucking a hand under her chin to lift her face to his were going to have to deal with it he kissed one wet cheek then the other i really cant do without you you told me to go i locked the door his lips curved a little before they brushed over hers if youd waited a few more hours i would have come to you i was sitting here tonight trying to talk myself out of it and not having any luck then you stalked in i was perilously close to getting on my knees why she touched his face you could have anyone you probably have why he tilted his head thats a tricky one could it be your serenity your quiet manner your flawless fashion sense it did his heart good to see her quick amused grin no i must be thinking of someone else it must be your courage your absolute dedication to balancing scales that restless mind and that sweet corner of your heart that pushes you to care so much about so many thats not me oh but it is you darling eve he touched his lips to hers just as that taste is you the smell the look the sound youve undone me well talk he murmured brushing his thumbs over drying tears well figure out a way to make this work for both of us she drew in a shuddering breath i love you and let it out god the emotion that swept through him was like a summer storm quick violent then clean swamped with it he rested his brow on hers you didnt choke on it i guess not maybe ill get used to it and maybe her stomach wouldnt jump like a pond of frogs next time angling her face up she found his mouth in an instant the kiss was hot greedy and full of edgy need the blood was roaring in her head so loud and fierce she didnt hear herself say the words again but she felt them in the way her heart stuttered and swelled breathless and already wet she tugged at his slacks now right now absolutely now hed dragged her shirt over her head before they hit the floor they rolled groping for each other limbs tangled giddy with hunger she sank her teeth into his shoulder as he yanked down her jeans he had a moment to register the feel of her skin under his hands the shape of her the heat of her then it was a morass of the senses a clash of scents and textures abrading against the urgent need to mate finesse would have to wait as would tenderness the beast clawed at them both devouring even when he was deep inside her pumping wildly he could feel her body clutch and tense heard her long low moan of staggering release and let himself empty heart soul and seed o o she awoke in his bed with soft sunlight creeping through the window filters with her eyes closed she reached out and found the space beside her warm but empty how the hell did i get here she wondered i carried you her eyes sprang open and focused on roarke he sat naked crosslegged at her knees watching her carried me you fell asleep on the floor he leaned over to rub a thumb over her cheek you shouldnt work yourself into exhaustion eve you carried me she said again too groggy to decide if she was embarrassed or not i guess im sorry i missed it we have plenty of time for repeat performances you worry me im fine im just she caught the time on the bedside clock holy christ ten ten a m he used one hand to shove her back when she started to scramble out of bed its sunday sunday completely disoriented now she rubbed her eyes clear i lost track she wasnt on duty she remembered but regardless you needed sleep he said reading her mind and you need fuel something other than caffeine he reached for the glass on the nightstand and held it out eve studied the pale pink liquid dubiously what is it good for you drink it to make sure she did he held the glass to her lips he could have given her the energy booster in pill form but he knew well her dislike for anything resembling drugs its a little something one of my labs has been working on we should have it on the market in about six months her eyes narrowed experimental its quite safe he smiled and set the empty glass aside hardly anyones died haha she sat back again feeling amazingly relaxed amazingly alert i have to go in to cop central do some work on the other cases on my desk you need some time off he held up a hand before she could argue a day even an afternoon id like you to spend it with me but even if you spend it alone you need it i guess i could take a couple of hours she sat up linked her arms around his neck what did you have in mind grinning he rolled her back onto the bed this time there was finesse and there was tenderness o o eve wasnt surprised to find a pile of messages waiting sunday had stopped being a day of rest decades before her message disc beeped along recounting transmissions from nadine furst the arrogant weasel morse another from yvonne metcalfs parents that had her rubbing her temples and a short message from mirina angelini you cant take on their grief eve roarke said from behind her what the metcalfs i can see it in your face im all theyve got to hold onto she initialed the messages to document her receipt they have to know someones looking after her id like to say something eve rolled her eyes prepared for him to lecture her about rest objectivity or professional distance spit it out then so i can get to work ive dealt with a lot of cops in my time evaded them bribed them outmaneuvered them or simply outran them amused she nudged a hip onto the corner of her desk im not sure you should be telling me that your records suspiciously clean of course it is on impulse he kissed the tip of her nose i paid for it she winced really roarke what i dont know cant hurt you the point is he continued blandly ive dealt with a lot of cops over the years youre the best caught completely off guard she blinked well youll stand eve for the dead and the grieving im staggered by you cut it out miserably embarrassed she shifted i mean it you can use that when you call morse back and run up against his irritating whine im not calling him back you initialed the transmissions i zapped his first she smiled oops with a laugh he picked her up off the desk i like your style she indulged herself by combing her fingers through his hair before she tried to wriggle free right now youre cramping it so back off while i see what mirina angelini wants brushing him off she engaged the number waited it was mirina herself who answered her pale tense face onscreen yes oh lieutenant dallas thank you for getting back to me so quickly i was afraid i wouldnt hear from you until tomorrow what can i do for you ms angelini i need to speak with you as soon as possible i dont want to go through the commander lieutenant hes done enough for me and my family is this regarding the investigation yes at least i suppose it is eve signaled to roarke to leave the office he merely leaned against the wall she snarled at him then looked back at the screen ill be happy to meet with you at your convenience thats just it lieutenant its going to have to be at my convenience my doctors dont want me to travel again just now i need you to come to me you want me to come to rome ms angelini even if the department would clear the trip i need something concrete to justify the time and expense ill take you roarke said easily keep quiet who else is there is someone else there mirinas voice trembled roarke is with me eve said between her teeth ms angelini oh thats fine ive been trying to reach him could you come together i realize this is an imposition lieutenant i hesitate to pull strings but i will if necessary the commander will clear it im sure he will eve muttered ill leave as soon as he does ill be in touch she broke transmission the spoiled rich irritate the hell out of me grief and worry dont have economic boundaries roarke said oh shut up she huffed kicked badtemperedly at the desk youll like rome darling roarke said and smiled o o eve did like rome at least she thought she did from the brief blur she caught of it on the zooming trip from the airport to angelinis flat overlooking the spanish steps fountains and traffic and ruins too ancient to be believed from the rear of the private limo eve watched the fashionable pedestrians with a kind of baffled awe sweeping robes were in this season apparently clingy sheer voluminous in colors from the palest white to the deepest bronze jeweled belts hung from waists coordinating with crusted gems on flatsoled shoes and little jeweled bags carried by men and women alike everyone looked like royalty roarke hadnt known she could gawk it pleased him enormously to see that she could forget her mission long enough to stare and wonder it was a shame he thought that they couldnt take a day or two so that he could show her the city the grandeur of it and its impossible continuity he was sorry when the car pulled jerkily to the curb and yanked her back to reality this better be good without waiting for the driver she slammed out of the car when roarke took her elbow to lead her inside the apartment building she turned her head and frowned at him arent you even the least bit annoyed at being summoned across a damn ocean for a conversation darling i often go a great deal farther for less and without such charming company she snorted and had nearly taken out her badge to flash at the security droid before she remembered herself eve dallas and roarke for mirina angelini youre expected eve dallas and roarke the droid glided to a giltbarred elevator and keyed in a code you could get one of those eve nodded toward the droid before the elevators doors closed and ditch summerset summerset has his own charm she snorted again louder yeah you bet the doors slid open into a gold and ivory foyer with a small tinkling fountain in the shape of a mermaid jesus eve whispered scanning the palm trees and paintings i didnt think anybody but you really lived like this welcome to rome randall slade stepped forward thank you for coming please come in mirinas in the sitting room she didnt mention youd be here mr slade we made the decision to call you together biding her time for questions eve walked passed him the sitting room was sided on the front wall in sheer glass oneway glass eve assumed as the building was only six stories high despite the relatively short height it afforded an eyepopping view of the city mirina sat daintily on a curved chair sipping tea from a hand that shook slightly she seemed paler if possible and even more fragile in her trendy robe of ice blue her feet were bare the nails painted to match her robe shed dressed her hair up in a severe knot secured with a jeweled comb eve thought she looked like one of the ancient roman goddesses but her mythology was too sketchy to choose which one mirina didnt rise nor did she smile but set her cup aside to pick up a slim white pot and pour two more i hope youll join me for tea i didnt come for a party ms angelini no but youve come and im grateful here let me do that with a smooth grace that almost masked the way the cups rattled in mirinas hands slade took them from her please sit down he invited we wont keep you any longer than necessary but you might as well be comfortable i dont have any jurisdiction here eve began as she took a cushioned chair with a low back but id like to record this meeting with your permission mirina looked at slade bit her lip yes of course she cleared her throat when eve took out her recorder and set it on the table between them you know about the difficulties randy had several years ago in sector i know eve confirmed i was told you didnt randy told me yesterday mirina reached up blindly and his hand was there youre a strong confident woman lieutenant it may be difficult for you to understand those of us who arent so strong randy didnt tell me before because he was afraid i wouldnt handle it well my nerves she moved her thin shoulders business crises energize me personal crises devastate me the doctors call it an avoidance tendency id rather not face trouble youre delicate slade stated squeezing her hand its nothing to be ashamed of in any case this is something i have to face you were there she said to roarke during the incident i was on the station probably in the casino and the security at the hotel the security randy called they were yours thats right everyone has private security criminal cases are transferred to the magistrate unless they can be dealt with privately you mean through bribes naturally randy could have bribed security he didnt mirina he hushed her with another squeeze of his hand i didnt bribe them because i wasnt thinking clearly enough to bribe them if i had there wouldnt have been a record and we wouldnt be discussing it now the heavy charges were dropped eve pointed out you were given the minimum penalty for the ones that stood and i was assured that the entire matter would remain buried it didnt i prefer something stronger than tea roarke whiskey if you have it two fingers tell them randy mirina whispered while he programmed two whiskeys from the recessed bar he nodded brought roarke his glass then knocked back the contents of his own cicely called me on the night she was murdered eves head jerked up like a hound scenting blood there was no record of that on her link no record of an outgoing call she called from a public phone i dont know where it was just after midnight your time she was agitated angry mr slade you told me in our official interview that you had not had contact with prosecutor towers on that night i lied i was afraid you now choose to recant your earlier statement i wish to revise it without benefit of counsel lieutenant and fully aware of the penalty for giving a false statement during a police investigation im telling you now that she contacted me shortly before she was killed that of course gives me an alibi if you like it would have been very close to impossible for me to have traveled crosscountry and killed her in the amount of time i had you can of course check my transmission records be sure that i will what did she want she asked me if it was true just that at first i was distracted working it took me a moment to realize how upset she was and then when she was more definite to understand she was referring to sector i panicked made some excuses but you couldnt lie to cicely she pinned me to the wall i was angry too and we argued he paused his eyes going to mirina he watched her eve thought as if he waited for her to shatter like glass you argued mr slade eve prompted yes about what had happened why i wanted to know how she had found out about it but she cut me off lieutenant she was furious she told me she was going to deal with it for her daughters sake then she would deal with me she ended transmission abruptly and i settled down to brood and to drink he walked back to mirina laid a hand on her shoulder stroked it was early in the morning just before dawn when i heard the news report and knew she was dead she had never spoken to you about the incident before no we had an excellent relationship she knew about the gambling disapproved but in a mild way she was used to david i dont think she understood how deeply we were both involved she did roarke corrected she asked me to cut you both off ah slade smiled into his empty glass thats why i couldnt get through the door of your place in vegas ii thats why why now eve asked why have you decided to revise your previous statement i felt it was closing in on me i knew how hurt mirina would be if she heard it from someone else i needed to tell her it was her decision to contact you our decision mirina reached for his hand again i cant bring my mother back and i know how it will affect my father when we tell him randy was used to hurt her those are things i have to learn to live with i can do that if i know that whoever used randy and me will pay for it she would never have gone out there she would never have gone but to protect me o o when they were flying west eve paced the comfortable cabin families she tucked her thumbs into her back pockets do you ever think about them roarke occasionally since she was going to talk he switched the business news off his personal monitor if we follow one theory cicely towers went out on that rainy night as a mother someone was threatening her childs happiness she was going to fix it even if she gave slade the heaveho she was going to fix it first thats what we assume is the natural instinct of a parent she slanted him a glance we both know better i wouldnt claim that either of our experiences are the norm eve okay thoughtful she sat on the arm of his chair so if its normal for a mother to jump to shield her child against any trouble towers did exactly as her killer expected he understood her judged her character well perfectly id say she was also a servant of the court it was her duty and certainly should have been her instinct to call the authorities report any threats or blackmail attempts a mothers love is stronger than the law hers was and whoever killed her knew it who knew her her lover her exhusband her son her daughter slade and others eve she was a strong vocal supporter of professional motherhood of family rights there have been dozens of stories about her over the years highlighting her personal commitment to her family thats risking a lot going by press media can be and is biased or it slants a story to suit its own ends i say her killer knew not assumed but knew thered been personal contact or extensive research that hardly narrows the field eve brushed that aside with a flick of the hand and the same goes for metcalf a meetings set but it isnt going to be specifically documented in her diary how does the killer know that because he knows her habits my job is to figure out his or hers because therell be another one youre so sure im sure and mira confirmed it youve spoken to her then restless she rose again he its just easier to say he envies resents is fascinated by powerful women women in the public eye women who make a mark mira thinks the killings may be motivated by control but i wonder maybe thats giving him too much credit maybe its just the thrill the stalking the luring the planning who is he stalking now have you looked in the mirror hmm do you realize how often your face is on the screen in the papers fighting back fear he rose and put his hands on her shoulders and read her face youve thought of it already ive wished for it she corrected because id be ready you terrify me he managed you said i was the best she grinned patted his cheek relax roarke im not going to do anything stupid oh ill sleep easy now how much longer before we land impatient she turned to walk to the viewscreen thirty minutes or so i imagine i need nadine what are you planning eve me oh im planning on getting lots of press she shoveled her fingers through her untidy hair havent you got some ritzy affairs the kind the media just love to cover that we can go to he let out a sigh i suppose i could come up with a few great lets set some up she plopped down in a seat and tapped her fingers on her knee i guess i can even push it to getting a couple of new outfits above and beyond he scooped her up and sat her on his lap but im sticking close lieutenant i dont work with civilians i was talking about the shopping her eyes narrowed as his hand snaked under her shirt is that a dig yes okay she swiveled around to straddle him just checking chapter ten im going to do my leadin first nadine looked around eves office and cocked a brow not much of a sanctum excuse me casually nadine adjusted the angle of eves monitor it squeaked up till now youve guarded this room like holy ground i expected something more than a closet with a desk and a couple of ratty chairs homes where the heart is eve said mildly and leaned back in one of those ratty chairs nadine had never considered herself claustrophobic but the industrial beige walls were awfully close together making her rethink the notion and the single stingy window though undoubtedly blast treated was unshaded and offered a narrow view of an air traffic snarl over a local transport station the little room nadine mused was full of crowds id have thought after you broke the deblass case last winter youd have rated a snazzier office with a real window and maybe a little carpet are you here to decorate or to do a story and your equipments pathetic enjoying herself nadine clucked her tongue over eves work units at the station relics like this would be delegated to some lowlevel drone or more likely kicked to a charity rehab center she would not scowl eve told herself she would not scowl remember that the next time youre tagged for a donation to the police and security fund nadine smiled leaned back on the desk at channel even drones have their own autochef im learning to hate you nadine just trying to get you pumped for the interview you know what id like dallas since youre in the mood for exposure a oneonone an indepth interview with the woman behind the badge the life and loves of eve dallas nypsd the personal side of the public servant eve couldnt stop it she scowled dont push your luck nadine pushing my lucks what i do best nadine dropped down into a chair shifted it hows the angle pete the operator held his palmsized remote up to his face yo petes a man of few words nadine commented just how i like them want to fix your hair eve caught herself before she tunneled her fingers through it she hated being on camera hated it a lot no suit yourself nadine took a small mirrored compact out of her oversized bag patted something under her eyes checked her teeth for lipstick smears okay she dropped the compact back in her bag crossed her legs smoothly with the faintest whisper of silk against silk and turned toward camera roll rolling her face changed eve found it interesting to watch the minute the red light glowed her features became glossier more intense her voice which had been brisk and light slowed and deepened demanding attention this is nadine furst reporting direct from lieutenant eve dallass office in the homicide division of cop central this exclusive interview centers on the violent and as yet unsolved murders of prosecutor cicely towers and awardwinning actor yvonne metcalf lieutenant are these murders linked the evidence indicates that probability we can confirm from the medical examiners report that both victims were killed by the same weapon and by the same hand theres no doubt of that none both women were killed by a thin smoothedged blade nine inches in length tapered from point to hilt the point was honed to a v in both cases the victims were frontally attacked with one swipe of the weapon across the throat from right to left and at a slight angle eve picked up a signature pen from her desk causing nadine to jerk and blink when she slashed it a fraction of an inch from nadines throat like that i see this would have severed the jugular causing instant and dramatic blood loss disabling the victim immediately preventing her from calling for help or defending herself in any way death would have occurred within seconds in other words the killer needed very little time a frontal attack lieutenant doesnt that indicate that the victims knew their attacker not necessarily but there is other evidence that leads to the conclusion that the victims knew their attacker or were expecting to meet someone the absence of any defense wounds for example if i came at you eve thrust out with the pen again and nadine threw a hand in front of her throat you see its automatic defense thats interesting nadine said and had to school her face before it scowled we have the details on the murders themselves but not on the motive behind them or the killer what is it that connects prosecutor towers to yvonne metcalf were investigating several lines of inquiry prosecutor towers was killed three weeks ago lieutenant yet you have no suspects we have no evidence to support an arrest at this time then you do have suspects the investigation is proceeding with all possible speed and motive people kill people ms furst for all manner of reasons theyve done so since we crawled out of the muck biblically speaking nadine put in murder is the oldest crime you could say it has a long tradition we may be able to filter out certain undesirable tendencies through genetics chemical treatments beta scans we deter with penal colonies and the absence of freedom but human nature remains human nature those basic motives for violence that science is unable to filter love hate greed envy anger they separate us from the droids dont they and make us susceptible to joy sorrow and passion thats a debate for the scientists and the intellectuals but which of those motives killed cicely towers and yvonne metcalf a person killed them ms furst his or her purpose remains unknown you have a psychiatric profile of course we do eve confirmed and we will use it and all of the tools at our disposal to find the murderer ill find him eve said deliberately flicking her eyes toward the camera and once the cage door is closed motive wont matter only justice that sounds like a promise lieutenant a personal promise it is the people of new york will depend on you keeping that promise this is nadine furst reporting for channel she waited a beat then nodded not bad dallas not bad at all well run it again at six and eleven with the recap at midnight good take a walk pete the operator shrugged and wandered out of the room off the record eve began how much airtime can you give me for exposure i want plenty of it i figured there was something behind this little gift nadine let out a little breath that was nearly a sigh i have to say im disappointed dallas i never figured you for a camera hound ive got to testify on the mondell case in a couple of hours can you get a camera there sure the mondell case is small ratings but its worth a couple zips she pulled her diary out and noted it ive got this thing tonight too at the new astoria one of those gold plate dinners the astoria dinner ball sure her smile turned derisive i dont work the social beat dallas but i can tell the assignment desk to cue on you you and roarke are always good for the gossip eaters it is you and roarke isnt it ill let you know where you can catch me over the next couple of days eve continued ignoring the insult ill feed you regular updates to air fine nadine rose maybe youll trip over the killer on your way to fame and fortune got an agent yet for a moment eve said nothing just tapped her fingertips together i thought it was your job to fill airtime and guard the publics right to know not to moralize and i thought it was yours to serve and protect not to cash in nadine snagged up her bag by the strap catch you on the screen lieutenant nadine pleased eve tipped back in her chair you left out one of those basic human motives for violence before thrill ill make a note of it nadine wrenched at the door then let it slip out of her hands when she turned back her face was white and shocked under its sheen of camera makeup are you out of your mind youre bait youre fucking bait pissed you off didnt it smiling eve allowed herself the luxury of propping her feet on the desk nadines reaction had brought the reporter up several notches on eves opinion scale thinking about me wanting all that airtime and getting it really steamed you its going to steam him too cant you hear him nadine look at that lousy cop getting all my press nadine came back in and sat down carefully you had me dallas im not about to tell you how to do your job then dont let me see if im figuring this right you deduce the motive was at least partially for the thrill for the attention in the media kill a couple of ordinary citizens you get press sure but not so intense not so complete kill two prominent citizens familiar faces and the skys the limit so you make yourself a target its just a hunch thoughtfully eve scratched a vague itch on her knee it could be that all ill end up with is a lot of idiotic blips of me on screen or a knife at your throat gee nadine im going to start to think you care i think i do she spent a moment studying eves face ive worked with around and through cops for a long time now you get instincts on whos putting in time and who gives a damn you know what worries me dallas you give too much of a damn i carry a badge eve said soberly and made nadine laugh obviously youve been watching too many old videos too well its your neck literally ill see to it that you get it exposed thanks one more thing she added when nadine stood again if this theory has weight then future targets would fall into the wellknown mediahyped female variety keep an eye on your own neck nadine jesus shuddering nadine rubbed fingers over her throat thanks for sharing that dallas my pleasure literally eve had time to chuckle between the time the door closed and the call came through from the commanders office obviously hed heard about the broadcast o o she was still stinging a bit when she bolted up the steps of the courthouse the cameras were there as nadine had promised they were there in the evening at the new astoria when she stepped out of roarkes limo and tried to pretend she was enjoying herself after two days of tripping over a camera every time she took three steps she was surprised she didnt find one zooming over her in bed and she said as much to roarke you asked for it darling she was straddling him in what was left of the threepiece cocktail suit hed chosen for her to wear to the governors mansion the glittering black and gold vest skimmed her hips and was already unbuttoned to her navel i dont have to like it how do you stand it you live with this stuff all the time isnt it creepy you just ignore it he flipped open another button and go on i liked the way you looked tonight idly he toyed with the diamond that hung between her breasts of course im enjoying the way you look right now more im never going to get used to it all the fancy work small talk big hair and i dont fit the clothes either they might not suit the lieutenant but they suit eve you can be both he watched her pupils dilate when he spread his hands over her breasts cupped them you liked the food well sure but she shivered into a moan as he scraped his thumbs over her nipples i think i was trying to make a point i should never talk to you in bed excellent deduction he reared up and replaced his thumbs with his teeth o o she was sleeping deeply dreamlessly when he woke her the cop surfaced first alert and braced what despite being naked she reached for her weapon what is it im sorry when he leaned over the bed to kiss her she could tell from the vibrations of his body that he was laughing its not funny if id been armed youd have been on your ass lucky me absently she shoved at galahad whod decided to sit on her head why are you dressed whats going on ive had a call im needed on freestar one the olympus resort lights dim she ordered and blinked to focus as they highlighted his face god she thought he looked like an angel a fallen one a dangerous one is there a problem apparently nothing that cant be handled roarke picked up the cat himself stroked it then set galahad on the floor but i have to handle it personally it may take a couple of days oh it was because she was groggy she told herself that this awful sense of deflation snuck in well ill see you when you get back he skimmed a finger over the dent in her chin youll miss me maybe some it was his quick smile that defeated her yes here put this on he shoved a robe in her hands theres something i want to show you before i go youre going now the transports waiting it can wait i guess im supposed to come down and kiss you goodbye she muttered as she fumbled into the robe that would be nice but first things first he took her hand and pulled her from the platform to the elevator there isnt any need for you to be uncomfortable here while im gone right he put his hands on her shoulders as the car began to glide eve its your home now im going to be busy anyway she felt the slight shift as the car veered to horizontal mode arent we going all the way down not just yet he slipped an arm around her shoulders when the doors opened it was a room she hadnt seen then again she mused there were probably dozens of rooms shed yet to tour in the labyrinth of the building but it took only one quick glimpse for her to realize it was hers the few things she considered of any value from her apartment were here with new pieces added to fill it out into a pleasant workable space stepping away from roarke she wandered in the floors were wood and smooth and there was a carpet woven in slate blue and mossy green probably from one of his factories in the east her desk battered as it was stood on the priceless wool and held her equipment a frostedglass wall separated a small kitchen area fully equipped that led to a terrace there was more of course with roarke there was always more a communications board would allow her to call up any room in the house the entertainment center offered music video a hologram screen with dozens of visualization options a small indoor garden bloomed riotously below an arching window where dawn was breaking you can replace what you dont like he said as she ran her hand over the soft back of a sleep chair everythings been programmed for your voice and your palm print very efficient she said and cleared her throat very nice surprised to find himself riddled with nerves he tucked his hands in his pockets your work requires your own space i understand that you require your own space and privacy my office is through there the west panel but it locks on either side i see now he felt temper snapping at the nerves if you cant be comfortable in the house while im not here you can barricade yourself in this apartment you can damn well barricade yourself in it while i am here its up to you yes it is she took a deep breath and turned to him you did this for me annoyed he inclined his head there doesnt seem to be much i wouldnt do for you i think thats starting to sink in no one had ever given her anything quite so perfect no one she realized understood her quite so well that makes me a lucky woman doesnt it he opened his mouth bit back something particularly nasty the hell with it he decided i have to go roarke one thing she walked to him well aware he was all but snarling with temper i havent kissed you goodbye she murmured and did so with a thoroughness that rocked him back on his heels thank you before he could speak she kissed him again for always knowing what matters to me youre welcome possessively he ran a hand over her tousled hair miss me i already am dont take any unnecessary chances his hands gripped in her hair hard briefly theres no use asking you not to take the necessary ones then dont her heart stuttered when he kissed her hand safe trip she told him when he stepped into the elevator she was new at it so waited until the doors were almost shut i love you the last thing she saw was the flash of his grin o o what have you got feeney maybe something maybe nothing it was early just eight oclock on the morning after roarke left for freestar one but feeney already looked haggard eve punched two coffees double strength from her autochef youre in here at this hour looking like youve been up all night and in that suit i have to deduce its something and im a goldstar detective yeah ive been noodling the computer going down another level on the families and personal relations of the victims like you wanted and stalling he drank his coffee dug out his bag of candied nuts scratched his ear saw you on the news last night the wife did actually said you looked flash thats one of the kids expressions we try to keep up in that case youre rocking me feeney thats one of the kids expressions too translation youre not coming clear i know what it means shit this one cuts close to home dallas too close which is why youre here instead of transmitting what youve got over a channel so lets have it okay he puffed out a breath i was dicking around with david angelinis records financial stuff mostly we knew he was into some spine twisters for gambling debts hes been holding them off giving them a little trickle here and there could be hes dipped into the company till but i cant get a lock on that hes covered his ass so well uncover it i can get the name of the spine twisters she mused thinking of roarke lets see if he made them any promises like hed be coming into an inheritance her brows knit if it wasnt for metcalf id think hard about somebody he owed hurrying up on the ious by taking out towers might be that simple even with metcalf she had a nice nest egg set aside i havent found anybody among the beneficiaries who needed quick money but that doesnt mean i wont okay you keep working that angle but that isnt why youre here playing with your nuts he nearly managed a laugh cute okay here it is i turned up the commanders wife run that by slow feeney real slow he couldnt sit so he sprang up to pace the small space david angelini made some healthy deposits into his personal credit account four deposits of fifty k over the last four months the final one was keyed in two weeks before his mother got terminated all right he got his hands on two hundred k in four months and banked it like a good boy whered he get it fuck she already knew yeah i accessed the etransactions backtracked she transferred it to his new york bank and he flipped it over into his personal account in milan then he withdraws it in cash hard bills at an autotell on vegas ii jesus christ why didnt she tell me eve pressed her balled fists to her temples why the hell did she make us look for it it wasnt like she tried to hide it feeney said quickly when i clicked over to her records it was all out front she has an account of her own just like the commander he cleared his throat at eves level stare i had to look dallas he hasnt made any unusual transactions out of his or out of their joint but shes cut her principal in half doling out to angelini christ he was bleeding her blackmail eve speculated struggling to think coolly maybe they had an affair maybe she was stuck on the bastard oh man oh jesus feeneys stomach did a long sickening roll the commander i know we have to go to him with this i knew you were going to say that mournfully feeney took a disc out of his pocket i got it all how do you want to play it what i want to do is go out to white plains and knock mrs whitney on her perfect ass barring that we go to the commanders office and lay it out for him theyve still got some of that old body armor down in storage feeney suggested as eve rose good thinking o o they could have used it whitney didnt climb over his desk and body slam them nor did he pull out his stunner he did all the damage necessary with the lethal glare of his eyes you accessed my wifes personal accounts feeney yes sir i did and took this information to lieutenant dallas as per procedure as per procedure whitney repeated now youre bringing it to me to the commanding officer feeney began then drooped oh hell jack was i supposed to bury it you could have come to me first but then whitney trailed off shifted his hard eyes to eves your stand on this lieutenant mrs whitney paid david angelini a sum of two hundred thousand dollars over a fourmonth period this fact was not volunteered during either primary or followup interviews its necessary to the investigation that she broke off we have to know why commander the apology was in her eyes lurking just behind the cop we have to know why the money was paid why there have been no more payments since the death of cicely towers and i have to ask commander as primary if you were aware of the transactions and the reason behind them there was a clutching in his stomach a burning that warned of untreated stress ill answer that after ive spoken with my wife sir eves voice was a quiet plea you know we cant allow you to consult with mrs whitney before we question her this meeting has already risked contaminating the investigation im sorry commander youre not bringing my wife in to interview jack fuck this feeney shes not going to be dragged down here like a criminal he clutched his hands into fists under the desk and struggled to remain in control question her at home with our attorney present that doesnt violate procedure

mentioned you many times captain feeney now she laid a hand over her mothers whats this all about information has just come to light that needs clarification eve took out her recorder offered it to linda for examination she tried not to think that linda favored her father the caramelcolored skin the cool eyes genes and family traits both fascinated and frightened her i take it this is going to be a formal interview with careful calm linda set the recorder on the table and took out her own thats right eve recited the date and time interviewing officer dallas lieutenant eve also present whitney commander jack and feeney captain ryan interviewee whitney anna represented by counsel whitney linda my client is aware of all rights and agrees to this time and place of interview counsel

irritation it was her home after all her family lieutenant dallas already knows the answers im sorry to go over the same ground mrs whitney would you describe your relationship with david angelini david why im his godmother i watched him grow up youre aware that david angelini was in financial distress prior to the death of his mother yes he was her eyes went huge you dont seriously believe that david thats hideous she snapped it out before her mouth compressed into a thin red line im not going to dignify this with an answer i understand you feel protective toward your godson mrs whitney i understand you would go to some lengths to protect him and to some expense two hundred thousand dollars annas face whitened under her careful cosmetics i dont know what you mean mrs whitney do you deny paying to david angelini the sum of two hundred thousand dollars in installments of fifty thousand dollars over a fourmonth period beginning in february of this year and ending in may i she clutched at her daughters hand avoided her husbands do i have to answer that linda a moment please to confer with my client briskly linda scooped an arm around her mother and led her into the next room youre very good lieutenant whitney said tightly its been some time since i observed one of your interviews jack feeney sighed hurting for everyone shes doing her job yes she is its what shes best at he looked over as his wife came back into the room she was pale trembling a little the burning in his gut flared well continue linda said there was a warrior glint in her eye when she focused on eve my client wishes to make a statement go ahead mom its all right im sorry tears starred on her lashes jack im sorry i couldnt help it he was in trouble i know what you said but i couldnt help it its all right resigned he took the hand that reached out for his and stood beside her tell the lieutenant the truth and well deal with it i gave him the money did he threaten you mrs whitney what shock seemed to dry up the tears swimming in her eyes oh my goodness of course he didnt threaten me he was in trouble she repeated as if that should be enough for anyone he owed a very great deal of money to the wrong kind of people his business that portion of his fathers business that he oversaw was in some temporary upheaval and he had a new project he was trying to get off the ground he explained it she added with a wave of her free hand i dont remember precisely i dont bother overmuch with business mrs whitney you gave him four payments of fifty thousand you didnt relay this information to me in our other interviews what business of yours was it her spine was back snapped hard and cold so that she sat like a statue it was my money and a personal loan to my godchild a godchild eve said with straining patience who was being questioned in a murder investigation his mothers murder you might as well accuse me of killing her as david you didnt inherit a sizable portion of her estate now you listen to me anger suited her annas face glowed as she leaned forward that boy adored his mother and she him he was devastated by her death i know i sat with him i comforted him you gave him two hundred thousand dollars it was my money to do with as i chose she bit her lip no one would help him his parents refused theyd agreed to refuse this time i spoke with cicely about it months ago she was a wonderful mother and she loved her children but she was a very strong believer in discipline she was determined that he had to handle his problem on his own without her help without mine but when he came to me desperate what was i to do what was i to do she demanded turning to her husband jack i know you told me to stay out of it but he was terrified afraid they would cripple him even kill him what if it had been linda or steven wouldnt you have wanted someone to help anna feeding his problem isnt help he was going to pay me back she insisted he wasnt going to gamble with it he promised he only needed to buy some time i couldnt turn him away lieutenant dallas linda began my client lent her own money to a family member in good faith there is no crime in that your client hasnt been charged with a crime counselor did you in any of your previous interviews ask my client directly about disposition of funds did you ask my client if she had any financial dealings with david angelini no i did not then she is not required to volunteer such information which would appear to be personal and unconnected to your investigation to the best of her knowledge shes a cops wife eve said wearily her knowledge ought to be better than most mrs whitney did cicely towers argue with her son over money over his gambling over his debts and the settlement thereof she was upset naturally they argued families argue they dont hurt each other maybe not in your cozy little world eve thought your last contact with angelini a week ago he called to make sure i was all right that jack was all right we discussed plans for setting up a memorial scholarship fund in his mothers name his idea lieutenant she said with swimming eyes he wanted her to be remembered what can you tell me about his relationship with yvonne metcalf the actress annas eyes went blank before she dabbed at them did he know her he never mentioned it it had been a shot in the dark and hadnt found a target thank you eve picked up her recorder logged in the end of the interview counselor you should advise your client that it would be in her best interest not to mention this interview or any portion of it to anyone outside this room im a cops wife anna neatly tossed eves words back in her face i understand the drill the last glimpse eve had of the commander as she stepped outside he was holding his wife and daughter o o eve wanted a drink by the time shed logged out for the day she had spent the better part of the afternoon chasing after david angelinis tail he was in a meeting he was out of contact he was anywhere but where she looked without any other choice shed left messages at every possible point on the planet and figured shed be lucky to hear from him before the following day meanwhile she was faced with an enormous empty house and a butler who hated the air she breathed the impulse struck as she zipped through the gates she grabbed her car link and ordered maviss number your night off right she asked the instant maviss face blipped on screen you bet gotta rest those vocal chords plans nothing that cant be tossed out for better what do you have in mind roarkes off planet you want to come over here and hang stay over get drunk hang at roarkes stay over at roarkes get drunk at roarkes im on my way wait wait lets do it up big ill send a car for you a limo mavis forgot her vocal chords and squealed jesus dallas make sure the driver wears like a uniform the people in my building will be hanging out the windows with their eyes popped out fifteen minutes eve broke transmission and all but danced up the steps to the door summerset was there just as expected and she sent him a haughty nod shed been practicing im having a friend over for the evening send a car and driver to avenue c a friend his voice was ripe with suspicion thats right summerset she glided up the stairs a very good very close friend be sure and tell the cook therell be two for dinner she managed to get out of earshot before doubling over with laughter summerset was expecting a tryst she was sure but it was going to be even more of a scandal when he got a load of mavis o o mavis didnt disappoint her though for mavis she was conservatively dressed her hair de jour was rather tame a glittery gold fashioned in what was called a halfswing one glistening side curved to her ear while the other half skimmed her shoulder shed only worn perhaps a half dozen varied earrings and all in her ears a distinguished look for mavis freestone she stepped out of a torrential spring downpour handing a speechless summerset her transparent cloak strung with tiny lights and turned three circles more eve thought in awe of the hallway than to show off her skinhugging red body suit wow my thoughts exactly eve said shed hovered near the hallway waiting not wanting mavis to face summerset alone the strategy was obviously unnecessary as the usually disdainful butler was struck dumb its just mag mavis said in reverent tones really mag and youve got the whole digs to yourself eve sent summerset a cool sidelong glance just about decent with a flutter of inchlong lashes mavis held out a hand with interlinking hearts tattooed on the back and you must be summerset ive heard so much about you summerset took the hand so staggered he nearly lifted it to his lips before he remembered himself madam he said stiffly oh you just call me mavis great place to work huh you must get a hard charge out of it unsure if he was appalled or enchanted summerset stepped back managed a half bow and disappeared down the hall with her dripping cloak a man of few words mavis winked giggled then clattered down the hall on sixinch inflatable platforms and let out a sensual groan at the first doorway youve got a real fireplace a couple dozen of them i think jesus do you do it in front of the fire like in the old flicks ill leave that up to your imagination i can imagine good christ dallas that car you sent a real limo a classic it just had to be raining she whirled back sending her earrings dancing only about half the people i wanted to impress saw me what are we going to do first we can eat im starving but ive got to see the place first show me something eve pondered the roof terrace was incredible but it was raining furiously the weapon room was out as was the target range eve considered those areas off limits to guests without roarkes presence there was plenty more of course dubiously eve studied maviss shoes can you really walk in those theyre air glided i hardly know ive got them on all right then well take the stairs youll see more that way she took mavis to the solarium first amused by her friends droppedjaw reaction to the exotic plants and trees the sparkling waterfalls and chattering birds the curved glass wall was battered with rain but through it the lights of new york gleamed in the music room eve programmed a trash band and let mavis entertain her with a glassshattering short set of current favorites they spent an hour in the game room competing with the computer each other and hologram opponents at free zone and apocalypse mavis did a lot of oohing and aahing over the bedrooms and finally chose the suite for her overnight stay i can have a fire if i want mavis ran a possessive hand over the rich lapis lazuli of the hearth sure but it is nearly june i dont care if i roast arms out she took long swinging steps over the floor gazed up through the sky dome and plopped down on the lakesized bed with its thick silver cushions i feel like a queen no no an empress she rolled over and over while the floating mattress undulated beneath her how do you stay normal in a place like this i dont know i havent lived here very long still rolling lavishly from one side of the air cushions to the other mavis laughed it would only take me one night im never going to be the same scooting up to the padded headboard she punched buttons lights flickered on and off revolved sparkled music throbbed pulsed water began to run in the next room whats that you programmed your bath eve informed her oops not yet mavis flicked it off tried another and had the panel on the far wall sliding open to reveal a tenfoot video screen definitely decent wanna eat o o while eve settled in the dining room with mavis enjoying her first full evening off in weeks nadine furst scowled over the editing of her next broadcast i want to enhance that freeze on dallas she ordered the tech yeah yeah bring her up she looks damn good on camera sitting back she studied the five screens while the tech worked the panel editing room one was quiet but for the murmuring clash of voices from the screen for nadine putting images together seamlessly was as exciting as sex the majority of broadcasters left the process to their techs but nadine wanted her hand in here everywhere in the newsroom one level down it would be bedlam she enjoyed that too the scurry to beat the competition to the latest sound bite the latest picture the most immediate angle reporters manning their links for one more quote bumping their computers for that last bit of data the competition wasnt all outside on broadcast avenue there was plenty of it right in the channel newsroom everybody wanted the big story the big picture the big ratings right now she had it all and nadine didnt intend to lose it there hold it there when im standing on metcalfs patio yeah now try a split screen use the shot of me on the sidewalk where towers bought it umhmm eyes narrowed she studied the image she looked good she decided dignified sobereyed our intrepid clearsighted reporter revisiting the scenes of the crimes okay she folded her hands and rested her chin on them cue in the voiceover two women talented dedicated innocent two lives brutally ended the city reels looks over its shoulder and asks why loving families mourn bury their dead and ask for justice there is one person working to answer that question to meet that demand freeze nadine ordered bleed to dallas exterior courtroom shot bring up audio eves image filled the screens full length with nadine beside her that was good nadine thought the visual lent the impression they were a team working together couldnt hurt there had been the faintest of breezes ruffling their hair behind them the courthouse speared up a monument to justice its elevators busily gliding up and down its glass walkway crowded with people my job is to find a killer and i take my job seriously when i finish mine the courts begin theirs perfect nadine fisted her hand oh yes just perfect fade it there and ill pick it up on live time three fortyfive louise im a genius and youre not so bad yourself print it printed louise swiveled away from the console and stretched theyd worked together for three years and were friends its a good piece nadine damn right it is nadine angled her head but okay louise released her stubby ponytail and ran a hand through her thick dark curls were getting close to retreading here weve had nothing new in a couple of days neither has anybody else and ive got dallas and thats a big one louise was a pretty woman softfeatured brighteyed shed come to channel direct from college after less than a month on the job nadine had scooped her up as her main tech the arrangement suited them both shes got a solid visual and an excellent throat the roarke factor adds a gold edge thats not including the fact shes got a rep as a good cop so so im thinking continued louise until you get some new bites on this you might want to splice in some of the business from the deblass case remind people our lieutenant broke one of the big ones took a hit in the line of duty build up confidence i dont want to take the focus off the current investigation maybe you do louise disagreed at least until theres a new lead or a new victim nadine grinned a little more blood would heat things up another couple of days well be out of the sweeps and into the june doldrums okay ill keep it in mind you might want to put something together louise cocked a brow i might and if i use it you get full onair credit you greedy bitch deal louise tapped the pocket of her editing vest winced out of smokes youve got to stop that you know how the brass feel about employees taking health risks im sticking with the herb shit shits right get me a couple while youre at it nadine had the grace to look sheepish and keep it to yourself theyre tougher on the onair talent than you techs youve got some time before the midnight recap arent you going to take your break no ive got a couple of calls to make besides its pouring out nadine patted her perfectly coiffed hair you go she reached into her bag ill pay good deal since i have to go all the way to second to find a store thats licensed to sell smokes resigned she rose im using your raincoat go ahead nadine passed her a handful of credits just put my share in the pocket okay ill be in the newsroom they walked out together with louise bundling into the stylish blue coat nice material sheds water like a duck they crossed the rampway passed a series of editing and production rooms and walked toward a descending people glide noise began to filter through so nadine pitched her voice over it are you and bongo still thinking of taking the big step thinking hard enough that weve started looking at apartments were going the traditional route well give living together a try for a year if it works well make it legal better you than me nadine said with feeling i cant think of a single reason why a rational person would lock themselves to another rational person love louise put a dramatic hand to her heart it makes reason and rationality fly out the old window youre young and free louise and if im lucky im going to be old and chained to bongo who the hell wants to be chained to anybody named bongo nadine muttered me catch you later with a quick salute louise continued on the descent while nadine stepped off toward the newsroom and thinking of bongo louise wondered if shed be able to get home before one a m it was their night at her place that was a little inconvenience that would end once they found one suitable apartment rather than shifting back and forth between his rooms and hers idly she glanced over at one of the many monitors lining the walls playing channel s current broadcast right now it was a popular sitcom a dead medium that had been revived over the past couple years by talent such as yvonne metcalfs louise shook her head over that thought then chuckled a little as the lifesized actor on screen mugged outrageously for the viewing audience nadine might have been married to the news but louise liked sheer entertainment she looked forward to those rare evenings when she and bongo could cuddle up in front of the screen in channel s wide lobby there were more monitors security stations and a pleasant sitting area ringed with holograms of the stations stars and of course a gift shop stocked with souvenir tshirts hats signed mugs and holograms of the stations biggest stars twice a day between the hours of ten and four tours were guided through the station louise had taken one herself as a child had gawked with the best of them and had she remembered with a smug smile decided then and there on her career she waved to the guard at the front entrance detoured to the east end which was the shortest route to second at the side door for employees she passed her palm over the handplate to deactivate the lock as the door swung open she winced at the heavy sound of drumming rain she almost changed her mind was one sneaky smoke worth a twoblock sprint through the cold and damp damn right she thought and flipped up the hood the good expensive raincoat would keep her dry enough and shed been stuck in editing with nadine for more than an hour hunching her shoulders she bolted outside the wind kicked so that she broke her stride just long enough to secure the coat at the waist her shoes were soaked before she reached the bottom of the steps and looking down at them she swore under her breath well shit they were the last words she spoke a movement caught her attention and she looked up blinking once to clear the rain from her eyes she never saw the knife already in an arching slash glint wetly in the rain then slice viciously across her throat the killer studied her for only a moment watched the blood fountain the body collapse like a puppet cut from its strings there was shock then anger then a quick jittering fear the gored knife hurried back into a deep pocket before the darkly clad figure ran off into the shadows o o i think i could live like this after a meal of rare montana beef accented with lobsters harvested from icelandic waters washed down with french champagne mavis lounged in the lush indoor lagoon off the solarium she yawned blissfully naked and just a little drunk you are living like this sort of not quite as freespirited as mavis eve wore a snug onepiece tank suit shed cozied herself on a smooth seat made of stone and was still drinking she hadnt allowed herself to relax to this extent in too long to remember i dont really have a lot of time for this part of it make time babe mavis submerged popped up again perfect round breasts gleaming in the showy blue lights shed programmed lazily she paddled over to a water lily gave a sniff christ this is the real thing do you know what youve got here dallas indoor swimming what youve got mavis began as she frog kicked her way over to the float that held her glass is a grade one fantasy the kind you cant get from the topline vr goggles she took a long sip of icy champagne youre not going to get all weirded out and blow it are you what are you talking about i know you youll pick it apart question everything analyze noting eves glass was empty mavis did the honors well im telling you pal dont i dont pick things apart youre the champion picked pick it part damn it pick it aparter whew try saying that five times fast when your tongues numb she used a bare hip to nudge eve over and squeezed in next to her hes crazy about you isnt he eve jerked her shoulders and drank hes rich i mean mag rich gorgeous as a god and that body what dyou know about his body i got eyes i use em ive got a pretty good idea of what he looks like naked amused by the glint in eves eyes mavis licked her lips of course any time you want to fill in the missing details im here for you what a pal thats me anyway hes all that stuff then theres that power trip hes got all that power sort of shoots out from him she highlighted the statement by splashing up water and he looks at you like he could eat you alive in big greedy bites shit im getting hot keep your hands off me mavis snorted maybe ill go seduce summerset i dont think he has a dick bet i could find out but she was just too lazy at the moment youre in love with him arent you summerset ive had a hell of a time controlling myself around him look me dead in the eye come on to ensure obedience mavis snagged eves chin swiveled until they were face to face glassy eye to glassy eye youre in love with roarke it looks that way i dont want to think about it good dont always said you thought too damn much holding the glass over her head mavis pushed off into the lagoon can we use the jets sure impaired with wine eve fumbled a bit for the correct control once the water started to bubble and spew mavis let out a laughing moan christ jesus who needs a man when youve got one of these come on eve bump up the music lets party obliging eve doubled the volume on the controls so that the music screamed off the walls and water the rolling stones maviss favorite classic artists wailed lounged back eve laughed as mavis improvised dance steps and started to send the server droid after another bottle i beg your pardon huh blearyeyed eve studied the glossy black shoes at the lip of the lagoon slowly and with mild curiosity she let her gaze travel up the smokecolored pipestemmed pants the short stiff jacket and into summersets stony face hey you wanna take a little dip come on in summerset water lapped around maviss waist and dripped cheerfully from her classy breasts as she waved the more the merrier he sniffed his lips curled sheer habit had the words dropping out of his mouth like knifeedged ice cubes but his gaze kept wandering back to maviss swirling body theres a transmission for you lieutenant apparently you were unable to hear my attempts to inform you what okay okay she sniggered paddled toward the link set in the side of the lagoon is it roarke it is not it affronted his dignity to shout but it would have offended his pride to order the music lower it is dispatch from cop central even as eve reached for the link she stopped swore then slicked the hair back from her face music off she snapped and had mick and his pals echoing into silence mavis stay out of video range please eve sucked in a deep breath then opened the link dallas dispatch dallas lieutenant eve voice print verified report immediately to broadcast avenue channel confirmed homicide code yellow eves blood ran cold her fingers gripped on the edge of the pool victims name that information is not cleared for transmission at this time confirm receipt of orders dallas lieutenant eve confirmed eta twenty minutes request feeney captain edd on scene request verified dispatch out oh god oh god weak with guilt and liquor eve laid her head on the edge of the pool i fucking killed her stop it mavis swam over laid a hand on eves shoulder cut it out eve she said briskly he took the wrong bait the wrong bait mavis and shes dead it was supposed to be me i said stop it confused by the words but not by the sentiment mavis pulled her back and gave eve a quick shake snap out of it dallas helpless eve pressed a hand to her spinning head oh my christ im drunk thats perfect i can fix that ive got some sober up in my bag at eves moan mavis gave her another shake i know you hate pills but theyll clean the alcohol out of your bloodstream in ten minutes flat come on well get some into you fine dandy ill be sober when i have to look at her she started up the steps slipped was surprised to find her arm taken firmly lieutenant summersets voice was still cool but he held out a towel and helped her up onto the stone skirt of the pool ill see that your cars ready yeah thanks chapter twelve maviss handy antidote worked like a charm eve had a foul taste in the back of her throat but she was stonecold sober when she reached channel s sleek silver building it had been constructed in the midtwenties when the media boom had hit such astronomical proportions as to generate more profits than a small country one of the loftier buildings on broadcast avenue it towered up from a wide flat hilt housed several thousand employees five elaborate studios including the most lavish new set on the east coast and enough power to beam transmissions to every pocket of the planet and its orbiting stations the east wing where eve was directed faced third with its tony mutiplexes and apartment buildings designed for the convenience of the broadcast industry due to the thick air traffic eve realized word had already hit control was going to be a problem even as she rounded the building she called dispatch and requested air barricades as well as ground security a homicide right in the lap of the media was going to be hard enough to deal with without the vultures flying steady now she locked away guilt and stepped from her car to approach the scene the uniforms had been busy she saw with some relief theyd cleared the area and had the outside door sealed off reporters and their teams were there naturally there would be no keeping them away but shed have room to breathe shed already attached her badge to her jacket and moved through the rain to the portatarp some wise soul had tossed over the crime scene raindrops pinged musically against the strong clear plastic she recognized the raincoat dealt viciously with the quick instinctive lurch of her stomach she asked if the immediate scene had been scanned and recorded and receiving the affirmative crouched down her hands were rock steady as they reached for the hood that had fallen forward over the victims face she ignored the blood that pooled in a sticky puddle at the toes of her boots and managed to smother the gasp and the shudder as she tossed the hood away from a strangers face who the hell is this she demanded victims been preliminarily identified as louise kirski editorial tech for channel the uniform pulled a log out of the pocket of her slick black raincoat she was found at approximately eleven fifteen by c j morse he tossed his cookies just over there she went on with light disdain for civilian delicacy went inside through this door screaming his head off building security verified his story such as it was called it in dispatch logged the call at eleven twentytwo i arrived on scene at eleven twentyseven you made good time officer peabody lieutenant i was on a swing of first avenue i verified homicide secured the outer door called for additional uniforms and a primary eve nodded toward the building they get any of this on camera sir peabodys mouth thinned i ordered a news team off scene when i arrived id say they got plenty before we secured okay with fingertips encased in clear seal eve did a search of the body a few credits a little jingling change a pricey mini link attached to the belt no defense wounds no signs of struggle or assault she recorded it all dutifully her mind working fast yes she recognized the raincoat she thought and her initial exam complete she straightened im going in im expecting captain feeney pass him through she can go with the me yes sir you stand peabody eve decided the cop had a good firm style keep those reporters in line eve glanced over her shoulder ignoring the shouted questions the glint of lenses give no comment no statement ive got nothing to say to them good keep it that way eve unsealed the door passed through resealed it the lobby was nearly empty peabody or someone like her had cleared it of all but essential personnel eve shot a look at the security behind the main console c j morse where his stations on level six section eight some of your people took him up that way im expecting another cop send him after me eve turned and stepped onto the ascent there were people here and there some huddled together others standing against video backdrops talking furiously to cameras she caught the scent of coffee the stale justburned fragrance so similar to a cops bull pen another time it might have made her smile the noise level was climbing even as she did she stepped off on level six into the frantic buzz of the newsroom consoles were set back to back with traffic areas snaking through like police work broadcasting was a twentyfourhour business even at this hour there were more than a dozen stations manned the difference eve noted was that cops looked overworked rumpled even sweaty this crew was video perfect clothes were streamlined jewelry camera friendly faces carefully polished everyone seemed to have a job to do some were talking quickly to their link screens feeding their satellites updates eve imagined others barked at their computers or were barked at by them as data was requested accessed and transmitted to the desired source it all looked perfectly normal except mixed with the stale scent of bad coffee was the sticky odor of fear one or two noticed her started to rise questions in their eyes her brutally cold stare was as effective as a steel shield she turned to the wall where screens hugged against each other roarke had a similar setup and she knew each screen could be used for a separate image or in any combination now the wall was filled with a huge picture of nadine furst on the news set the familiar threedimensional view of new yorks skyline rose behind her she too looked polished perfect her eyes seemed to meet and hold on eves as eve stepped closer to listen to the audio and again tonight a senseless killing louise kirski an employee of this station was murdered only a few steps away from the building where i am now broadcasting this report eve didnt bother to curse as nadine added a few more details and segued to morse shed expected this an ordinary evening morse said in a clear reporters voice a rainy night in the city but once again despite the best offered by our police force murder happens this reporter is now able to give you a firsthand view of the horror the shock and the waste he paused timing perfect as the camera zoomed in on his face i found louise kirskis body crumpled bleeding at the bottom of the steps of this building where both she and i have worked many nights her throat had been slashed her blood pouring out on the wet pavement im not ashamed to say that i froze that i was revolted that the smell of death clogged in my lungs i stood looking down at her unable to believe what i saw with my own eyes how could this be a woman i knew a woman who i had often shared a friendly word with a woman i had occasionally had the privilege of working with how could she be lying there lifeless the screen dissolved from his pale serious face to a gruesomely graphic shot of the body they hadnt missed a beat eve thought in disgust and whirled on the closest manned console wheres the studio excuse me i said wheres the goddamn studio she jerked a thumb toward the screen well ah furious she leaned over caged him between her stiffened arms you want to see how fast i can shut this place down level twelve studio a she whirled away just as feeney stepped off the ascent took your sweet time hey i was in new jersey visiting my folks he didnt bother to ask but fell into step with her i need a gag on the broadcast well he scratched his head as they headed up we can probably finagle an order to confiscate the pictures of the scene he moved his shoulders at eves glance i caught some of it on the screen in the car on the way here theyll get it back but we can hang them up for a few hours anyway get to work on it i need all the data available on the victim they should have records here thats simple enough feed them to my office will you feeney ill be on my way there shortly no problem anything else eve stepped off scowled at the thick white doors of studio a i might need some backup in here thatd be my pleasure the doors were locked the on air sign glowing eve struggled with a desperate urge to draw her weapon and blow the security panel apart instead she jabbed the emergency button and waited for response channel news now in progress live came the soothing electronic voice what is the nature of your problem police emergency she held her id up to the small scanner one moment lieutenant dallas while your request is accessed its not a request eve said evenly i want these doors open now or ill be forced to break in under code b subsection j there was a quiet hum an electronic hiss as if the computer were considering then expressing annoyance clearing doors please remain quiet and do not pass the white line thank you inside the studio the temperature dropped ten degrees eve stalked directly toward a glass partition facing the set and rapped hard enough to have the news director go white with worry he held a desperate finger to his lips eve held up her badge with obvious reluctance he clicked open the door and gestured them in were live he snapped and turned back to his view of the set camera three on nadine back image of louise mark the robotics on set obeyed smoothly eve watched the small suspended camera shift on the control monitor louise kirski smiled cheerily slow down nadine dont rush it c j ready in ten go to commercial eve told him were running without ads on this broadcast go to commercial she repeated or youre going to go to black he screwed up his forehead puffed out his chest now listen here you listen she poked him none too gently in that expanded chest youve got my eyewitness out there you do what youre told or your competitors are going to have ratings through the roof with the story im going to give them on how channel interfered with a police investigation on the murder of one of its own people she lifted a brow while he considered and maybe im going to start to think you look like a suspect he strike you as the coldblooded killer type feeney i was just thinking that maybe we need to take him in have a nice long chat after a strip search just hold on hold on he wiped a hand across his mouth what could a quick ninetysecond commercial break hurt go to zippy spot in ten c j wind it up cue music camera one pan back mark he let out a long breath im calling legal on this you do that eve stepped out of the booth and stalked to the long black console morse and nadine shared weve got a right to im going to tell you all about your rights eve interrupted morse youve got a right to call your lawyer and have him meet you at cop central he went dead white youre arresting me jesus christ are you nuts youre a witness asshole and youre not going to make any further statements until youve made one to me officially she flicked a scathing gaze in nadines direction youll just have to muddle through the rest on your own i want to go with you on shaky legs nadine rose to dispense with the frantic shouts from the control booth she tugged her earpiece free and tossed it down i was probably the last person to speak to her fine well talk about that eve led them out pausing only to grin nastily toward control you could fill in with some old reruns of nypd blue its a classic o o well well c j however miserable she was eve could appreciate the moment ive finally got you where i want you comfy he looked a little green around the gills but managed to sneer as he took a long scan of the interview room you guys could use a decorator were trying to work that into the budget she settled back at the single table in the room record she requested june jeez where did may go subject c j morse position interview room c interview conducted by dallas lieutenant eve re homicide victim louise kirski time oh oh fortyfive mr morse youve been advised of your rights do you want your attorney present during this interview he reached for his glass of water and took a sip am i being charged with anything not at this time then get on with it take me back c j tell me exactly what happened fine he drank again as if his throat was parched i was coming into the station i had the coanchor on the midnight report what time did you arrive about quarter after eleven i went to the east side entrance most of us use that end because its more direct to the newsroom it was raining so i made a quick dash from the car i saw something at the base of the steps i couldnt tell what it was at first he stopped speaking covered his face with his hands and rubbed hard i couldnt tell he continued until i was practically on top of her i thought i dont know what i thought really somebody took a hell of a spill you didnt recognize the victim the the hood he gestured vaguely helplessly with his hands it was over her face i reached down and i started to move it away from her face he gave one violent shudder then i saw the blood her throat the blood he repeated and covered his eyes did you touch the body no i dont think no she was just lying there and her throat was wide open her eyes no i didnt touch her he dropped his hand again made what appeared to be a herculean effort for control i got sick you probably dont understand that dallas some people have basic human reactions all that blood her eyes god i got sick and i got scared and i ran inside the guard on the desk i told him you knew the victim sure i knew her louise had edited a few pieces for me mostly she worked with nadine but she did some pieces for me and for some others she was good real good quick a sharp eye one of the best christ he reached for the pitcher on the table water sloshed as he poured it there was no reason to kill her no reason at all was it her habit to go out that exit at that time i dont know i dont think she should have been in editing he said fiercely were you close personally his head came up and his eyes narrowed youre trying to pin this on me arent you youd really like that just answer the questions c j were you involved with her she had a relationship talked about some guy named bongo we worked together dallas thats all you arrived at channel at eleven fifteen before that before that i was at home when i have the midnight shift i catch a couple hours sleep i didnt have a feature running so i didnt have much prep it was supposed to be just a read a recap of the day i had dinner with some friends about seven headed home around eight and took a nap he propped his elbows on the table and lowered his head into his hands i had my wakeup at ten then headed out just before eleven gave myself a little extra travel time because of the weather jesus jesus jesus if eve hadnt watched him report on camera minutes after his discovery of the body she might have felt sorry for him did you see anyone at or near the scene just louise theres not a lot of people going in and out that time of night i didnt see anybody just louise just louise okay c j thats about it this time around he set down the glass hed guzzled from again i can go keep in mind youre a witness if youre holding back or if you remember anything not revealed in this interview ill charge you with withholding evidence and impeding an investigation she smiled pleasantly oh and give me the names of your friends c j i didnt think you had any she let him go and brooded while she waited for nadine to be brought in the scenario was all too clear and the guilt came with it to keep both fresh she flipped open the file and studied the hard copy photos of louise kirskis body she turned them facedown when the door opened nadine didnt look polished now the professional gloss of the onair personality had given way to a pale shaken woman with swollen eyes and a trembling mouth saying nothing eve gestured to the chair and poured water in a fresh glass you were quick she said coolly getting your report on the air thats my job nadine didnt touch the glass but gripped her hands in her lap you do yours i do mine right just serving the public arent we im not very interested in what you think of me right now dallas just as well because i dont think very much of you right now for the second time she started the recorder fed in the necessary information when did you last see louise kirski alive we were working in editing refining and timing a piece for the midnight spot it didnt take as much time as wed scheduled to finish louise was good really good nadine drew a deep breath and continued to stare at a spot an inch above eves left shoulder we talked for a few minutes she and the man shed been seeing for the last several months were looking for an apartment together she was happy louise was a happy person easy to get along with bright she had to stop again had to her breath was backing up carefully firmly she ordered herself to inhale exhale twice anyway she was out of cigarettes she liked to catch a quick smoke between assignments everybody looked the other way even though shed sneak off into a closet somewhere and light up i told her to pick me up a couple while she was at it gave her some credits we went down together and i got off at the newsroom i had some calls to make otherwise id have gone with her id have been with her did you usually go out together before the broadcast no normally i take a short break head out have a quiet cup of coffee in this little cafe on third i like to get away from the station especially before the midnight weve got a restaurant lounges a coffee shop in house but i like to break off and take ten on my own habitually yeah nadine met eves eyes veered away habitually but i wanted to make those calls and it was raining so so i didnt go i lent her my raincoat and she went out her eyes shifted back straight to eves and were devastated shes dead instead of me you know that and i know that dont we dallas i recognized your coat eve said briefly i thought it was you she didnt do anything but run out for a few cigarettes wrong place wrong time wrong coat wrong bait eve thought but didnt say it lets take this a step at a time nadine an editor has a certain amount of power of control no slowly methodically nadine shook her head the sickness in her stomach had snuck into her throat and tasted foul its the story dallas and the onair personality nobody appreciates or even thinks of an editor but the reporter she wasnt the target dallas lets not pretend otherwise what i think and what i know are handled in different ways nadine but lets go with what i think for now i think you were the target and i think the killer mistook louise for you youve got different builds but it was raining she was wearing your coat had the hood on there either wasnt time or there wasnt a choice once the mistake was realized what dazed at having it all said so flatly nadine struggled to focus what did you say it was over quickly ive got the time she left from the security desk she waved to the guard weve got morse stumbling over her ten minutes later either it was timed extremely well or our killer was cocky and you can bet your ass he wanted to see it on the news before shed gotten cold we accommodated him didnt we yeah eve nodded you did you think it was easy for me nadines voice raspy and thick burst out you think it was easy to sit there and give a report knowing she was still lying outside i dont know eve said mildly was it she was my friend nadine began to weep tears rushing out pouring down her cheeks and leaving trails in her camera makeup i cared about her damn it she mattered to me not just a story she isnt just a fucking story struggling to carry her own guilt eve nudged the glass toward nadine drink she ordered take a minute nadine had to use both hands to keep the glass even partially steady she would she realized have preferred brandy but that would have to wait i see this kind of thing all the time not so different from you you saw the body eve snapped you went out on the scene i had to see with eyes still swimming she looked back at eve that was personal dallas i had to see i didnt want to believe it when word came up how did word come up somebody heard morse yelling to the guard that somebody was dead that somebody had been murdered right outside that drew a lot of attention she said rubbing her temples word travels i hadnt finished my second call before i caught the buzz i hung up on my source and went down and i saw her her smile was grim and humorless i beat the cameras and the cops and you and your pals risked contaminating a crime scene eve swiped a hand through the air thats done did anybody touch her did you see anybody touch her no nobody was that stupid it was obvious she was dead you could see you could see the wound the blood we sent for an ambulance anyway the first police unit was there within minutes ordered us back inside sealed the door i talked to somebody peabody she rubbed fingers over her temples not because they hurt because they were numb i told her it was louise then i went up to prep for broadcast and the whole time i was thinking it was supposed to be me i was alive facing the camera and she was dead it was supposed to be me it wasnt supposed to be anyone we killed her dallas nadines voice was steady again you and me i guess well have to live with that eve drew a breath and leaned forward lets go over the timing again nadine step by step chapter thirteen sometimes eve thought the drudge of routine police work payed off like a slot machine fed habitually mindlessly monotonously so that youre almost shocked when the jackpot falls in your lap thats just the way it was when david angelini fell into hers shed had several questions on small details of the kirski case the timing was one of them nadine skips her usual break kirksi goes out instead passing the lobby desk at approximately she steps out into the rain and into a knife minutes later running late morse arrives at the station lot stumbles over the body vomits and runs inside to report a murder all of it she mused quick fast and in a hurry as a matter of course she ran the discs from the security gate at channel it wasnt possible to know if the killer had driven through them parked a car on the stations lot strolled over to wait for nadine sliced louise by mistake then driven off again an assailant could just as easily have cut across the property from third on foot just as louise had intended to do gate security was to make sure that there were parking facilities for station employees and that guests werent infringed upon by every frustrated driver looking for a place to stick his car or minishuttle off the street eve reviewed the discs because it was a matter of routine and because she admitted to herself she hoped morses story wouldnt gel hed have recognized nadines raincoat and hed have known her habit of cutting out for some solo time before the midnight broadcast there was nothing shed have enjoyed more on a basic even primal personal level than nailing his skinny butt to the wall and thats when she saw the sleek little twopassenger italian model cruise like a shiny cat to the gate shed seen that car before parked outside of the commanders home after the memorial service stop she ordered and the image on screen froze enhance sector twentythree through thirty full screen the machine clicked then clunked wobbling the image with an impatient snarl eve smacked the screen with the heel of her hand jarring it back on course goddamn budget cuts she muttered and then her smile began slow and savoring well well mr angelini she took a deep breath as davids face filled her screen he looked impatient she thought distracted nervous what were you doing there she murmured flicking her glance down to the digital time frozen at the bottom left corner at twentythree oh two and five seconds she leaned back in her chair rifling through a drawer with one hand as she continued to study the screen absently she bit into a candy bar that was going to pass for breakfast shed yet to go home hard copy she ordered then go back to original view and hard copy she waited patiently while her machine wheezed its way through the process continue disc run normal speed nibbling on her breakfast she watched the pricey sports car whiz past camera range the image blinked channel could afford the latest in motionactivated security cameras eleven minutes had passed on the counter when morses car approached interesting she murmured copy disc transfer copy to file k kirski louise homicide cross reference to case file t towers cicely and m metcalf yvonne homicides turning from the screen she engaged her link feeney dallas he stuffed the last of a danish into his mouth im working on it christ its barely seven a m i know what time it is ive got a sensitive matter here feeney hell his already rumpled face grew more wrinkles i hate when you say that ive got david angelini on the gate security disc at channel coming in about ten minutes before louise kirskis body was discovered shit shit shit whos going to tell the commander i am after ive had a talk with angelini i need you to cover for me feeney im going to transmit what ive got excluding angelini you take it in to the commander tell him im hooking a couple hours of personal time yeah like hell buy that one feeney tell me i need some sleep tell me youll report to the commander and to go home and catch a couple hours of sleep feeney heaved a long sigh dallas you need some sleep ill report to the commander go home and catch a couple hours now you can tell him you told me she said and flicked off o o like routine police work a cops gut often paid off eves told her that david angelini would close himself in with family her first stop was the angelini piedaterre cozied in an affluent east side neighborhood here the brownstones had been constructed barely thirty years before reproductions of those designed during the nineteenth and destroyed during the dawn of the twentyfirst when most of new yorks infrastructure had failed a large portion of new yorks posher homes in this area had been condemned and razed after much debate this area had been rebuilt in the old tradition a tradition only the very wealthy had been able to afford after a tenminute search eve managed to find a spot among the expensive european and american cars overhead a trio of private minishuttles jockeyed for air space circling as they looked for a clear landing apparently public transportation wasnt high on the list in the neighborhood and property was too dear to waste on garage facilities still new york was new york and she locked the doors on her battered police issue before heading up the sidewalk she watched a teenager skim by on an airboard he took the opportunity to impress his small audience with a few complicated maneuvers ending with a long looping flip rather than disappoint him eve flashed him an appreciative grin nice moves i got the groove he claimed in a voice that was hovering between puberty and manhood with less security than he hovered over the sidewalk you board no too risky for me when she continued to walk he circled around her pivoting on the board with quick footwork i could show you some of the easy scoots in five minutes ill keep it in mind you know who lives there in twentyone twentyone sure mr angelini youre not one of his nibbles she stopped im not come on the boy cocked a grin showing perfect teeth he goes for the dignified type older too he did a quick vertical rock side to side you dont look like a domestic either anyway he mostly does the droid thing for that does he have a lot of nibbles only seen a few around here always come up in a private car sometimes theyll stay till morning but mostly not and how would you know he grinned unabashed i live right over there he pointed to a townhouse across the street i like to keep my eye on whats doing okay why dont you tell me if anybody came around last night he swiveled his board spun how come cause im a cop his eyes widened as he studied her badge wow decent hey you think he popped his old lady gotta keep up with current events and shit for school this isnt a quiz were you keeping your eye out last night whats your name its barry i was kind of hanging loose last night watching some screen listening to some tune supposed to be studying for this monster final in comp tech why arent you in school today hey youre not with the truant division his grin turned a little nervous its too early for class anyway i got the threeday thing eschool at home okay last night while i was hanging i saw mr angelini go out about eight i guess then late probably closing on midnight this other dude flash car pulls up he didnt get out for awhile just kinda sat there like he couldnt make up his mind barry did a quick whirlaloop dancing up the length of the board then he went in walking funny i figured hed been dousing a few went right on in so he knew the code didnt see mr angelini come back i was probably zeeing by then you know catching winks sleeping yeah i get it did you see anybody leave this morning nope but the flash cars still there i see thanks hey he scooted behind her is being a cop a rocking thing sometimes it rocks sometimes it doesnt she climbed the short steps to the angelini home and identified herself to the cool tones of the greeting scanner im sorry lieutenant there is no one at home if you would like to leave a message it will be returned at the first opportunity eve looked directly at the scanner process this if theres no one at home im going to walk back to my car request an entry and search warrant that should take about ten minutes she stood her ground and waited less than two before david angelini opened the door lieutenant mr angelini here or cop central your choice come in he stepped back i just arrived in new york last night im still a bit disorganized this morning he led her into a darktoned highceilinged sitting room and offered her coffee politely which she declined with equal politeness he wore the slim narrow cuffed slacks shed seen on the streets of rome with a widesleeved silk shirt of the same neutral cream color his shoes matched the tone and looked soft enough to dent with a fingertip but his eyes were restless and his hands tapped rhythmically on the arms of his chair when he sat you have more information about my mothers case you know why im here he flicked his tongue over his lips shifted eve thought she understood why he did so poorly at gaming excuse me she set her recorder on the table in full view david angelini your rights are as follows you are under no obligation to make a statement if you do make a statement it will be logged into record and can and will be used against you in court or any legal proceeding you have a right to the presence and advice of an attorney or representative she continued the brisk recitation of his rights while his breathing quickened and grew more audible the charges you are not yet charged do you understand your rights of course i understand them do you wish to call your attorney his mouth opened a breath shuddered out not yet i assume youre going to make the purpose of this interrogation clear lieutenant i think its going to be crystal mr angelini where were you between the hours of eleven p m may and twelve a m june i told you id just gotten into the city i drove in from the airport and came here you came here directly from the airport thats right i had a late meeting but i i canceled it he flicked open the top hook of his shirt as if he needed air rescheduled it what time did you arrive at the airport my flight got in around tenthirty i believe you came here ive said so yes you did eve angled her head and youre a liar a bad liar you sweat when you bluff aware of the damp line running down his back he rose his voice tried for outrage but ended on fear i believe ill contact my attorney after all lieutenant and your superior is it standard police procedure to harass innocent people in their own homes whatever works she murmured then again youre not innocent go ahead and call your attorney and well all go down to cop central but he didnt move toward his link i havent done anything for starters youve lied on record to an investigating officer call your attorney wait wait rubbing a hand over his mouth david paced the room it isnt necessary it isnt necessary to take this that far thats your choice would you care to revise your previous statement this is a delicate matter lieutenant funny ive always thought of murder as a crude matter myself he continued to pace working his hands together you have to understand the business is in a tenuous position at the moment the wrong kind of publicity will influence certain transactions in a week two at the most it will all be resolved and you think i should hold off on all this until you get your financial ducks in a row id be willing to compensate you for your time and your discretion would you eve widened her eyes what sort of compensation are you suggesting mr angelini i can swing ten thousand he struggled for a smile double that if you simply bury all of this for good eve crossed her arms let the record show that david angelini offered a monetary bribe to investigating primary lieutenant eve dallas and the aforesaid bribe was refused bitch he said softly you bet why were you at channel last night ive never said i was lets cut the dreck you were recorded by gate security entering the property to emphasize she opened her bag took out the hard copy of his face tossed it on the table gate security his legs seemed to fold from under him and he groped into a chair i never thought never considered i panicked slicing someones jugular can do that to you i never touched her i never went near her good god do i look like a murderer they come in all styles you were there i have documentation hands she said sharply as her own jumped to her shoulder harness keep your hands out of your pockets name of god do you think im carrying a knife slowly he drew out a handkerchief wiped his brow i didnt even know louise kirski but you know her name i saw it on the news he closed his eyes i saw it on the news and i saw him kill her the muscles in eves shoulders bunched but unlike david she was good at the game both her face and voice were bland well then why dont you tell me all about it he worked his hands together again linking fingers twisting he wore two rings one diamond one ruby both set in heavy gold they clinked together musically you have to keep my name out of this no she said evenly i dont i dont make deals your mother was a pa mr angelini you should know if there are going to be any deals theyre going to come through that office not me youve already lied on the record she kept her tone flat easy it was best when working with a nervous suspect to ease them in im giving you a chance to revise your previous statement and again reminding you that you have the right to contact your attorney at any time during this interview but if you want to talk to me talk now and ill start to make it easy for you what were you doing at channel last night i had a late meeting i told you that i had one and canceled thats the truth weve been ive been working on an expansion deal angelini has some interest in the entertainment industry weve been developing projects programs features for inhome viewing carlson young the head of the entertainment division of the channel had done quite a bit to bring these projects to fruition i was to meet him in his office there a little after business hours wasnt it the entertainment field doesnt have what you might call normal business hours both of our schedules were tight and this was a time that suited us both why not handle it over the link a great deal of our business was done that way but we both felt it was time for a personal meeting wed hoped still hope to have the first project on air by fall we have the script he continued almost talking to himself now the production teams in place weve already signed some of the cast so you had a late night meeting with carlson young of channel yes the weather held me up a bit i was running late his head came up i called him from my car you can check that too you can check i called him a few minutes before eleven when i realized i would be late well check everything mr angelini count on it i arrived at the main gate i was distracted thinking of of some casting problems i turned i should have gone straight to the main entrance but i was thinking of something else i stopped the car realized id have to backtrack then i saw he used his handkerchief rubbed at his mouth i saw someone come out of a door then there was someone else he must have been standing there watching waiting he moved so fast it all moved so fast she turned and i saw her face just for a second i saw her face in the light his hand jerked up fast very fast and dear god the blood it gushed like a fountain i didnt understand i couldnt believe it just spurted out of her she fell and he was running running away what did you do i i just sat there i dont know how long i was driving away i dont even remember i was driving and everything was like a dream the rain and the lights from other cars then i was here i cant even remember how i got here but i was outside in the car i called young and told him id been delayed again that we needed to reschedule i came inside there was no one here i took a sedative and went to bed eve let the silence hum a moment lets see if ive got this you were on your way to a meeting took a wrong turn and saw a woman brutally murdered then you drove away canceled your meeting and went to bed is that accurate yes yes i suppose it is it didnt occur to you to get out of your car to see if she could be helped or perhaps to use your link to notify the authorities the mts i wasnt thinking i was shaken you were shaken so you came here took a pill and went to bed thats what i said he snapped out i need a drink with sweaty fingers he fumbled for a control vodka he ordered bring the bottle eve let him stew until the server droid arrived with a bottle of stoli and a short thick glass on its tray she let him drink there was nothing i could do he mumbled goaded as shed intended by her silence i wasnt involved your mother was murdered a few weeks ago by the method youve just described to me and this didnt involve you that was part of the problem he poured again drank again shuddered i was shocked and and afraid violence isnt part of my life lieutenant it was part of my mothers a part i could never understand she understood violence he said quietly she understood it and did you resent that mr angelini that she understood violence was strong enough to face it fight against it his breathing was shallow i loved my mother when i saw this other woman murdered as my mother had been murdered all i could think of to do was run he paused took a last quick swallow of vodka do you think i dont know youve been checking on me asking questions digging into my personal and professional lives im a suspect already how much worse would it have been for me to be there right there at the scene of another murder eve rose youre about to find out chapter fourteen eve questioned him again in the less comforting surroundings of interview room c hed finally taken up his right for counsel and three pinstriped coldeyed lawyers ranged beside their client at the conference table eve had privately dubbed them moe larry and curly moe apparently was in charge she was a toughvoiced woman with a severe bowlcut hairstyle that had inspired eve to christen her her associates said little but looked sober and occasionally made importantlooking notations on the yellow legal pads that lawyers never seemed to tire of now and again curly his wide forehead creased would tap a few buttons on his log book and murmur conspiratorially in larrys ear lieutenant dallas moe folded her hands which were tipped with wicked looking inchlong scarlet nails on the table my client is eager to cooperate he wasnt eve stated as youve seen for yourself from the first interview after recanting his original story your client admitted to leaving the scene of a crime and failing to report said crime to the proper authorities moe sighed it was a windy disappointed sound you can of course charge mr angelini with those lapses we will in turn claim diminished capacity shock and the emotional trauma of his mothers recent murder this would all be a waste of the courts time and the taxpayers dollar i havent charged your client with those lapses as yet were dealing with a larger theme here curly scribbled something tilted his pad for larry to read the two of them murmured together and looked grave you have confirmed my clients appointment at channel yeah he had an appointment which he canceled at eleven thirtyfive odd that his diminished capacity and his emotional trauma eased off enough for him to take care of business before moe could speak again eve turned and pinned angelini with one hard stare you know nadine furst i know who she is ive seen her on the news he hesitated leaned over to consult moe after a moment he nodded id met her a few times socially and spoke with her briefly after my mothers death eve already knew all of that and circled her quarry im sure youve seen her reports youd have a vested interest as shes been covering the recent murders your mothers murder lieutenant what does my clients interest in the news coverage of his mothers death have to do with the murder of ms kirski im wondering you have seen nadine fursts reports over the last couple weeks mr angelini of course hed recovered enough to sneer youve gotten a lot of airtime out of it lieutenant does that bother you i think its appalling that a public servant paid by the city would seek notoriety through tragedy sounds like it pissed you off eve said with an easy shrug ms furst has been getting plenty of notoriety out of it too one learns to expect someone like her to use someone elses pain for her own advancement you didnt like the coverage lieutenant moe said with her patience obviously straining wheres the point in this this isnt a trial yet i dont need a point were you annoyed by the coverage mr angelini angry i he broke off at a sharp look from moe i come from a prominent family he said more carefully were accustomed to such things if we could get back to the business at hand moe requested this is the business at hand louise kirski was wearing nadine fursts raincoat when she was killed you know what i think mr angelini i think the killer hit the wrong target i think he was waiting for nadine and louise just happened to choose the wrong time to go out in the rain for cigarettes it doesnt have anything to do with me his eyes darted toward his attorneys it still doesnt have anything to do with me i saw it thats all you said it was a man what did he look like i dont know i didnt see him clearly his back was to me it happened so fast but you saw enough to know it was a man i assumed he broke off struggling to control his breathing while moe whispered in his ear it was raining he began i was several meters away in my car you said you saw the victims face the light she turned her head toward the light when he or when the killer went toward her and this killer who might have been a man and who came out of nowhere was he tall short old young i dont know it was dark you said there was light just that circle of light hed been in the shadows he was wearing black david said on a burst of inspiration a long black coat and a hat a hat that drooped down low thats convenient he was wearing black its so original lieutenant i cant advise my client to continue to cooperate if you persist in sarcasm your clients in hip deep my sarcasms the least of his worries weve got the three big ones means motive opportunity you have nothing but my clients admission that he witnessed a crime further moe went on tapping those dangerous nails on the conference table you have absolutely nothing to link him with the other murders what youve got lieutenant is a maniac on the loose and a desperate need to appease your superiors and the public with an arrest its not going to be my client well have to see about that now her communicator beeped twice a signal from feeney her adrenaline surged and she masked it with a bland smile excuse me ill only be a moment she stepped out of the room into the hallway behind her through the oneway glass a huddle was in progress give me good news feeney i want to nail this son of a bitch good news feeney rubbed his chin well you might like this yvonne metcalf was in negotiations with our pal in there covert negotiations for the lead in some flick it was all on the q t because her contract for tune in was coming up i finally pinned her agent down if she snagged the part she was willing to ditch the sitcom but they were going to have to up the ante guarantee a threefeature deal international distribution and twenty hours straight promo sounds like she wanted a lot she was squeezing him some my take from what the agent said is he needed metcalf to guarantee some of the financial backing but they wanted a chunk on the front end he was scrambling to come up with it and save his project he knew her and she had the controls according to the agent he came in to meet metcalf personally several times they had a couple of teteatetes at her apartment he got a little hot but metcalf laughed it off she was banking that hed come around i love when it falls into place dont you she turned studying angelini through the glass weve got a connection feeney he knew them all he was supposed to be on the coast when metcalf got whacked how much do you want to bet hes got a private plane you know something ive learned since roarke feeney flight plans dont mean squat if youve got money and your own transpo no unless he comes up with ten witnesses who were kissing his ass when metcalf went down ive got him watch him sweat she muttered as she swung back into the interview room she sat crossed her arms on the table and met angelinis eyes you knew yvonne metcalf i off balance david reached up tugged at the collar of his shirt certainly i everyone did you had business with her met her personally youd been to her apartment this was obviously news to moe who bared her teeth tossed up a hand one moment lieutenant id like to speak to my client privately all right obliging eve rose outside she watched the show through the glass and thought it a pity that the law prevented her from turning on the audio still she could see moe fire questions at david and could gauge his stuttering responses while larry and curly looked grim and scribbled furiously on their pads moe shook her head at one of davids answers stabbed him with one of her lethal red nails eve was smiling when moe lifted a hand and signaled her back into the room my client is prepared to state that he was acquainted with yvonne metcalf on a professional level uhhuh this time eve leaned a hip on the table yvonne metcalf was giving you some grief wasnt she mr angelini we were in negotiations his hands linked together again twisted its standard for the talent side of a project to demand the moon we were coming to terms you met her in her apartment argued we i we had meetings at several locations her home was one of them we discussed terms and options where were you mr angelini on the night yvonne metcalf was murdered id have to check my diary he said with surprising control but i believe i was in new los angeles the planet hollywood complex i stay there whenever im in town and where might you have been between oh seven and midnight west coast time i couldnt say youre going to want to say mr angelini most likely in my room i had a great deal of business to see to the script needed reworking the script you were tailoring for ms metcalf yes actually and you were working alone i prefer to be alone when i write i wrote the script you see he flushed a little the color rising from the collar of his shirt i put a great deal of time and effort into preparing it you keep a plane a plane naturally the way i travel i was your plane in new los angeles yes i his eyes went wide and blank as he realized the implication you cant seriously believe this david sit down moe said firmly when he lurched to his feet you have nothing more to say at this time she thinks i killed them thats insane my own mother for gods sake what reason what possible reason could there be for that oh ive got a few ideas on that well see if the shrink agrees with me my client is under no obligation to submit to psychiatric testing i think youre going to advise him to do just that this interview moe said in snippy tones is terminated fine eve straightened enjoyed the moment when her eyes met davids david angelini youre under arrest you are charged with leaving the scene of a crime obstruction of justice and attempted bribery of a police officer he lunged at her going ironically eve thought for the throat she waited until his hands had closed over it his eyes bulging with fury before she knocked him down ignoring the snapping orders of his attorney eve leaned over him we wont bother with adding assaulting an officer and resisting arrest i dont think were going to need it book him she snapped at the uniforms who had charged the door nice work dallas feeney congratulated as they watched david being led away lets hope the pas office thinks so enough to block bail we have to hold him and sweat him i want him on murder one feeney i want him bad were close to it kid we need the physical evidence we need the damn weapon blood the souvenirs miras psychiatric will help but i cant bump up the charges without some physical impatient she consulted her watch shouldnt take too long to get a search warrant even with the lawyers trying to block how long you been up he wondered i can count the circles under your eyes long enough that another couple of hours wont matter how about i buy you a drink while we wait for the warrant he put a paternal hand on her shoulder i think were both going to need one the commander got wind of it he wants us dallas now she dug a finger along the center of her brow lets get it together then and make it two drinks after were done o o whitney didnt waste time the moment eve and feeney stepped into his office he scalded them both with one long look you brought david in to interview i did yes sir eve took an extra step forward to take the heat we have video of him on the gate security at channel at the time of louise kirskis murder she didnt pause but streamed through her report her voice brisk her eyes level david says he saw the murder he claims he saw someone possibly male in a long black coat and a hat attack kirski then run toward third and he panicked whitney added still in control his hands were quiet on his desk left the scene without reporting the incident whitney may have been cursing inwardly his stomach might have been in greasy knots of tension but his eyes were cool hard and steady its not an atypical reaction from a witness to a violent crime he denied he was on scene eve said calmly tried to cover offered a bribe he had the opportunity commander and hes linked to all three victims he knew metcalf was working with her on a project had been to her apartment whitneys only reaction was to curl his fingers then uncurl them motive lieutenant money first she said hes having financial difficulties that will be eased after his mothers will is probated the victims or in the third case the intended victim were all strong women in the public eye were all in some manner causing him distress unless his lawyers try to block it doctor mira will test him determine his emotional and mental state the probability factor of his aptitude toward violence she thought of the press of his hands around her throat and figured the probability was going to be nice and high he wasnt in new york for the first two murders sir she felt a bolt of pity but suppressed it he has a private plane he can shuttle anywhere he likes its pathetically simple to doctor flight plans i cant book him for the murders yet but i want him held until we gather more evidence youre holding him on leaving the scene and the bribery charge its a good arrest commander im requesting search warrants when we find any physical evidence if whitney interrupted he rose now no longer able to sit behind his desk thats a very big difference dallas without physical evidence your murder case cant hold which is why he has yet to be charged for murder she laid a hard copy on his desk she and feeney had taken the time to swing past her office and use her computer for the probability ratio he knew the first two victims and nadine furst had contact with them was on the scene of the last murder we suspect that towers was covering for someone when she zapped the last call on her link she would have covered for her son and their relationship was strained due to his gambling problem and her refusal to bail him out with known data the probability factor of guilt is eightythree point one percent you havent taken into account that hes incapable of that kind of violence whitney laid his hands on the edge of his desk and leaned forward you didnt factor that in to the mix did you lieutenant i know david angelini dallas i know him as well as i know my own children he isnt a killer hes a fool perhaps hes weak perhaps but he isnt a coldblooded killer sometimes the weak and the foolish strike out commander im sorry i cant kick him loose do you have any idea what it would do to a man like him to be penned to know hes suspected of killing his own mother there was no choice left for him in whitneys mind but a plea i cant deny that he was spoiled his father wanted the best for him and for mirina and saw that they got it from childhood he was accustomed to asking for something and having it fall into his lap yes his life has been easy privileged even indulgent hes made mistakes errors in judgment and theyve been fixed for him but theres no malice in him dallas no violence i know him whitneys voice didnt rise but it reverberated with emotion youll never convince me that david took a knife and ripped it across his mothers throat im asking you to consider that and to delay the paperwork on the yellow sheet and recommend his release on his own recognizance feeney started to speak but eve shook her head he may have outranked her but she was primary she was in charge three women are dead commander we have a suspect in custody i cant do what youre asking you put me on as primary because you knew i wouldnt he turned and stared hard out of the window compassions not your strong suit is it dallas she winced but said nothing thats a wrong swing jack feeney said with heat and if youre going to take one at her then youll have to take one at me cause im with dallas on this weve got enough to book him on the small shit to take him off the street and thats what were doing youll ruin him whitney turned back but thats not your problem you get your warrants and you do your search but as your commanding officer im ordering you to keep the case open you keep looking have your reports on my desk by fourteen hundred he flicked a last glance at dallas youre dismissed she walked out surprised that her legs felt like glass the thin fragile kind that could be shattered with a careless brush of the hand he was out of line dallas feeney said catching at her arm hes hurting and he took a bad shot at you not so bad her voice was rough and raw compassions not my strong suit is it i dont know shit about family ties and loyalties do i uncomfortable feeney shifted his feet come on dallas you dont want to take it personal dont i hes stood behind me plenty of times now hes asking me to stand behind him and i have to say sorry no chance thats pretty fucking personal feeney she shook off his hand lets take a rain check on the drinks im not feeling sociable at a loss feeney dumped his hands in his pockets eve strode off in one direction the commander remained behind closed doors in the other feeney stood unhappily between them o o eve supervised the search of marco angelinis brownstone personally she wasnt needed there the sweepers knew their job and their equipment was as good as the budget allowed still she sprayed her hands coated her boots and moved through the threestory home looking for anything that would tie up the case or thinking of whitneys face break it marco angelini remained on the premises that was his right as owner of the property and as the father of the prime suspect eve blocked out his presence the cold azure eyes that followed her moves the haggard look to his face the quick muscle twitch in his jaw one of the sweepers did a thorough check of davids wardrobe with a portasensor looking for bloodstains while he worked eve meticulously searched the rest of the room coulda ditched the weapon the sweeper commented he was an old bucktoothed vet nicknamed beaver he traced the sensor the arm of it wrapped over his left shoulder down a thousanddollar sport coat he used the same one on all three women eve answered speaking more to herself than beaver the lab confirms it why would he ditch it now maybe he was done the sensor switched from its muted hum to a quick beep just a little salad oil beaver announced extra virgin olive spotted his pretty tie maybe he was done beaver said again he admired detectives had once had ambitions to become one the closest hed managed to get was as a field tech but he read every detective story available on disc see threes like a magic number an important number his eyes sharpened behind his tinted glasses as the treated lenses picked up a minute spot of talc on a cuff he moved on warming to the theme so this guy see he fixes on three women women he knows sees all the time on the screen maybe hes hot for them the first victim was his mother hey beaver paused long enough to swivel a look toward eve you never heard of oedipus that greek guy you know had the hots for his mama anyhow he does the three then ditches the weapon and the clothes he was wearing when he did them this guys got enough clothes for six people anyway frowning eve walked over to the spacious closet scanned the automatic racks the motorized shelves he doesnt even live here dudes rich right to beaver that explained everything hes got a couple suits in here aint never been worn shoes too he reached down picked up one of a pair of leather half boots turned them over nothing see he skimmed the sensor over the unscuffed bottom no dirt no dust no sidewalk scrapes no fibers that only makes him guilty of selfindulgence goddamn it beaver get me some blood im working on it probably tossed what he was wearing though youre a real optimist beaver in disgust she turned toward a ushaped lacquered desk and began to rifle through the drawers the discs she would bag and run through her own computer they could get lucky and find some correspondence between david angelini and his mother or metcalf or luckier yet she mused and find some rambling confessional diary that described the murders where the hell had he put the umbrella she wondered the shoe she wondered if the sweepers in n l a or the ones in europe were having any better luck the thought of backtracking and searching all the cozy little homes and luxury hideaways of david angelini was giving her a bad case of indigestion then she found the knife it was so simple open the middle drawer of the work console and there it was long slim and lethal it had a fancy handle carved out of what might have been genuine ivory which would have made it an antique or an international crime harvesting ivory or purchasing it in any form had been outlawed planetwide for more than half a century after the near extinction of african elephants eve wasnt an antique buff nor was she an expert on environmental crime but shed studied forensics enough to know that the shape and length of the blade were right well well her indigestion was gone like a bad guest in its place was the clear clean high of success maybe three wasnt his magic number after all he kept it son of a bitch disappointed in the foolishness of a murderer beaver shook his head guys an idiot scan it she ordered crossing to him beaver shifted the bulk of the scanner changed the program from clothing after a quick adjustment of his lenses he ran the funnel of the arm up the knife the scanner beeped helpfully got some shit on it beaver muttered his thick fingertips playing over controls like a concert pianists over keys fiber maybe paper some kind of adhesive prints on the handle want a hard copy of em yeah kay the scanner spit out a square of paper dotted with fingerprints turn her over and bingo theres your blood not much of it he frowned skimming the funnel along the edge of the blade going to be lucky if its enough for typing much less dna you keep that positive outlook beaver how olds the blood come on lieutenant behind the sensor lenses his eyes were huge and cynical you know i cant give you that from one of the portables gotta take it in all this little girl does is identify no skin he announced be better if you had some skin ill take the blood as she sealed the knife into evidence a movement caught her eyes she looked up and into the dark damning eyes of marco angelini he glanced down at the knife then back into her face something moved across his something wrenching that had the muscle jerking in his jaw id like a moment of your time lieutenant dallas i cant give you much more than that it wont take long his eyes flicked to beaver then back to the knife as dallas slipped it into her bag in private please all right she nodded to the uniform who stood at angelinis shoulder tell one of the team to come up and finish the handson search in here she ordered beaver then followed angelini out of the room he turned toward a set of narrow carpeted steps his hand trailing along a glossy banister as he climbed at the top he shifted right and stepped into a room an office eve discovered sunwashed now in the brilliant afternoon light beamed and glinted off the surfaces of communication equipment struck and bounced from the smooth semicircular console of sober black flashed and pooled on the surface of the gleaming floor as if annoyed with the strength of the sunlight angelini hit a switch that had the windows tinted to a soft amber now the room had shadows around pale gold edges angelini walked directly to a wall unit and ordered a bourbon on the rocks he held the square glass in his hand took one careful sip you believe my son murdered his mother and two other women your son has been questioned on those charges mr angelini he is a suspect if you have any questions about the procedure you should speak with his counsel ive spoken with them he took another sip they believe theres a good chance you will charge him but that he wont be indicted thats up to the grand jury but you think he will mr angelini if and when i have arrested your son and charged him with three counts of firstdegree murder it will be because i believe he will be indicted tried and convicted on those charges and that i have the evidence to ensure that conviction he looked at her field bag where shed put some of that evidence ive done some research on you lieutenant dallas have you i like to know the odds he said with a humorless smile that came and went in a blink commander whitney respects you and i respect him my former wife admired your tenacity and your thoroughness and she was not a fool she spoke of you did you know that no i didnt she was impressed by your mind a clean cops mind she called it youre good at your job arent you lieutenant yeah im good at it but you make mistakes i try to keep them to a minimum a mistake in your profession however minimal can cause incredible pain to the innocent his eyes stayed on hers relentlessly you found a knife in my sons room i cant discuss that with you he rarely uses this house angelini said carefully three or four times a year perhaps he prefers the long island estate when hes in the area that may be mr angelini but he used this house on the night louise kirski was killed impatient now eager to get the evidence to the lab eve moved a shoulder mr angelini i cant debate the states case with you but youre very confident that the state has a good case he interrupted when she didnt answer he took another long study of her face then he finished the drink in one swallow set the glass aside but youre wrong lieutenant youve got the wrong man you believe in your sons innocence mr angelini i understand that not believe lieutenant know my son didnt kill those women he took a breath like a diver about to plunge under the surface i did chapter fifteen eve had no choice she took him in and grilled him after a full hour she had a vicious headache and the calm unshakable statement from marco angelini that he had killed three women he refused counsel and refused to or was unable to elaborate each time eve asked him why he had killed he stared straight into her eyes and claimed it had been impulse hed been annoyed with his wife he stated personally embarrassed by her continued intimacy with a business partner hed killed her because he couldnt have her back then hed gotten a taste for it it was all very simple and to eves mind very rehearsed she could picture him repeating and refining the lines in his head before he spoke them this is bullshit she said abruptly and pushed back from the conference table you didnt kill anybody i say i did his voice was eerily calm you have my confession on record then tell me again leaning forward she slapped her hands on the table why did you ask your wife to meet you at the five moons i wanted it to happen somewhere out of our milieu i thought i could get away with it you see i told her there was trouble with randy she didnt know the full problem of his gambling i did so of course she came and you slit her throat yes his skin whitened slightly it was very quick what did you do then i went home how he blinked i drove id parked my car a couple of blocks away what about the blood she peered into his eyes watching his pupils thered have been a lot of it shed have gushed all over you the pupils dilated but his voice remained steady i was wearing a top coat rain resistant i discarded it along the way he smiled a little i imagine some itinerant found it and made use of it what did you take from the scene the knife of course nothing of hers she waited a beat nothing to make it look like a robbery a mugging he hesitated she could almost see his mind working behind his eyes i was shaken i hadnt expected it to be so unpleasant i had planned to take her bag the jewelry but i forgot and just ran you ran taking nothing but were smart enough to ditch your bloodsplattered coat thats right then you went after metcalf she was an impulse i kept dreaming about what it had been like and i wanted to do it again she was easy his breathing leveled and his hands lay still on the table she was ambitious and rather naive i knew david had written a screenplay with her in mind he was determined to complete this entertainment project it was something we disagreed over it annoyed me and it would have cost the company resources that are at the moment a bit strained i decided to kill her and i contacted her of course she agreed to meet me what was she wearing wearing he fumbled for a moment i didnt pay attention it wasnt important she smiled held out both of her hands as i walked toward her and i did it why are you coming forward now as i said i thought i could get away with it perhaps i could have i never expected my son to be arrested in my place so youre protecting him i killed them lieutenant what more do you want why did you leave the knife in his drawer in his room his eyes slid away slid back as i said he rarely stays there i thought it was safe then i was contacted about the search warrant i didnt have time to remove it you expect me to buy this you think youre helping him by clouding the case by coming forward with this lame confession you think hes guilty she lowered her voice bit off each word youre so terrified that your son is a murderer that youre willing to take the rap rather than see him face the consequences are you going to let another woman die angelini or two or three before you swallow reality his lips trembled once then firmed ive given you my statement youve given me bullshit turning on her heel eve left the room struggling to calm herself she stood outside watched with a jaundiced eye as angelini pressed his face into his hands she could break him eventually but there was always a chance that word would leak and the media would scream that there was a confession from someone other than the prime she looked over at the sound of footsteps and her body stiffened like steel commander lieutenant progress hes sticking to his story its got holes you could drive a shuttle through ive given him the opening to bring up the souvenirs from the first two hits he didnt bite id like to talk to him privately lieutenant and off the record before she could speak he held up a hand i realize its not procedure im asking you for a favor and if he incriminates himself or his son whitneys jaw tightened im still a cop dallas goddamn it yes sir she unlocked the door then after only a faint hesitation darkened the twoway glass and shut off audio ill be in my office thank you he stepped inside he gave her one last look before shutting the door and turning to the man slumped at the table marco whitney said on a long sigh what the fuck do you think youre doing jack marco offered a thin smile i wondered if youd be along we never did make that golf date talk to me whitney sat down heavily hasnt your efficient and dogged lieutenant filled you in the recorders off whitney said sharply were alone talk to me marco we both know you didnt kill cicely or anyone else for a moment marco stared up at the ceiling as if pondering people never know each other as well as they believe not even the people they care for i loved her jack i never stopped loving her but she stopped loving me part of me was always waiting for her to start loving me again but she never would have damn it marco do you expect me to believe that you slit her throat because she divorced you twelve years ago maybe i thought she might have married hammett he wanted that marco said quietly i could see that he wanted that cicely was reluctant his voice remained calm quiet faintly nostalgic she enjoyed her independence but she was sorry to disappoint hammett sorry enough that she might have given in eventually married him it would have really been over then wouldnt it you killed cicely because she might have married another man she was my wife jack whatever the courts and the church said whitney sat a moment silent ive played poker with you too many times over the years marco youve got tells folding his arms on the table he leaned forward when you bluff you tap your finger on your knee the finger stopped tapping this is a long way from poker jack you cant help david this way youve got to let the system work david and i theres been a lot of friction between us in the last several months business disagreements and personal ones for the first time he sighed deep and long and wearily there shouldnt be distance between father and son over such foolishness this is hardly the way to mend fences marco the steel came back into angelinis eyes there would be no more sighs let me ask you something jack just between us if it was one of yours and there was the slightest chance just the slightest that theyd be convicted of murder would anything stop you from protecting them you cant protect david by stepping in with some bullshit confession who said it was bullshit the word sounded like cream in angelinis cultured voice i did it and im confessing because i cant live with myself if my own child pays for my crime now tell me jack would you stand behind your son or in front of him ah hell marco was all whitney could say he stayed for twenty minutes but got nothing more for a time he guided the conversation into casual lines golf scores the standings of the baseball team marco had a piece of then quick and sleek as a snake hed toss out a hard leading question on the murders but marco angelini was an expert negotiator and had already given his bottom line he wouldnt budge guilt grief and the beginnings of real fear made an unsettling stew in whitneys stomach as he stepped into eves office she was hunched over her computer scanning data calling up more for the first time in days his eyes cleared of their own fatigue and saw hers she was pale her eyes shadowed her mouth grim her hair stood up in spikes as if shed dragged her hands through it countless times even as he watched she did so again then pressed her fingers to her eyes as if they burned he remembered the morning in his office the morning after cicely had been murdered and the responsibility hed hung around eves neck lieutenant her shoulders straightened as if shed slammed steel poles into them her head came up her eyes carefully blank commander she got to her feet got to attention whitney thought annoyed by the stiff and impersonal formality marcos in holding we can keep him for fortyeight hours without charging him i thought it best to let him think behind bars for a while he still refuses counsel whitney stepped in while she stood there and he looked around he wasnt often in this sector of the complex his officers came to him another weight of command she could have had a bigger office shed earned one but she seemed to prefer to work in a room so small that if three people crowded into it theyd be in sin good thing youre not claustrophobic he commented she gave no response didnt so much as twitch an eyebrow whitney muttered an oath listen dallas sir her interruption was fast and brittle forensics has the weapon retrieved from david angelinis room im informed that there will be some delay on the results as the blood traces detected by the sweeper are of an amount borderline for typing and dna so noted lieutenant the fingerprints on the weapon in evidence have been matched to those of david angelini my report well get to your report momentarily her chin jutted up yes sir goddamn it dallas yank that stick out of your butt and sit down is that an order commander ah hell he began mirina angelini burst through the doorway in a clatter of high heels and a crackle of silk why are you trying to destroy my family she demanded shaking off the restraining hand of slade who had come in behind her mirina this isnt going to help she jerked away and crowded into eve isnt it enough that my mother was murdered on the street murdered because american cops are too busy chasing shadows and filling out useless reports to protect the innocent mirina whitney said come on to my office well talk talk she turned on him like a cat gold and sleek teeth bared for blood how can i talk to you i trusted you i thought you cared about me about david about all of us youve let her lock david in a cell and now my father mirina marco came in voluntarily well talk about this ill explain it all to you theres nothing to explain she turned her back on him and aimed her scorching fury at eve i went to my fathers house he wanted me to stay in rome but i couldnt not when every report in the media is smearing my brothers name when we arrived a neighbor was more than happy even gleeful to tell me that my father had been taken away by the police i can arrange for you to speak with your father ms angelini eve said coolly and your brother youre damn right youll arrange it and now where is my father she used both hands to shove eve back a pace before whitney or slade could stop her what have you done with him you bitch you want to keep your hands off me eve warned ive just about had my fill of angelinis your fathers in holding here your brothers in the tower at rikers you can see your father now if you want to see your brother youll be shuttled over her gaze flicked to whitney and stung or since youve got some pull around here you can probably have him transported to visitation for an hour i know what youre doing this was no fragile flower now mirina fairly vibrated with power you need a scapegoat you need an arrest so that the media will get out of your face youre playing politics using my brother even my murdered mother so that you wont lose your job yeah some cushy job she smiled sourly i toss innocent people in a cage every day so i can keep all the benefits it keeps your face on the screen doesnt it mirina tossed her glorious hair how much publicity have you traded over my mothers dead body thats enough mirina whitneys voice lashed like a whip in one vicious snap go to my office and wait he looked over her shoulder at slade take her out of here mirina this is useless slade murmured trying to tuck her under his arm lets go now dont hold me she bit off each word as if they were stringy meat then shrugged away from him ill go but youre going to pay for the grief youve brought my family lieutenant youre going to pay for every bit of it she stalked out giving slade time for only a muttered apology before he followed after her whitney stepped quietly into the silence you okay ive dealt with worse eve jerked a shoulder inside she was sick with anger and guilt sick enough that she wanted badly to be alone behind closed doors if youll excuse me commander i want to finish going over this report dallas eve it was the weariness in his tone that had her gaze lifting warily to his mirinas upset understandably so but she was out of line way out of line she was entitled to a couple of shots at me because she wanted to press her hands to her throbbing head she tucked them negligently into her pockets ive just put whats left of her family in a cage who else is she going to be pissed at i can take it her gaze remained cool steely feelings arent my strong suit he nodded slowly i had that coming i put you on this case dallas because youre the best ive got your minds good your guts good and you care you care about the victim letting out a long breath he dragged a hand over his hair i was off base this morning dallas in my office ive been off base a number of times with you since this whole mess began i apologize for it it doesnt matter i wish it didnt he searched her face saw the stiff restraint but i see it does ill take care of mirina arrange the visitations yes sir id like to continue my interview with marco angelini tomorrow whitney said and set his teeth when she didnt quite mask the sneer youre tired lieutenant and tired cops make mistakes and miss details youll pick it up tomorrow he headed for the door swore again and stopped without looking back at her get some sleep and for christs sake take a painkiller for that headache you look like hell she resisted slamming the door after him resisted because it would be petty and unprofessional but she sat down stared at the screen and pretended her head wasnt shuddering with pain when a shadow fell over her desk moments later she looked up eyes fired for battle well roarke said mildly and leaned over to kiss her snarling mouth thats quite a welcome he patted his chest am i bleeding haha theres that sparkling wit i missed he sat on the edge of the desk where he could look at her and catch a glimpse of the data on the screen to see if that was what had put the miserable anger in her eyes well lieutenant and how was your day lets see i booked my superiors favorite godson on obstruction and other assorted charges found what may be the murder weapon in his console drawer in the family town house took a confession from the prime suspects father who claims he did it and just took a couple of shots between the eyes from the sister who thinks im a media grabbing bitch she tried on a small smile other than that its been pretty quiet how about you fortunes won fortunes lost he said mildly worried about her nothing nearly as exciting as police work i wasnt sure you were coming back tonight neither was i the construction on the resorts moving ahead well enough i should be able to handle things from here for a time she tried not to be so relieved it irritated her that in a few short months shed gotten so used to his being there even dependent upon it thats good i guess mmm he read her well what can you tell me about the case its all over the media pick a channel id rather hear it from you she brought him up to date in much the way she would file a report in quick efficient terms heavy on facts light on personal comments and she discovered she felt better for it afterward roarke had a way of listening that made her hear herself more clearly you believe its the younger angelini weve got means and opportunity and a good handle on motive if the knife matches anyway ill be meeting with dr mira tomorrow to discuss his psych testing and marco roarke continued what do you think of his confession its a handy way to confuse things tie up the investigation hes a clever man and hell find a way to leak it to the media she scowled over roarkes shoulder itll jerk everything around for a while cost us some time and trouble but well smooth it out you think he confessed to the murders to complicate the investigation thats right she shifted her gaze to his lifted a brow youve got another theory the drowning child roarke murmured the father believes his son is about to go under for the third time jumps into the torrent his life for his childs love eve he cupped her chin in his hand love stops at nothing marco believes his son is guilty and would rather sacrifice himself than see his child pay the price if he knows or even believes that david killed those women it would be insane to protect him no it would be love theres probably none stronger than a parents for a child you and i dont have any experience with that but it exists she shook her head even when the childs defective perhaps especially then when i was a boy in dublin there was a woman whose daughter had lost an arm in an accident there was no money for a replacement she had five children and loved them all but four were whole and one was damaged she built a shield around that girl to protect her from the stares and the whispers and the pity it was the damaged child she pushed to excel who they all devoted themselves to the others didnt need her as much you see as the one who was flawed theres a difference between a physical defect and a mental one eve insisted i wonder if there is to a parent whatever marco angelinis motive well cut through to the truth in the end no doubt you will whens your shift over what your shift he repeated when is it over she glanced at the screen noted the time in the bottom corner about an hour ago good he rose and held out a hand come with me roarke there are some things i should tie up here i want to review the interview with marco angelini i may find a hole he was patient because he had no doubt hed have his own way eve youre so tired you wouldnt see a hundredmeter hole until youd fallen into it determined he took her hand and pulled her to her feet come with me all right maybe i could use a break grumbling a bit she ordered her computer off and locked im going to have to goose the techs at the lab theyre taking forever on the knife her hand felt good in his she didnt even worry about the ribbing shed take from the other cops who might see them in the hall or elevator where are we going he brought their linked hands to his lips and smiled at her over them i havent decided o o he opted for mexico it was a quick easy flight and his villa there on the turbulent west coast was always prepared unlike his home in new york he kept it fully automated calling in domestics only for lengthy stays in roarkes mind droids and computers were convenient but impersonal for the purposes of this visit however he was content to rely on them he wanted eve alone he wanted her relaxed and he wanted her happy jesus roarke she took one look at the towering multilayered building on the brink of a cliff and goggled it looked like a extension of the rock as if the sheer glass walls had been polished from it gardens tumbled over terraces in vivid colors shapes and fragrances above the deepening sky was devoid of any traffic just blue the swirl of white clouds the flashing wings of birds it looked like another world shed slept like a stone on the plane barely surfacing when the pilot had executed a snazzy drop landing that had placed them neatly at the foot of zigzagging stone steps that climbed the towering cliff she was groggy enough to reach up to be certain he hadnt slipped vr goggles on her while shed slept where are we mexico he said simply mexico stunned she tried to rub the sleep and the shock from her eyes roarke thought with affection that she looked like a cranky child awakened from a nap but i cant be in mexico i have to ride or walk he asked pulling her along like a stubborn puppy i have to ride he decided youre still groggy she could enjoy the climb later he thought and its many views of sea and cliffs instead he nudged her into a sleek little air cart taking the controls himself and shooting them up to vertical with a speed that knocked the rest of sleep out of her system christ not so fast her instinct for survival had her clutching the side wincing as rocks flowers and water whizzed by he was roaring with laughter when he slipped the little cart into place at the front patio awake now darling she had her breath back barely im going to kill you as soon as i make sure all my internal organs are in place what the hell are we doing in mexico taking a break i need one he stepped out of the cart and came around to her side theres no doubt you do since she was still holding onto the side knuckles white he reached in plucked her up and carried her over the irregularly shaped stones toward the door cut it out i can walk stop complaining he turned his head expertly finding her mouth deepening the kiss until her hand stopped pushing at his shoulder and began to knead it damn it she murmured how come you can always do that to me just lucky i guess roarke disengage he said and the decorative bars across the entrance slid apart behind them doors ornate with carving and etched glass clicked open and swung back in welcome he stepped inside secure he ordered and the doors efficiently closed while eve stared one wall of the entrance level was glass and through it she could see the ocean shed never seen the pacific and she wondered now how it had earned its serene name when it looked so alive so ready to boil they were in time for sunset and as she watched speechless the sky exploded and shimmered with bolts and streams of wild color and the fat red globe of the sun sank slowly inevitably toward the blue line of water youll like it here he murmured she was staggered by the beauty of an ending day it seemed that nature had waited for her held the show its wonderful i cant stay a few hours he pressed a kiss to her temple just overnight for now well come back and spend a few days when we have more time still carrying her he walked closer to the glass wall until it seemed to eve that the entire world was made of frantic color and shifting shapes i love you eve she looked away from the sun the ocean and into his eyes and it was wonderful and for the moment it was simple i missed you she pressed her cheek to his and held him tightly i really missed you i wore one of your shirts she could laugh at herself now because he was here she could smell him touch him i actually went into your closet and stole one of your shirts one of the black silk ones you have dozens of i put it on then snuck out of the house like a thief so summerset wouldnt catch me absurdly touched he nuzzled her neck at night id play your transmissions over just so i could look at you hear your voice really she giggled a rare sound from her god roarke weve gotten so sappy well keep it our little secret deal she leaned back to look at his face i have to ask you something its so lame but i have to what was it ever she winced wished she could muffle the need to ask before with anyone else no he touched his lips to her brow her nose the dip in her chin it was never with no one else not for me either she simply breathed him in put your hands on me i want your hands on me i can do that he did tumbling with her to a spread of floor cushions while the sun died brilliantly in the ocean chapter sixteen taking a break with roarke wasnt quite like stopping off at the deli for a quick veggie hash salad and soy coffee she wasnt sure how he managed it all but then great quantities of money talk and talk big they dined on succulent grilled lobster drenched in real creamy rich butter they sipped champagne so cold it frosted eves throat a symphony of fruit was there for the sampling exotic hybrids that sprinkled harmonized flavors on the tongue long before she could admit that she loved him eve had accepted the fact that she was addicted to the food he could summon up with the flick of a wrist she soaked naked in a small whirling lagoon cupped under palm trees and moonlight her muscles slack from the heated water and thorough sex she listened to the song of night birds no simulation but the real thing that hung on the fragrant air like tears for now for one night the pressures of the job were lightyears away he could do that to her and for her she realized he could open little pockets of peace roarke watched her pleased at the way the tension had melted from her face with a bit of pampering he loved seeing her this way unwound limp with pleasuring her senses too lax to remember to be guilty for indulging herself just as he loved seeing her revved her mind racing her body braced for action no it had never been like this for him before with anyone of all the women hed known she was the only one he was compelled to be with driven to touch beyond the physical the basic and apparently unsatiable lust she inspired in him was a constant fascination her mind her heart her secrets her scars he had told her once they were two lost souls he thought now hed spoken no more than the truth but with each other theyd found something that rooted them for a man who had been wary of cops all of his life it was staggering to know his happiness now depended on one amused at himself he slipped into the water with her eve managed to drum up enough energy to open her eyes to slits i dont think i can move then dont he handed her another flute of champagne wrapping her fingers around the stem im too relaxed to be drunk but she managed to find her mouth with the glass its such a weird life yours she elaborated i mean you can have anything you want go anywhere do anything you want to take a night off you zip over to mexico and nibble on lobster and what was that stuff again the stuff you spread on crackers goose liver she winced and shuddered thats not what you called it when you shoved it in my mouth it sounded nicer foie gras same thing thats better she shifted her legs tangled them with his anyway most people program a video or take a quick trip with their vr goggles maybe plug a few credits into a simulation booth down at times square but you do the real thing i prefer the real thing i know thats another odd piece of you you like old stuff youd rather read a book than scan a disc rather go to the trouble to come out here when you could have programmed a simulation in your holoroom her lips curved a little dreamily i like that about you thats handy when you were a kid and things were bad for you is this what you dreamed about i dreamed about surviving getting out having control didnt you i guess i did too many of her dreams were jumbled and dark after i was in the system anyway then what i wanted most was to be a cop a good cop a smart cop what did you want to be rich not to be hungry we both got what we wanted more or less you had nightmares while i was gone she didnt have to open her eyes to see the concern in his she could hear it in his voice they arent too bad theyre just more regular eve if youd work with doctor mira im not ready to remember it not all of it do you ever feel the scars from what your father did to you restless with the memories he shifted and sank deeper in the hot frothy water a few beatings careless cruelty why should it matter now you shrug it off now she opened her eyes looked at him saw he was brooding but it made you didnt it what happened then made you i suppose it did roughly she nodded tried to speak casually roarke do you think if some people lack something and that lack lets them brutalize their kids the way we were do you think it passes on do you think no but no he cupped a hand over her calf and squeezed we make ourselves in the long run you and i did if that wasnt true id be drunk in some dublin slum looking for something weaker to pummel and you eve would be cold and brittle and without pity she closed her eyes again sometimes i am no that you never are youre strong and youre moral and sometimes you make yourself ill with compassion for the innocent her eyes stung behind her closed lids someone i admire and respect asked me for help asked me for a favor i turned him down flat what does that make me a woman who had a choice to make roarke the last woman who was killed louise kirski thats on my head she was twentyfour talented eager in love with a secondrate musician she had a cluttered oneroom apartment on west twentysixth and liked chinese food she had a family in texas that will never be the same she was innocent roarke and shes haunting me relieved eve let out a long breath i havent been able to tell anyone that i wasnt sure i could say it out loud im glad you could say it to me now listen he set his glass down scooted forward to take her face in his hands her skin was soft her eyes a narrow slant of dark amber fate rules eve you follow the steps and you plan and you work then fate slips in laughing and makes fools of us sometimes we can trick it or outguess it but most often its already written for some its written in blood that doesnt mean we stop but it does mean we cant always comfort ourselves with blame is that what you think im doing comforting myself its easier to take the blame than it is to admit there was nothing you could do to stop what happened youre an arrogant woman eve just one more aspect of you that i find attractive its arrogant to assume responsibility for events beyond our control i should have controlled it ah yes he smiled of course its not arrogance she insisted miffed its my job you taunted him assuming hed come after you because the thought of that still twisted in his gut like hissing snakes roarke tightened his grip on her face now youre insulted annoyed that he didnt follow your rules thats a hideous thing to say goddamn you i dont she broke off sucked in her breath youre pissing me off so ill stop feeling sorry for myself it seems to have worked all right she let her eyes close again all right im not going to think about it anymore right now maybe by tomorrow ill have a better shot at sorting it out youre pretty good roarke she said with a ghost of a smile thousands concur he murmured and caught her nipple lightly between his thumb and forefinger the ripple effect made it all the way down to her toes thats not what i meant its what i meant he tugged gently listened to her breath catch maybe if i can manage to crawl out of here i can take you up on your interesting offer just relax watching her face he slid his hand between her legs cupped her let me he managed to catch her glass as it slipped from her hand and he set it aside let me have you eve before she could answer he shot her to a fast wracking orgasm her hips arched up pumped against his busy hand then went lax she wouldnt think now he knew she would be wrapped in layered sensations she never seemed to expect it and her surprise her sweet and naive response was as always murderously arousing he could have pleasured her endlessly for the simple delight of watching her absorb every touch every jolt so he indulged himself exploring that long lean body suckling the small hot breasts wet with perfumed water gulping in the rapid breath that gasped from her lips she felt drugged helpless her mind and body burdened with pleasure part of her was shocked or tried to be not so much at what she let him do but at the fact that she allowed him complete and total control of her she couldnt have stopped him wouldnt have even when he held her near to screaming on the edge before shoving her over into another shuddering climax again greedy he dragged her head back by the hair and stabbed his fingers inside her worked her ruthlessly until her hands splashed bonelessly in the water im all there is tonight were all there is he savaged her throat on the way to her mouth and his eyes were like fierce blue suns tell me you love me say it i do i do love you a moan ripped from her throat when he plunged himself into her jerked her hips high and plunged deeper tell me again he felt her muscles squeeze him like a fist and gritted his teeth to keep from exploding tell me again i love you trembling from it she wrapped her legs around him and let him batter her past delirium o o she did have to crawl out of the pool her head was spinning her body limp i dont have any bones left roarke chuckled and gave her a friendly slap on the butt im not carrying you this time darling wed both end up on our faces maybe ill just lie down right here it was a struggle to remain on her hands and knees on the smooth tiles youll get cold with an effort he summoned the strength to drag her to her feet where they rocked together like drunks she began to snicker teetering what the hell did you do to me i feel like ive downed a couple of freebirds he managed to grip her waist since when did you play with illegals standard police training she bit experimentally at her bottom lip and found that it was indeed numb we have to take a course in illegals at the academy i palmed most of mine and flushed them is your head spinning ill let you know when i regain feeling above the waist he tipped her head back and kissed her lightly why dont we see if we can make it inside we can he trailed off eyes narrowing over her shoulder she might have been impaired but she was still a cop instinctively she whirled and braced unconsciously shielding his body with hers what what is it nothing he cleared his throat patted her shoulder nothing he repeated go on in ill be right along what she stood her ground scanning for trouble its nothing really i just i neglected to disengage the security camera its ah activated by motion or voice naked he strode over toward a low stone wall flicked a switch and palmed a disc camera eve held up a finger there was a recording on the entire time weve been out here she flicked a narroweyed stare at the lagoon the entire time which is why i generally prefer people to automations were on there all on there ill take care of it she started to speak again then got a good look at his face the devil took over ill be damned roarke youre embarrassed certainly not if hed been wearing anything but skin he would have pushed his hands into his pockets it was simply an oversight i said id take care of it lets play it back he stopped short and gave eve the rare pleasure of seeing him goggle i beg your pardon you are embarrassed she leaned over to kiss him and while he was distracted snatched the disc thats cute really cute shut up give me that i dont think so delighted she danced back a step and held the disc out of reach i bet this is very hot arent you curious no he made a grab but she was very quick eve give me the damn thing this is fascinating she edged back toward the open patio doors the sophisticated seenitall roarke is blushing i am not he hoped to christ he wasnt that would top it i simply see no reason to document lovemaking its private im not going to pass it on to nadine furst for broadcast im just going to review it right now she dashed inside while he swore and ran after her o o she walked into her office at nine a m sharp with a spring to her step her eyes were clear and unshadowed her system toned and her shoulders free of tension she was all but humming somebody got lucky feeney said mournfully and kept his feet planted on her desk roarkes back on planet i take it i got a good nights sleep she retorted and shoved his feet aside he grunted be grateful cause youre not going to find much peace today lab reports in the fucking knife doesnt match her sunny mood vanished what do you mean the knife doesnt match the blades too thick a centimeter might as well be a meter goddamn it that could be the angle of the wounds the thrust of the blow mexico vanished like a bubble of air thinking fast she began to pace what about the blood they managed to scrape off enough to get type dna his already gloomy face sagged it matches our boy its david angelinis blood dallas lab says its old six months minimum from the fibers they got it looks like he used it to open packages probably nicked himself somewhere along the line its not our weapon screw it she heaved a breath refused to be discouraged if he had one knife he could have had two well wait to hear from the other sweepers taking a moment she scrubbed her face with her hands listen to me feeney if we go with marcos confession as bogus we have to ask why hes not a crank or a loony calling in trying to take credit hes saving his sons ass is what hes doing so we work on him and we work hard ill bring him in to interview try to crack him im with you there ive got a session with mira in a couple hours well just let our main boy stew for awhile while we pray one of the teams turns up something praying cant hurt heres the big one feeney our boys lawyers get a hold of marcos confession its going to corrupt the hearing on the minor charges well whistle for an indictment with that and without physical evidence hes going back out dallas yeah son of a bitch o o marco angelini was like a boulder cemented to concrete he wasnt going to budge two hours of intense interrogation didnt shake his story though eve consoled herself he hadnt shored up any of the holes in it either at the moment she had little choice but to pin her hopes on miras report i can tell you mira said in her usual unruffled fashion that david angelini is a troubled young man with a highly developed sense of selfindulgence and protection tell me hes capable of slicing his mothers throat ah mira sat back and folded her neat hands what i can tell you is in my opinion he is more capable of running from trouble than confronting it on any level when combining and averaging his placements on the murdocklowell and the synergy evaluations can we skip over the psych buzz doctor i can read that in the report all right mira shifted away from the screen where she had been about to bring up the evaluations well keep this in simple terms for the time being your man is a liar one who convinces himself with little effort that his lies are truth in order to maintain his selfesteem he requires good opinion even praise and is accustomed to having it and having his own way and if he doesnt get his own way he casts blame elsewhere it is not his fault nor his responsibility his world is insular lieutenant comprised for the most part of himself alone he considers himself successful and talented and when he fails its because someone else made a mistake he gambles because he doesnt believe he can lose and he enjoys the thrill of risk he loses because he believes himself above the game how would he react at the risk of having his bones snapped over gambling debts he would run and he would hide and being abnormally dependent on his parents he would expect them to clean up the mess and if they refused mira was silent for a moment you want me to tell you that he would strike out react violently even murderously i cant do that it is of course a possibility that cant be ruled out in any of us no test no evaluation can absolutely conclude the reaction of an individual under certain circumstances but in those tests and those evaluations the subject reacted consistently by covering by running by shifting blame rather than by attacking the source of his problem and he could be covering his reaction to skew the evaluation its possible but unlikely im sorry eve stopped pacing and sank into a chair youre saying that in your opinion the murderer may still be out there im afraid so it makes your job more difficult if im looking in the wrong place eve said to herself wheres the right place and whos next unfortunately neither science nor technology is yet able to forecast the future you can program possibilities even probabilities but they cant take into account impulse or emotion do you have nadine furst under protection as much as possible eve tapped a finger on her knee shes difficult and shes torn up about louise kirski and so are you eve slid her gaze over nodded stiffly yeah you could say that yet you look uncommonly rested this morning i got a good nights sleep untroubled eve moved a shoulder tucked angelini and the case into a corner of her mind where she hoped it would simmer into something fresh what would you say about a woman who cant seem to sleep well unless this mans in bed with her id say she may be in love with him is certainly growing used to him you wouldnt say shes overly dependent can you function without him do you feel able to make a decision without asking his advice opinion or direction well sure but she trailed off feeling foolish well if one was to feel foolish what better place than a shrinks office the other day when he was off planet i wore one of his shirts to work thats lovely mira said with a slow easy smile romantic why does romance worry you it doesnt i okay it scares the shit out of me and i dont know why im not used to having someone there having someone look at me like the way he does sometimes its unnerving why is that because i havent done anything to make him care about me as much as he does i know he does eve your selfworth has always been focused on your job now a relationship has forced you to begin evaluating yourself as a woman are you afraid of what youll find i havent figured that out its always been the job the highs and lows the rush the monotony everything i needed to be was there i busted my ass to make lieutenant and i figure i can sweat my way up to captain maybe more doing the job was it all of it it was important to be the best to make a mark its still important but its not all anymore i would say eve that youll be a better cop and a better woman because of it single focus limits us and can too often obsess us a healthy life needs more than one goal one passion then i guess my lifes getting healthier eves communicator beeped reminding her that she was on the clock a cop first dallas youre going to want to switch over to public broadcast channel feeney announced then get your butt back here to the tower the new chief wants to fry our asses eve cut him off and mira had already opened her viewing screen they came in on c j morses noon update continuing problems with the investigation of the murders a cop central source has confirmed that while david angelini has been charged with obstruction of justice and remains prime suspect for the three murders marco angelini the accuseds father has confessed to those murders the senior angelini president of angelini exports and former husband of the first victim prosecuting attorney cicely towers surrendered to the police yesterday though he has confessed to all three murders he has not been charged and the police continue to hold david angelini morse paused shifted slightly to face a new camera angle his pleasant youthful face radiated concern in other developments a knife taken from the angelini home during a police search has proven through testing not to be the murder weapon mirina angelini daughter of the late cicely towers spoke to this reporter in an exclusive interview this morning the screen snapped to a new video and filled with mirinas lovely outraged face the police are persecuting my family it isnt enough that my mother is dead murdered on the street now in a desperate attempt to cover their own ineptitude theyve arrested my brother and theyre holding my father it wouldnt surprise me to find myself taken away in restraints at any moment eve ground her teeth while morse led mirina through questions prodded her to make accusations tears gleaming in her eyes when the broadcast switched back to the news desk he was frowning seriously a family under siege there are rumors of coverups clouding the investigation primary investigating officer lieutenant eve dallas could not be reached for comment little bastard little bastard eve muttered and swung away from the screen he never tried to reach me for comment id give him a comment furious she snatched up her bag and shot mira one last look you ought to analyze that one she said jerking her head toward the screen that little prick has delusions of grandeur chapter seventeen harrison tibble was a thirtyfiveyear vet on the police force hed plodded his way up from beat cop working the west side barrios when cops and their quarries still carried guns hed even taken a hit once three nasty rounds in the abdomen that might have killed a lesser man and would certainly have given most ordinary cops cause to consider their career choices tibble had been back on full duty within six weeks he was an enormous man a full six foot six and two hundred sixty pounds of solid muscle after the gun ban hed used his bulk and cold terrifying grin to intimidate his quarries he still had the mind of a street cop and his record was clean enough to serve tea on he had a large square face skin the color of polished onyx hands the size of steamship rounds and no patience for bullshit eve liked him and could privately admit she was a little afraid of him what is this pile of shit weve got ourselves into lieutenant sir eve faced him flanked by feeney and whitney but at the moment she knew she was very much alone david angelini was on scene the night louise kirski was killed we have that locked he has no solid alibi for the times of the other two murders hes in debt big time to the spine twisters and with his mothers death he comes into a nice healthy inheritance its been confirmed that she had refused to bail him out this time look for the moneys a tried and true investigative tool lieutenant but what about the other two he knew all of this eve thought and struggled not to squirm every word of every report had passed by him he knew metcalf had been to her apartment was working with her on a project he needed her to commit but she was playing coy covering her bases the third victim was a mistake we believe strongly that the intended victim was nadine furst who at my suggestion and with my cooperation was putting a great deal of pressure on the story he also knew her personally thats real good so far his chair creaked under his weight as he shifted back real good youve placed him at one of the scenes established motives dug up the links now we run into the hard place you dont have a weapon you dont have any blood you dont have diddly as far as physical evidence not at this time youve also got a confession but not from the accused that confessions nothing more than a smoke screen whitney put in an attempt by a father to protect his son so you believe tibble said mildly but the fact is its now on record and is public knowledge the psych profile doesnt fit the weapon doesnt fit and in my opinion the pas office was too eager to put the spotlight on it happens when its one of your own he held up a platesized hand before eve could speak ill tell you what weve got what it looks like to all those fine people watching their screens a grieving family hammered by cops circumstantial evidence and three women with their throats cut open no ones throats been cut open since david angelinis been locked up and the charges filed against him are clean true enough but that handy fact wont get an indictment on the lessers not when the jurys going to feel sorry for him and the counsel starts hawking diminished capacity he waited scanning faces tapped his fingers when no one disagreed with him youre the number whiz feeney the electronic genius what are the odds on the grand jury if we send our boy over tomorrow on the obstruction and bribery charges feeney hunched his shoulders fiftyfifty he said mournfully at the outside considering that idiot morses latest news flash thats not good enough spring him spring him chief tibble all were going to get if we push those charges is bad press and public sympathy for the son of a martyred public servant cut him loose lieutenant and dig deeper put someone on him he ordered whitney and on his daddy i dont want them to fart without hearing about it and find the fucking leak he added his eyes going hard i want to know what asshole fed that idiot morse data his grin spread suddenly terrifyingly then i want to talk to him personally keep your distance from the angelinis jack this isnt any time for friendship id hoped to talk to mirina i might be able to persuade her not to give any more interviews its a little late for damage control there tibble considered hold off on that ive worked hard to get the stink of the word coverup out of this office i want to keep it that way get me a weapon get me some blood and for christs sake do it before somebody else gets sliced his voice boomed out fingers jabbing as he snapped orders feeney work some of your magic go over the names from the victims diaries again cross them with fursts find me somebody else who had an interest in those ladies thatll be all gentlemen he got to his feet lieutenant dallas another moment of your time chief tibble whitney began formally i want it on record that as lieutenant dallass commanding officer i consider her pursuit of this investigation to be exemplary her work has been top rate despite difficult circumstances both professional and personal some of which i have caused tibble cocked a bushy brow im sure the lieutenant appreciates your review jack he said nothing more waiting until the men left me and jack we go back a ways he began conversationally now he thinks since im sitting here where that corrupt piefaced fucker simpson used to rest his sorry ass im going to use you as a handy scapegoat and feed you to the media dogs he held eves eyes steadily is that what you think dallas no sir but you could yeah he scratched the side of his neck i could have you bumbled this investigation lieutenant maybe i have it was a hard one to swallow if david angelini is innocent the courts decide innocence or guilt he interrupted you gather evidence you gathered some nice evidence and the jerk was there for kirski if he didnt kill her the bastard watched some woman get slaughtered and walked away he dont win any prizes in my book tibble steepled his fingers and peered over them you know what would make me take you off this case dallas if i thought you were carrying around too much baggage about kirski when she opened her mouth then shut it again he gave her a thinlipped smile yeah best to keep it shut you laid out some bait took a chance there was a pretty good shot hed come after you id have done the same thing in my glory days he added with some wistful regret that they were over problem is he didnt and some poor woman with a tobacco habit gets hit instead you figure youre responsible for that she struggled with the lie gave up to the truth yes get over it he said with a snap the trouble with this case is theres too much emotion jack cant get past his grief you cant get past your guilt that makes the two of you useless you want to be guilty you want to be pissed wait till you nail him clear yes sir satisfied he leaned back again you walk out of here the medias going to be all over you like lice i can handle the media im sure you can he blew out a breath so can i ive got a fucking press conference clear out o o there was only one place to go and that was back to the beginning eve stood on the sidewalk outside the five moons and stared down playing the route back in her mind she strode to the subway entrance it was raining she remembered id have a hand on my umbrella my purse over my shoulder with a good grip on that too bad neighborhood im pissed i walk fast but i keep an eye shifting for anybody who wants my purse as much as i do she walked into the five moons ignoring the quick glances and the bland face of the droid behind the bar as she tried to read cicely towerss thoughts disgusting place dirty im not going to drink not even going to sit down god knows what id pick up on my suit check the watch where the hell is he lets get this over with why the hell did i meet him here stupid stupid should have used my office my turf why didnt i because its private eve thought closing her eyes its personal too many people there too many questions not city business her business why not her apartment didnt want him there too angry upset eager to argue when he named the time and place no its just angry impatient eve decided remembering the droids statement shed checked her watch again and again shed frowned shed given up and walked out eve followed the route remembering the umbrella the purse quick steps heels clicking someone there she stops does she see him recognize him has to its face to face maybe she speaks to him youre late he does it quick its a bad neighborhood not much cruising traffic but you can never tell security lights are dinky always are around here nobody complains much because its safer to score in the dark but someone might come out of the bar or the club across the street one swipe and shes down her bloods all over him the fucking bloods got to be all over him he takes her umbrella an impulse or maybe for a shield walks away fast not to the subway hes covered with blood even around here somebody would notice she covered two blocks in either direction then covered them again questioning anyone who was loitering on the street most of the responses were shrugs angry eyes cops werent popular on the west end she watched a street hawker who she suspected was pushing more than fashion beads and feathers skim around the corner on motor skates she scowled after him you been round here before eve glanced over the woman was so white she was next to invisible her face was like bleached putty her hair cropped so close it showed her bonewhite scalp and her eyes were colorless down to the pinprick pupil funky junkie eve thought they popped the white tablet that kept the mind misted and pigments bleached yeah ive been around cop the junkie jerked forward stiff jointed like a droid coming up on maintenance a sign she was low on a fix seen you talking with crack a while ago hes some dude yeah hes some dude were you around the night that woman got whacked down the street fancy lady rich fancy lady caught it on the screen in detox eve bit back an oath stopped and backtracked if you were in detox howd you see me talking to crack went in that day maybe the next day times relative right maybe you saw the rich fancy lady before you caught her on the screen nope the albino sucked her finger didnt eve scanned the building behind the junkie gauged the view is this where you live i live here i live there got me a crash flop upstairs you were there the night the lady got slashed probably got a credit problem she flashed tiny round teeth in a smile and her breath was awesome not much fun on the street when you aint got a credit it was raining eve prompted oh yeah i like the rain her muscles continued to jerk but her eyes went dreamy i watch it out the window did you see anything else out the window people come people go she said in a singsong voice sometimes you can hear the music from down the street but not that night rains too loud people running to get out of it like theyd melt or something you saw someone running in the rain the colorless eyes sharpened maybe whats it worth eve dug into her pocket she had enough loose credit tokens for a quick small score the junkies eyes rolled and her hand jerked out what did you see eve said slowly snatching the credits out of reach a guy pissing in the alley over there she shrugged her eyes focused on the credits maybe jerking off hard to tell did he have anything with him was he carrying anything just his dick she laughed uproariously at that and nearly tumbled her eyes were beginning to water heavily he just walked away in the rain hardly anybody out that night guy got in a car same guy nah another guy had it parked over there she gestured vaguely not from round here why car had a shine to it nobody got a car with a shine to it round here if they got a car now crack hes got one and that pissant reeve down the hall from me but they dont shine tell me about the guy who got in the car got in the car drove away what time was it hey i look like a clock ticktock she snorted another laugh it was nighttime nighttimes the best my eyes hurt in daytime she whined lost my sunshields eve dragged a pair of eye protectors out of her pocket she never remembered to wear the damn things anyway she shoved them at the albino who hooked them on cheap cop issue shit what was he wearing the guy who got in the car hell i dont know the junkie toyed with the sunglasses her eyes didnt burn quite so much behind the treated lenses a coat maybe dark coat flapped around yeah it flapped around when he was closing the umbrella eve felt a jolt like a punch in the stomach he had an umbrella hey it was raining some people dont like getting wet pretty she said dreaming again bright what color was it bright she repeated you going to give me those credits yeah youre going to get them but eve took her arm led her to the broken steps of the building and sat her down but lets talk about this a little more first o o the uniforms missed her eve paced her office while feeney lolled in her chair she went into detox the day after the first murder i checked it she got out a week ago you got an albino addict feeney put in she saw him feeney she saw him get in a car she saw the umbrella you know what a funky junkies visions like dallas in the dark in the rain from across the street she gave me the umbrella goddamn it nobody knew about the umbrella and the color was i quote bright he held up both hands before eve could snap at him im just trying to save you some grief you got an idea of putting the angelinis in a lineup for a funky junkie their lawyers are going to whip your little ass kid she had thought of it and she too had rejected it she wouldnt hold up on direct id im not stupid but it was a man shes damn sure of that he drove away he had the umbrella he was wearing a long coat dark which jibes with david angelinis statement it was a new car i juggled that out of her shiny bright back with bright so they dont see colors well she snarled the guy was alone and the car was a small personal vehicle the drivers side door opened up not to the side and he had to swivel down to get in could be a rocket a midas or a spur maybe a midget if its a late model she said new and shes got a thing for cars likes to watch them okay ill run it he gave a sour smile any idea how many of those models been sold in the last two years in the five boroughs alone now if shed come up with an id plate even a partial quit bitching ive been back over metcalfs theres a couple dozen bright new cars in the garage there oh joy possibility hes a neighbor eve said with a shrug it was a very low possibility wherever he lives he has to be able to get in and out without being noticed or where people dont notice maybe he leaves the coat in the car or he puts it in something to get it inside and clean it up theres going to be blood in that car feeney and on that coat no matter how much hes scrubbed and sprayed ive got to get over to channel are you crazy i need to talk to nadine shes dodging me jesus talk about the lions den oh ill be fine she smiled viciously im taking roarke with me theyre scared of him o o its so sweet of you to ask for my company roarke pulled his car into the visitors lot at channel and beamed at her im touched all right i owe you the man never let her get away with anything eve thought in disgust as she climbed out of the car ill collect he caught her arm you can start paying off by telling me why you want me along i told you itll save time since you want to go to this opera thing very slowly very thoroughly he scanned over her dusty trousers and battered boots darling eve though you always look perfect to me youre not going to the opera dressed like that so were going to have to go home to change anyway come clean maybe i dont want to go to the opera so youve already said several times i believe but we had a deal she lowered her brows toyed with one of the buttons of his shirt its just singing ive agreed to sit through two sets at the blue squirrel with the idea of helping mavis into a recording contract and no one no one with ears would consider that singing of any kind she huffed out a breath a deal was after all a deal okay fine i said im going now that youve managed to avoid the question ill repeat it why am i here she looked up from his button into his face it was always hell for her to admit she could use help feeneys got to dig into the ework he cant be spared right now i want another pair of eyes ears another impression his lips curved so im your second choice youre my first civilian choice you read people well im flattered and perhaps while im here i could break morses face for you her grin came quickly i like you roarke i really like you i like you too is that a yes id enjoy it very much she laughed but there was a part of her that wanned foolishly over the idea of having an avenger its a happy thought roarke but id really rather break his face myself at the right time and in the right place can i watch sure but for the moment can you just be the rich and powerful roarke my personal trophy ah how sexist im excited good hold that thought maybe well skip the opera after all they walked together through the main entrance and roarke had the pleasure of watching her shrug on the cop she flashed her badge at security gave him a pithy suggestion that he keep out of her face then strode toward the ascent i love to watch you work he murmured in her ear youre so forceful he decided as his hand slid down her back toward her butt cut it out see what i mean he rubbed his gut where her elbow had jabbed hit me again i could learn to love it she managed barely to turn a chuckle into a snort civilians was all she said the newsroom was busy noisy at least half of the ondesk reporters were plugged into links headsets or computers screens flashed current broadcasts a number of conversations stopped dead when eve and roarke stepped from the ascent then like a horde of dogs with the same scent in their nostrils reporters scrambled forward back off eve ordered with enough force to have one eager beaver stumbling backward and stomping on the foot of a cohort nobody gets a comment nobody gets squat until im ready if i do buy this place roarke said to eve in a voice just loud enough to carry ill have to make several staff cuts that created a swath wide enough to stride through eve zeroed in on a face she recognized rigley wheres furst hey lieutenant he was all teeth and hair and ambition if youd like to step into my office he invited gesturing toward his console furst she repeated in a voice like a bullet where i havent seen her all day i covered her morning report myself she called in beaming smiles morse sauntered over taking some time off he explained and his mobile face shifted to sober lines shes pretty ripped up about louise we all are is she at home said she needed some time is all i know management cut her a break shes got a couple of weeks coming im taking over her beat his smile flashed again so if youd like a little airtime dallas im your man ive had plenty of your airtime morse well then he dismissed her and shifted toward roarke his smile bumped up in wattage its a pleasure to meet you youre a difficult man to contact deliberately insulting roarke ignored morses offered hand i only give time to people i consider interesting morse lowered his hand but kept his smile in place im sure if you spared me a few minutes id find several areas of interest for you roarkes smile flashed quick and lethal you really are an idiot arent you down boy eve murmured patting roarkes arm who leaked confidential data morse was obviously struggling to recover his dignity he veered his gaze to hers and nearly managed an arrogant sneer now now sources are protected lets not forget the constitution patriotically he laid his palm over his heart now if you wish to comment on contradict or add to any of my information id be more than happy to listen why dont we try this she said shifting gears you found louise kirskis body while it was still warm thats right he folded his mouth into grim lines ive given my statement you were pretty upset werent you jittery shot your dinner in the bushes feeling better now its something ill never forget but yes im feeling better thanks for asking she stepped forward backing him up you felt good enough to go on air within minutes to make sure there was a camera out there getting a nice closeup of your dead associate immediacy is part of the business i did what i was trained to do that doesnt mean i didnt feel his voice trembled and was manfully controlled that doesnt mean i dont see her face her eyes every time i try to sleep at night did you ever wonder what would have happened if youd gotten there five minutes sooner that jarred him and though she knew it was nasty and personal it pleased her yes i have he said with dignity i might have seen him or stopped him louise might be alive if i hadnt been caught in traffic but that doesnt change the facts shes dead and so are two others and you dont have anyone in custody maybe it hasnt occurred to you that youre feeding him that youve given him just what he wants she took her gaze from morse long enough to scan the room and all the people who were listening eagerly he must love watching all the reports hearing all the details the speculation youve made him the biggest star on the screen its our responsibility to report morse began morse you dont know shit about responsibility all you know is how to count the minutes youre on air front and center the more people die the bigger your ratings you can quote me on that one she turned on her heel feel better roarke asked her when they were outside again not a hell of a lot impressions the newsrooms in turmoil too many people doing too many things theyre all jumpy the one you talked to initially about nadine rigley hes a little fish i think they hired him for his teeth hes been biting his nails there were several others who looked ashamed when you made your little speech they turned away got very busy but they werent doing anything several more looked quietly pleased when you took a couple layers off morse i dont believe hes well liked big surprise hes better than id thought roarke mused morse at what slinging shit image roarke corrected which is often the same thing he pulls out all those emotions he doesnt feel any of them but he knows how to make them play over his face in his voice hes in the right field and will definitely move up god help us she leaned against roarkes car do you think he knows more than hes put on air i think its possible highly possible hes enjoying stringing this out particularly now that hes in charge of the story and he hates your guts oh now im hurt she started to open the door then turned back hates me hell ruin you if he can watch yourself he can make me look foolish but he cant ruin me she wrenched the door open where the hell is nadine its not like her roarke i understand how she feels about louise but its not like her to take off not to tell me to hand a story this size to that bastard people react in different ways to shock and grief its stupid she was a target she could still be a target we have to find her is that your way of squirming out of the opera eve got in the car stretched out her legs no thats just a little side benefit lets run by her place okay shes on eightieth between second and third all right but you have no excuse to squirm out of the cocktail party tomorrow night cocktail party what cocktail party the one i arranged fully a month ago he reminded her as he slipped in beside her to kick off the fundraiser for the art institute on station grimaldi which you agreed to attend and to help host she remembered all right hed brought home some fancy dress she was supposed to wear wasnt i drunk when i agreed the word of a drunk is worthless no you werent he smiled as he skimmed from the visitors lot you were however naked panting and i believe very close to begging bull actually she thought folding her arms he may have been right the details were hazy okay okay ill be there ill be there with a stupid smile in some fancy dress that cost you too much money for too little material unless something comes up something she sighed he only asked her to do one of his silly gigs when it was important to him police business only if its urgent police business barring that ill stick for the whole fussy mess i dont suppose you could try to enjoy it maybe i could she turned her head and on impulse lifted a hand to his cheek a little chapter eighteen no one answered the buzzer at nadines door the recording requested simply that the caller leave a message which would be returned at the earliest possible time she could be in there brooding eve mused rocking on her heels as she considered or she could be at some tony resort she slipped her guard plenty over the past few days shes a slick one our nadine and youll feel better if you know yeah brow furrowed eve considered using her police emergency code to bypass security she didnt have enough cause and she balled her hands in her pockets ethics roarke said its always an education to watch you struggle with them let me help you out he took out a small pocket knife and pried open the handplate jesus roarke tampering with security will get you six months house arrest umhmm calmly he studied the circuits im a bit out of practice we make this model you know put that damn thing back together and dont but he was already bypassing the main board working with a speed and efficiency that made her wince out of practice my butt she mumbled when the lock light went from red to green i always had a knack the door slid open and he tugged her inside security tampering breaking and entering private property trespass oh its just mounting up but youll wait for me wont you with one hand still on eves arm he studied the living area it was clean cool spare in furnishings but with an expensive minimalistic style she lives well he commented noting the gleam on the tile floor the few objects dart on spearing clear pedestals but she doesnt come here often eve knew he had a good eye and nodded no she doesnt really live here just sleeps here sometimes theres nothing out of place no dents in the cushions she walked past him toward the adjoining kitchen punched the available menu on the autochef doesnt keep a lot of food on hand either mostly cheese and fruit eve thought about her empty stomach was tempted but resisted she headed out across the wide living space toward a bedroom office she stated studying the equipment the console the wide screen it faced she lives here some shoes under the console single earring by the link empty cup probably coffee the second bedroom was larger the sheets on the unmade bed twisted as if someone had wrapped and unwrapped themselves through a particularly long night eve spotted the suit nadine had been wearing on the night of louises murder on the floor kicked under a table where a vase of daisies wilted they were signs of pain and they made her sorry she walked to the closet and hit the button to open it christ how could you tell if she packed anything shes got enough clothes for a tenwoman model troupe still she looked through them while roarke moved to the bedside link and ran the record disc back to the beginning eve glanced over her shoulder saw what he was up to she only moved her shoulders might as well completely invade her privacy eve continued to search for some sign that nadine had gone off on a trip while the calls and messages played back she listened with some amusement to some frank sexual byplay between nadine and some man named ralph there were a lot of innuendoes overt suggestions and laughter before the transmission ended with a promise to get together when he got into town other calls breezed by workoriented a call to a nearby restaurant for delivery ordinary everyday calls then it changed nadine was speaking to the kirskis the day after the last murder all of them were weeping maybe there was comfort in it eve thought as she walked toward the viewer maybe sharing tears and shock helped i dont know if it matters right now but the primary investigator dallas lieutenant dallas she wont stop until she finds out who did this to louise she wont stop oh man eve closed her eyes as the transmission ended there was nothing more just blank disc and she opened her eyes again wheres the call to the station she demanded wheres the call morse said she called in and requested time off could have done it from her car from a portable in person lets find out she whipped out her communicator feeney i need make model and id number on nadine fursts vehicle it didnt take long to access the data or to read the garage inventory and discover her car had been logged out the day before and hadnt been returned i dont like it eve fretted as she sat back in roarkes car shed have left me a message shed have left word i need to talk to some brass at the station find out who took her call she started to key it into roarkes car link then stopped one other thing taking out her log she requested a different number kirski deborah and james portland maine the number beeped on and she transferred it to the link it was answered quickly by a palehaired woman with exhausted eyes mrs kirski this is lieutenant dallas nypsd yes lieutenant i remember you is there any news theres nothing i can tell you right now im sorry damn it she had to give the woman something were pursuing some new information were hopeful mrs kirski we said goodbye to louise today she struggled to smile it was a comfort to see how many people cared for her so many of her friends from school and there were flowers messages from everyone she worked with in new york she wont be forgotten mrs kirski could you tell me if nadine furst attended the memorial today we expected her the swollen eyes looked lost a moment id spoken with her at her office only a few days ago to give her the date and time of the services she said she would be here but something must have come up she didnt make it a sour feeling spread in eves stomach you havent heard from her no not for a few days shes a very busy woman i know she has to get on with her life of course what else can she do eve could offer no comfort without adding worry im sorry for your loss mrs kirski if you have any questions or need to speak with me please call anytime youre very kind nadine said you wouldnt stop until youd found the man who did this to my girl you wont stop will you lieutenant dallas no maam i wont she broke transmission let her head fall back closed her eyes im not kind i didnt call her to say i was sorry but because she might have given me an answer but you were sorry roarke closed his hand gently over hers and you were kind i can count the people who mean something to me without coming close to double digits the same with the people i mean something to if hed have come after me like the bastard was supposed to i would have dealt with him and if i hadnt shut up his hand vised over hers with a force that had her muffling a yelp and his eyes were fierce and angry just shut up absently she nursed her hand as he raced along the street youre right im doing it wrong im taking it in and that doesnt help anything too much emotion on the case she murmured remembering the chiefs warning i started out today thinking clean and thats what ive got to keep doing next step is to find nadine she called dispatch and ordered an all points on the woman and her vehicle calmer with the twist of her earlier words unraveling in his gut he slowed glanced at her how many homicide victims have you stood for in your illustrious career lieutenant stood for thats an odd way of putting it she moved her shoulders trying to focus her mind on a man in a long dark coat with a shiny new car i dont know hundreds murder never goes out of style then id say youre well past the double digits on both sides you need to eat she was too hungry to argue with him o o the trouble with the crosscheck is metcalfs diary feeney explained its full of cutesy little codes and symbols and she changes them so we cant work a pattern weve got names like sweet face hot buns dumb ass we got initials we got stars hearts little smiley faces or scowly faces itll take time and lots of it to cross it with the copy of nadines or the prosecutors so what youre telling me is you cant do it i didnt say cant he looked insulted okay sorry i know youre busting your computer chips on this but i dont know how much time weve got hes got to go for somebody else until we find nadine you think he snatched her feeney scratched his nose his chin reached for his bag of little candied nuts that breaks pattern dallas and all three bodies he hit he left where someone was going to stumble over them pretty quick so hes got a new pattern she sat on the edge of the desk and immediately shifted off too edgy for stillness listen hes pissed he missed his target it was all going his way then he fucks up downloads the wrong woman if we go with mira he got plenty of attention hours of airtime but he failed its a power thing she wandered to her stingy window stared out watched as an airbus rumbled past at eye level like an awkward overweight bird below people were scattered like ants rushing on the sidewalks the ramps the handyglides to wherever their pressing business took them there were so many of them eve thought so many targets its a power thing eve repeated frowning down at the pedestrian traffic this womans been getting all the attention all the glory his attention his glory when he takes them out he gets the kick of the kill all the publicity the womans gone and thats good she was trying to run everything her way now the public is focused on him who is he what is he where is he youre sounding like mira feeney commented without the thousandcredit words maybe shes nailed him the what is he anyway she thinks male she thinks unattached because women are a problem for him cant let them get the upper hand like his mother did or the prominent female figure in his life hes had some success but not enough he cant quite get to the top maybe because a womans in the way or women she narrowed her eyes closed them women who speak she murmured women who use words to wield power thats a new one thats mine she said turning back he cuts their throats he doesnt rough them up doesnt sexually assault or mutilate its not about sexual power though its about sex if you term it as gender theres all sorts of ways to kill feeney tell me about it somebodys always finding some new inventive way to ditch somebody else he uses a knife and thats an extension of the body a personal weapon he could stab them in the heart rip them in the gut disembowel okay okay he swallowed a nut manfully and waved a hand you dont have to draw a picture towers made her mark in court her voice a powerful tool metcalf the actress dialogue furst talking to viewers maybe thats why he didnt go after me she murmured talking isnt my source of power youre doing all right now kid it doesnt really matter she said with a shake of the head what weve got is an unattached male in a career where hes unable to make a deep mark one who had a strong successful female influence fits david angelini yeah and his father if we add in the fact that his business is in trouble slade too mirina angelini isnt the fragile flower i thought she was theres hammett he was in love with towers but she wasnt taking him quite as seriously thats a squeeze on the balls feeney grunted shifted or theres a couple thousand men out there frustrated angry with violent tendencies eve hissed a breath through her teeth where the hell is nadine look they havent located her vehicle she hasnt been gone that long any record of her using credits in the last twentyfour hours no feeney sighed still if she decided to go off planet it takes longer to access she didnt go off planet shed want to stay close damn it i should have known shed do something stupid i could see how ripped she was i could see it in her eyes frustrated eve dragged her hands through her hair then her fingers curled in went tense i could see it in her eyes she repeated slowly oh my jesus the eyes what what the eyes he saw her eyes she leaped toward her link get me peabody she ordered field officer at the shit shit what is it the four oh two what have you got dallas lets wait she rubbed her fingers over her mouth lets just wait peabody the officers face flipped on screen irritation showing around the mouth there was a riot of noise on audio voices music christ peabody where are you crowd control irritation edged toward a sneer parade on lex its some irish thing freedom of the six counties day feeney said with a hint of pride dont knock it can you get away from the noise eve shouted sure if i leave my post and walk three blocks crosstown she remembered herself sir hell eve muttered and made do the kirski homicide peabody im going to transmit a picture of the body you take a look eve called up the file flipped through sent the shot of kirski sprawled in the rain is that how you found her exactly how you found her eve demanded over audio yes sir exactly eve pulled the image back left it in the bottom corner of her screen the hood over her face nobody messed with the hood no sir as i stated in my report the tv crew was taking pictures i moved them back sealed the door her face was covered to just above the mouth she had not been officially identified when i arrived on scene the statement from the witness who found the body was fairly useless he was hysterical you have the record yeah ive got the record thanks peabody so feeney began when she ended the transmission what does that tell you lets look at the record again morses initial statement eve eased back so that feeney could bring it up together they studied morse his face was wet with what looked like a combination of rain and sweat possibly tears he was white around the lips and his eyes jittered guys shook feeney commented dead bodies do that to some people peabodys good he added listening slow thorough yeah shell move up eve said absently then i saw it was a person a body god all the blood there was so much blood everywhere and her throat i got sick you could smell i got sick couldnt help it then i ran inside for help thats the gist of it eve steepled her hands tapped them against her jaw okay run through to where i talked to him after we shut down the broadcast that night he still looked pale she noted but he had that little superior smirk around his mouth shed run him through the details much the same as peabody had and received basically the same responses calmer now that was expected that was usual did you touch the body no i dont think no she was just lying there and her throat was wide open her eyes no i didnt touch her i got sick you probably dont understand that dallas some people have basic human reactions all that blood her eyes god he said almost the same thing to me yesterday eve murmured hed never forget her face her eyes dead eyes are spooky they can stay with you yeah hers have stayed with me she shifted her gaze to feeneys but nobody saw her face until i got there that night feeney the hood had fallen over it nobody saw her face before i did except the murderer jesus dallas you dont seriously think some little media creep like morse is slicing throats in his off time he probably added it for impact to make himself more important now her lips curved just a little in a smile more feral than amused yeah he likes being important doesnt he he likes being the focus what do you do when youre an ambitious unethical secondstring reporter feeney and you cant find a hot story he let out a low whistle you make one lets run his background see where our pal comes from it didnt take feeney long to pull up a basic sheet c j morse had been born in stamford connecticut thirtythree years before that was the first surprise eve would have pegged him as several years younger his mother deceased had been head of computer science at carnegie melon where her son had graduated with double majors in broadcasting and compuscience smart little fucker feeney commented twentieth in his class i wonder if it was good enough his employment record was varied hed bumped from station to station one year at a small affiliate near his hometown six months with a satellite in pennsylvania nearly two years at a toprated channel in new los angeles then a stretch in a halfbaked independent in arizona before heading back east another gig in detroit before hitting new york hed worked on all news then made the lateral transfer to channel first in the social data unit then into hard news our boy doesnt hold down a job long channel s his record with three years and theres no mention of his father in family data just mama feeney agreed a successful highly positioned mama a dead mama she thought theyd have to take time to check on how she died lets check criminal no record feeney said frowning at the screen a cleanliving boy go into juvie well well she said reading the data weve got ourselves a sealed record here feeney what do you suppose our cleanliving boy did in his misspent youth bad enough that somebody used an arm to have it sealed up wont take me long to find out he was cheering up fingers ready to dance ill want my own equipment and a green light from the commander do it and dig into each of those job positions lets see if there was any trouble i think ill take a swing by channel have a nice fresh chat with our boy were going to need more to take him down than a possible match with the psych profile then well get it she shrugged into her shoulder harness you know if i hadnt had such a personal beef with him i might have seen it before who benefited from the murders the media she locked in her weapon and the first murder took place when nadine was conveniently off planet on assignment morse could step right in and metcalf the fucker was on scene almost before i was it pissed me off but it never clicked he was so damn cool and then who finds kirskis body whos on air in minutes giving his personal report it doesnt make him a killer thats what the pas office is going to say they want a connection ratings she said as she headed for the door theres the goddamn connection chapter nineteen eve did a quick pass through the newsroom studied the viewing screens there was no sign of morse but that didnt worry her it was a big complex and he had no reason to hide no reason to worry she wasnt going to give him one the plan shed formulated on the trip over was simple not as satisfying as hauling him out by his camerafriendly hair and into lockup but simpler shed talk to him about nadine let it leak that she was worried from there it would be natural to steer things to kirski she could play good cop for a good cause she could sympathize with his trauma add a war story from her first encounter with the dead to nudge him along she could even ask him for help in broadcasting nadines picture her vehicle agree to work with him not too friendly she decided it should be grudging with underlying urgency if she was right about him hed love the fact that she needed him and that he could use her to pump up his own airtime then again if she was right about him nadine could already be dead eve blocked that out it couldnt be changed and regrets could come later looking for something eve glanced down the woman was so perfect eve might have been tempted to check for a pulse her face could have been carved from alabaster her eyes painted with liquid emerald her lips with crushed ruby onair talents were often known to leverage their first three years salaries against cosmetic enhancement eve figured unless this one had been born very lucky shed bet the first five her hair was goldtipped bronze swept up and away from that staggering face her voice was trained to a throaty purr that transmitted competent sex gossip line right social information larinda mars she offered a perfect longfingered hand with tapered scarlet tips and youre lieutenant dallas mars thats familiar it should be if larinda was irked that eve didnt place her instantly she hid it well behind a dazzling whitetoothed smile and a voice that held the faintest whiff of upperclass brit ive been trying for weeks to nail down an interview with you and your fascinating companion you havent returned my messages bad habit of mine just like thinking my personal life is personal when youre involved with a man like roarke personal life becomes public domain her gaze skittered down latched like a hook on a point between eves breasts my my thats quite a little bauble a gift from roarke eve bit off an oath closed her hand over the diamond shed taken to playing with it while she was thinking and had forgotten to shove it back under her shirt im looking for morse hmmm larinda had already calculated the size and value of the stone it would make a nice side piece to her broadcast cop wears billionaires ice i might be able to help you with that and youll return the favor theres a little soiree at roarkes tonight she fluttered her incredible twolayer twotoned lashes my invitation must have been lost thats roarkes deal talk to him oh an expert on button pushing larinda leaned back so he runs the show does he i suppose when a mans so used to making decisions he wouldnt consult the little woman im nobodys little woman eve shot back before she could stop herself she took a breath for control reevaluated the eerily beautiful face nice one larinda yes it was so how about a pass for tonight i can save you a lot of time looking for morse she added when eve sent a new narroweyed stare around the room prove it and well see he left five minutes before you walked in without looking larinda punched the call coming in on her link to hold practically she used a slim pointer rather than her expensive manicure in a hurry id say as he nearly knocked me off the ascent he looked quite ill poor baby the venom there had eve feeling more in tune with larinda you dont like him hes a puss ball larinda said in her melodious voice this is a competitive business darling and im not against stepping on someones back now and then to get ahead morse is the kind whod step on you then sneak in a nice kick to the crotch and never break a sweat he tried it with me when we were on the social beat together and how did you handle that she rolled a gorgeous shoulder darling i eat little weenies like him for breakfast still he wasnt altogether bad a whiz with research and a good camera presence just thought he was too manly to scoop up gossip social information eve corrected with a thin smile right anyway i wasnt sorry to see him shift over to hard news you wont find that hes made many friends there either hes cut nadine what bells rang in eves head he wants to anchor and he wants it solo every time hes on the news desk with her he pulls little shit steps on her lines adds a few seconds to his own time cuts her copy once or twice the teleprompters been screwed up on her copy too nobody could prove it but morse is the boy genius with electronics is he we all hate him she said cheerfully except upstairs the brass think hes good ratings and appreciate his killer instinct i wonder if they do eve murmured where did he go we didnt stop to chat but the way he looked id say home and bed he really looked sagged she moved her curvy shoulders sent some classy fragrance wafting up maybe hes still shaking about finding louise and i should have more sympathy but its tough when its morse now about that invitation wheres his station larinda sighed flipped her call onto message mode and rose over here she glided through the aisles proving that her body was every bit as impressive as her face whatever youre looking for you wont find it she sent a wicked smile over her shoulder did he do something did they finally pass a law making puss ball tendencies a crime i just need to talk to him why wont i find anything larinda paused at a corner cubicle the console facing out so that anyone sitting behind it had his back to the wall and his eyes on the room nice little sign of paranoia eve thought he never leaves anything out not the tiniest memo the bitsiest note he locks down his computer if he stands up to scratch his butt claims somebody stole some of his research on one of his other gigs he even uses an audio enhance so he can whisper on calls and nobody can hear as if we all strain to catch those golden words from his throat so how do you know he uses audio enhance larinda smiled good one lieutenant his consoles locked too she added discs secured she flicked up a glance from under goldtipped lashes being a detective you can probably figure out how i know that now the invite the cubicle was perfect eve thought awfully perfect for someone who had been hard at work then had dashed out ill does he have a source at cop central i guess he may though i cant imagine an actual human playing ball with morse does he talk about it brag about it hey in the gospel according to morse hes got toplevel sources in the four corners of the universe her voice lost a bit of its sophistication on the dig and whispered unmistakably of queens but he never scooped nadine well until the towerss murder but he didnt last long on that eves heart was pounding now strong and steady she nodded turned on her heel hey larinda called after her how about tonight tit for tat dallas no cameras or youre out before youre in eve warned and kept walking o o because she remembered her days in uniform and her ambition eve requested peabody as her backup hes going to remember your face eve waited impatiently as the elevator climbed to the thirtythird floor of morses building hes good with faces i dont want you to say anything unless i give you an opening then keep it brief official and look stern i was born looking stern maybe toy with the hilt of your stunner now and again you could look a little anxious the corner of peabodys mouth twitched like id like to use it but cant in the presence of a superior officer you got it she stepped off the elevator turned left feeneys still working on data so i dont have as much as id like to pressure him with the fact is i could be wrong but you dont think so no i dont think so but i was wrong about david angelini you built a good circumstantial case and he looked guilty as hell in interview at eves casual glance peabody flushed officers involved in a case are entitled to review all data pertaining to said case i know the drill peabody very cool very official eve announced herself through the entrance intercom you looking for a detective badge officer peabody squared her shoulders yes sir eve merely nodded announced herself again and waited walk down the hall peabody see if the emergency exit is secure sir walk down the hall eve repeated holding peabodys baffled gaze thats an order yes sir the minute peabodys back was turned eve took out her master code and disengaged the locks she slid the door open a fraction and had the code back in her bag before peabody came back secured sir good doesnt look like hes home unless well look here peabody the door isnt fully secured peabody looked at the door then back at eve and pursed her lips i would consider that unusual we could have a breakin here lieutenant mr morse may be in trouble youve got a point peabody lets put this on record while peabody engaged her recorder eve slid the door open drew her weapon morse this is lieutenant dallas nypds the entrance is unsecured we suspect a breakin and are entering the premises she stepped in signaled for peabody to stand tight she slipped into the bedroom checked closets and skimmed a glance over the communications center that took up more room than the bed no sign of an intruder she said to peabody then ducked into the kitchen where has our little bird flown she wondered pulling out her communicator she contacted feeney give me everything youve got so far im in his apartment and hes not im only about halfway there but i think youre going to like it first the sealed juvie record and i had to sweat for this one kid little c j had a problem with his social science instructor when he was ten she didnt give him an a on an assignment well that bitch thats what he figured apparently he broke into her house wrecked the place and killed her little doggie jesus killed her dog sliced its throat dallas ear to floppy ear ended up with mandatory therapy probation and community service thats good eve felt the pieces shifting into place keep going okay im here to serve our pal drives a brandnew twopassenger rocket god bless you feeney more he said preening a bit his first adult job was on dispatch at a little station in his own hometown he quit when another reporter jogged ahead of him to an onair assignment a woman dont stop now i think i love you all the gold shields do its my pretty face got on air on the next gig weekends only subbing for the first and second string left in a huff claiming discrimination assignment editor female better and better but heres the big one station he worked at in california he was making it pretty good there scrambled up from third string got a regular spot on the midday coanchoring with a woman yeah but thats not the big guns dallas wait for it pretty little weather girl that was pulling in all the mail brass liked her so much they let her do some of the soft features on the midday ratings went up when she was on and she started to get press of her own morse quit citing he refused to work with a nonprofessional that was just before the little weather girl got her big break a recurring bit part in a comedy want to guess her name eve closed her eyes tell me its yvonne metcalf give the lieutenant a cigar metcalf had a notation about meeting the dumb ass from the partly sunny days id say its a good bet our boy looked her up in our fair city funny he never mentioned they were old pals in his reports wouldve given them such a nice shine i do love you desperately im going to kiss your ugly face hey its lived in thats what my wife tells me yeah right i need a search warrant feeney and i need you here at morses to break down his computer ive already requested the warrant ill have it transmitted to you as soon as it comes in then im on my way o o sometimes the wheels moved smoothly eve had the warrant and feeney within thirty minutes she did kiss him enthusiastically enough to have him going red as a hybrid beet secure the door peabody then take the living area dont bother to be neat eve swung into the bedroom two steps ahead of feeney he was already rubbing his hands together thats a beautiful system he said whatever his faults the asshole knows his computers its going to be a pleasure to play with her he sat down as eve started to hunt through drawers obsessively trendy she commented nothing that shows too much sign of wear nothing too expensive hes putting all his money in his toys feeney hunched over brows knit this guy respects his equipment and hes careful there are code blocks everywhere jesus hes got a failsafe what eve straightened up on a home unit hes got one all right gingerly feeney eased back if i dont use the right code the datas zapped odds are its voice printed too its not going to let me in easy dallas im going to have to bring in some equipment and its going to take time hes on the run i know hes on the run he knew we were coming after him rocking back on her heels she considered the possibilities leaks human or electronic leaks call in your best man to come over here you take the computer at the station thats where he was when he ran its going to be a long night lieutenant peabody came to the door her face was impassive but for the eyes and the eyes were on fire i think youd better see this in the living room peabody gestured to the blocky platform sofa i was giving it the onceover probably would have missed it except my dad likes to build stuff he was always putting in hidden drawers and hideyholes we got a kick out of it used to play hidden treasure i got curious when i saw the knob on the side it looks like an ordinary decorative device that simulates oldfashioned turn bolts she stepped around the front of the couch and gestured eve could almost feel the vibrations rising from her skin peabodys voice rose slightly in octave hidden treasure eve felt her heart kick once hard there in a long wide drawer that slid from under the cushions lay a purple umbrella and a highheeled redandwhitestriped shoe got him eve turned to peabody with a fierce and powerful grin officer youve just taken one giant step toward your detective shield o o my man says youre harassing him eve scowled at feeneys face in her communicator im simply asking him for periodic updates she paced away from the sweepers who were scanning the living area of morses apartment they had the lights on high the sun was going down and interrupting his flow dallas i told you this would be slow work morse was an expert on compuscience he knew all the tricks hed have written it down feeney like a fucking news report and if hes got nadine thats on one of those damned discs too im with you on that kid but breathing down my mans neck isnt going to free up the data any quicker give us some space here for christs sake dont you have a fancy do tonight what she grimaced oh hell go put on your party dress and leave us alone im not going to dress up like some brainless idiot and eat canapes while hes out there hes going to be out there whatever youre wearing listen up weve got a citywide net out on him his car his apartments under heavy surveillance sos the station you cant help us here this parts my job i can slow up the process by making me talk to you he snapped go away dallas the minute i get anything the first byte ill call you in weve got him feeney weve got the who the what let me try to find the where if nadine furst is still alive every minute counts that was what haunted her she wanted to argue but there was no ammunition okay ill go but dont call me feeney interrupted ill call you he broke transmission before she could swear at him o o eve was trying hard to understand relationships the importance of balancing lives and obligations the value of compromise what she had with roarke was still new enough to fit snugly like a vaguely uncomfortable shoe and lovely enough to keep wearing it until it stretched to accommodate so she dashed into the bedroom at a full run saw him standing in the dressing area and launched into the offense strategy dont give me any grief about being late summerset already handled that she whipped off her harness tossed it on a chair roarke finished securing a square of gold to his cuff hands elegant steady you dont answer to summerset he looked at her then a brief flick of the eyes as she tugged off her shirt nor to me look i had work naked from the waist up she dropped into a chair to pull off her boots i said id be here and im here i know guests are going to be arriving in ten minutes she heaved a boot aside as summersets abrasive words scraped through her head ill be ready i dont take hours to put some dress on and trowel a bunch of gunk on my face boots disposed of she arched her hips and wiggled out of her jeans before they hit the floor she was dashing into the adjoining bath with a smile for the exit roarke followed her theres no hurry eve you dont clock in to a cocktail party or get docked for tardiness i said id be ready she stood in the crisscrossing sprays of his shower lathering pale green liquid into her hair suds dripped into her eyes ill be ready fine but no one will be offended if you come down in twenty minutes or thirty for that matter do you expect me to be annoyed with you because you have another life she swiped at her stinging eyes tried to see him through suds and steam maybe then youre doomed to disappointment if you recall i met you via that other life and i have a number of other obligations as well he watched her rinse her hair it was pleasant to see the way she tilted her face back the way water and soap sleeked down and away from her skin im not trying to box you in im just trying to live with you she blew her wet hair out of her eyes as he opened the body dryer for her she stepped toward it pivoted then surprised him by grabbing his face in both of her hands and kissing him with a burst of enthusiasm it cant be easy she stepped into the tube and hit the power that swirled warm dry air over her i can have a hard time living with myself sometimes i wonder why you dont just deck me when i start on you its occurred to me but youre so often armed dry and fragrant from the perfumed soap she stepped out im not now he caught her by the waist then stroked his hands down over her firm muscled bottom other things occur to me when youre naked yeah she wrapped her arms around his neck enjoying the fact that by rising slightly on her toes they were eye to eye mouth to mouth like what with more than a little regret he eased her back to arms length why dont you tell me why youre so revved maybe its because i like seeing you in a fancy shirt she moved away tugged a short dressing robe off a hanger or maybe its because im stimulated by the idea of wearing shoes that will make my arches scream for the next couple hours she peered into the mirror and supposed she was obliged to put on a little of the paint mavis was always pushing off on her leaning closer she steadied the lash darkener and lengthener closed it firmly over the lashes of her left eye and hit the plunger just maybe she continued glancing around its because officer peabody found the hidden treasure good for officer peabody what hidden treasure eve dealt with her right eyelashes then blinked them experimentally one umbrella and one shoe youve got him taking her shoulders roarke kissed her on the nape of the neck congratulations weve nearly got him she corrected she tried to remember what was next and chose lipstick mavis touted the virtues of lip dye but eve was wary of a color commitment that could last for three weeks weve got the evidence the sweep confirmed his prints on the souvenirs his and the victims only on the umbrella got a few others on the shoe but we expect salespeople or other customers brandnew shoes hardly a scuff on the bottoms and she picked up several pairs at saks right before she died she went back to the bedroom remembered the scented cream roarke had brought back from paris and shrugged out of the robe to smear it on the problem is we dont have him he got tipped somehow that i was coming and skipped feeneys working on his equipment now to see if we can shake loose some data thatll lead us to him theres a net out but he may have ditched the city i wouldnt have made it tonight but feeney gave me the boot said i was harassing his man she opened the closet pushed for revolve and spotted the minuscule coppercolored dress she took it out held it in front of her the sleeves were long and snug from a deep scooped neck the skirt ended somewhere just south of the law am i supposed to wear anything under this he reached in her top drawer pulled out a matching colored triangle that might have laughingly been called panties these should do it she caught them from his underhand toss wiggled in jesus she said after a quick look in the mirror why bother since it was too late to debate she stepped into the dress and began to tug the clingy material up its always entertaining to watch you dress but im distracted at the moment i know i know go on down ill be right there no eve who who she snapped the low shoulders into place didnt i say no roarke said with admirable patience you didnt morse she ducked into the closet for shoes youre joking c j morse she held the shoes as she might hold a weapon and her eyes went dark and fixed and when im finished with the little son of a bitch hes going to get more airtime than he ever dreamed of the inhouse link beeped summersets disapproving voice floated out the first guests are arriving sir fine morse he said to eve thats right ill fill you in between canapes she scooped a hand through her hair told you id be ready oh and roarke she linked fingers with him as they started from the room i need you to pass a lastminute guest through for me larinda mars chapter twenty eve supposed there could have been worse ways to wait through the last stages of an investigation the atmosphere had it all over her cramped office at cop central and the food was certainly a long leg up from the eatery roarke had opened up his domeceilinged reception room with its glossy wood floors mirrored walls and sparkling lights long curved tables followed the rounded walls and were artistically crowded with exotic finger foods colorful bitesized eggs harvested from the dwarf pigeons of the moons farm colony delicate pink shrimp from the sea of japan elegant cheese swirls that melted on the tongue pastries pumped with pates or creams in a menagerie of shapes the gleam of caviar heaped on shaved ice the richness of fresh fruit with frosty sugar coating there was more the hot table across the room steamed with heat and spices one entire area was a treasure trove for those of a vegetarian persuasion with another at a discreet distance decked out for carnivores roarke had opted for live music rather than simulation and the band out on the adjoining terrace played quiet conversationenhancing tunes they would heat up as the night went on to seduce dancers through the swirl of color of scent of gleam and gloss waiters in severe black wandered with silver trays topped with crystal flutes of champagne this is so decent mavis popped a black button mushroom in her mouth shed dressed conservatively for the occasion which meant a great deal of her skin was actually covered and her hair was a tame medium red being mavis so were her irises i cant believe roarke actually invited me youre my friend yeah hey you think if later on after everybodys imbibed freely could i ask the band to let me do a number eve scanned the rich privileged crowd the glint of real gold and real stones and smiled i think that would be great superior mavis gave eves hand a quick squeeze im going to go talk to the band now sort of worm my way into their hearts lieutenant eve shifted her gaze from maviss retreating form over and up into chief tibbles face sir youre looking unprofessional tonight when she squirmed he laughed that was a compliment roarke puts on quite a show yes sir he does its for a worthy cause but she couldnt quite remember what that worthy cause was i happen to think so my wife is very involved he took a flute from a passing tray and sipped my only regret is that these monkey suits never go out of style with his free hand he tugged at his collar it made her smile you should try wearing these shoes theres a heavy price for fashion id rather be dowdy and comfortable but she resisted tugging at her buttmolding skirt well he took her arm eased her toward a shielding arborvitae now that weve exchanged the obligatory small talk id like to tell you youve done an excellent job on the investigation i bumped with angelini no you pursued a logical line then you backtracked and found pieces others had missed the albino junkie was a fluke sir just luck luck counts so does tenacity and attention to detail you cornered him dallas hes still at large he wont get far his own ambition will help us find him his face is known eve was counting on it sir officer peabody did fine work she has a sharp eye and good instincts so you noted in your report i wont forget it when he glanced at his watch she realized he was as edgy as she i promised feeney a bottle of irish whiskey if he broke it by midnight if that doesnt do it nothing will she put on a smile there was no use reminding the chief that they hadnt found the murder weapon in morses apartment he already knew when she spotted marco angelini step into the room her shoulders stiffened excuse me chief tibble theres someone i have to speak to he laid a hand on her arm it isnt necessary dallas yes sir it is she knew the moment he became aware of her by the quick upward jut of his chin he stopped linked his hands behind his back and waited mr angelini lieutenant dallas i regret the difficulties i caused you and your family during the investigation do you his eyes were cool unblinking accusing my son of murder subjecting him to terror and humiliation bringing more grief upon already impossible grief putting him behind bars when his only crime was witnessing violence she could have justified her actions she could have reminded him that his son had not only witnessed violence but had turned away from it without a thought but to his own survival and had compounded his crime by attempting to bribe his way out of involvement i regret adding to your familys emotional trauma i doubt if you understand the phrase he skimmed his eyes down and i wonder if had you not been so busy enjoying your companions position you might have caught the real murderer its easy enough to see what you are youre an opportunist a climber a media whore marco roarke spoke softly as he laid a hand on eves shoulder no she went stiff under the touch dont defend me let him finish i cant do that im willing to take your state of mind into account marco as the reason you would attack eve in her own home you dont want to be here he said in an undertone of steel that indicated he was taking nothing into account ill show you out i know the way marcos eyes stabbed at eve well put our business association to an end as soon as possible roarke i no longer trust your judgment hands balled into fists at her side eve trembled with fury as marco strode away why did you do that i could have handled it you could have roarke agreed and turned her to face him but that was personal no one absolutely no one comes into our home and speaks to you that way she tried to shrug it off summerset does roarke smiled touched his lips to hers the exception for reasons too complicated to explain he rubbed away the frown line between her brows with his thumb okay i guess im not going to be exchanging christmas cards with the angelinis well learn to live with it how about some champagne in a minute im going to go freshen up she touched his face it was getting easier to do that to touch him when they werent alone i guess i ought to tell you that mars has a recorder in her bag roarke gave the dent in her chin a quick flick she did i have it in mine now after i let her crowd me at the vegetarian table very slick you never mentioned pickpocketing as one of your skills you never asked remind me to ask and ask a lot ill be back she didnt care about freshening up she wanted a few minutes to simmer down and maybe a few more to call feeney though she imagined hed bite her head off for interrupting his compusearch he still had an hour to go before he lost his bottle of irish she didnt think it would hurt to remind him she was at the door to the library preparing to code herself in when summerset melted out of the shadows behind her lieutenant you have a call termed both personal and urgent feeney he did not grant me his name summerset said down his nose ill take it in here she had the small but worthy satisfaction of letting the door close smartly in his face lights she ordered and the room brightened shed almost gotten used to the walls of books with leather bindings and paper pages that crackled when you leafed through for once she didnt give them so much as a glance as she hurried to the link on roarkes library desk she engaged then froze surprise surprise morse beamed at her bet you werent expecting me all dressed up for your party i see you look flash ive been looking for you c j oh yeah i know youve been looking for a lot of things i know this is on record and it doesnt matter but you listen close you keep this between you and me or im going to start slicing off little tiny pieces of a friend of yours say hi to dallas nadine he reached out and nadines face came on screen eve whod seen terror too many times to count looked at it now has he hurt you nadine i she whimpered when he jerked her head back by the hair touched a long slim blade to her throat now you tell her ive been real nice to you tell her he skimmed the flat of the blade over her throat bitch im fine im okay she closed her eyes and a tear squeezed through im sorry shes sorry morse said between pursed lips and pressed his cheek to nadines so both of their faces were in view shes sorry she was so hungry to be top bitch that she slipped the guard you put on her and fell right into my waiting arms isnt that right nadine yes and im going to kill you but not quick like the others im going to kill you slowly and with a lot of pain unless your pal the lieutenant does everything i say isnt that right you tell her nadine hes going to kill me she pressed her lips together hard but nothing would stop the trembling hes going to kill me dallas thats right you dont want her to die do you dallas its your fault louise died yours and nadines fault she didnt deserve it she knew her place she wasnt trying to be top cunt its your fault shes dead you dont want that to happen again he still had the knife at nadines throat and eve could see his hand shake what do you want morse calling up miras profile she carefully hit the right buttons youre in control you call the shots thats right his smile exploded damn right youve got my position coming up on screen by now you see im at a nice quiet spot in greenpeace park where nobodys going to bother us all those nice greenlovers planted these pretty trees its a wonderful spot of course nobody comes here after dark unless theyre smart enough to know how to bypass the electronic field that discourages loiterers and chemiheads youve got exactly six minutes to get here so we can conduct our negotiations six minutes i can barely make that at full speed if i run into traffic then dont he snapped six minutes from end of transmission dallas ten seconds over ten seconds you might use to call this in to contact anyone to so much as blink for backup and i start ripping nadine you come alone if i smell an extra cop i start on her you want her to come alone right nadine as incentive he turned the point of the blade to prick a narrow slice at the side of her throat please she tried to arch back as the blood trickled please cut her again and i wont deal youll deal morse said six minutes starting now the screen went blank eves finger poised over the controls thought of dispatch of the dozens of units that could be around the park in minutes she thought of leaks electronic leaks and she thought of the blood dribbling down nadines throat she bolted across the room and hit the elevator panel on the run she needed her weapon o o c j morse was having the time of his life hed begun to see that hed sold himself short by killing quickly there was so much more kick in courting fear seducing it watching it swell and climax he saw it in nadine fursts eyes they were glassy now the pupils huge slick and black with barely a rim of color at the edges he was he realized with great relish literally scaring her to death he hadnt cut her again oh he wanted to and made sure he showed her the knife often so that she would never lose the fear that he could but a part of him worried about the cunt cop not that he couldnt handle her morse mused he could handle her the only way women understood by killing her but he wouldnt make it fast like the others shed tried to outsmart him and that was an insult he wouldnt tolerate women always tried to run the show always got in the way just when you were about to grab that fat brass ring it had happened to him all of his life all of his fucking life starting with his pushy bitch of a mother you havent done your best c j use your brains for gods sake youll never get through life on looks or charm you havent got any i expected more from you if you cant be the best youll be nothing hed taken it hadnt he smiling to himself he began to stroke nadines hair while she shuddered hed taken it for years playing the good devoted son while at night hed dreamed of ways to kill her wonderful dreams sweaty and sweet where hed finally silenced that grating demanding voice so i did he said conversationally touching the tip of the knife to the pulse jerking in nadines throat and it was so easy she was all alone in that big important house busy with her big important business and i walked right in c j she said what are you doing here dont tell me youve lost your job again youll never succeed in life unless you focus and i just smiled at her and i said shut up mother shut the fuck up and i cut her throat to demonstrate he trailed the blade over nadines throat lightly just enough to scrape the skin she gushed and she goggled and she shut the fuck up but you know nadine i learned something from the old bitch it was time i focused i needed a goal and i decided that goal would be to rid the world of loudmouthed pushy women the ball breakers of the world like towers and metcalf like you nadine he leaned over kissed her dead center of the forehead just like you she was reduced to whimpers her mind had frozen shed stopped trying to twist her wrists out of the restraints stopped trying anything she sat docile as a doll with the occasional quiver breaking her stillness you kept trying to shove me aside you even went to management to try to get me off the news desk you told them i was a he tapped the blade against her throat for emphasis pain in the ass you know that bitch towers wouldnt even give me an interview she embarrassed me nadine wouldnt even acknowledge me at press conferences but i fixed her a good reporter digs right nadine and i dug and i got a nice juicy story about her darling daughters idiot lover oh i sat on it and sat on it while the happy mother of the bride to be made all her wedding plans i could have blackmailed her but that wasnt the goal was it she was so ticked when i called her that night when i dumped it all in her face his eyes narrowed they gleamed she was going to talk to me then nadine oh you bet she was going to talk shed have tried to ruin me even though i was only going to report the facts but towers was a big fucking deal and she would have tried to squash me like a bug thats exactly what she said over the link but she did exactly what she was told and when i walked toward her on that nasty little street she sneered at me the bitch sneered at me and she said youre late now you little bastard were going to set things straight he laughed so hard he had to press a hand to his stomach oh i set her straight gush and goggle just like my dear old mother he gave nadine a quick slap on the top of the head rose and faced the camera he had set up this is c j morse reporting as the clock ticks away the seconds it appears that the heroic lieutenant cunt will not arrive in time to save her fellow bitch from execution though it has long been considered a sexist cliche this experiment has proven that women are always late he laughed uproariously and gave nadine a careless backhanded slap that knocked her back on the bench where hed put her after one last highpitched giggle he controlled himself and frowned soberly into the lens the public broadcasting of executions was banned in this country in five years before the supreme court once again ruled that capital punishment was unconstitutional of course the court was forced into that decision by five idiot bigmouthed women so this reporter deems that ruling null and void he took a small pocket beam out of his jacket before turning to nadine im going to key into the station now nadine on air in twenty thoughtfully he tilted his head you know you could use a little makeup its a pity there isnt time im sure youd want to look your best for your final broadcast he walked to her laid the length of the knife at her throat and faced the camera in ten nine eight he glanced over at the sound of rushing feet on the crushed stone path well well here she is now and with seconds to spare eve skidded to a halt on the path and stared shed seen a great deal in her decade on the force plenty that she often wished could be erased from her memory but shed never seen anything to compare with this shed followed the light the single light that beamed a circle around the tableau the park bench where nadine sat passively blood drying on her skin a knife at her throat c j morse behind her dressed nattily in a roundcollared shirt and colorcoordinated jacket facing a camera on a slim tripod its red light beamed as steadily as judgments eye what the hell are you doing morse live stand up he said cheerfully please step into the light lieutenant so our viewers can see you keeping her eyes on his eve stepped into the circle o o shed been gone too long roarke thought and found himself irritated by the party chat obviously shed been more upset than hed realized and he regretted not dealing with angelini more effectively damn if hed let her brood or take on blame the only way to make sure she didnt was to amuse or annoy the mood out of her he slipped quietly from the room away from the lights and music and voices the house was too big to search but he could pinpoint her location with one question eve he said the moment summerset stepped from a room to the right shes gone what do you mean gone gone where because discussing the woman always put summersets back up he lifted his shoulders i couldnt say she simply ran out of the house got into her vehicle and drove off she did not deign to inform me of her plans the nasty twisting in roarkes gut sharpened his voice dont fuck with me summerset why did she leave insulted summerset tightened his jaw perhaps it was due to the call she received a few moments ago she took it in the library turning on his heel roarke strode to the library door uncoded it with summerset at his heels he stepped up to the table replay last call as he watched listened the twisting in his gut turned to a burning that was fear christ jesus shes gone for him shes gone alone he was out of the door and moving fast the order shot over his shoulder like a laser relay that information to chief tibble privately o o though our time is short lieutenant im sure our viewers would be fascinated by the investigative process morse kept the pleasant camera smile on his face the knife at nadines throat you did pursue a false lead for a time and were i believe on the point of charging an innocent man why did you kill them morse oh ive documented that extensively for future broadcast lets talk about you you must have felt terrible when you realized youd killed louise kirski instead of nadine i felt very bad about that sickened louise was a nice quiet woman with an appropriate attitude but it wasnt my fault it was yours and nadines for trying to bait me you wanted exposure she flicked a glance toward the camera youre certainly getting it now but this is putting you in a spot morse you wont get out of this park now oh i have a plan dont worry about me and we have just a few minutes left before we have to end this the public has a right to know i want them to see this execution but i wanted you to see it in person to witness what you caused she looked at nadine no help there she noted the woman was in deep shock possibly drugged i wont be as easy to take youll be more fun how did you take nadine eve stepped closer keeping her eyes on his and her hands in sight you had to be clever im very clever people women in particular dont give me enough credit i just leaked a tip to her about the murders a message from a frightened witness who wanted to speak to her alone i knew shed ditch her guard an ambitious woman after the big story i got her in the parking garage just as simple as that gave her a dose of a deep tranq loaded her in her own trunk and drove off left her and the car in a little rent space zone way downtown you were smart she stepped closer stopping when he lifted his brows and pressed the knife more firmly really smart she said lifting her hands up you knew i was coming for you how did you know you think your wrinkled pal feeney knows everything about computers hell i can run rings around that hacker ive been keyed in to your system for weeks every transmission every plan every step you took i was always ahead of you dallas yeah you were ahead of me you dont want to kill her morse you want me im the one who ragged on you gave you all the grief why dont you let her go shes zoned anyway take me on he flashed his quick boyish smile why dont i kill her first then you eve lifted a shoulder i thought you liked a challenge guess i was wrong towers was a challenge you had to do a lot of fast talking to get her where you wanted her but metcalf was nothing are you serious she thought i was puss he bared his teeth hissed through them shed still be doing weather if she hadnt had tits and they were giving her my airtime my fucking airtime i had to pretend i was a big fan tell her i was going to do a twentyminute feature on her just her told her we had a shot at international satellite and she bit good so she met you that night on the patio yeah she got herself all slicked up was all smiles and no hard feelings tried to tell me she was glad id found my niche my goddamn niche well i shut her up you did i guess you were pretty smart with her too but nadine shes not saying anything she cant even think right now she wont know youre paying her back ill know times up you might want to stand to the side dallas or youre going to get blood all over your party dress wait she took a step and feinting to the side and reaching a hand to the small of her back she whipped out her weapon blink you bastard and ill fry you he did blink several times it seemed to him the weapon had come from nowhere you use that my hands going to jerk shell be dead before i am maybe eve said steadily maybe not youre dead either way drop the knife morse step away from her or your nervous systems going to go on fast overload bitch you think youre going to beat me he jerked nadine to her feet shielding himself from a clean shot then shoved her forward eve caught nadine with one arm while she aimed with her weapon hand but he was already into the trees seeing no choice eve slapped nadine hard front handed then back snap out of it goddamn it hes killing me nadines eyes rolled back then forward when eve hit her again get moving do you hear me you get moving call this in now call it in that way eve gave nadine a shove toward the path hoped shed stay on her feet and dashed toward the trees hed said he had a plan and she didnt doubt it even if he managed to get out of the park theyd bring him in eventually but he was primed to kill now some woman walking her dog on the sidewalk or someone coming home from a late date hed use the knife on anyone now because hed failed again she stopped in the shadows ears straining for sound breath rigidly controlled dimly she could hear the sounds of street and air traffic could see the lights of the city beyond the thick border of trees a dozen paths spread out before her that would wind through the glade and the gardens so lovingly planted so carefully designed she heard something perhaps a footstep perhaps a bush rustled by some small animal with her weapon blinking ready she stepped deeper into the shadows there was a fountain its waters silent in the dark a small childrens playground with glide swings twisty slides the foamy jungle gym that prevented little climbers from bruising shins and elbows she scanned the area cursing herself for not grabbing a search beam out of her car there was too much dark pouring dangerously out of the trees too much silence hanging on the air like a shroud then she heard the scream hed circled back she thought the bastard has circled back and gone for nadine after all eve spun around and her instinct to protect saved her life the knife caught her on the collarbone a long shallow cut that stung ridiculously she blocked with her elbow connected with his jaw spoiled his aim but the blade flew out slicing her just above the wrist her weapon spun uselessly out of her wounded hand you thought i was going to run his eyes glowed sickly in the dark as he circled her women always underestimate me dallas im going to cut you to pieces im going to rip your throat he jabbed sending her back a step im going to rip your guts he swung again and she felt the wind from the blade im in charge now arent i like hell her kick was well aimed a womans ultimate defense he went down air bursting through his lips like a popped balloon the knife clattered on stone and she was on him he fought like what he was a madman his fingers tore at her his teeth snapped as they sought flesh to sink into her wounded arm was slick with blood and slipped off him as she struggled to find the point under his jaw that would immobilize him they rolled over the crushed stone and trimmed sod viciously silent but for grunts and labored breathing his hand dug along the path for the hilt of the knife hers clawing after it then stars exploded in her head as he pumped his fist into her face she was dazed for only an instant but she knew she was dead she saw the knife and her fate and sucked in her breath to meet it later she would think it had sounded like a wolf that howl of rage a blood cry morses weight was off of her his body spinning away she rolled to her hands and knees shaking her head the knife she thought frantically the goddamn knife but she couldnt find it and crawled toward the dull gleam of her weapon it was in her hand poised when her mind cleared enough to understand two men were fighting grappling like dogs in the pretty playground and one of them was roarke get away from him she scrambled to her feet teetered braced get away from him so i can get a shot they rolled again end over end roarkes hand gripped morses but morses held the knife through the rage the duty the instinct came a titanic jittering fear weak still losing blood she leaned back on the padded bars of the gym steadied her weapon hand with the other in the dappled moonlight she could see roarkes fist plunge hear the crack of bone on bone the knife strained the blade angling then she watched it plunge watched it quiver as it found its home in morses throat someone was praying when roarke got to his feet she realized it was herself she stared at him let her weapon lower his face was fierce his eyes hot enough to burn there was blood soaking his elegant dinner jacket youre a goddamn mess she managed you should look at yourself his breathing was labored and he knew from experience that he would feel every miserable bruise and scrape later dont you know its rude to leave a party without making your excuses legs trembling with reaction she took a step toward him then stopped swallowing the sob that was bubbled in her throat sorry im sorry god are you hurt she launched herself at him all but burrowing when he caught her close did he cut you are you cut she yanked back began to fumble at his clothes eve he jerked her chin up steadied it youre bleeding badly he caught me a couple times she swiped a hand under her nose its not bad but roarke was already using a square of irish linen from his pocket to staunch and wrap the arm wound and its my job she took a deep breath felt the black edges around her vision creeping back until she could see clearly where are you cut its his blood roarke said calmly not mine his blood she nearly wobbled again forced her knees to lock youre not hurt nothing major concerned he angled her head back to examine the shallow slice along her collarbone the rapidly swelling eye you need a medic lieutenant in a minute let me ask you something ask away having nothing else he tore part of his ripped sleeve to dab at the blood on her shoulder do i come charging into one of your board rooms when youre having trouble with a business deal his eyes flicked to hers some of the fierceness died out of them into what was almost a smile no eve you dont i dont know what got into me its okay since there was nowhere else to put it she jabbed her weapon onto her lower back where shed fixed it with adhesive this once she murmured and caught his face in her hands its okay its okay i was scared when i couldnt get past you for a shot i thought he would kill you before i could stop him then you should understand the feeling giving her a supporting arm around the waist they began to limp off after a moment eve realized she was limping primarily because shed lost a shoe hardly breaking stride she stepped out of the other then she spotted lights up ahead cops i imagine i ran into nadine as she was stumbling along the path toward the main gate hed given her a pretty rough time but shed pulled it together enough to tell me which direction youd gone off in i could probably have dealt with the bastard on my own eve murmured recovered enough to worry about it but you sure handled yourself roarke you got a real knack for hand to hand neither of them mentioned how the knife had come to be planted in morses throat she saw feeney in the circle of light near the camera with a dozen other cops he merely shook his head and signaled for the medteam nadine was already on a stretcher pale as wax dallas she lifted a hand let it fall i blew it eve leaned over as one of the medics

full working order the mts knew their stuff i want you to marry me uhhuh well well she stopped nearly stumbled then gaped at him with her good eye you want what i want you to marry me he had a bruise on his jaw blood on his coat and a gleam in his eye she wondered if hed lost his mind were standing here beat to shit walking away from a crime scene where either or both of us could have bought it
