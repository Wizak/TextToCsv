concludes by remaining incog illustrations plate i nothing to eat plate ii the dining saloon plate iii the invitation to dinner plate iv kitty malones inheritance plate v the meat market plate vi the dinner plate vii the water cure plate viii after dinner nothing to eat not by the author of nothing to wear the argument though famine prevails not at all in the city though none of starvation have died in the street yet many there are now exciting our pity whore daily complaining of nothing to eat the everyday cry and the everyday fare thats every day heard where the livewells are dining is nothing to eat or else nothing to wear which naked and starving rich merdles are whining theres kitty malone mrs merdle tis now was ever on earth here before such a sinner protesting excusing and swearing a vow shed nothing worth eating to give us for dinner why kitty if starving for want of a meal and hadnt a cent in the world to buy meat you wouldnt exclaim with a more pious zeal im dying of hunger weve nothing to eat the proof the queen of fashion the point i advance if it need confirmation ill prove by a witness that few will dispute a pink of perfection and truth in the naion where fashion and folly are all of a suit tis merdle the banker or rather his wife whose fashion religion or music or dress is followed consulted by many through life as pilots are followed by ships in distress for moneys a pilot a master a king which men follow blindly through quicksands and shoals where pilots their ships in a moment might fling to destruction the vessel and cargo and souls twas money made kitty of fashion the queen and fortune oft lends queens the scepter so fortune and fashion with this one weve seen her money and fortune in fashion has kept her while slaves of the queen with her hoops rules the day expanding their utmost extent of expansion and mandates of fashion most freely obey and would if it bid all their souls to extinction the object aimed at but what lady patron as queen holds the sway or sweeping whose hoops in the street are most sweeping the burthen is not of this truthtelling lay that should in its reading the world set to weeping while telling the suffrings from head to the feet of poor human beings with nothing to eat what another poet did another expounder of lifes thorny mazes excited our pity at fortunes hard fare and troubled the citys most troublesome places while singing his ditty of nothing to wear a tale worth the telling though i tell for the same great objects of pity we see in the street with nothing to wear though a legion by name is not to buy clothing but something to eat how the author sometimes dines and now by your leave i will try to expound it in truth as it is and the way that i found it my dinner sometimes like things transcendental and things more substantial like women and wine a thing is uncertain and quite accidental and sometimes i wonder oh where shall i dine it was when reflecting one evening of late what tavern or hotel or diningroom skinner with table cloth dirty and dirtier plate would give me a nausea and call it a dinner i met with jack merdle a name fully known as good for a million in stockgamblers street where none but a nabob or forger high flown with bulls or with bears need look for a seat merdle the banker now merdle this day having tossd with his horns the bears that were pulling so hard at the stocks and gored every bull that was treading his corns had lined all his pockets with plenty of rocks and home now was driving at two forty speed where dinner was waiting a jolly good feed himself feeling happy he knew by my looks a case full of sadness and deep destitution was present in person not read of in books appealing in pity for an alms institution places where mortals dine the case too was urgent for there stood a sinner whose fate hung on chance a chance for his dinner a chance for all mortals with truth i assert who eat where his chance was to counteract fate to eat during life each a peck of pure dirt by eating at once the whole peck from one plate for true when i think of the places we eat at or rather the places by hunger when driven we rush in and swallow our bread and our meat at a bushel good measure in life will be given to those who are living a boardinghouse life or those who are driven by fortune to journey and eat when we must with so dirty a knife i wisht could be done by the power of attorney or where you must eat in a place called saloon or coffeehouse synonym of whisky and rum i wish all the breed were sent off to the moon and earth was well clear of the coffeehouse scum or where restauration hangs out for sign at barroom or cellar or dirty back room where dishcloths for napkins are thought extra fine and table cloths look as though washed with a broom where knives waiters spit on and wipe on their sleeves and plates needing polish with coat tails are cleaned where priests dine with harlots and judges with thieves and mayors with villains his worship has screened illustration where knives waiters spit on and wipe on their sleeves and plates needing polish with coat tails are cleaned things that mortals eat there and what do you eat in the mess there compounded for roast beef the gravy the soapman should claim the soup some odd things might turn up if sounded and other madedishes might turn up the same decoctions that puzzle your chemical skill you get if you call either coffee or tea and milk that is made with and tastes of the swill as like milk as wine is that often we see is like to the juice of the grape in perfection or like as the candidate after election is like the fair thing that we hoped or expected before the base thief was exposed or detected as like truth and virtue and more is the pity the men we elected to rule our own city in council while sitting though common we call them in common opinion if people at large ares common in morals no worse could befal em if satan should take them at once in his charge if food as their filth was as plenty for diet no lack would they feel of the coveted cash or power they maintain with the power of a riot when heads of opponents are served up as hash by starchamber cooks of the club restoration that rules now the city and would rule the nation if sachems were willing the wigwam to yield and give the archtraitor a fair fighting field illustration jack warden drove up in his carriage and bays but fighting just now is not our intention but dining with merdle the banker in state and only these items like side dishes mention while waiting the coming the main dinner plate the invitation while waiting debating i stated before jack merdle drove up in his carriage and bays halloo said the banker i see youre ashore no wonder this weather is all in a haze but come in my carriage and truly confess youre a victim of hunger and dinner down town a case of most common distressing distress when dining in public with jones smith or brown or some other practical men of the nation is worse on the whole than a little starvation but come home with me for the sake of lang syne and see mrs merdle and see how we dine i must not expect he advised in advance to meet with a dinner got up in perfection but must run the risk of the luck and the chance as candidates do on the day of election the merdle origin now merdle en passant i had known for a score of years when a dinner with jones brown or smith as good as one gets for a quarter or more was a thing unthought of or else but a myth in merdes daydreaming of things yet in store when hope painted visions of a painted abode and hope never hoped for anything more im sure never dreamed he would dine a la mode in dreams wildest fancy i doubt if he dreamed that time in its changes that wears rocky shores should change what so changeless certainly seemed till merdle jack merdle would own twenty stores much more own a bank een the horse that he rode or pay half the debts of the wild oats he sowed i knew when he worked at his old fathers trade and thought he would stick to his wax and the last but fortune the fickle incontinent jade a turn to his fortune has given a cast a wife with a fortune which men hunt in packs to jack was the fortune that fell to his share a fortune that often is such a hard tax that men hurry through it with nothing to spare with nothing to eat or a house fit to live in with nothing half decent to put on their backs with nothing exclusive to have or believe in except what is common to common street hacks so fortune and comfort that should be like brothers though fought for and bled for where fortunes are made though sought for and failed of by ten thousand others are not worth the fighting and fuss that is made but fortune for merdle by cupid was cast and bade him look higher than wax and the last that merdle his father with good honest trade had used with the stitches his waxed end had made i knew when old merdle lived down by the mill i often went fishing and jack dug the bait but jack merdle then never thought he should fill with fish and roast meat such a full dinner plate nor i when my line which i threw for a trout while jack watched the bob of the light floating cork ever thought of the time in a merdle turn out to ride or to dine with a pearl handle fork in jacks splendid mansion where taste waste and style contend for preemption as then by the mill old merdle contended with fortune the while for bread wherewithal jacks belly to fill illustration i never thought then little kitty malone as heir to old cripus would bring him the cash i never thought then little kitty malone as heir to old gripus would bring him the cash pon which as a banker jack merdle has shone and kitty in fashion has cut such a dash nor when as a girl not a shoe to her feet she accepted my offers of coppers or candy she would tell me in satin weve nothing to eat while eating from silver or sipping her brandy and wondring that merdle the jack i have named should bring home a friend twas thus she exclaimed the day that ive mentioned a day to remember when merdle and i in his carriage and bays through avenue five on a day in september drove up to a mansion with gaslight ablaze mrs merdle at home she discourseth of nothing to eat and the cost thereof why merdle why did you bring dinewell today so very though welcome so quite unexpected for dinner if any im sure i cant say our servants with washing are all so infected if anys provided t is nothing but scraps of potluck or pick up of some common fare or something left over from last week perhaps which youve brought a friend and an old one to share i never im sure now so much was ashamed to think hell discover whats true to the letter weve nothing or next tot thats fit to be named for one who is used every day to whats better but what can you expect if you come on a monday our french cooks away too i vow and declare but if you would see us with something to spare lets know when youre coming or come on a sunday for that of all others for churchmen or sinners a day is for gorging with extra good dinners illustration and that is just what as our butcher explains the dickens has played with our beef and our mutton if merdle had told me a friend would be here a dinner id get up in spite of the bills i often tell butcher hes wonderful dear he says every calf that a butcher now kills will cost near as much as the price of a steer before all the banks in their discount expanded and flooded the country with lampblack and rags which poor men has ruined and shipwrecked and stranded on povertys billows and quicksands and crags and that is just what as our butcher explains the dickens has played with our beef and our mutton but something is gained for with all of his pains the poor man wont make of himself such a glutton im sure if they knew what a sin t is to eat when things are all selling at extravagant prices that poor folks more saving would be of their meat and learn by example how little suffices i wish they could see for themselves what a table what examples we set to the laboring poor in prudence and saving in those who are able to live like a king and his court on a tour i feel i acknowledge sometimes quite dejected to think as it happens with you here today to drop in so sudden and quite unexpected how poor we are living some people will say mrs merdle goes to market with prices outrageous they charge now for meat and servants so worthless are every day growing i wonder we get half enough now to eat and shouldnt if t want for the fact of my going to market to cheapen potatoes and beef and talk to the butchers about their abuses and listen to stories beyond our belief they tell while they cheat us by way of excuses and grocers do tell us is t legal to charge such prices for sugar and butter and flour oh why dont the mayor in his wisdom enlarge both weight and measure as he does doubtful power the dinnerbell rings mrs merdle describes the sufferings of dyspepsia and its remedy but come now i hear by the sound of the ringing that dinner is ready and time none to spare to finish our eating in time for the singing at niblos or at burtons drop in for a stare to kill time the object whatever the source is and that is the reason we sit at the table and call for our dinner in slowcoming courses to kill while we eat all the time we are able though little i told you thats worthy your taste youll find on our table pray dont think us mean your welcome is ample thats better than waste oh here comes the soup in a silver tureen tis mock turtle too so good for digestion that kills me by inches the wretched complaint dyspepsia to cure which i take by suggestion portwine in the soup when i feel slightly faint the dinner table talk now soup if you like made of beef very nice youll find this the next thing to the height of perfection and eaten with ketchup or thickened with rice will suit you i know if this is your selection my own disposition to this one inclines but dreadful dyspepsia destroys all the pleasure of dinner except its well tinctured with wines which plan i adopt as a healthgiving measure a table well ordered well furnished and neat no wonder our nature for ever is tempting and id like to know if mahomet could beat its pleasures dyspepsia for ever exempting with all that he promised in paradise gained with houris attendant in place of the churls with which we are worried tormented and pained the colored men servants or green irish girls mrs merdle doubts paradises uneating pleasure though houris are handsome though lovely the place more lovely perhaps than our own country seat i never could see in the light of free grace what pleasure they have there with nothing to eat with nothing to wear if the climate is suiting we might get along i am sure pretty well no washing and starching and crimping and fluting no muslin and laces and trouble of dressing they tell eer troubles the women or bothers the men who soon grow accustomed as people do here to fashions prevailing and things that they ken to dresses foreshortened where bosoms appear to bonnets that show but a rose in the wearing to dresses that sweep like a besom the street to dresses so gauzy the hoops through are seen to shoes quite as gauzy to cover the feet but watch how a man here goes raving and swearing at wife and all hands if theyve nothing to eat mrs merdle discourseth of things earthly no matter how costly or flimsy her dresses the angel you honor with your kind attentions no matter how foolish her wardrobe inventions you love her or say so from slipper to tresses but presto you call her the greatest of sinners though smiling she treats you to badly cooked dinners which proves where the seat is of mens best affections with which pon their honor they extol us as wives and treat us at dinner with sagest reflections of beauty and duty we owe all our lives to you noble lords of this mundane creation which judging from some things they tell us was made for the creatures of this trading nation who make it a business to buy us and sell us like erie or central or other such stocks with care when they bid for a very miss nancy that shes of a stock that the brokers call fancy or else has a pocket chuck full of the rocks the rocks that are wrecking each day of their sailing more fortunes than ever in ocean were swallowed where ventures of marriage their victims impaling with mammon and misry together have wallowed mrs merdle discourseth of things eatable now colonel to husband you need not be winking while wiping the soup with a smile from your lips i know just as well as he does how youre thinking the soup is as tasteless as though made of chips you need not deny it and swear that no better concocted was ever in london or paris remember the praises you gave in your letter of cooking and eating you wrote to miss harris now colonel dont offer a word more to flatter the soup may be soso but wait for the meat and after youve seen the last dish plate or platter youll own then im certain weve nothing to eat that is compared as described to miss harris with all the best tables you eat at in paris mrs merdle ordereth the second course come john jane and susan the soup take away and bring in the turbot the sheeps head and bass and have you got lobster and salad today and see that the celerys all right in the glass now fish colonel dinewell which fish will you try and how shall i dress it to suit your nice taste for sauce to the fish is as love to the sigh imperfect its worthless and both prove a waste mrs merdle discourseth of hygiene and fish sauce but this is concocted by rules so complete though piquant is healthy and easy digested and if you will note it as slowly we eat the contents ill give for our friends interested imprimus in fish stock an onion we stew and anchovy essence two spoonfuls we add with butter horseradish and lemons a few mushrooms too in ketchup is not very bad and pickle of walnuts with onions chopped fine to which there is added some old sherry wine my doctor so queer when i suffer distress inquires what ive latterly foolishly eaten and swears that to swallow this horrible mess would entitle a dog like a dog to be beaten but la such a doctor knows nothing of womens complaints and talks latin nonsense about regular diet and thinks that us mortals should live more like saints on moonshine and nonsense of a heavenly quiet he says that a woman of my plaint complaining if she was a woman at all half discreet would shudder to think every day she is maiming her stomach with trash and such stuff as we eat mrs merdle describeth her doctor but hes an old fogy you may know by this sign he dont smoke tobacco drink lager or wine and swears that rich gravy roast pork or chop would kill a big ostrich if stuffed in his crop he told me one day bout the pain in my feet i see what t is ails you youve nothing to eat provoking absurd foolish hint that my health was injured by eating what station and wealth and fashion give right for my sex to enjoy in spite of the doctors we choose to employ mrs merdle discourseth again on dinner but you are not eating and i fear that the fish or else t is the gravys not done to your wish youre starving while waiting for something to eat thank fortune i told you how poorly we live i hope john now will give us a piece of roast meat or else such a dinner youd never forgive why yes merdle look there is beef on that dish jane hill dont you see theres a plate here to shift that john is now bringing t is all he can lift and colonel that turkey you know t is my wish you know that excelsiors your motto in carving as nothing more now we shall have on the table well eat and give thanks this day that were able to keep our poor bodies entirely from starving now susans this all that youve been able to pick up oh no theres a ham and its done to a turn so nice that the nose of a jew neednt stick up and a tongue well a tongue i never could spurn its nice while the wine at our leisure we sip and good with a cracker in wine we can dip illustration my appetites none of the best and so i must pamper the delicate thing and tickle a fancy thats very capricious with bits of a turkey the breast or the wing with kirf very tender and gravy delicious mrs merdle accepteth of a slight dinner suitable for a woman suffering with dyspepsia some turkey why yes the least mite will suffice a side bone and dressing and bit of the breast the tip of the rump thats it and one o the flis in spite of the doctor my appetites none of the best and so i must pamper the delicate thing and tickle a fancy thats very capricious with bits of a turkey the breast or the wing with beef very tender and gravy delicious some beef now i thank you not any at present ill nibble a little at what i have got and wish for a duck or a grouse or a pheasant though none of them come for a wish in the pot mrs merdle discourseth of wishes and her sufferings if wishes were horses ive heard when a girl if wishes were horses the beggars would ride if wishes were pheasants id wish with a skirl till cooked ones came flying and sat by my side a fig then for doctors their tinctures and drugs good eating would cure me with plenty of game and as for pill boxes and bottles and jugs i wouldnt know one when i saw it by name oh dear such a load now my stomach oppresses while eating these trifles attempting to dine im sure taint the turkey it must be my dresses and if so t will ease them to sip sherry wine tis sad though to be such a sad invalid dear me colonel dinewell youve done eating meat your doctor like mine i hope hasnt forbid that you shouldnt have as i do so little to eat ah well then i see though ive hardly begun the meats and the solids must go right away so bring in the pudding if susans got one which will for a while ones appetite stay mrs merdle discourseth of pudding a pudding why yes as i live too its plum so plain susan makes them on purpose for me i never refuse when the plum puddings come to finish my dinner if finished t can be on things unsubstantial like puddings and pies so made up of suet and currants and flour like this one before us to get up the size and stirred up and beaten with eggs by the hour with bread crumbs and citron and small piece of mace with nutmeg and cinnamon and sugar and milk and currants and raisins and spices so race and what else i know not of things of that ilk the whole after cooking six hours at the least when thus well compounded with delicate skill with wine sauce is eaten to finish the feast and suits the digestion of ladies quite ill who suffer as i do from having bad cooks and very weak stomachs and food that near kills em and then such a sight of bad rules in the books from contents to finis to cure one that fills em illustration for nothing to cure with is used but cold water and what with the bathing and washing and scrubbing theres one of all others so much recommended to cure every ill of old eves every daughter with nothing or next tot for medicine expended for nothing to cure with is used but cold water and what with the bathing and washing and scrubbing the packing and sweating and using the sheet the shower bath and douche bath and all sorts of rubbing and literally nothing but brown bread to eat no wonder the patient accepts of the lure to escape such a ducking acknowledged a cure but lord what a skein i have made of my yarn while susans arranging and changing the plates and running all round old robin hoods barn like puzzles at school that we made on our slates but talking of puzzles no one that we made while playing the fool we played as a trade when childhood and folly joined hands at the schools could equal the pranks of these coldwater fools yes yes mr merdle i knew by the smelling the pudding was ready without any telling so colonel ill help you a delicate slice for nothing im sure like a dinner youve eaten and afterwards follow with jelly and ice so pleasant while waiting to cool off the heat on and then with a syllabub comfit or cream our dessert of almonds and raisins well nibble till coffee comes in to revive with its steam when cakes in its fragrance well leisurely dibble im sure after all its a terrible bore to labor so hard as we do for our victuals i envy the women that beg at the door or hire out for wages to handle your kettles and wash bake and iron and do nothing but cooking so rugged and healthy and often good looking the doctor has told me except when theyre mothers they never take tincture or rhubarb or pill and swears the profession if there were no others their patients would use up and starve out and kill im sure i dont see how that makes them exempt from all sorts of sickness and womans complaints with nothing to hinder if appetite tempt from eating or drinking as happy as saints oh lord now this pudding so delicate made and gravy im sure with nothing thats rich in that one of those women who beg as a trade the whole in one stomach could leisurely pitch in is now in my own so terribly painful in feeling its calls for relief are most loudly appealing mrs merdle discourseth of the necessity of good wine and other matters so while we are eating the fruits of the vine dont let us forget such a health giving juice as champagne or sherbet or other good wine nor sin by neglecting its temperate use now sherbet my husband extols to the skies with me though my stomach is weak and wont bear it and sherry though sometimes affecting my eyes a bottle with pleasure well open and share it ha ha welladay what a queer world to live in if one were contented on little to dine we need not be longing another to be in where women they tell us exist without wine where husbands are happy and women content where dresses though gauzy are fit for the street where no one is wretched with purses unbent with nothing to wear and nothing to eat where women no longer are treated la turk where husbands descended from saxon or norman for women when sickly are willing to work and not long for utah and pleasures la mormon where men freely marry and live with their wives and not live as you do mon colonel so single such wretched and dinnerless bachelor lives you dont know the pleasure there is in the tingle of ears pricked by lectures la curtain au caudle or noise of young dinewells beginning to toddle while plodding all day with your paper and quills and copy and proof sheets and work for the printer pray what do you know of the housekeepers bills and other such pleasures of hope for the winter you men selfish creatures think all of the care of living and keeping yourselves in existence is due to your own daily labor and share from breakfast to dinner of business persistance while woman is either a plaything or drudge according to station of wealth or position which men help along with a word or a nudge to heaven high up or low down to perdition but what was i saying of a world free from care of eating and drinking and dresses to wear where women by husbands are never tormented and never asked money where husbands dissented and never see others their rivals in fashion ahead and never have doctors a womans great dread and nothing i hope like my own indigestion to torment and starve them as this one does me and keep them from sipping forgive the suggestion the nectar etherial they drink for their tea mrs merdle suggesteth that dinner being finished the gentlement will smoke in the meantime she discourseth now merdle now colonel i know you are waiting and thinking my talking to eatings a bar still hoping by tasting my appetite sating will give you the license to smoke a cigar illustration will give you the license to smoke a cigar well then ive done now and hope too youve dined as well as down town where you dine for a shilling at taylors or thompsons or one of the kind where mortals are flocking each day for their filling or else at the astor where bachelors quarter where port holes for windows give light to the room far out of the region of eves every daughter so high they are stuck up away toward the moon though as for the stuck up no walls built of brick or granite or marble or dirty red sand could stick up a man who himselfs but a stick an inch above where he would naturally stand to witness the truth of this final assertion i call you to witness the sticks at the door where they make it a daily a manly diversion to ogle each woman and sometimes do more who passes the hotel thats named by a saint where boorish bad manners give room for complaint where idlers and loafers with gamblers a few make up for the nonce the st nicholas crew the outside barbarians i freely confess who ogle our faces and ogle our dress who spit where we walk as dirty a puddle as bipeds can make when their brains are a muddle do not prove the inside is as dirty as they are or else the gods help all the ladies who stay there why any prefer in a hotel to stay instead of a house of their choosing to own is just to avoid all the trouble they say that servants to give us are certainly prone im sure if a tyranny more terrible prevails in austria or other despotic domain my memory where most certainly fails that servants and milliners over us gain just here in new york and the more is the pity where wood is the mogul that governs the city mrs merdle having nibbled a little for two hours at dinner retireth from the table unsatisfied impatient oh yes just the way with you men i never have time to half finish my eating ere merdle is done such a fidget is then hed starve me i think rather n miss of a meeting where brokers preside oer the fate of the stocks as pales presided oer shepherds and flocks now while you are smoking what nonsense and folly ill go to my room dont say no for i must put on a new dress with assistance of molly and then with a little strong tea and a crust my strength i may hope for a walk will be able as far as the gate and a very short ride to give me a relish again for the table what else do we live for in this world beside the poet moralizeth he discourseth to those who gorge and complain oh kitty malone mrs merdle tis now was there ever on earth than this greater folly still gorging while groaning and swearing a vow that yours is a case of most sad melancholy with table that croesus never had but might covet you live but to eat and to eat cause you love it and yet while you swallow great sirloins of meat complain like a beggar of nothing to eat he discourseth of the wherefore of bachelorism what else do we live for in this world beside alas t is the question of ten times a day that comes on the wind or that floats on the tide and creeps in the houses where men go to pray what else do we live for than get such a wife as this of the banker of our faint description what else is the end of our fashionable life from which men escape as they would from conscription what else is the reason so few natives marry than this that extravagance leads on to ruin it is because few men are able to carry the load of this baking and roasting and stewing of buying and wasting extravagant meat where women are dying of nothing to eat where men in corruption so rapidly tending in morals and wealth in bankruptcy ending that forging and stealing and breaches of trust and ten thousand arts of the confidence game and follies uncounted of men on a bust are follies and crimes of this age to our shame till angels who witness the folly so wide extended from palace to farmhouse and cot might wonder if mortals lifes objects forgot or merdles position is mans common lot he discourseth of what some mortals live for what else do they live for in this world beside what else but for kittys or one of the same do mothers their daughters at schools give the touch that leaves them to live as a wife but in name while position and fashion they frantically clutch what else do they live for our girls so refined so forward precocious and gifted at ten they are flirting and courting and things of the kind that never came under our grandmothers ken at fifteen so dressed up and hooped up i ween theyre mothers full often before theyre sixteen and fading and dowdy and sickly at twenty with one boy in trowsers and two girls in laces complaining of starving while dying of plenty the fate is of ladies in fashionable places he imploreth mercy upon those condemned with fashionable folly to marry and illustrateth their condition now heaven in mercy be kind to the wretch who marries for money or fashion or folly hed better accept of the noose of jack ketch than such a helpmeet or at once marry dolly the cook or with bridget the maid of the broom with one hed be sure to get coffee and meat and never hear whining of nothing to eat and t other would make up his bed and his room and if he was blest with a child now and then as happens sometimes with your fashionable wives whore coupled to bipeds in nature called men hed need no insurance to warrant their lives and need no expense of a grand bridal tour or visit each season at watering places where fashion at people well known to be poor in money or station will make ugly faces where women though married with roues will flirt where widows though widows in fresh sable weeds spread nets that entangle like old nessus shirt and finish with burdell and cunningham deeds where daughters when fading are taken to spend a month at the springs or a week in salt water where bachelors flirting on ellen attend are whispered by mamma engaged to my daughter he imploreth merry for other unfortunate beings now heaven in mercy be kind to the wretches who stay on the earth like this mrs merdle more wretched than ever a wretch on the hurdle was drawn by all englands official jack ketches more wretched if can be at church on a sunday a woman who worships than god more her dress would be if she heard or een thought mrs grundy would sneer at the set of a bonnet or tress or say that she thought miss freeloves new pattern of laces or collars or yard flowing sleeves looked more like the dress of a real miss slattern and not so becomings the first one of eves he discourseth of a common prayer yet look at the thousands whose every day prayer far more than their own or their neighbors salvation absorbs every thought every dream and all care to eat or to wear is anything new in creation he discourseth of trouble and sorrow what else do they live for they live but for this and nothing but this ever troubles their thinking rich eating rich dressing and flirtings their bliss and lifes better purposes constantly blinking their lifes but a tissue of trouble and sorrow of what is the fashion or will be tomorrow he moralizeth upon what a day may bring forth tomorrow wholl warrant tomorrow well see wholl care the next day or day after for dinner or what the next fashion of new dress will be or who mrs grundy will say is the winner having reached thirtysixthly the author is about to make the application and pray forgiveness but concludes by remaining incog wholl care for tomorrow for this bit of scandal with malice prepense that a cynic has written thats what they will say when the poem they handle who feel tis themselves whom the mad dog has bitten and wish he was treated as dogs with the rabies are treated to stop his unmannerly bark or packed off to bed as you do naughty babies to sleep or be frightened all alone in the dark wholl care why the author of this ugly poem hell care for a reason that all of you read it hell care for the cash youll give oh how he needs it oh what would you give ladies dear just to know him but that by your leave by the aid of the elf the printer employs he will keep to himself he knows if you knew him what fate he would meet at every table youd give him nothing to eat excuse then dear ladies the author his shyness and accept his conge at the end of this finish
