 the midas plaque and so they were married the bride and groom made a beautiful couple she in her twentyyard frill of immaculate white he in his formal gray ruffled blouse and pleated pantaloons it was a small weddingthe best he could afford for guests they had only the immediate family and a few close friends and when the minister had performed the ceremony morey fry kissed his bride and they drove off to the reception there were twentyeight limousines in all though it is true that twenty of them contained only the caterers robots and three flower cars bless you both said old man elon sentimentally youve got a fine girl in our cherry morey he blew his nose on a ragged square of cambric the old folks behaved very well morey thought at the reception surrounded by the enormous stacks of wedding gifts they drank the champagne and ate a great many of the tiny delicious canapes they listened politely to the fifteenpiece orchestra and cherrys mother even danced one dance with morey for sentiments sake though it was clear that dancing was far from the usual pattern of her life they tried as hard as they could to blend into the gathering but all the same the two elderly figures in severely simple and probably rented garments were dismayingly conspicuous in the quarteracre of tapestries and tinkling fountains that was the main ballroom of moreys country home when it was time for the guests to go home and let the newlyweds begin their life together cherrys father shook morey by the hand and cherrys mother kissed him but as they drove away in their tiny runabout their faces were full of foreboding it was nothing against morey as a person of course but poor people should not marry wealth morey and cherry loved each other certainly that helped they told each other so a dozen times an hour all of the long hours they were together for all of the first months of their marriage morey even took time off to go shopping with his bride which endeared him to her enormously they drove their shopping carts through the immense vaulted corridors of the supermarket morey checking off the items on the shopping list as cherry picked out the goods it was fun for a while their first fight started in the supermarket between breakfast foods and floor furnishings just where the new precious stones department was being opened morey called off from the list diamond lavaliere cos tame rings earbobs cherry said rebelliously morey i have a lavaliere please dear morey folded back the pages of the list uncertainly the lavaliere was on there all right and no alternative selection was shown how about a bracelet he coaxed look they have some nice ruby ones there see how beautifully they go with your hair darling he beckoned a robot clerk who busded up and handed cherry the bracelet tray lovely morey exclaimed as cherry slipped the largest of the lot on her wrist and i dont have to have a lavaliere cherry asked of course not he peeked at the tag same number of ration points exactly since cherry looked only dubious not convinced he said briskly and now wed better be getting along to the shoe department ive got to pick up some dancing pumps cherry made no objection neither then nor throughout the rest of their shopping tour at the end while they were sitting in the supermarkets groundfloor lounge wait ing for the robot accountants to tote up their bill and the robot cashiers to stamp their ration books morey re membered to have the shipping department save out the bracelet i dont want that sent with the other stuff darling he explained i want you to wear it right now honestly i dont think i ever saw anything looking so right for you cherry looked flustered and pleased morey was de lighted with himself it wasnt everybody who knew how to handle these little domestic problems just right he stayed selfsatisfied all the way home while henry their companionrobot regaled them with funny stories of the factory in which it had been built and trained cherry wasnt used to henry by a long shot but it was hard not to like the robot jokes and funny stories when you needed amusement sympathy when you were depressed a neverfailing supply of news and information on any subject you cared to namehenry was easy enough to take cherry even made a special point of asking henry to keep them company through dinner and she laughed as thoroughly as morey himself at its droll anecdotes but later in the conservatory when henry had con siderately left them alone the laughter dried up morey didnt notice he was very conscientiously mak ing the rounds turning on the trid selecting their after dinner liqueurs scanning the evening newspapers cherry cleared her throat selfconsciously and morey stopped what he was doing dear she said tentatively im feeling kind of restless tonight could we mean do you think we could just sort of stay home andwell relax morey looked at her with a touch of concern she lay back wearily eyes half closed are you feeling all right he asked perfectly i just dont want to go out tonight dear i dont feel up to it he sat down and automatically lit a cigarette i see he said the trid was beginning a comedy show he got up to turn it off snapping on the tapeplayer muted strings filled the room we had reservations at the club tonight he reminded her cherry shifted uncomfortably i know and we have the opera tickets that i turned last weeks in for i hate to nag darling but we havent used any of our opera tickets we can see them right here on the trid she said in a small voice that has nothing to do with it sweetheart i didnt want to tell you about it but wainwright down at the office said something to me yesterday he told me he would be at the circus last night and as much as said hed be looking to see if we were there too well we werent there heaven knows what ill tell him next week he waited for cherry to answer but she was silent he went on reasonably so if you could see your way clear to going out tonight he stopped slackjawed cherry was crying silently and in quantity darling he said inarticulately he hurried to her but she fended him off he stood helpless over her watching her cry dear whats the matter he asked she turned her head away morey rocked back on his heels it wasnt exactly the first time hed seen cherry crythere had been that poignant scene when they gave each other up realizing that their backgrounds were too far apart for happiness before the realization that they had to have each other no matter what but it was the first time her tears had made him feel guilty and he did feel guilty he stood there staring at her then he turned his back on her and walked over to the bar he ignored the ready liqueurs and poured two stiff highballs brought them back to her he set one down beside her took a long drink from the other in quite a different tone he said dear whats the matter no answer come on what is it she looked up at him and rubbed at her eyes almost sullenly she said sorry i know youre sorry look we love each other lets talk this thing out she picked up her drink and held it for a moment before setting it down untasted whats the use morey please lets try she shrugged he went on remorselessly you arent happy are you and its because ofwell all this his gesture took in the richly furnished conservatory the thickpiled carpet the host of machines and contrivances for their comfort and entertainment that waited for their touch by implica tion it took in twentysix rooms five cars nine robots morey said with an effort it isnt what youre used to is it i cant help it cherry said morey you know ive tried but back home dammit he flared this is your home you dont live with your father any more in that fiveroom cottage you dont spend your evenings hoeing the garden or play ing cards for matchsticks you live here vrith me your husband you knew what you were getting into we talked all this out long before we were married the words stopped because words were useless cherry was crying again but not silently through her tears she wailed darling ive tried you dont know how ive tried ive worn all those silly clothes and ive played all those silly games and ive gone out with you as much as i possibly could andive eaten all that terrible food until im actually getting fafa af i thought i could stand it but i just cant go on like this im not used to it i love you morey but im going crazy living like this i cant help it moreyim tired of being poor eventually the tears dried up and the quarrel healed and the lovers kissed and made up but morey lay awake that night listening to his wifes gentle breathing from the suite next to his own staring into the darkness as tragically as any pauper before him had ever done blessed are the poor for they shall inherit the earth blessed morey heir to more worldly goods than he could possibly consume morey fry steeped in grinding poverty had never gone hungry a day in his life never lacked for anything his heart could desire in the way of food or clothing or a place to sleep in moreys world no one lacked for these things no one could malthus was rightfor a civilization vidthout ma chines automatic factories hydroponics and food syn thesis nuclear breeder plants oceanmining for metals and minerals and a vastly increasing supply of labor and architecture that rose high in the air and dug deep in the ground and floated far out on the water on piers and pontoons architecture that could be poured one day and lived in the next and robots above all robots robots to burrow and haul and smelt and fabricate to build and farm and weave and sew what the land lacked in wealth the sea was made to yield and the laboratory invented the rest and the factories became a pipeline of plenty churning out enough to feed and clothe and house a dozen worlds limitless discovery infinite power in the atom tireless labor of humanity and robots mechanization that drove jungle and swamp and ice off the earth and put up office buildings and manufacturing centers and rocket ports in their place the pipeline of production spewed out riches that no king in the time of malthus could have known but a pipeline has two ends the invention and power and labor pouring in at one end must somehow be drained out at the other lucky morey blessed economicconsuming unit drown ing in the pipelines flood striving manfully to eat and drink and wear and wear out his share of the ceaseless tide of wealth morey felt far from blessed for the blessings of the poor are always best appreciated from afar quotas worried his sleep until he awoke at eight oclock the next morning redeyed and haggard but inwardly resolved he had reached a decision he was starting a new life there was trouble in the morning mail under the let terhead of the national ration board it said we regret to advise you that the following items re turned by you in connection with your august quotas as used and no longer serviceable have been inspected and found insufficiently worn the list followeda long one morey saw to his sick disappointment credit is hereby disallowed for these and you are therefore given an addi tional consuming quota for the current month in the amount of points at least points of which must be in the textile and homefurnishing categories morey dashed the letter to the floor the valet picked it up emotionlessly creased it and set it on his desk it wasnt fair all right maybe the bathing trunks and beach umbrellas hadnt been really used very much though how the devil he asked himself bitterly did you go about using up swimming gear when you didnt have time for such leisurely pursuits as swimming but cer tainly the hiking slacks were used hed worn them for three whole days and part of a fourth what did they expect him to do go around in rags morey looked belligerently at the coffee and toast that the valetrobot had brought in with the mail and then steeled his resolve unfair or not he had to play the game according to the rules it was for cherry more than for himself and the way to begin a new way of life was to begin it morey was going to consume for two he told the valetrobot take that stuff back i want cream and sugar with the coffeelots of cream and sugar and besides the toast scrambled eggs fried potatoes orange juiceno make it half a grapefruit and orange juice come to think of it right away sir said the valet you wont be hav ing breakfast at nine then will you sir i certainly will said morey virtuously double por tions as the robot was closing the door he called after it butter and marmalade with the toast he went to the bath he had a full schedule and no time to waste in the shower he carefully sprayed himself with lather three times when he had rinsed the soap off he went through the whole assortment of taps in order three lotions plain talcum scented talcum and thirty seconds of ultraviolet then he lathered and rinsed again and dried himself with a towel instead of using the hotair drying jet most of the miscellaneous scents went down the drain with the rinse water but if the ration board accused liiw of waste he could claim he was experiment ing the effect as a matter of fact wasnt bad at all he stepped out full of exuberance cherry was awake staring in dismay at the tray the valet had brought good morning dear she said faintly ugh morey kissed her and patted her hand well he said looking at the tray with a big hollow smile food isnt that a lot for just the two of us two of us repeated morey masterfully nonsense my dear im going to eat it all by myself oh morey gasped cherry and the adoring look she gave him was enough to pay for a dozen such meals which he thought as he finished his morning exercises with the sparringrobot and sat down to his real breakfast it just about had to be day in and day out for a long long time still morey had made up his mind as he worked his way through the kippered herring tea and crumpets he ran over his plans with henry he swallowed a mouthful and said i want you to line up some appointments for me right away three hours a week in an exercise gym pick one with lots of reducing equipment henry i think im going to need it and fittings for some new clothes ive had these for weeks and lets see doctor dentist say henry dont i have a psychiatrists date coming up indeed you do sir it said warmly this morning in fact ive already instructed the chauffeur and notified your office fine well get started on the other things henry yes sir said henry and assumed the curious absent look of a robot talking on its tbr circuitsthe talk between robots radioas it arranged the appointments for its master morey finished his breakfast in silence pleased with his own virtue at peace with the world it wasnt so hard to be a proper industrious consumer if you worked at it he reflected it was only the malcontents the neerdowells and the incompetents who simply could not adjust to the world around them well he thought with distant pity someone had to suffer you couldnt break eggs without making an omelet and his proper duty was not to be some sort of wildeyed crank challengmg the social order and beating his breast about injustice but to take care of his wife and his home it was too bad he couldnt really get right down to work on consuming today but this was his one day a week to hold a jobfour of the other six days were devoted to solid consumingand besides he had a group therapy session scheduled as well his analysis morey told him self would certainly take a sharp turn for the better now that he had faced up to his problems morey was immersed in a glow of selfrighteousness as he kissed cherry goodby she had finally got up all in a confusion of delight at the new regime and walked out the door to his car he hardly noticed the little man in enormous floppy hat and garishly ruffled trousers who was standing almost hidden in the shrubs hey mac the mans voice was almost a whisper hub ohwhat is it the man looked around furtively listen friend he said rapidly you look like an intelligent man who could use a little help times are tough you help me iii help you want to make a deal on ration stamps six for one one of yours for six of mine the best deal youti get anywhere in town naturally my stamps arent exactly the real mccoy but theyll pass friend theyll pass morey biinked at him no he said violently and pushed the man aside now its racketeers he thought bitterly slums and endless sordid preoccupation with rations werent enough to inflict on cherry now the neighborhood was becoming a hangout for people on the shady side of the law it was not of course the first time he had ever been approached by a counterfeit ration stamp hoodlum but never at his own front door morey thought briefly as he climbed into his car of calling the police but certainly the man would be gone before they could get there and after all he had handled it pretty well as it was of course it would be nice to get six stamps for one but very far from nice if he got caught good morning mr fry tinkled the robot reception ist wont you go right in with a steeltipped finger it pointed to the door marked group therapy someday morey vowed to himself as he nodded and complied he would be in a position to afford a private analyst of his own group therapy helped relieve the in finite stresses of modern living and without it he might find himself as badly off as the hysterical mobs in the ration riots or as dangerously antisocial as the counter feiters but it lacked the personal touch it was he thought too public a performance of what should be a private affair like trying to live a happy married life with an interfering everpresent crowd of robots in the house morey brought himself up in panic how had that thought crept in he was shaken visibly as he entered the room and greeted the group to which he was assigned there were eleven of them four freudians two reich ians two jungians a gestalter a shock therapist and the elderly and rather quiet sumivanite even the members of the majority groups had their own individual differences in technique and creed but despite four years with this par ticular group of analysts morey hadnt quite been able to keep them separate in his mind their names though he knew well enough morning doctors he said what is it today morning said semmelweiss morosely today you come into the room for the first time looking as if some thing is really bothering you and yet the schedule calls for psychodrama dr fairless he appealed cant we change the schedule a little bit fry here is obviously under a strain thats the time to start digging and see what he can find we can do your psychodrama next time cant we fairless shook his gracefully bald old head sorry doctor if it were up to me of coursebut you know the rules rules rules jeered semmelweiss ah whats the use heres a patient in an acute anxiety state if i ever saw oneand believe me i saw plentyand we ignore it because the rules say ignore it is that professional is that how to cure a patient little blaine said frostily if i may say so dr semmel weiss there have been a great many cures made without the necessity of departing from the rules i myself in fact you yourself mimicked semmelweiss you your self never handled a patient alone in your life when you going to get out of a group blaine blaine said furiously dr fairless i dont think i have to stand for this sort of personal attack just because semmelweiss has seniority and a couple of private patients one day a week he thinks gentlemen said fairless mildly please lets get on with the work mr fry has come to us for help not to listen to us losing our tempers sorry said semmelweiss curtly all the same i ap peal from the arbitrary and mechanistic ruling of the chair fairless inclined his head all in favor of the ruling of the chair nine i count that leaves only you opposed dr semmelweiss well proceed with the psychodrama if the recorder will read us the notes and comments of the last session the recorder a pudgy lowranking youngster named sprogue flipped back the pages of his notebook and read in a chanting voice session of twentyfourth may sub ject morey fry in attendance doctors fairless bileck semmelweiss carrado weber fairless interrupted kindly just the last page if you please dr sprogue umoh yes after a tenminute recess for additional rorschachs and an electroencephalogram the group con vened and conducted rapidfire word association results were tabulated and compared with standard deviation patterns and it was determined that subjects major traumas derived from respectively morey found his attention waning therapy was good everybody knew that but every once in a while he found it a little dull if it werent for therapy though there was no telling what might happen certainly morey told him self he had been helped considerablyat least he hadnt set fire to his house and shrieked at the firerobots like newell down the block when his eldest daughter divorced her husband and came back to live with him bringing her ration quota along of course morey hadnt even been tempted to do anything as outrageously frighteningly im moral as destroy things or waste themwell he admitted to himself honestly perhaps a little tempted once in a great while but never anything important enough to worry about he was sound perfectly sound he looked up starfled all the doctors were staring at him mr fry fairless repeated will you take your place certainly morey said hastily uhwhere semmelweiss guffawed told you never mind morey you didnt miss much were going to run through one of the big scenes in your life the one you told us about last time remember you were fourteen years old you said christmas time your mother had made you a promise morey swallowed i remember he said unhappily well all right where do i stand right here said fairless youre you carrado is your mother im your father will the doctors not par ticipating mind moving back fine now morey here we are on christmas morning merry christmas morey merry christmas morey said halfheartedly uh father dear wheres myuhmy puppy that mother promised me puppy said fairless heartily your mother and i have something much better than a puppy for you just take a look under the tree thereits a robot yes morey your very own robota fullsize thirtyeighttube fully automatic companion robot for you go ahead morey go right up and speak to it its name is henry go on boy morey felt a sudden incomprehensible tingle inside the bridge of his nose he said shakily but i didnt want a robot of course you want a robot carrado interrupted go on child play with your nice robot morey said violently i hate robots he looked around him at the doctors at the graypaneled consulting room he added defiantly you hear me all of you i still hate robots there was a seconds pause then the questions began it was half an hour before the receptionist came in and announced that time was up in that half hour morey had got over his trembling and lost his wild momentary passion but he had remembered what for thirteen years he had forgotten he hated robots the surprising thing was not that young morey had hated robots it was that the robot riots the ultimate violent outbreak of flesh against metal the battle to the death between mankind and its machine heirs never happened a little boy hated robots but the man he be came worked with them hand in hand and yet always and always before the new worker the competitor for the job was at once and inevitably outside the law the waves swelled inflie irish the negroes the jews the italians they were squeezed into their ghettoes where they encysted seethed and struck out until the burgeoning generations became indistinguish able for the robots that genetic relief was not in sight and still the conflict never came the feedback circuits aimed the antiaircraft guns and reshaped and newly planned found a place in a new sort of machinetogether with a miraculous trail of cams and levers an indestructible and potent power source and a hundred thousand parts and subassemblies and the first robot clanked off the bench its mission was its own destruction but from the scavenged wreck of its pilot body a hundred better robots drew their inspiration and the hundred went to work and hundreds more until there were millions upon untold millions and still the riots never happened for the robots came bearing a gift and the name of it was plenty and by the time the gift had shown its own unguessed ills the time for a robot riot was past plenty is a habit forming drug you do not cut the dosage down you kick it if you can you stop the dose entirely but the convul sions that follow may wreck the body once and for all the addict craves the grainy white powder he doesnt hate it or the runner who sells it to him and if morey as a little boy could hate the robot that had deprived him of his pup morey the man was perfectly aware that the robots were his servants and his friends but the little morey inside the manhe had never been convinced morey ordinarily looked forward to his work the one day a week at which he did anything was a wonderful change from the dreary consume consume consume grind he entered the brightlit drafting room of the brad moor amusements company with a feeling of uplift but as he was changing from street garb to his drafting smock howland from procurement came over with a knowing look wainwrights been looking for you how land whispered better get right in there morey nervously thanked him and got wainwrights office was the size of a phone booth and as bare as antarctic ice every time morey saw it he felt his in sides churn with envy think of a desk with nothing on it but work surfaceno calendarclock no twelvecolor pen rack no dictating machinesi he squeezed himself in and sat down while wainwright finished a phone call he mentally reviewed the possible reasons why wainwright would want to talk to him in person instead of over the phone or by dropping a word to him as he passed through the drafting room very few of them were good wainwright put down the phone and morey straight ened up you sent for me he asked wainwright in a chubby world was aristocratically lean as general superintendent of the design development section of the bradmoor amusements company he ranked high in the upper section of the welltodo he rasped i certainly did fry just what the hell do you think youre up to now i dont know what you mmean mr wainwright morey stammered crossing off the list of possible reasons for the interview all of the good ones wainwright snorted i guess you dont not because you werent told but because you dont want to know think back a whole week what did i have you on the carpet for then morey said sickly my ration book look mr wain wright i know im running a little bit behind but but nothing how do you think it looks to the com mittee fry they got a complaint from the ration board about you naturally they passed it on to me and na turally im going to pass it right along to you the ques tion is what are you going to do about it good god man look at these figurestextiles fiftyone per cent food sixtyseven per cent amusements and entertain ment thirty per cent you havent come up to your ration in anything for months morey stared at the card miserably wethat is my wife and ijust had a long talk about that last night mr wainwright and believe me were going to do better were going to buckle right down and get to work and uhdo better he finished weakly wainwright nodded and for the first time there was a note of sympathy in his voice your wife judge etons daughter isnt she good family ive met the judge many times then gruffly well nevertheless fry im warning you i dont care how you straighten this out but dont let the committee mention this to me again no sir all right finished with the schematics on the new k morey brightened just about sir im putting the first section on tape today im very pleased with it mr wainwright honestly i am ive got more than eighteen thousand moving parts in it now and thats without good good wainwright glanced down at his desk get back to it and straighten out this other thing you can do it fry consuming is everybodys duty just keep that in mind howland followed morey out of the drafting room down to the spotless shops bad time he inquired solicitously moray grunted it was none of howlands business howland looked over his shoulder as he was setting up the programing panel morey studied the matrices silently then got busy reading the summary tapes checking them back against the schematics setting up the instructions on the programing board howland kept quiet as morey com pleted the setup and ran off a test tape it checked per fectly morey stepped back to light a cigarette in celebra tion before pushing the start button howland said go on run it i cant go until you put it in the works morey grinned and pushed the button the board lighted up within it a tiny metronomic beep began to pulse that was all at the other end of the quartermile shed morey knew the automatic sorters and conveyers were fingering through the copper reels and steel ingots measuring hoppers of plastic powder and colors setting up an intricate weaving path for the thousands of in dividual components that would make up bradmoors new k spinagame but from where they stood in the elaborately muraled programing room nothing showed bradmoor was an ultramodernized plant in the manu facturing end even robots had been dispensed with in favor of machines that guided themselves morey glanced at his watch and logged in the starting time while howland quickly counterchecked moreys rawmaterial flow program checks out howland said solemnly slapping him on the back calls for a celebration anyway its your first design isnt it yes first all by myself at any rate howland was already fishing in his private locker for the bottle he kept against emergency needs he poured with a flourish to morey fry he said our most fa vorite designer in whom we are much pleased morey drank it went down easily enough morey had conscientiously used his liquor rations for years but he had never gone beyond the minimum so that although liquor was no new experience to him the single drink immediately warmed him it warmed his mouth his throat the hollows of his chest and it settled down with a warm glow inside him howland exerting himself to be nice complimented morey fatuously on the design and poured another drink morey didnt utter any protest at all howland drained his glass you may wonder he said formally why i am so pleased with you morey fry i will tell you why this is morey grinned please do howland nodded i will its because i am pleased with the world morey my wife left me last night morey was as shocked as only a recent bridegroom can be by the news of a crumbling marriage thats too ba i mean is that a fact yes she left my beds and board and five robots and im happy to see her go he poured another drink for both of them women cant live with them and cant live without them first you sigh and pant and chase after emyou like poetry he demanded suddenly morey said cautiously some poetry howland quoted how long my love shall i behold this wall between our gardensyours the rose and mine the swooning lily like it i wrote it for jocelynthats my wifewhen we were first going together its beautiful said morey she wouldnt talk to me for two days howland drained his drink lots of spirit that girl anyway i hunted her like a tiger and then i caught her wowl morey took a deep drink from his own glass what do you mean wow he asked wow howland pointed his finger at morey wow thats what i mean we got married and i took her home to the dive i was living in and wow we had a kid and wow i got in a little trouble with the ration board nothing serious of course but there was a mixupand wow fights everything was a fight he explained shed start with a little nagging and naturally id say something or other back and bang we were off budget budget budget i hope to die if i ever hear the word budget again morey youre a married man you know what its like tell me the truth werent you just about ready to blow your top the first time you caught your wife cheating on the budget cheating on the budget morey was startled cheat ing how oh lots of ways making your portions bigger than hers sneaking extra shirts for you on her clothing ration you know damn it i do not know cried morey cherry wouldnt do anything like that rowland looked at him opaquely for a long second of course not he said at last lets have another drink ruffled morey held out his glass cherry wasnt the type of girl to cheat of course she wasnt a fine loving girl like hera pretty girl of a good family she wouldnt know how to begin howland was saying in a sort of chant no more budget no more fights no more daddy never treated me like this no more nagging no more extra radons for household allowance no moremorey what do you say we go out and have a few drinks i know a place where sorry howland morey said ive got to get back to the office you know howland guffawed he held out his wristwatch as morey a little unsteadily bent over it it tinkled out the hour it was a matter of minutes before the office dosed for the day oh said morey i didnt realizewell anyway howland thanks but i cant my wife will be expecting me she certainly will howland sniggered wont catch her eating up your rations and hers tonight morey said tightly howland oh sorry sorry howland waved an arm dont mean to say anything against your wife of course guess maybe jocelyn soured me on women but honest morey youd like this place name of uncle piggottys down in the old town crazy bunch hangs out there youd like them couple nights last week they had mean you understand morey i dont go there as often as all that but i just happened to drop in and morey interrupted firmly thank you rowland must go home wife expects it decent of you to offer good night be seeing you he walked out turned at the door to bow politely and in turning back cracked the side of his face against the door jamb a sort of pleasant numbness had taken pos session of his entire skin surface though and it wasnt until he perceived henry chattering at him sympathetic ally that he noticed a trickle of blood running down the side of his face mere flesh wound he said with dignity nothing to cause you least conshterconsternation henry now kindly shut your ugly face want to think and he slept in the car all the way home it was worse than a hangover the name is hold over youve had some drinks youve started to sober up by catching a little sleep then you are required to be awake and to function the consequent state has the worst features of hangover and intoxication your head thumps and your mouth tastes like the floor of a bearpit but you are nowhere near sober there is one cure morey said thickly lets have a cocktail dear cherry was delighted to share a cocktail with him be fore dinner cherry morey thought lovingly was a won derful wonderful wonderful he found his head nodding in time to his thoughts and the motion made him wince cherry flew to his side and touched his temple is it bothering you darling she asked solicitously where you ran into the door i mean morey looked at her sharply but her expression was open and adoring he said bravely just a little nothing to it really the butler brought the cocktails and retired cherry lifted her glass morey raised his caught a whiff of the liquor and nearly dropped it he bit down hard on his churning insides and forced himself to swallowhe was surprised but grateful it stayed down in a moment the curious phenomenon of warmth began to repeat itself he swallowed the rest of the drink and held out his glass for a refill he even tried a smile oddly enough his face didnt fall off one more drink did it morey felt happy and relaxed but by no means drunk they went in to dinner in fine spirits they chatted cheerfully with each other and henry and morey found time to feel sentimentally sorry for poor howland who couldnt make a go of his marriage when marriage was obviously such an easy relationship so bene ficial to both sides so warm and relaxing startled he said what cherry repeated its the cleverest scheme i ever heard of such a funny little man dear all kind of nervous if you know what i mean he kept looking at the door as if he was expecting someone but of course that was silly none of his friends would have come to our house to see him morey said tensely cherry please what was that you said about ration stamps but i told you darling it was just after you left this morning this funny little man came to the door the butler said he wouldnt give any name anyway i talked to him i thought he might be a neighbor and i certainly would never be rude to any neighbor who might come to call even if the neighborhood was the ration stamps morey begged did i hear you say he was peddling phony ration stamps cherry said uncertainly well i suppose that in a way theyre phony the way he explained it they werent the regular official kind but it was four for one dearfour of his stamps for one of ours so i just took out our house hold book and steamed off a couple of weeks stamps and how many morey bellowed cherry biinked aboutabout two weeks quota she said faintly was that wrong dear morey closed bis eyes dizzily a couple of weeks stamps he repeated four for oneyou didnt even get the regular rate cherry wailed how was i supposed to know i never had anything like this when i was home we didnt have food riots and slums and all these horrible robots and filthy little revolting men coming to the door morey stared at her woodenly she was crying again but it made no impression on the casehardened armor that was suddenly thrown around his heart henry made a tentative sound that in a human would have been a preparatory cough but morey froze him with a whiteeyed look morey said in a dreary monotone that barely penetrated the sound of cherrys tears let me tell you just what it was you did assuming at best that these stamps you got are at least average good counterfeits and not so bad that the best thing to do with them is throw them away before we get caught with them in our possession you have approximately a twomonth supply of funny stamps in case you didnt know it those ration books are not merely ornamental they have to be turned in every month to prove that we have completed our consuming quota for the month when they are turned in they are spotchecked every book is at least glanced at a big chunk of them are gone over very carefully by the inspectors and a certain per centage are tested by ultraviolet infrared xray radio isotopes bleaches fumes paper chromatography and every other damned test known to man his voice was rising to an uneven crescendo if we are lucky enough to get away with using any of these stamps at all we darentwe simply dare notuse more than one or two counterfeits to every dozen or more real stamps that means cherry that what you bought is not atwomonth supply but maybe a twoyear supplyand since as you no doubt have never noticed the things have expiration dates on them there is probably no chance in the world that we can ever hope to use more than half of them he was bellowing by the time he pushed back his chair and lowered over her moreover he went on right now right as of this minute we have to make up the stamps you gave away which means that at the very best we are going to be on double rations for two weeks or so and that says nothing about the one feature of this whole grisly mess that you seem to have thought of least namely that counterfeit stamps are against the lawl im poor cherry i live in a slum and i know it ive got a long way to go betore im as rich or respected or powerful as your father about whom i am beginning to get con siderably tired of hearing but poor as i may be i can tell you this for sure up until now at any rate i have been honest cherrys tears had stopped entirely and she was bowed whitefaced and dryeyed by the time morey had finished he had spent himself there was no violence left in him he stared dismally at cherry for a moment then turned wordlessly and stamped out of the house marriage he thought as he left he walked for hours blind to where he was going what brought him back to awareness was a sensation he had not felt in a dozen years it was not morey abruptly realized the dying traces of his hangover that made his stomach feel so queer he was hungryactually hungry he looked about him he was in the old town miles from home jostled by crowds of lowerclass people the block he was on was as atrocious a slum as morey had ever seenchinese pagodas stood next to rococo imita tions of the chapels around versailles gingerbread marred every facade no building was without its brilliant signs and flarelights he saw a blindingly overdecorated eating establishment called billies budget busy bee and crossed the street toward it dodging through the unending streams of traf fic it was a miserable excuse for a restaurant but morey was in no mood to care he found a seat under a potted palm as far from the tinkling fountains and robot string ensemble as he could manage and ordered recklessly pay ing no attention to the ration prices as the waiter was gliding noiselessly away morey had a sickening realiza tion hed come out without his ration book he groaned out loud it was too late to leave without causing a dis turbance but then he thought rebelliously what differ ence did one more unrationed meal make anyhow food made him feel a little better he finished the last of his profiterole au chocolate not even leaving on the plate the uneaten onethird that tradition permitted and paid his check the robot cashier reached automatically for his ration book morey had a moment of grandeur as he said simply no ration stamps robot cashiers are not equipped to display surprise but this one tried the man behind morey in line audibly caught his breath and less audibly mumbled something about slummers morey took it as a compliment and strode outside feeling almost in good humor good enough to go home to cherry morey thought seriously of it for a second but he wasnt going to pre tend he was wrong and certainly cherry wasnt going to be willing to admit that she was at fault besides morey told himself grimly she was undoubt edly asleep that was an annoying thing about cherry at best she never had any trouble getting to sleep didnt even use her quota of sleeping tablets though morey had spoken to her about it more than once of course he re minded himself he had been so polite and tactful about it as befits a newlywed that very likely she hadnt even understood that it was a complaint well that would stop mans man morey fry wearing no collar ruff but his own strode determinedly down the streets of the old town hey joe want a good time morey took one unbelieving look you again he roared the little man stared at him in genuine surprise then a faint glimmer of recognition crossed his face oh yeah he said this morning hub he clucked com miseratingly too bad you wouldnt deal with me your wife was a lot smarter of course you got me a little sore jack so naturally i had to raise the price a little bit you skunk you cheated my poor wife blind you and i are going to the local station house and talk this over the little man pursed his lips we are hub morey nodded vigorously damn right and let me tell you he stopped in the middle of a threat as a large hand cupped around his shoulder the equally large man who owned the hand said in a mild and cultured voice is this gentleman disturbing you sam not so far the little man conceded he might want to though so dont go away morey wrenched his shoulder away dont think you can strongarm me im taking you to the police sam shook his head unbelievingly you mean youre going to call the law in on this i certainly am sam sighed regretfully what do you think of that walter treating his wife like that such a nice lady too what are you talking about morey demanded stung on a peculiarly sensitive spot im talking about your wife sam explained of course im not married myself but it seems to me that if i was i wouldnt call the police when my wife was en gaged in some kind of criminal activity or other no sir id try to settle it myself tell you what he advised why dont you talk this over with her make her see the error of wait a minute morey interrupted you mean youd involve my wife in this thing the man spread his hands helplessly its not me that would involve her buster he said she already involved her own self it takes two to make a crime you know i sell maybe i wont deny it but after all i cant sell unless somebody buys can i morey stared at him glumly he glanced in quick specu lation at the largesized walter but walter was just as big as hed remembered so that took care of that violence was out the police were out that left no really attractive way of capitalizing on the good luck of running into the man again sam said well im glad to see thats off your mind now returning to my original question mac how would you like a good time you look like a smart fellow to me you look like youd be kind of interested in a place i happen to know of down the block morey said bitterly so youre a divesteerer too a real talented man i admit it sam agreed stamp business is slow at night in my experience people have their minds more on a good time and believe me a good time is what i can show em take this place im talking about uncle pig gottys is the name of it its what i would call an unusual kind of place wouldnt you say so walter oh i agree with you entirely walter rumbled but morey was hardly listening he said uncle pig gottys you say thats right said sam morey frowned for a moment digesting an idea uncle piggottys sounded like the place howland had been talk ing about back at the plant it might be interesting at that while he was making up his mind sam slipped an arm through his on one side and walter amiably wrapped a big hand around the other morey found himself walking youti like it sam promised comfortably no hard feelings about this morning sport of course not once you get a look at piggottys youti get over your mad any how its something special i swear on what they pay me for bringing in customers i wouldnt do it unless i believed in it dance jack the hostess yelled over the noise at the bar she stepped back lifted her flounced skirts to ankle height and executed a tricky ninestep my name is morey morey yelled back and i dont want to dance thanks the hostess shrugged frowned meaningfully at sam and danced away sam flagged the bartender first rounds on us he explained to morey then we wont bother you any more unless you want us to of course like the place morey hesitated but sam didnt wait fine place he yelled and picked up the drink the bartender left him see you around he and the big man were gone morey stared after them uncertainly then gave it up he was here anyhow might as well at least have a drink he ordered and looked around uncle piggottys was a thirdrate dive disguised to look in parts of it at least like one of the exclusive upperclass country clubs the bar for instance was treated to re semble the clean lines of nailed wood but underneath the surface treatment morey could detect the intricate lamina tions of plyplastic what at first glance appeared to be burlap hangings were in actuality elaborately textured synthetics and all through the bar the motif was carried out a floor show of sorts was going on but nobody seemed to be paying much attention to it morey straining briefly to hear the master of ceremonies gathered that the wit was on a more than mildly vulgar level there was a dispirited string of chorus beauties in long ruffled pantaloons and diaphanous tops one of them morey was almost sure was the hostess who had talked to him just a few moments before next to him a man was declaiming to a middleaged woman smote i the monstrous rock yahoo smote i the turgid tube bully boy smote i the cankered hill why morey he interrupted himself what are you doing here he turned farther around and morey recognized him hello howland he said iuh happened to be free tonight so i thought howland sniggered well guess your wife is more liberal than mine was order a drink boy thanks ive got one said morey the woman with a tigerish look at morey said dont stop everett that was one of your most beautiful things oh moreys heard my poetry howland said morey id like you to meet a very lovely and talented young lady tanaquil bigelow morey works in the office with me tan obviously said tanaquil bigelow in a frozen voice and morey hastily withdrew the hand he had begun to put out the conversation stuck there impaled the woman cold rowland relaxed and abstracted morey wondering if after all this had been such a good idea he caught the eyecell of the robot bartender and ordered a round of drinks for the three of them politely putting them on howlands ration book by the time the drinks had come and morey had just got around to deciding that it wasnt a very good idea the woman had all of a sudden become thawed she said abruptly you look like the kind of man who thinks morey and i like to talk to that kind of man frankly morey i just dont have any patience at all with the stupid stodgy men who just work in their offices all day and eat all their dinners every night and gad about and consume like mad and where does it all get them anyhow thats right i can see you understand just one crazy rush of consume consume from the day youre born plop to the day youre buried pop and whos to blame if not the robots faintly a tinge of worry began to appear on the surface of howlands relaxed calm tan he chided morey may not be very interested in politics politics morey thought well at least that was a clue hed had the dizzying feeling while the woman was talk ing that he himself was the ball in the games machine he had designed for the shop earlier that day following the womans conversation might at that give his next design some valuable pointers in swoops curves and obstacles he said with more than half truth no please go on miss bigelow im very much interested she smiled then abruptly her face changed to a fright ening scowl morey flinched but evidently the scowl wasnt meant for him robots she hissed supposed to work for us arent they hah were their slaves slaves for every moment of every miserable day of our lives slaves wouldnt you like to join us and be free morey morey took cover in his drink he made an expressive gesture with his free handexpressive of exactly what he didnt truly know for he was lost but it seemed to satisfy the woman she said accusingly did you know that more than threequarters of the people in this country have had a nervous breakdown in the past five years and four months that more than half of them are under the constant care of psychiatrists for psychosisnot just plain ordinary neurosis like my husbands got and rowland here has got and youve got but psychosis like ive got did you know that did you know that forty per cent of the population are essentially manic depressive thirtyone per cent are schizoid thirtyeight per cent have an assortment of other unfixed psychogenic disturbances and twentyfour hold it a minute tan howland interrupted critically youve got too many per cents there start over again oh the hell with it the woman said moodily i wish my husband were here he expresses it so much better than i do she swallowed her drink since youve wrig gled off the hook she said nastily to morey how about setting up another roundon my ration book this time morey did it was the simplest thing to do in his con fusion when that was gone they had another on how lands book as near as he could figure out the woman her husband and quite possibly howland as well belonged to some kind of antirobot group morey had heard of such things they had a quasilegal status neither approved nor prohibited but he had never come into contact with them before re membering the hatred he had so painfully relived at the psychodrama session he thought anxiously that perhaps he belonged with them but question them though he might he couldnt seem to get the principles of the organ ization firmly in mind the woman finally gave up trying to explain it and went off to find her husband while morey and howland had another drink and listened to two drunks squabble over who bought the next round they were at the al phonsegaston stage of inebriation they would regret it m the morning for each was bending over backward to per mit the other to pay the ration points morey wondered uneasily about his own points howland was certainly get ting credit for a lot of moreys driaking tonight served him right for forgetting his book of course when the woman came back it was with the large man morey had encountered in the company of sam the coun terfeiter steerer and general man about old town a remarkably small world isnt it boomed walter bigelow only slightly crushing moreys hand in his well sir my wife has told me how interested you are in the basic philosophical drives behind our movement and i should like to discuss them further with you to begin with sir have you considered the principle of twoness morey said why very good said bigelow courteously he cleared his throat and declaimed hanheaded cathay saw it first bright as brightest solar burst whipped it into boy and girl the blinding spiralsliced swirl yang and yin he shrugged deprecatingly just the first stanza he said i dont know if you got much out of it well no morey admitted second stanza bigelow said firmly hegal saw if saw it clear jackal marx drew near drew near oer his shoulder saw it plain turned it upside down again yang and yin there was an expectant pause morey said iuh wraps it all up doesnt it bigelows wife demanded oh if only others could see it as clearly as you do the robot peril and the robot savior starvation and surfeit always twoness always bigelow patted moreys shoulder the next stanza makes it even clearer he said its really very clever i shouldnt say it of course but its howlands as much as its mine he helped me with the verses morey darted a glance at howland but howland was carefully looking away third stanza said bigelow this is a hard one because its long so pay attention justice tip your sightless scales one pan rises one pan falls howland he interrupted himself are you sure about that rhyme i always trip over it well anyway add to a and b grows less as bs partner nonetheless next the twoness that there be in even electricity chart the current as ifs found sine the hot lead line the ground the wild sine dances soars and falls but only to figures the zero calls sine wave scales all things that be share a reciprocity male and female light and dark name the numbers of noahs ark yang and yini dearest shrieked bigelows wife youve never done it better there was a spatter of applause and morey realized for the first time that half the bar had stopped its noisy revel to listen to them bigelow was evidently quite a wellknown figure here morey said weakly ive never heard anything like it he turned hesitantly to howland who promptly said drink what we all need right now is a drink they had a drink on bigelows book morey got howland aside and asked him look level with me are these people nuts howland showed pique no certainly not does that poem mean anything does this whole busi ness of twoness mean anything howland shrugged if it means something to them it means something theyre philosophers morey they see deep into things you dont know what a privilege it is for me to be allowed to associate with them they had another drink on rowlands book of course morey eased walter bigelow over to a quiet spot he said leaving twoness out of it for the moment whats this about the robots bigelow looked at him roundeyed didnt you under stand the poem of course i did but diagram it for me in simple terms so i can tell my wife bigelow beamed its about the dichotomy of robots he explained like the little salt mill that the boy wished for it ground out salt and ground outsalt and ground out salt he had to have salt but not that much salt whitehead explains it clearly they had another drink on bigelows book morey wavered over tanaquil bigelow he said fuzzily listen mrs walter tanaquil strongarm bigelow listen she grinned smugly at him brown hair she said dreamily morey shook his head vigorously never mind hair he ordered never mind poem listen in precise and ele men tary terms explain to me what is wrong with the world today not enough brown hair she said promptly never mind hair all right she said agreeably too many robots too many robots make too much of everything ha got it morey exclaimed triumphantly get rid of robots oh no no no no we wouldnt eat everything is mechanized cant get rid of them cant slow down pro ductionslowing down is dying stopping is quicker dying principle of twoness is the concept that clarifies all these no morey said violently what should we do do ill tell you what we should do if thats what you want i can tell you then tell me what we should do is tanaquil hiccupped with a look of refilled consternationhave another drink they had another drink he gallantly let her pay of course she ungallantly argued with the bartender about the ration points due her though not a twofisted drinker morey tried he really worked at it he paid the price too for some little time before his limbs stopped moving his mind stopped functioning blackout almost a blackout at any rate for all he re tamed of the late evening was a kaleidoscope of people and places and things howland was there drunk as a skunk disgracefully drunk morey remembered thinking as he stared up at howland from the floor the bigelows were there his wife cherry solicitous and amused was there and oddly enough henry was there it was very very hard to reconstruct morey devoted a whole mornings hangover to the effort it was important to reconstruct it for some reason but morey couldnt even remember what the reason was and finally he dis missed it guessing that he had either solved the secret of twoness or whether tanaquil bigelows remarkable figure was natural he did however know that the next morning he had waked in his own bed with no recollection of getting there no recollection of anything much at least not of anything that fit into the proper chronological order or seemed to mesh with anything else after the dozenth drink when he and howland arms around each others shoul ders composed a new verse on twoness and plagiarizing an old marching tune howled it across the boisterous bar room a twoness on the scene much later rests in your refrigerator heat your house and insulate if next your food refrigerate it frost will damp your freon coils so flux in nichrome till it boils see the picture heat in cold in heat in cold the storys told giantwrit the sacred scrawl oh the twoness of it all yang and yin it had at any rate seemed to mean something at the time if alcohol opened moreys eyes to the fact that there was a twoness perhaps alcohol was what he needed for there was call it a dichotomy if the word seems more couth a kind of twopronged struggle the struggle of two unweary ing runners in an immortal race there is the refrigerator inside the house the cold air the bubble of heated air that is the house the bubble of cooled air that is the re frigerator the momentary bubble of heated air that de frosts it call the heat yang if you will call the cold yin yang overtakes yin then yin passes yang then yang passes yin then give them other names call yin a mouth call yang a hand if the hand rests the mouth will starve if the mouth stops the hand will die the hand yang moves faster yin may not lag behind then call yang a robot and remember that a pipeline has two ends like any onceinalifetime lush morey braced himself for the consequencesand found startledly that there were none cherry was a surprise to him you were so funny she giggled and honestly so romantic he shakily swallowed his breakfast coffee the office staff roared and slapped him on the back howland tells us youre living high boy they bellowed more or less in the same words hey listen to what morey didwent on the town for the night of a lifetime and didnt even bring his ration book along to cash in they thought it was a wonderful joke but then everything was going well cherry it seemed had reformed out of recognition true she still hated to go out in the evening and morey never saw her forcing herself to gorge on unwanted food or play undesired games but moping into the pantry one afternoon he found to his in credulous delight that they were well ahead of their ration quotas in some items in fact they were outa months supply and more was gone ahead of schedule nor was it the counterfeit stamps for he had found them tucked behind a bainmarie and quietly burned them he cast about for ways of complimenting her but caution prevailed she was sensitive on the subject leave it be and virtue had its reward wainwright called him in all smiles morey great news weve all appreciated your work here and weve been able to show it in some more tangible way than compliments i didnt want to say anything till it was definite butyour status has been reviewed by classifica tion and the ration board youre out of class four minor morey morey said tremulously hardly daring to hope im a full class four class five morey class five when we do something we do it right we asked for a special waiver and got it youve skipped a whole class he added honestly not that it was just our backing that did it of course your own recent splendid record of consumption helped a lot i told you you could do it morey had to sit down he missed the rest of what wainwright had to say but it couldnt have mattered he escaped from the office sidestepped the knot of fellow employees waiting to congratulate him and got to a phone cherry was as ecstatic and inarticulate as he oh dar ling was all she could say and i couldnt have done it without you he babbled wainwright as much as said so himself said if it wasnt for the way wewell you have been keeping up with the rations it never would have got by the board ive been meaning to say something to you about that dear but i just havent known how but i do appreciate it i hello there was a curious silence at the other end of the phone hello he repeated worriedly cherrys voice was intense and low morey fry i think youre mean i wish you hadnt spoiled the good news and she hung up morey stared slackjawed at the phone howland appeared behind him chuckling women he said never try to figure them anyway congratula tions morey thanks morey mumbled howland coughed and said uhby the way morey now that youre one of the big shots so to speak you wontuhfeel obliged towell say anything to wain wright for instance about anything i may have said while w excuse me morey said imhearing and pushed past him he thought wildly of calling cherry back of racing home to see just what hed said that was wrong not that there was much doubt of course hed touched her on her sore point anyhow his wristwatch was chiming a reminder of the fact that his psychiatric appointment for the week was coming up morey sighed the day gives and the day takes away blessed is the day that gives only good things if any the session went badly many of the sessions had been going badly morey decided there had been more and more whispering in knots of doctors from which he was excluded poking and probing in the dark instead of the precise psychic surgery he was used to something was wrong he thought something was semmelweiss confirmed it when he ad journed the group session after the other doctor had left he sat morey down for a private talk on his own time toohe didnt ask for his usual ration fee that told morey how important the problem was morey said semmelweiss youre holding back i dont mean to doctor morey said earnestly who knows what you mean to do part of you means to weve dug pretty deep and weve found some important things now theres something i cant put my finger on exploring the mind morey is like sending scouts through cannibal territory you cant see the can nibalsuntil its too late but if you send a scout through the jungle and he doesnt show up on the other side its a fair assumption that something obstructed his way in that case we would label the obstruction cannibals in the case of the human mind we label the obstruction a trauma what the trauma is or what its effects on be havior will be we have to find out once we know that its there morey nodded all of this was familiar he couldnt see what semmelweiss was driving at semmelweiss sighed the trouble with healing traumas and penetrating psychic blocks and releasing inhibitions the trouble with everything we psychiatrists do in fact is that we cant afford to do it too well an inhibited man is under a strain we try to relieve the strain but if we succeed completely leaving him with no inhibitions at all we have an outlaw morey inhibitions are often socially necessary suppose for instance that an average man were not inhibited against blatant waste it could happen you know suppose that instead of consuming his ration quota in an orderly and responsible way he did such things as set fire to his house and everything in it or dumped his food allotment in the river when only a few individuals are doing it we treat the individuals but if it were done on a mass scale morey it would be the end of society as we know it think of the whole collection of antisocial actions that you see in every paper man beats wife wife turns into a harpy junior smashes up windows husband starts a blackmarket stamp racket and every one of them traces to a basic weakness in the minds defenses against the most impor tant single antisocial phenomenonfailure to consume morey flared thats not fair doctor that was weeks ago weve certainly been on the ball lately i was just commended by the board in fact the doctor said mildly why so violent morey i only made a general remark its just natural to resent being accused the doctor shrugged first foremost and above all we do not accuse patients of things we try to help you find things out he lit his endofsession cigarette think about it please ill see you next week cherry was composed and unapproachable she kissed him remotely when he came in she said i called mother and told her the good news she and dad promised to come over here to celebrate yeah said morey darling what did i say wrong on the phone theyll be here about six sure but what did i say was it about the rations if youre sensitive i swear never mention them again i am sensitive morey he said despairingly im sorry i just he had a better idea he kissed her cherry was passive at first but not for long when he had finished kissing her she pushed him away and actually giggled let me get dressed for dinner certainly anyhow i was just she laid a finger on his lips he let her escape and feeling much less tense drifted into the library the afternoon papers were waiting for him virtuously he sat down and began going through them in order midway through the worldtelegramsun postandnews he rang for henry morey had read clear through to the drama section of the timesheraldtribunemirror before the robot ap peared good evening it said politely what took you so long morey demanded where are all the robots robots do not stammer but there was a distinct pause before henry said belowstairs sir did you want them for something well no i just havent seen them around get me a drink it hesitated scotch sir before dinner get me a manhattan were all out of vermouth sir all out would you mind telling me how its all used up sir now thats just ridiculous morey snapped we have never run out of liquor in our whole lives and you know it good heavens we just got our allotment in the other day and i certainly he checked himself there was a sudden flicker of horror in his eyes as he stared at henry you certainly what sir the robot prompted morey swallowed henry did idid i do something i shouldnt have im sure i wouldnt know sir it isnt up to me to say what you should and shouldnt do of course not morey agreed grayly he sat rigid staring hopelessly into space remembering what he remembered was no pleasure to him at all henry he said come along were going belowstairs right now it had been tanaquil bigelows remark about the robots too many robotsmake too much of everything that had implanted the idea it germinated in moreys home more than a little drunk less than ordinarily in hibited he had found the problem clear and the answer obvious he stared around him in dismal worry his ovm robots following his own orders given weeks before henry said its just what you told us to do sir morey groaned he was watching a scene of unparal leled activity and it sent shivers up and down his spine there was the butlerrobot hard at work his copper face expressionless dressed in moreys own sports knick ers and golfing shoes the robot solemnly hit a ball against the wall picked it up and teed it hit it again over and again with moreys own clubs until the ball wore rag ged and was replaced and the shafts of the clubs leaned out of true and the closestitched seams in the clothing began to stretch and abrade my god said morey hollowly there were the maidrobots exquisitely dressed in cherrys best walking up and down in the delicate slim shoes sitting and rising and bending and turning the cookrobots and the sendngrobots were preparing diony sian meals morey swallowed youyouve been doing this right along he said to henry thats why the quotas have been filled oh yes sir just as you told us morey had to sit down one of the servingrobots po litely scurried over with a chair brought from upstairs fo their new chores waste morey tasted the word between his lips waste you never wasted things you used them if necessary you drove yourself to the edge of breakdown to use them you made every breath a burden and every hour a torment to use them until through diligent consuming and or oc cupational merit you were promoted to the next higher class and were allowed to consume less frantically but you didnt wantonly destroy or throw out you consumed morey thought fearfully when the board finds out about this still he reminded himself the board hadnt found out it might take some time before they did for humans after all never entered robot quarters there was no law against it not even a sacrosanct custom but there was no reason to when breaks occurred which was infrequently main tenance robots or repair squads came in and put them back in order usually the humans involved didnt even know it had happened because the robots used their own tbr radio circuits and the process was next thing to auto matic morey said reprovingly henry you should have told well i mean reminded me about this but sir henry protested dont tell a living soul you said you made it a direct order umph well keep it that way iuh have to go back upstairs better get the rest of the robots started on dinner morey left not comfortably the dinner to celebrate moreys promotion wasdifficult morey liked cherrys parents old elon after the pre marriage inquisition that father must inevitably give to daughters suitor had buckled right down to the job of adjustment the old folks were good about not interfering good about keeping their superior social status to them selves good about helping out on the budgetat least once a week they could be relied on to come over for a hearty meal and mrs elon had more than once remade some of cherrys new dresses to fit herself even to the extent of wearing all the highpoint ornamentation and they had been wonderful about the wedding gifts when morey and their daughter got married the most any member of moreys family had been willing to take was a silver set or a few crystal table pieces the elons had come through with a dazzling promise to accept a car a birdbath for their garden and a complete set of livingroom furniture of course they could afford it they had to consume so little that it wasnt much strain for them even to take gifts of that magnitude but without their help morey knew the first few months of matrimony would have been even tougher consuming than they were but on this particular night it was hard for morey to like anyone he responded with monosyllables he barely grunted when elon proposed a toast to his promotion and his brilliant future he was preoccupied rightly so morey in his deepest bravest searching could find no clue in his memory as to just what the pun ishment might be for what he had done but he had a sick certainty that trouble lay ahead morey went over his problem so many times that an anesthesia set in by the time dinner was ended and he and his fatherinlaw were in the den with their brandy he was more or less functioning again elon for the first time since morey had known him offered him one of his cigars youre grade fivecan afford to smoke somebody elses now hey yeah morey said glumly there was a moment of silence then elon as punctili ous as any companionrobot coughed and tried again remember being peaked till i hit grade five he remin isced meaningfully consuming keeps a man on the go all right things piled up at the law office couldnt be taken care of while ration points piled up too and con suming comes first of coursethats a citizens prime duty mother and i had our share of grief over that but a couple that wants to make a go of marriage and citizen ship just pitches in and does the job hey morey repressed a shudder and managed to nod best thing about upgrading eton went on as if he had elicited a satisfactory answer dont have to spend so much time consuming give more attention to work great est luxury in the world work wish i had as much stamina as you young fellows five days a week in court are about all i can manage hit six for a while relaxed first time in my life but my doctor made me cut down said we cant overdo pleasures youll be working two days a week now hey morey produced another nod elon drew deeply on his cigar his eyes bright as they watched morey he was visibly puzzled and morey even in his halfdaze could recognize the exact moment at which elon drew the wrong inference ah everything okay with you and cherry he asked diplomatically fine morey exclaimed couldnt be better good good elon changed the subject with almost an audible wrench speaking of court had an interesting case the other day young fellowyear or two younger than you i guesscame in with a section ninetyseven on him know what that is breaking and entering breaking and entering morey repeated wonderingly interested in spite of himself breaking and entering what houses old term laws full of them originally ap plied to stealing things still does i discovered you mean he stole something morey asked in be wilderment exactly he stole strangest thing i ever came across talked it over with one of his bunch of lawyers later new one on him too seems this kid had a girl friend nice kid but a little you know plump she got interested in art theres nothing wrong with that morey said nothing wrong with her either she didnt do any thing she didnt like him too much though wouldnt marry him kid got to thinking about how he could get her to change her mind andwell you know that big mondrian in the museum ive never been there morey said somewhat embar rassed urn ought to try it some day boy anyway comes closing time at the museum the other day this kid sneaks in he steals the painting thats rightsteals it takes it to give to the girl morey shook his head blankly i never heard of any thing like that in my life not many have girl wouldnt take it by the way got scared when he brought it to her she mustve tipped off the police i guess somebody did took em three hours to find it even when they knew it was hanging on a wall pretty poor kid fortytwo room house and there was a law against it morey asked i mean its like making a law against breathing certainly was old law of course kid got set back two grades would have been more but my god he was only a grade three as it was yeah said morey wetting his lips say dad urn morey cleared his throat uh wonder mean whats the penalty for instance for things likewell mis using rations or anything like that elons eyebrows went high misusing rations say yon had a liquor ration it might be and instead of drinking it youwell flushed it down the drain or something his voice trailed off elon was frowning he said funny thing seems im not as broadminded as i thought i was for some reason i dont find that amusing sorry morey croaked and he certainly was it might be dishonest but it was doing him a lot of good for days went by and no one seemed to have pene trated his secret cherry was happy wainwright found oc casion after occasion to pat moreys back the wages of sin were turning out to be prosperity and happiness there was a bad moment when morey came home to find cherry in the middle of supervising a team of packing robots the new house suitable to his higher grade was ready and they were expected to move in the next day but cherry hadnt been belowstairs and morey had his household robots clean up the evidences of what they had been doing before the packers got that far the new house was by moreys standards pure lux ury it was only fifteen rooms morey had shrewdly retained one more robot than was required for a class five and had been allowed a compensating deduction in the size of his house the robot quarters were less secluded than in the old house though and that was a disadvantage more than once cherry had snuggled up to him in the delightful in timacy of their one bed in their single bedroom and said with faint curiosity i wish theyd stop that noise and morey had promised to speak to henry about it in the morning but there was nothing he could say to henry of course unless he ordered henry to stop the tireless con suming through each of the days twentyfour hours that kept them always ahead but never quite far enough ahead of the inexorable weekly increment of ration quotas but though cherry might once in a while have a mo ments curiosity about what the robots were doing she was not likely to be able to guess at the facts her up bringing was for once on moreys sideshe knew so little of the grind grind grind of consuming that was the lot of the lower classes that she scarcely noticed that there was less of it morey almost sometimes relaxed he thought of many ingenious chores for robots and the robots politely and emotionlessly obeyed morey was a success it wasnt all gravy there was a nervous moment for morey when the quarterly survey report came in the mail as the day for the ration board to check over the degree of wear on the turnedin discards came due morey began to sweat the clothing and furniture and household goods the robots had consumed for him were very nearly in shreds it had to look plausible that was the big thing no normal person would wear a hole completely through the knee of a pair of pants as henry had done with his dress suit before morey stopped him would the board question it worse was there something about the way the robots consumed the stuff that would give the whole show away some special wear point in the robot anatomy for in stance that would rub a hole where no humans body could or stretch a seam that should normally be under no strain at all it was worrisome but the worry was needless when the report of survey came morey let out a longheld breath not a single item disallowed morey was a successand so was his scheme to the successful man come the rewards of success morey arrived home one evening after a hard days work at the office and was alarmed to find another car parked in his drive it was a tiny twoseater the sort affected by top officials and the very welltodo right then and there morey learned the first half of the embezzlers lesson anything different is dangerous he came uneasily into his own home fearful that some high officer of the ration board had come to ask questions but cherry was glowing mr porfirio is a newspaper feature writer and he wants to write you up for their consumers of distinction page morey i couldnt be more proud thanks said morey ginmiy hello mr porfirio shook moreys hand warmly im not ex actly from a newspaper he corrected transvideo press is what it is actually were a news wire service we sup ply fortyseven hundred papers with news and feature material every one of them he added complacently on the required consumption list of grades one through six inclusive we have a sunday supplement selfhelp feature on consuming problems and we like towell give credit where credit is due youve established an enviable record mr fry wed like to tell our readers about it urn said morey lets go in the drawing room oh no cherry said firmly i want to hear this hes so modest mr porfirio youd really never know what kind of a man he is just to listen to him talk why my goodness im his wife and i swear dont know how he does all the consuming he does he simply have a drink mr porfirio morey said against all etiquette rye scotch bourbon ginandtonic brandy alexander dry manha mean what would you like he became conscious that he was babbling like a fool anything said the newsman rye is fine now mr fry i notice youve fixed up your place very attractively here and your wife says that your country home is just as nice as soon as i came in i said to myself beautiful home hardly a stick of furniture that isnt absolutely necessary might be a grade six or seven and mrs fry says the other place is even barer she does does she morey challenged sharply well let me tell you mr porfirio that every last scrap of my furniture allowance is accounted for i dont know what youre getting at but oh i certainly didnt mean to imply anything like that i just want to get some information from you that i can pass on to our readers you know to sort of help them do as well as yourself how do you do it morey swallowed weuhwell we just keep after it hard work thats all porfirio nodded admiringly hard work he repeated and fished a triplefolded sheet of paper out of his pocket to make notes on would you say he went on that anyone could do as well as you simply by devoting him self to itsetting a regular schedule for example and keeping to it very strictly oh yes said morey in other words its only a matter of doing what you have to do every day thats it exactly i handle the budget in my house more experience than my wife you seebut no reason a woman cant do it budgeting porfirio recorded approvingly thats our policy too the interview was not the terror it had seemed not even when porfirio tactfully called attention to cherrys slim waistline so many housewives mrs fry find it difficult to keep from beingwell a little plump and morey had to invent endless hours on the exercise machines while cherry looked faintly perplexed but did not interrupt from the interview however morey learned the second half of the embezzlers lesson after porfirio had gone he leaped in and spoke more than a little firmly to cherry that business of exercise dear we really have to start doing it i dont know if youve nodced it but you are beginning to get just a trifle heavier and we dont want that to happen do we in the following grim and unnecessary sessions on the mechanical horses morey had plenty of time to reflect on the lesson stolen treasures are less sweet than one would like when one dare not enjoy them in the open but some of moreys treasures were fairly earned the new bradmoor k spinagame for instance was his very own his job was design and creation and he was a fortunate man in that his efforts were permitted to be expended along the line of greatest social utility namely to increase consumption the spinagame was a wellnigh perfect machine for the purpose brilliant said wainwright beaming when the pilot machine had been put through its first tests guess they dont call me the talentpicker for nothing i knew you could do it boy even howland was lavish in his praise he sat munch ing on a plate of petitsfours he was still only a grade three while the tests were going on and when they were over he said enthusiastically its a beauty morey that seriescorruptersensational never saw a prettier piece of machinery morey flushed gratefully wainwright left exuding praise and morey patted his pilot model affectionately and admired its polychrome gleam the looks of the machine as wainwright had lec tured many a time were as important as its function you have to make them want to play it boy they wont play it if they dont see it and consequently the whole k series was distinguished by flashing rainbows of light provocative strains of music haunting scents that drifted into the nostrils of the passerby with compelling effect morey had drawn heavily on all the old masterpieces of designdie onearm bandit the pinball machine the juke box you put your ration book in the hopper you spun the wheels until you selected the game you wanted to play against the machine you punched buttons or spun dials or in any of different ways you pitted your human skill against the magnetictaped skills of the machine and you lost you had a chance to win but the inexor able statistics of the machines setting made sure that if you played long enough you had to lose that is to say if you risked a tenpoint ration stamp showing perhaps that you had consumed three sixcourse mealsyour statistic return was eight points you might hit the jackpot and get a thousand points back and thus be exempt from a whole freezerful of steaks and joints and prepared vegetables but it seldom happened most likely you lost and got nothing got nothing that is m the way of your hazarded ration stamps but the beauty of the machine which was moreys main contribution was that win or lose you always found a pellet of vitamindrenched sugarcoated antibiotic hor mone gum in the hopper you played your game won or lost your stake popped your hormone gum into your mouth and played another by the time that game was ended the gum was used up the coating dissolved you discarded it and started another thats what the man from the nrb liked howland told morey confidentially he took a set of schematics back with him they might install it on all new machines oh youre the fairhaired boy all right it was the first morey had heard about a man from the national ration board it was good news he excused himself and hurried to phone cherry the story of his latest successes he reached her at her mothers where she was spending the evening and she was properly impressed and affectionate he came back to howland in a glowing hu mor drink said howland diffidently sure said morey he could afford he thought to drink as much of howlands liquor as he liked poor guy sunk in the consuming quicksands of class three only fair for somebody a little more successful to give him a hand once in a while and when howland learning that cherry had left morey a bachelor for the evening proposed uncle pig gottys again morey hardly hesitated at all the bigelows were delighted to see him morey won dered briefly if they had a home certainly they didnt seem to spend much time in it it turned out they did because when morey indicated virtuously that hed only stopped in at piggottys for a single drink before dinner and howland revealed that he was free for the evening they captured morey and bore him off to their house tanaquil bigelow was haughtily apologetic i dont suppose this is the kind of place mr fry is used to she observed to her husband right across morey who was standing between them still we call it home morey made an appropriately polite remark actually the place nearly turned his stomach it was an enormous glaringly new mansion bigger even than moreys former house stuffed to bursting with bulging sofas and pianos and massive mahogany chairs and trid sets and bedrooms and drawing rooms and breakfast rooms and nurseries the nurseries were a shock to morey it had never oc cured to him that the bigelows had children but they did and though the children were only five and eight they were still up under the care of a brace of robot nurse maids doggedly playing with their overstuffed animals and miniature trains you dont know what a comfort tony and dick are tanaquil bigelow told morey they consume so much more than their rations walter says that every family ought to have at least two or three children to you know help out walters so intelligent about these things its a pleasure to hear him talk have you heard his poem morey the one he calls the twoness of morey hastily admitted that he had he reconciled him self to a glum evening the bigelows had been eccentric but fun back at uncle piggottys on their own ground they seemed just as eccentric but painfully dull they had a round of cocktails and another and then the bigelows no longer seemed so dull dinner was ghastly of course morey was nouveauriche enough to be a snob about his relatively spartan table but he minded his man ners and sampled with grim concentration each successive course of chunky protein and rich marinades with the help of the endless succession of table wines and liqueurs dinner ended without destroying his evening or his strained digestive system and afterward they were a pleasant company in the bigelows ornate drawing room tanaquil bigelow in con sultation with the children checked over their ration books and came up with the announcement that they would have a brief recital by a pair of robot dancers followed by string music by a robot quartet morey prepared himself for the worst but found before the dancers were through that he was enjoying himself strange lesson for morey when you didnt have to watch them the robot entertain ers were funt good night dears tanaquil bigelow said firmly to the children when the dancers were done the boys re belled naturally but they went it was only a matter of minutes though before one of them was back clutching at moreys sleeve with a pudgy hand morey looked at the boy uneasily having little experi ence with children he said uhwhat is it tony dick you mean the boy said gimme your auto graph he poked an engraved pad and a vulgarly jeweled pencil at morey morey dazedly signed and the child ran off morey star ing after him tanaquil bigelow laughed and explained he saw your name in porfirios column dick loves por firio reads him every day hes such an intellectual kid really hed always have his nose in a book if i didnt keep after him to play with his trains and watch trid that was quite a nice writeup walter bigelow com menteda little enviously morey thought bet you make consumer of the year i wish he sighed that we could get a little ahead on the quotas the way you did but it just never seems to work out we eat and play and con sume like crazy and somehow at the end of the month were always a little behind in somethingeverything keeps piling upand then the board sends us a warning and they call me down and first thing you know ive got a couple of hundred added penalty points and were worse off than before never you mind tanaquil replied staunchly con suming isnt everything in life you have your work bigelow nodded judiciously and offered morey another drink another drink however was not what morey needed he was sitting in a rosy glow less of alcohol than of sheer contentment with the world he said suddenly listen bigelow looked up from his own drink eh if i tell you something thats a secret will you keep it that way bigelow rumbled why i guess so morey but his wife cut in sharply certainly we will morey of course what is it there was a gleam in her eye morey noticed it puzzled him but he decided to ignore it he said about that writeup iim not such a hot shot consumer really you know in fact all of a sudden everyones eyes seemed to be on him for a tor tured moment morey wondered if he was doing the right thing a secret that two people know is compromised and a secret known to three people is no secret still its like this he said firmly you remember what we were talking about at uncle piggottys that night well when i went home i went down to the robot quarters and i he went on from there tanaquil bigelow said triumphantly i knew it walter bigelow gave his wife a mild reproving look he declared soberly youve done a big thing morey a mighty big thing god willing youve pronounced the death sentence on our society as we know it future gen orations will revere the name of morey fry he solemnly shook moreys hand morey said dazedly i what walter nodded it was a valedictory he turned to his wife tanaquil well have to call an emergency meeting of course walter she said devotedly and morey will have to be there yes youll have to morey no excuses we want the brotherhood to meet you right howland howland coughed uneasily he nodded noncommittally and took another drink morey demanded desperately what are you talking about howland you tell me howland fiddled with his drink well he said its like tan was telling you that night a few of us well politically mature persons have formed a little group we little group tanaquil bigelow said scornfully how land sometimes i wonder if you really catch the spirit of the thing at all its everybody morey everybody in the world why there are eighteen of us right here in old town there are scores more all over the world i knew you were up to something like this morey i told walter so the morning after we met you i said walter mark my words that man morey is up to sometliing but i must say she admitted worshipfully i didnt imow it would have the scope of what youre proposing now im aginea whole world of consumers rising as one man shouting the name of morey fry fighting the ration board with the boards own weaponthe robots what poetic justice bigelow nodded enthusiastically call uncle piggottys dear he ordered see if you can round up a quorum right now meanwhile morey and i are going belowstairs lets go moreylets get the new world started morey sat there openmouthed he closed it with a snap bigelow he whispered do you mean to say that youre going to spread this idea around through some kind of subversive organization subversive bigelow repeated stiffly my dear man all creative minds are subversive whether they operate singly or in such a group as the brotherhood of freemen i scarcely like never mind what you like morey insisted youre going to call a meeting of this brotherhood and you want me to tell them what i just told you is that right wellyes morey got up i wish i could say its been nice but it hasnt good night and he stormed out before they could stop him out on the street though his resolution deserted him he hailed a robot cab and ordered the driver to take him on the traditional timekilling ride through the park while he made up his mind the fact that he had left of course was not going to keep bigelow from going through with his announced in tention morey remembered now fragments of conversa tion from bigelow and his wife at uncle piggottys and cursed himself they had it was perfectly true said and hinted enough about politics and purposes to put him on his guard all that nonsense about twoness had diverted him from what should have been perfectly clear they were subversives indeed he glanced at his watch late but not too late cherry would still be at her parents home he leaned forward and gave the driver their address it was like beginning the first of a hundredshot series of injections you know its going to cure you but it hurts just the same morey said manfully and thats it sir i know ive been a fool im willing to take the consequences old elon rubbed his jaw thoughtfully um he said cherry and her mother had long passed the point where they could say anything at all they were seated side by side on a couch across the room listening with expres sions of strain and incredulity elon said abruptly excuse me phone call to make he left the room to make a brief call and returned he said over his shoulder to his wife coffee well need it got a problem here morey said do you think mean what should i do elon shrugged then surprisingly grinned what can you do he demanded cheerfully done plenty already id say drink some coffee call i made he explained was to jim my law clerk hell be here in a minute get some dope from jim then well know better cherry came over to morey and sat beside him all she said was dont worry but to morey it conveyed all the meaning in the world he returned the pressure of her hand with a feeling of deepest relief hell he said to him self why should i worry worst they can do to me is drop me a couple of grades and whats so bad about that he grimaced involuntarily he had remembered his own early struggles as a class one and what was so bad about that the law clerk arrived asmallish robot with a battered stainlesssteel hide and dull coppery features elon took the robot aside for a terse conversation before he came back to morey as i thought he said in satisfaction no precedent no laws prohibiting therefore no crime thank heaven morey said in ecstatic relief elon shook his head theyll probably give you a re conditioning and you cant expect to keep your grade five probably call it antisocial behavior is isnt it dashed morey said oh he frowned briefly then looked up all right dad if ive got it coming to me ill take my medicine way to talk elon said approvingly now go home get a good nights sleep first thing in the morning go to the ration board tell em the whole story beginning to end theyll be easy on you elon hesitated well fairly easy he amended i hope the condemned man ate a hearty breakfast he had to that morning as morey awoke he had the sick certainty that he was going to be consuming triple rations for a long long time to come he kissed cherry goodby and took the long ride to the ration board in silence he even left henry behind at the board he stammered at a series of receptionist robots and was finally brought into the presence of a mildly supercilious young man named hachette my name he started is morey fry iive come totalk over something ive been doing with certainly mr fry said hachette ill take you in to mr newman right away dont you want to know what i did demanded morey hachette smiled what makes you think we dont know he said and left that was surprise number one newman explained it he grinned at morey and rue fully shook his head all the time we get this he com plained people just dont take the trouble to learn any thing about the world around them son he demanded what do you think a robot is morey said hub i mean how do you think it operates do you think its just a kind of a man with a tin skin and wire nerves why no its a machine of course it isnt human newman beamed fine he said its a machine it hasnt got flesh or blood or intestinesor a brain oh he held up a handrobots are smart enough i dont mean that but an electronic thinking machine mr fry takes about as much space as the house youre living in it has to robots dont carry brains around with them brains are too heavy and much too bulky then how do they think with their brains of course but you just said i said they didnt carry them each robot is in constant radio communication with the master control on its tbr circuitthe talk between robots radio master control gives the answer the robot acts i see said morey well thats very interesting but but you still dont see said newman figure it out if the robot gets information from master control do you see that master control in return necessarily gets informa tion from the robot oh said morey then louder oh you mean that all my robots have been the words wouldnt come newman nodded in satisfaction every bit of informa tion of that sort comes to us as a matter of course why mr fry if you hadnt come in today we would have been sending for you within a very short time that was the second surprise morey bore up under it bravely after all it changed nothing he reminded him self he said well be that as it may sir here i am i came in of my own free will ive been using my robots to con sume my ration quotas indeed you have said newman and im willing to sign a statement to that effect any time you like i dont know what the penalty is but ill take it im guilty i admit my guilt newmans eyes were wide guilty he repeated pen alty morey was startled why yes he said im not deny ing anything penalties repeated newman musingly then he began to laugh he laughed morey thought to considerable excess morey saw nothing he could laugh at himself in the situation but the situation morey was forced to ad mit was rapidly getting completely incomprehensible sorry said newman at last wiping his eyes but i couldnt help it penalties well mr fry let me set your mind at rest i wouldnt worry about the penalties if i were you as soon as the reports began coming through on what you had done with your robots we naturally as signed a special team to keep observing you and we for warded a report to the national headquarters we made certainahrecommendations in it andwell to make a long story short the answers came back yesterday mr fry the national ration board is delighted to know of your contribution toward improving our distribu tion problem pending a further study a tentative program has been adopted for setting up consumingrobot units all over the country based on your scheme penalties mr fry youre a herol a hero has responsibilities moreys were quickly made clear to him he was allowed time for a brief reassuring visit to cherry a triumphal tour of his old office and then he was rushed off to washington to be quizzed he found the national ration board in a frenzy of work the most important job weve ever done one of the high officers told him i wouldnt be surprised if its the last one we ever have yes sir were trying to put our selves out of business for good and we dont want a single thing to go wrong anytiling i can do to help morey began diffidently youve done fine mr fry gave us just the push weve been needing it was there all the time for us to see but we were too close to the forest to see the trees if you get what i mean look im not much on rhetoric and this is the biggest step mankind has taken in centuries and i cant put it into words let me show you what weve been doing he and a delegation of other officials of the ration board and men whose names morey had repeatedly seen in the newspapers took morey on an inspection tour of the entire plant its a closed cycle you see he was told as they looked over a chamber of industriously plodding con sumerrobots working off a shipment of shoes nothing is permanently lost if you want a car you get one of the newest and best if not your car gets driven by a robot until its ready to be turned in and a new one gets built for next year we dont lose the metalsthey can be sal vaged all we lose is a little power and labor and the sun and the atom give us all the power we need and the robots give us more labor than we can use same thing applies of course to all products but whats in it for the robots morey asked i beg your pardon one of the biggest men in the country said uncomprehendingly morey had a difficult moment his analysis had condi tioned him against waste and this decidedly was sheer destruction of goods no matter how scientific the jargon might be if the consumer is just using up things for the sake of using them up he said doggedly realizing the danger he was inviting we could use wearandtear machines in stead of robots after all why waste them they looked at each other worriedly but thats what you were doing one pointed out with a faint note of threat oh no morey quickly objected i built in satisfac tion circuitsmy training in design you know adjustable circuits of course satisfaction circuits he was asked adjustable well sure if the robot gets no satisfaction out of using up things dont talk nonsense growled the ration board offi cial robots arent human how do you make them feel satisfaction and adjustable satisfaction at that morey explained it was a highly technical explanation involving the use of great sheets of paper and elaborate diagrams but there were trained men in the group and they became even more excited than before beautiful one cried in scientific rapture why it takes care of every possible moral legal and psychological argument what does the ration board official demanded how you tell him mr fry morey tried and couldnt but he could show how his principle operated the ration board lab was turned over to him complete with more assistants than he knew how to give orders to and they built satisfaction circuits for a squad of robots working in a hat factory then morey gave his demonstration the robots manu factured hats of all sorts he adjusted the circuits at the end of the day and the robots began trying on the hats squabbling over them each coming away triumphantly with a huge and diverse selection their metallic features were incapable of showing pride or pleasure but both were evident in the way they wore their hats their fierce possessiveness and their faster neater more intensive more dedicated work to produce a still greater quantity of hats which they also were allowed to own you see an engineer exclaimed deughtedly they can be adjusted to want hats to wear them loyingly to wear the hats to pieces and not just for the sake of wear ing them outthe hats are an incentive for them but how can we go on producing just hats and more hats the ration board man asked puzzledly civiliza tion does not live by hats alone that said morey modestly is the beauty of it look he set the adjustment of the satisfaction circuit as porter robots brought in skids of gloves the hatmanu facturing robots fought over the gloves with the same mechanical passion as they had for hats and that can apply to anything we or the robots produce morey added everything from pins to yachts but the point is that they get satisfaction from possession and the craving can be regulated according to the glut in various industries and the robots show their appreciation by working harder he hesitated thats what i did for my servantrobote its a feedback you see satisfaction leads to more workand better workand that means more goods which they can be made to want which means incentive to work and so on all around closed cycle whispered the ration board man in awe a reed closed cycle this time and so the inexorable laws of supply and demand were irrevocably repealed no longer was mankind hampered by inadequate supply or drowned by overproduction what mankind needed was there what the race did not require passed into the insatiableand adjustablerobot maw nothing was wasted for a pipeline has two ends morey was thanked complimented rewarded given a tickertape parade through the city and put on a plane back home by that time the ration board had liquidated itself cherry met him at the airport they jabbered excitedly at each other all the way to the house in their own living room they finished the kiss they had greeted each other with at last cherry broke away laughing morey said did i tell yon im through with bradmoor from now on i work for the board as civilian consultant and he added impressively starting right away im a class eight my gasped cherry so worshipfully that morey felt a twinge of conscience he saidhonestly of course if what they were saying in washington is so the classes arent going to mean much pretty soon still its quite an honor it certainly is cherry said staunchly why dads only a class eight himself and hes been a judge for i dont know how many years morey pursed his lips we cant all be fortunate he said generously of course the classes still will count for somethingthat is a class one will have so much to con sume in a year a class two will have a little less and so on but each person in each class will have robot help you see to do the actual consuming the way its going to be special facsimile robots will cherry flagged him down i know dear each family gets a robot duplicate of every person in the family oh said morey slightly annoyed how did you know ours came yesterday she explained the man from the board said we were the first in the areabecause it was your idea of course they havent even been activated yet ive still got them in the green room want to see them sure said morey buoyantly he dashed ahead of cherry to inspect the results of his own brainstorm there they were standing statuestill against the wall waiting to be energized to begin their endless tasks yours is real pretty morey said gallantly butsay is that thing supposed to look like me he inspected the chromium face of the manrobot disapprovingly only roughly the man said cherry was right behind him notice anything else morey leaned closer inspecting the features of the facsimile robot at a close range well no he said its got a kind of a squint that i dont like butoh you mean that he bent over to examine a smaller robot half hidden between the other pair it was less than two feet high bigheaded pudgylimbed thickbellied in fact morey thought wonderingly it looked almost like my god morey spun around staring wideeyed at his wife you mean i mean said cherry blushing slightly morey reached out to grab her in his arms darling he cried why didnt you tell me
