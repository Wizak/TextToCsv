 prologue mother anna macgregor clasped hands with her son as he crouched at her feet panic fear grief surged through her and met a solid wall of will she wouldnt lose control now she couldnt her children were coming caine her fingers were icy as they tightened on his but they were steady her face was almost colorless from the strain of the past few hours and her eyes were dark dark young and frightened it flashed through caine that hed never seen his mother frightened before not ever are you all right of course she knew what he needed and brushed her lips over his cheek better now that youre here with her free hand she gripped dianas as her daughterinlaw sat beside her wet snow clung to dianas long dark hair and was already melting on the shoulders of her coat anna took a long breath before she looked back at caine you got here quickly we chartered a plane there was a little boy inside the grown man the attorney the new father who wanted to scream out a denial his father was invulnerable his father was the macgregor he couldnt be lying broken in a hospital how bad is he she was a doctor and could tell him precisely the broken ribs the collapsed lung the concussion and the internal bleeding which her colleagues were even now struggling to stop she was also a mother hes in surgery she kept her hand tight on his and nearly managed to smile hes strong caine and dr feinstein is the best in the state she had to hold on to that and to her family laura lauras with lucy robinson diana said quietly she knew well what it was like to hold emotions in slowly she massaged annas fingers dont worry no im not this time anna managed the smile but you know daniel lauras his first granddaughter hell be full of questions when he wakes up and he would wake up she promised herself by god he would anna diana slipped an arm around her motherinlaws shoulders she looked so small so frail have you eaten what anna gave a tiny shake of her head then rose three hours hed been in surgery for three hours how many times had she been in the operating room fighting to save a life while a loved one agonized in these plastic waiting rooms these cold corridors shed struggled and studied to be a doctor to ease pain to heal to somehow in some way make a difference now when her husband was hurt she could do no more than wait like any other woman no not like any woman she corrected herself because she knew what the operating room looked like what it sounded and smelled like she knew the instruments the machines and the sweat too well she wanted to scream she folded her hands and walked to the window there was a will of iron behind her dark quiet eyes shed use it now for herself for her children but mostly for daniel if it were possible to bring him back with sheer desire she would do so there was more to doctoring much more to healing she knew than skill the snow had nearly stopped the snow she thought as she watched it fall thinly had caused the roads to be slick and treacherous the snow had blinded some young man caused his car to spin out of control and crash into her husbands foolish little twoseater her hands balled into fists why werent you in the limo old man what were you trying to prove with that flashy red toy always showing off always her thoughts trailed away going back in time her hands unclenched wasnt that one of the reasons shed fallen in love with him wasnt that one of the reasons shed loved and lived with him for nearly forty years damn you daniel macgregor no one can tell you anything anna pressed her fingers to her eyes and nearly laughed she couldnt count the number of times shed said that to him over their lifetime together and adored him for it the sound of footsteps had her whirling bracing then she saw alan her oldest son daniel had sworn before he had ever had a child that one of his offspring would be in the white house though alan was close to making the oath reality he was the only one of her children who took more after herself than their father the macgregor genes were strong the macgregors were strong she let herself be folded in alans arms hell be glad youre here her voice was steady but there was a woman inside her who wanted to weep and weep but hes bound to scold you for bringing your wife out in her condition anna smiled at shelby and held out a hand her daughterinlaw with the fiery hair and soft eyes was big with child you should sit down i will if you will without waiting for an answer shelby led anna to a chair the moment anna sat caine put a cup of coffee in her hands thank you she murmured and sipped for his sake she could smell it strong and hot feel it scald her tongue but she couldnt taste it anna listened to the ding of the electronic pages the quick slap of rubbersoled shoes on tiled floor hospitals they were as much her home as the fortress daniel had built for the two of them shed always felt comfortable in them confident in their antiseptic halls now she felt helpless caine paced it was his nature to do so to prowl to stalk how proud she and daniel had been of him when hed won his first case alan sat beside her quiet intense just as hed always been he was suffering she watched shelby slip a hand into his and was content her sons had chosen well our sons she thought trying to communicate with daniel caine with his quietly strongwilled diana alan with his freespirited shelby balance was needed in a relationship almost as much as love as much as passion shed found that her sons had found that and her daughter rena caine was across the room holding his sister how alike they look anna thought vaguely so slim so bold of all her children serena came closest to matching daniels temper and stubbornness now her daughter was a mother herself anna could feel alans quiet strength beside her theyre all grown when did it happen weve done so well daniel she closed her eyes for only a moment she could allow herself only a moment you wouldnt dare leave me to enjoy it all alone dad with one hand serena held on to her brother with the other she gripped her husband still in surgery caines voice was rough with cigarettes and fear as he turned to justin im glad you could come mom needs all of us momma serena went to kneel at her mothers feet as she always had when she needed comfort or conversation hes going to be fine hes stubborn and hes strong but anna saw the plea in her daughters eyes tell me hes going to be all right if you say so ill believe it of course hes going to be fine she glanced up at her daughters husband justin was a gambler like her daniel anna touched serenas cheek do you think hed miss a reunion like this serena let out a shaky laugh thats just what justin said she smiled seeing that justin already had an arm around his sisters shoulder diana serena rose to exchange an embrace hows laura shes wonderful she just got her second tooth and robert a terror serena thought of her son who already worshiped grandpa shelby how are you feeling fat she flashed a smile and managed to conceal the fact that shed been in labor for more than an hour i called my brother she turned to anna grant and gennie are coming i hope its all right of course anna patted her hand theyre family too dads going to be thrilled serena swallowed over the fear that had lodged in her throat all this attention and then theres the little announcement justin and i have to make she looked at him willing her courage to return justin and i are going to have another baby have to insure the line momma her voice broke as she knelt down again daniel will be so smug about it wont he yes she kissed both of serenas cheeks she thought of the grandchildren she had of those she would have family continuity immortality daniel always daniel hell consider it all his doing wasnt it alan murmured anna fought the tears back how well they knew their father yes yes it was there was more pacing murmuring handholding as the minutes dragged by anna set her halffinished cup of coffee aside cold and unwanted four hours and twenty minutes it was taking too long beside her shelby tensed and deliberately began to breathe deeply automatically anna placed a hand on the mound that was her grandchild how close just under five minutes now how long couple of hours she gave anna a look that was a little excited a little terrified a bit more than three actually i wish i couldve timed it better youve timed it perfectly do you want me to go with you no for a moment shelby nuzzled into annas neck ill be fine were all going to be fine alan she held out both hands wanting to be hauled to her feet im not going to have the baby at georgetown hospital he drew her up gently what im going to have it here very soon she laughed a bit when he narrowed his eyes dont try logic on a baby alan its ready the entire clan clustered around her offering help advice support in her calm efficient way anna summoned a nurse and a wheelchair with little fuss she had shelby settled ill be down to check on you were going to be fine shelby reached over her shoulder for alans hand all of us tell daniel its going to be a boy im going to see to it she watched as shelby and alan disappeared behind elevator doors just before dr feinstein walked into the hall sam anna exclaimed and was on him in seconds at the doorway of the waiting room justin held caine back give her a minute he murmured anna feinstein put his hands on her shoulders she wasnt just a colleague now or a surgeon he respected she was the wife of a patient hes a strong man she felt hope surge and willed herself to be calm strong enough he lost a lot of blood anna and hes not young anymore but weve stopped the hemorrhaging he hesitated then realized he respected her too much to evade we lost him once on the table in seconds he was fighting his way back if will to live counts anna hes got a hell of an edge she folded her arms around her chest cold why were the hallways so cold when can i see him theyll be bringing him up to icu his hands were cramping after hours of delicate work he kept them firm on her shoulders anna i dont have to tell you what the next twentyfour hours mean life or death no you dont thank you sam im going to talk to my children then ill come up she turned to walk back down the hall a small lovely woman with gray threading through her deep sable hair her face was finely lined her skin as soft as it had been in her youth shed raised three children worked her way to the top of her profession and had spent over half of her life loving one man hes out of surgery she said calmly calling on the control shed been born with theyre taking him to intensive care theyve controlled the bleeding when can we see him the question came from several of them at once when he wakes up her tone was firm she was in charge again and being in charge was what she did best im going to stay here tonight she glanced at her watch he may float in and out a bit and hell be better knowing im there but he wont be able to talk until tomorrow it was all the hope she could give them i want you to go down to maternity and check on shelby stay as long as you like then go back to the house and wait ill call as soon as anything changes mother she cut caine off with a look do as youre told i want you rested and well when your fathers ready to see you she lifted a hand to caines cheek for me she left her children and comfort to go to her husband he was dreaming even through the drugs daniel knew he was dreaming it was a soft world full of visions tapestried with memories still he fought it wanting needing to orient himself when he opened his eyes he saw anna he needed nothing else she was beautiful always beautiful the strong stubborn coolheaded woman hed first admired then loved then respected he tried to reach out but couldnt lift his hand infuriated at his weakness he tried again only to have annas voice float smoothly over him lie still darling im not going anywhere im staying right here and waiting he thought he felt her lips on the back of his hand i love you daniel macgregor damn you his lips curved his eyes closed chapter one contents prev next an empire at the time hed turned fifteen daniel macgregor had promised himself hed have one build one rule one he always kept his word he was thirty years old and working on his second million with the same drive that had earned him his first as he always had he used his back his brains and pure guile in whatever order worked best when hed come to america five years before daniel had had the money hed saved by working his way up from miner to head bookkeeper for hamus mcguire hed also brought a shrewd brain and towering ambition he could have passed for a king he topped six four with a build bold enough to suit his height his size alone had kept him out of a number of fights just as his size had seduced some men into challenging him either way was fine with daniel he was reputed to have a temper but he considered himself a mild sort of person daniel didnt think hed broken more than his share of noses in his day he didnt consider himself handsome either his jaw was long and square and running along its right edge was a scar that hed gotten when a loose beam had toppled down on him in the mines as a sop to his vanity hed grown a beard in his teens a dozen years later it remained deep red and well trimmed around his face blending with a mane of hair that was too long for fashion the combination made him look both fierce and royal which pleased him his cheekbones rose high and wide and his mouth appeared surprisingly soft in its cushion of wild red hair his eyes were a deep brilliant blue that lit with humor and goodwill when he smiled and meant it just as they cooled to frost when he smiled and didnt imposing that was one adjective used to describe him ruthless was another daniel didnt care how he was described as long as he didnt go unnoticed he was a gambler who played the odds boldly real estate was his wheel and the stock market was his game table when daniel gambled he played to win the chances hed taken had paid off and when they had hed taken more he never intended to play it too safe because with safety came boredom though hed been born poor daniel macgregor didnt worship money he used it wielded it played with it money equaled power and power was a weapon in america he found himself in a vast arena of wheeling and dealing there was new york with its fast pace and hungry streets a man with brains and nerve could build a fortune there there was los angeles with its glamour and high stakes a man with imagination could fashion an empire daniel had spent time in both dabbled in business on either coast but he chose boston as his base and as his home it wasnt simply money or power he sought but style boston with its oldworld charm its stubborn dignity and its unapologetic snobbishness suited daniel perfectly hed come from a long line of warriors who had lived as much by wit as by the sword his pride in his line was fierce as fierce as his ambition daniel intended to see his line continue with strong sons and daughters as a man of vision he had no trouble seeing his grandchildren taking what hed molded and building on it there could be no empire without family to share it to begin one he needed the proper wife acquiring one to daniel was as challenging and as logical as acquiring a prime piece of real estate hed come to the donahues summer ball to speculate on both he hated the tight collar and strangulating tie when a man was built like a bull he liked his neck free his clothes were made in boston by a tailor on newbury street daniel used him as much because his size demanded it as for the prestige ambition had put him in a suit but he didnt have to like it another man dressed in the elegant black dinner suit and pleated silk shirt would have looked distinguished daniel in either tartan or dress blacks looked flamboyant he preferred it that way cathleen donahue maxwell donahues eldest daughter preferred it as well mr macgregor fresh out of finishing school in switzerland cathleen knew how to serve tea embroider silk and flirt elegantly i hope youre enjoying our little party she had a face like porcelain and hair like flax daniel thought it a pity her shoulders were so thin but he too knew how to flirt im enjoying it more now miss donahue knowing most men were put off by giggles cathleen kept her laugh low and smooth her taffeta skirts whispered as she positioned herself beside him at the end of the long buffet table now whoever stopped for a taste of truffles or salmon mousse would see them together if she turned her head just a fraction she could catch a glimpse of their reflection in one of the long narrow mirrors that lined the wall she decided she liked what she saw my father tells me youre interested in buying a little piece of cliff he owns in hyannis port she fluttered her lashes twice i hope you didnt come here tonight to discuss business daniel slipped two glasses from the tray of a passing waiter hed have preferred scotch in a sturdy glass to champagne in crystal but a man who didnt adjust in certain areas broke in others as he drank he studied cathleens face he knew maxwell donahue would no more have discussed business with his daughter than he would have discussed fashion with her but daniel didnt fault her for lying rather he gave her credit for knowing how to dig out information but while he admired her for it it was precisely the reason he didnt consider her proper wife material his wife would be too busy raising babies to worry about business business comes second to a lovely woman have you been to the cliffs of course she tilted her head so that the diamond flowers in her ears caught the light i do prefer the city are you attending the ditmeyers dinner party next week if im in town so much traveling cathleen smiled before she sipped her champagne shed be very comfortable with a husband who traveled it must be exciting its business he said then he added but youve just returned from paris yourself flattered that hed been aware of her absence cathleen almost beamed three weeks wasnt enough shopping alone took nearly every moment i had you cant imagine how many tedious hours i spent in fittings for this gown he swept his gaze down and up as shed expected i can only say it was well worth it why thank you as she stood posing his mind began to drift he knew women were supposed to be interested mainly in dresses and hairstyles but hed have preferred a more stimulating conversation sensing she was losing his attention cathleen touched his arm youve been to paris mr macgregor hed been to paris and had seen what war could do to beauty the pretty blonde smiling up at him would never be touched by war why should she be still vaguely dissatisfied daniel sipped the dry bubbling wine some years ago he glanced around at the glitter of jewels the sparkle of crystal there was a scent in the air that could only be described as wealth in five years hed become accustomed to it but he hadnt forgotten the smell of coal dust he never intended to forget it ive come to prefer america to europe your father knows how to throw a party im glad you approve youre enjoying the music he still missed the wail of bagpipes the twelvepiece orchestra in white tie was a bit stiff for his taste but he smiled very much i thought perhaps you werent she sent him a slow melting look from under her lashes you arent dancing in a courtly gesture daniel took the champagne from cathleen and set both their glasses down oh but i am miss donahue he corrected and swept her onto the dance floor cathleen donahue continues to be obvious myra lornbridge nibbled pate and sniffed keep your claws sheathed myra the voice was low and smooth by nature rather than design i dont mind when a persons rude or calculating or even a bit stupid with a sigh myra finished off the cracker but i do detest it when one is obvious myra all right all right myra poked at the salmon mousse by the way anna i love your dress anna glanced down at the rosecolored silk you picked it out i told you i loved it myra gave a selfsatisfied smile at the way the folds draped over annas hips very chic if youd pay half the attention to your wardrobe as you do your books youd put cathleen donahues nose out of joint anna only smiled and watched the dancers im not interested in cathleens nose well it isnt very interesting how about the man shes dancing with the redhaired giant so you noticed im not blind she wondered how soon she could make a dignified exit she really wanted to go home and read the medical journal dr hewitt had sent her know who he is who anna patience was a virtue myra extended only to her closest friends fe fi fo fum with a laugh anna sipped her wine all right who is he daniel duncan macgregor myra paused a bit hoping to pique annas interest at twentyfour myra was rich and attractive beautiful no even at her best myra knew shed never be beautiful she understood beauty was one route to power brains were another myra used her brains hes bostons current boy wonder if youd pay more attention to whos who in our cozy little society youd recognize the name society with its games and restrictions didnt interest anna in the least why should i youll tell me serve you right if i didnt but anna only smiled and drank again all right ill tell you gossip was one temptation myra found impossible to resist hes a scot which is obvious i suppose from his looks and his name you should hear him talk its like cutting through fog at that moment daniel let out a big booming laugh that raised annas eyebrows that sounds as though it would cut through anything hes a bit rough around the edges but some people she cast a meaningful look at cathleen donahue believe that a million dollars or so smoothes out anything realizing that the man was being weighed and judged by the size of his bank balance anna felt a twinge of sympathy i hope he knows hes dancing with a viper anna murmured he doesnt look stupid he bought old line savings and loan six months ago really she shrugged business only interested anna when it involved a hospital budget sensing the movement to her left she turned to smile at herbert ditmeyer standing with an unfamiliar gentleman how are you glad to see you he was only a few inches taller than anna and had the lean ascetic face of a scholar with dark hair that promised to thin in a matter of years but there was a strength around his mouth that anna respected and he had a sense of humor it took a sharp wit to understand youre looking lovely he gestured to the man beside him my cousin mark anna whitfield and myra lornbridge herberts gaze lingered just a moment longer on myra but as the orchestra began a new waltz he lost his nerve and took annas arm you should be dancing anna matched her steps to his naturally she loved to dance but preferred to do so with someone she knew herbert was comfortable i heard congratulations are in order she smiled up into his dependable face mr district attorney he grinned he was young for the position but had no intention of stopping there if he hadnt considered it bad form he might have told anna of his ambitions i wasnt sure boston news traveled as far as connecticut he glanced to where myra was dancing with his cousin i suppose i should have known better anna laughed as they twirled around another couple just because ive been out of town doesnt mean i dont want to keep up with whats happening here in boston you must be very proud its a beginning herbert said lightly and you one more year and well have to call you dr whitfield one more year anna murmured sometimes it seems like forever impatient anna thats not like you yes it was but shed always managed to conceal it so successfully i want it to be official its no secret that my parents disapprove they might disapprove herbert added but your mother doesnt have any trouble mentioning youre in the top ten percent of your class for the third year running really surprised anna thought it over her mother had always been more apt to praise her hairstyle than her grades ill have to be grateful for that then though she still harbors the hope that some man will come along and make me forget about operating rooms and bedpans as she spoke herbert turned her anna found herself looking directly into daniel macgregors eyes she felt her stomach muscles tighten nerves ridiculous she felt the quick chill that raced down her spine and up again fear absurd though he still danced with cathleen he stared at anna stared at her in a way that was designed to make a young womans cheeks flush anna stared back coolly while her heart raced perhaps it was a mistake he seemed to take it as a challenge and smiled very slowly with a detached admiration she watched him maneuver catching the eye of another man on the edge of the dance floor daniel gave a quick almost imperceptible signal within moments cathleen found herself dancing in the arms of another man anna braced herself for the next step with the ease of experience daniel weaved through the dancers hed noticed anna the moment shed begun to dance noticed then watched then calculated as soon as shed glanced over and had given him that coolly appraising stare hed been hooked she didnt have the stature of cathleen but seemed small and delicate her hair was dark and looked as warm and soft as sable her eyes matched it the rose hue of her dress set off her creamy skin and smooth shoulders she looked like a woman who would fit easily into a mans arms with the confidence he carried everywhere daniel tapped herberts shoulder may i cut in daniel waited only until herbert had relinquished his hold before he clasped anna and swirled her back into the dance that was very clever mr macgregor it pleased him that she knew his name it pleased him as well that hed been right about the way shed fit into his arms she smelled like moonbeams soft and quiet thank you miss whitfield anna whitfield it was also very rude he stared a moment because the stem voice didnt fit the quietly lovely face always one to appreciate a surprise daniel laughed until heads turned aye but i go with what works i dont believe ive seen you before miss anna whitfield but i know your parents thats very possible the hand holding hers was huge hard as rock and incredibly gentle her palm began to itch are you new to boston mr macgregor ill have to say yes because ive lived here only two years not two generations she tilted her head a bit farther so that she could keep her eyes on his you have to go back at least three not to be new or you have to be clever he twirled her in three quick circles pleasantly surprised that for his size he was light on his feet anna relaxed just a little it would be a shame to waste the music ive been told you are youll be told so again he didnt bother to keep his voice low though the dance floor was crowded power not propriety was his forte will i anna cocked a brow how odd only if you dont understand the system he corrected her unsinged if you cant have the generations behind you you need money in front though she knew it was true anna disliked both forms of snobbery how fortunate for you society has such flexible standards her dry disinterested voice made him smile she wasnt a fool this anna whitfield nor was she a silkcoated barracuda like cathleen donahue youve a face like the cameo my grandmother wore around her neck anna lifted a brow and nearly smiled at him the look made him realize hed said no more than the truth thank you mr macgregor but youd be better off saving your flattery for cathleen shes more susceptible a frown clouded his eyes and he looked fierce and formidable but it cleared quickly before anna could gauge her reaction youve a cool tongue in your head lassie i admire a woman who speaks her mind to a point feeling aggressive for no reason she could name anna kept her gaze directly on his what point is that mr macgregor to the point where it becomes unfeminine before shed anticipated his move daniel swung her through the terrace doors until that moment she hadnt realized just how hot and stuffy the ballroom had become regardless of that annas normal reaction with a man she didnt know would have been to excuse herself firmly and finally and walk back inside instead she found herself stopping just where she was with daniels arms still around her the moonlight pouring over the flagstones and warm roses scenting the air im sure you have your own definition of femininity mr macgregor but i wonder if you keep it in tune with the fact that were in the twentieth century he enjoyed the way she stood in his arms and subtly insulted him ive always considered femininity a constant thing miss whitfield not something that changes with years or fashion i see his arms seemed to fit around her a bit too easily she drew herself away to stroll to the edge of the terrace nearest the gardens the air was sweeter there the moonlight dimmer the music became more romantic with distance it occurred to her that she was having a private conversation one that might have been approaching an argument with a man shed only just met yet she didnt feel any urge to cut it short shed taught herself to be comfortable around men shed had to as the only woman in her graduating class anna had learned how to deal with men on their own level and how to do so without constantly rubbing against their egos shed gotten through the first year of criticism and innuendos by staying calm and concentrating on her studies now she was about to enter her last year of medical school and for the most part anna was accepted by her colleagues she was perfectly aware however of what she would face when she began her internship the stigma of being labeled unfeminine still stung a bit but she was long resigned to it im sure your views on femininity are fascinating mr macgregor the hem of her dress skimmed the flagstone as she turned but i dont think its something i care to discuss tell me what is it exactly that you do in boston he hadnt heard her he hadnt heard anything from the moment shed turned back to face him her hair swung softly just at her white smooth shoulders in the thin rosecolored silk her body looked as delicate as fine china the moonlight filtered over her face so that her skin was like marble and her eyes as dark as midnight a man hears nothing but the thunder when hes struck by lightning mr macgregor for the first time since theyd stepped outside annas nerves began to hum he was huge a stranger and he was looking at her as though hed lost his senses she straightened her shoulders and reminded herself she could handle any situation that came along mr macgregor aye daniel pulled himself out of his fantasy and stepped closer oddly anna relaxed he didnt seem as dangerous when he stood beside her and his eyes were beautiful true there was a very simple genetic reason for their shade she could have written a paper on it but they were beautiful you do work in boston dont you i do perhaps it had been a trick of the light that had made her look so perfect so ethereal and seductive i buy he took her hand because personal contact was vital to him he took it because part of him wanted to be assured she was real i sell his hand was warm and as gentle as it had been when theyd danced anna drew hers away how interesting what do you buy whatever i want smiling he stepped a bit closer whatever her pulse accelerated her skin heated anna knew there were emotional as well as physical causes for such things though she couldnt think of them at the moment she didnt back away im sure thats very satisfying that leads me to believe you sell whatever you no longer want in a nutshell miss whitfield and at a profit conceited ox she thought mildly and tilted her head some might consider that arrogance mr macgregor she made him laugh with the cool calm way she spoke the cool calm way she looked even when he could see traces of passion in her eyes she was a woman he thought who could make a man wait on the doorstep with bouquets and heartshaped boxes of candy when a poor mans arrogant its crude miss whitfield when a man of means is arrogant its called style ive been both she felt there was some truth in his words but wasnt willing to give an inch strange ive never felt arrogance changes with years or with fashion he took out a cigar as he watched her your point his lighter flared highlighting his eyes for one brief instant in that moment anna realized he was dangerous after all then perhaps we should call it a draw pride prevented her from stepping back dignity prevented her from continuing what was despite logic becoming interesting now if youll excuse me mr macgregor i really must get back inside he took her arm in a way that was both abrupt and proprietary anna didnt jerk away and she didnt freeze she merely looked at him as a duchess might look at a dustcovered commoner faced with that serene disapproval most men would have dropped their hand and mumbled apologies daniel grinned at her now heres a lass he thought whod make a mans knees tremble ill see you again miss anna whitfield perhaps ill see you again he lifted her hand to his lips she felt the soft surprising brush of his beard across her knuckles and for a moment the trace of passion hed seen in her eyes flared full blown and again i doubt well have much occasion to socialize as ill only be in boston for a couple of months now if youll excuse me why he didnt release her hand which troubled her more than she could permit to show why what mr macgregor why will you only be in boston for a couple of months if she were running off to get married it might change things daniel looked at her again and decided he wouldnt allow it to change anything i go back to connecticut at the end of august for my last year in medical school medical school his brows drew together youre not going to be a nurse his voice carried the vague puzzlement of a man who had no understanding of and little tolerance for professional women no she waited until she felt him relax a surgeon thank you for the dance but he had her arm again before she could reach the door youre going to cut people open for the second time she heard his laughter boom out youre joking though she bristled she managed to make it appear she was simply bored i promise you im much more amusing when i joke good night mr macgregor being a doctors a mans job i appreciate your opinion i happen to believe there is no such thing as a mans job if a woman is capable of doing it he snorted puffed on his cigar and muttered pack of nonsense succinctly put mr macgregor and again rude you are consistent she walked through the terrace doors without looking back but she did think of him brash crude flamboyant and foolish he thought of her as he watched her slip into the crowd cool opinionated blunt and ridiculous they were both fascinated chapter two contents prev next tell me everything anna set her purse on the white linen cloth and smiled at the hovering waiter ill have a champagne cocktail two myra decided then leaned forward well taking her time anna glanced around the quiet pastel restaurant there were half a dozen people she knew by name several others she knew by sight she found it cozy safe and serene there were times in the rush and fury of classes and studies when she longed for moments like this there would be a way somehow someday to have both in her life you know the one thing i miss about living in connecticut is having lunch here im glad you suggested it anna myra saw no reason to waste time on polite chatter when there was news ready to break tell me tell you what anna countered and enjoyed the flash of frustration in her friends eyes myra took a cigarette out of a thin gold case tapped it twice then lit it tell me what happened between you and daniel macgregor we had a waltz anna picked up her menu and began to scan it but she caught herself tapping her foot as the music crept back into her head and she shifted her gaze over the top of the menu and anna myra cut herself off as their drinks were served impatient she pushed her cocktail aside you were out on the terrace with him alone for quite some time really anna sipped her champagne decided on a salad and closed the menu yes really with calculated flamboyance myra blew smoke at the ceiling apparently you must have found something to talk about i believe we did the waiter returned so anna ordered her salad seething in frustration myra ordered lobster newburg and told herself shed fast through dinner well what did you talk about i seem to remember one of the topics was femininity anna took another casual sip but wasnt quite able to conceal the anger that leaped into her eyes seeing it myra put out her cigarette and perked up i assume that mr macgregor has some definite opinions on the subject anna sipped again savoring the taste of the champagne before she set her glass down mr macgregor is an opinionated boor thoroughly pleased myra cupped her chin in her hand the little veil attached to her hat fell just below her eyes but didnt conceal their enthusiasm i was nearly certain about the opinionated but i would have bet heavily against the boor tell me he admires a woman who speaks her mind anna continued firing up to a point to a point she repeated with a quick unladylike snort that point stops wherever it conflicts with his outlook a little disappointed myra shrugged he sounds like any other man its men like him who see women as subsidiary to their manhood sitting back anna began to tap her fingers in a slow steady rhythm on the white cloth were fine as long as were baking cookies diapering babies and warming the sheets after choking on a sip of champagne myra swallowed my goodness he did get under your skin in a very short time deliberately anna drew herself back she detested losing her temper and reserved the privilege for something of real importance she reminded herself that daniel macgregor didnt fit the bill hes rude and arrogant she said more calmly myra gave it a moments thought that may be she agreed but its not necessarily a mark against him id rather be around an arrogant man than a stuffy one stuffy hes not didnt you see that maneuver he pulled on cathleen her eyes lit up no he signaled to some man to cut in while they were dancing so he could cut in on herbert and dance with me how clever myra beamed approval then laughed at annas expression come on darling you have to admit it was and cathleens much too involved with her own charms to have noticed myra gave a sigh of pleasure as her lobster was served you know anna you should be flattered flattered she stabbed at her salad i dont see why i should be flattered that some enormous selfimportant dolt of a man preferred to dance with me myra paused to appreciate the scent of the lobster hes certainly enormous and he may be a dolt but he is important and in a rough sort of way hes attractive obviously from the way youve brushed others off you arent interested in the smooth sophisticated type i have my career to think of myra i dont have time for men darling theres always time for men with a laugh she took another forkful of lobster i dont mean that you have to take him seriously im glad to hear that but i dont see why you should just toss him back i have no intention of reeling him in youre being stubborn anna laughed one of the reasons she was so fond of myra was that her friend saw things clearly her way im being myself anna i know what becoming a doctor means to you and you know how much i admire what youre doing but she continued before anna could comment youre going to be in boston for the summer anyway whats the harm in having an attractive escort whos obviously going places i dont need an escort needing and having are two different things myra broke off the corner of a roll and swore to herself shed only eat half of it tell me anna are your parents still pressuring you about your decision to go into medicine are they still lining up eligible men to change your mind theyve already lined up three potential candidates for my hand this summer she had to convince herself to be amused and nearly managed it at the top of the list is the grandson of my mothers doctor she thinks his connection to medicine might influence me is he attractive myra waved away the question at annas scowl never mind then my point is that your parents are going to continue to toss all of these men your way hoping something sticks but she added a bit of butter to her roll if you were seeing someone as in daniel macgregor why not he certainly seemed interested last night anna took the roll myra had buttered and bit into it because its dishonest im not interested it might keep your mother from inviting every single man between twentyfive and forty over to your house for tea anna let out a long breath myra had a point there if just once her parents would understand what it was she needed what she was striving for for your own good how many times had she heard that particular phrase if she ever married and if she ever had children those four words would never come out of her mouth anna was well aware her parents had stopped arguing about her going to medical school only because theyd been certain shed be out again before the end of the first semester if it hadnt been for aunt elsie anna was aware shed probably never have managed medical school at all elsie whitfield had been her fathers eccentric older sister a spinster who had made her money some said bootlegging whiskey during prohibition anna could hardly fault her however the money had been earned since aunt elsie had left her a legacy large enough for tuition and independence with no strings attached dont marry a man unless youre damn sure of him anna remembered elsie advising if youve got a dream go after it lifes too short for cowards use the money anna and make something out of yourself for yourself now she was only months away from the dream graduation her internship it wasnt going to be easy for her parents to accept it would be harder still when they learned she intended to begin her internship at boston general and that she didnt intend to live at home while she was doing it myra ive been thinking about getting my own place with the fork halfway to her mouth myra stopped have you told your parents no anna pushed away her salad and wondered why life was so complicated when so many things seemed clear to her i dont want to upset them but its time im a grown woman but theyre never going to see me as one while im living in their home also if i dont make the break now theyre going to expect me to go on living with them after i graduate myra sat back and finished what was left of her champagne i think youre right i also think youd be wise to tell them after its a fait accompli so do i how would you like to spend the afternoon apartment hunting id love it right after some chocolate mousse she signaled the waiter still anna that doesnt solve the problem with daniel macgregor there isnt any problem oh i think you can depend on one chocolate mousse she told the waiter dont spare the whipped cream in his newly decorated office daniel sat behind an enormous oak desk and lit a cigar hed just completed a deal in which hed bought the lions share of a company that would manufacture televisions daniel calculated that what was now a novelty would become a staple in the american home in a matter of years besides he enjoyed watching the little box himself it gave him a great deal of satisfaction to buy something that entertained him still his biggest project at the moment was revamping the teetering old line savings and loan to make it the biggest lending institution in boston hed already started by extending two major loans and refinancing several others he believed in putting money into circulation where it could grow the bank manager was horrified but daniel figured the man would bend or find other employment in the meantime daniel had some research to do anna whitfield he knew her family background because her father was one of the top attorneys in the state daniel had nearly retained him before hed decided to go with the younger more flexible herbert ditmeyer now that herbert had been elected district attorney he might have to do some rethinking there maybe anna whitfields father was the answer hed just about decided that anna was her family home on beacon hill had been built in the eighteenth century her ancestors had been patriots whod started a new life in the new world and had prospered the whitfields were and had been for generations a solid part of boston society daniel respected nothing more than a strong lineage prince or pauper didnt matter just strength and endurance anna whitfield came from good stock that was daniels prime prerequisite for a proper wife she had a head on her shoulders it hadnt taken him long to learn that though she was studying something as odd as medicine she was at the top of her class he didnt intend to pass along soft brains to his children she was lovely a man looking for a wife and a mother for his children had to appreciate beauty especially that soft creamy sort she also wasnt a pushover daniel didnt want a simpering blindly obedient wife though he did expect a woman to respect the fact that he called the shots there were a dozen women he could woo and win but none of them had presented him with that little bit extra a challenge after one meeting with anna daniel was certain she would give him that being pursued by a woman flattered the ego but a challenge a challenge fired the blood there was enough warrior in him to look forward to the fight if he knew one thing it was how to lay the groundwork for a takeover first he found out his opponents strengths and weaknesses then he played on both picking up the phone daniel kicked back in his chair and began a few hours later daniel was struggling with the knot in his black silk tie the only problem with being wealthy as far as he could see was having to dress the part there was no question that he presented an imposing figure in dress black but he never stopped straining against the restrictions still if a man was out to sweep a woman off her feet he was ahead of the game if he did it in his sunday best according to his information anna whitfield would be spending the evening at the ballet with friends daniel figured he had his accountant to thank for talking him into renting a box at the theater he might not have put it to much use thus far but tonight would make up for all that he was whistling as he walked down the stairs to the first floor most people would have considered his twentyroom house a bit overindulgent for one man but to daniel the house with its tall windows and gleaming floors was a statement as long as he had it hed never have to go back to the threeroom cottage hed grown up in the house said what daniel needed it to say that the man who owned it had success had presence had style without those things daniel duncan macgregor was back in the mines with coal dust ground into his skin and reddening his eyes at the foot of the stairs daniel paused to bellow mcgee he got a foolish surge of pleasure at the way his voice bounced off the walls sir mcgee walked down the long hall erect and unbending hed served other gentlemen in his time but never one as unconventional or as generous as macgregor besides it pleased him to work for a fellow scot ill need the car brought around its waiting for you outside the champagne chilled of course sir the flowers white roses sir two dozen as you requested good good daniel was halfway to the door before he stopped and turned around help yourself to the scotch mcgee youve got the evening off with no change of expression mcgee inclined his head thank you sir whistling again daniel went outside to the waiting car hed bought the silver rolls on a whim but had had no cause to regret it hed given the gardener the extra job of chauffeur and had pleased them both by outfitting him in a pearlgray uniform and cap stevens grammar might be faulty but once he was behind the wheel he was the soul of dignity evening mr macgregor steven opened the door then polished the handle with a soft cloth after hed closed it again daniel might have bought the rolls but steven considered it his baby after settling himself in the quiet luxury of the back seat daniel opened the briefcase that was waiting for him if it took fifteen minutes to drive to the theater it meant he had fifteen minutes to work idle time was for his old age if things went according to plan hed have that piece of property in hyannis port by the following week the cliffs the tough gray rock the tall green grass reminded him of scotland hed make his home there a home he already imagined in his minds eye thered be nothing to compare with it once he had it hed fill it with a wife and children so he thought of anna the white roses were spread on the seat beside him the champagne was cased in ice he only had to sit through the ballet before he began his courting he picked up a rose and sniffed the scent was quiet and sweet white roses were her favorite it hadnt taken him long to find that out it would take a hard woman to resist two dozen of them a hard woman to resist the luxury hed offer her daniel dropped the rose back with the others hed made up his mind it would only be a short time before he made up hers as well satisfied he sat back and closed the briefcase as steven pulled up in front of the theater two hours he told his driver then on impulse picked up one of the roses again it wouldnt hurt to start his campaign a bit early the scene in the lobby of the theater was one of glitter and silk long sweeping dresses in pastels contrasted with dark evening suits there was a glow of pearls a sparkle of diamonds and everywhere the feminine scent of perfume daniel wandered through the crowd not so much aloof as preoccupied his size and presence coupled with his casual manner had fascinated more than one woman daniel took this with a smile and a grain of salt a woman who was easily fascinated would be easily bored wide mood swings werent what a wise man looked for in a mate especially when the man was prone to them himself as he strolled through the crowd he was distracted now and again and stopped with a friendly word or greeting he liked people so it was an easy matter for him to socialize whether in the lobby of the theater or in the pits at one of his construction sites since he was first and last a businessman he was comfortable talking about one thing while thinking of something entirely different he didnt consider it dishonest merely practical so while he stopped here paused there he kept a sharp lookout for anna when he saw her he was struck just as hard and just as fast as hed been at the summer ball she wore blue pale pale blue that made her skin glow as white as new milk her hair was swept up and back with combs so that her face was unframed and more like his grandmothers cameo than ever he felt a pang of desire then something deeper and stronger than hed expected still he waited patiently until she turned her head and their eyes met she didnt as another woman might have blush or flirt but simply met his stare with a calm appraising look daniel felt the excitement and challenge of the game as he moved to her in a move that was too smooth to be considered rude he homed in on her and ignored the group around them miss whitfield for the waltz when he offered her the rose anna hesitated then saw there was no polite way to refuse even as she took the rose its scent drifted to her mr macgregor i dont believe youve met my friend myra myra lornbridge daniel macgregor how do you do myra offered her hand carefully sizing him up he looked her directly in the eye his own eyes cool and cautious myra discovered that though she wasnt certain she liked him she respected him ive heard a great deal about you ive had some business with your brother she was smaller than anna though rounder one look told daniel shed be formidable but interesting thats not who i heard it from jasper never gossips im afraid daniel sent her a quick grin which is why i like doing business with him you enjoy the ballet miss whitfield yes very much she sniffed the rose involuntarily then annoyed with herself lowered her hands im afraid i havent seen many and dont seem to get the full impact he added a rueful smile to the charm of the rose im told it helps if you know the story or watch with someone who truly appreciates ballet im sure thats true i wonder if i could ask you a great favor warning signals flashed and made her narrow her eyes you can ask of course ive a box if youd sit with me maybe you could show me how to enjoy the dancing anna only smiled she wasnt so easily taken in under different circumstances id be glad to help you out but im here with friends so dont mind us myra cut in whatever devil prompted her to interfere urged her further its a shame for mr macgregor to sit through giselle without really appreciating it dont you think eyes wicked she smiled at anna you two run right along im grateful daniel looked at myra and his eyes which had been cool warmed with humor very grateful miss whitfield daniel offered his arm for one quick satisfying instant anna considered tossing his rose on the floor and grinding it underfoot before stomping away then she smiled and tucked her arm through his there were better ways of winning a match than tantrums daniel led her away tossing a wink at myra without breaking stride myra caught it and annas scowl with the same aplomb isnt it odd to hold a box at the ballet without being able to appreciate it its business daniel told her briefly as they walked up the stairs but tonight im sure ill get more than my moneys worth oh you can count on it anna swept through the doors and took her seat carefully she set the rose across her lap and allowed daniel to remove the ivory lace wrap shed tossed on as an afterthought beneath it her shoulders were bare both of them became aware of how stunning the lightest touch of flesh against flesh could be anna folded her hands and decided to pay him back by giving him exactly what hed asked for now to give you the background in the tone of a kindergarten teacher reciting little red riding hood anna told him the story of giselle without giving him a chance to comment throughout the lecture she went on with everything she knew about ballet in general enough she thought to put a strong man to sleep ah heres the curtain now pay attention satisfied with her tactics anna settled back and prepared to enjoy herself she couldnt concentrate within the first ten minutes her mind wandered a dozen times daniel sat quietly beside her but he wasnt cowed of that she was certain she thought that if she turned her head only a few inches shed see him grinning at her she looked straight ahead shed deal with myra she thought grimly for boxing her in with a redbearded barbarian and she wouldnt look at him she wouldnt she promised herself even think about him instead shed absorb the music the color the dancing of a ballet she loved it was romantic exciting poignant if she could only relax shed forget he was there deliberately she took five deep breaths then he touched her hand making her pulse jolt its all about love and luck isnt it daniel murmured she realized that barbarian or not he understood and from the quiet tone of his voice that he appreciated unable to resist she turned her head their faces were close the lights were dim the music swelled and crested over them a little piece of her heart weakened and was lost to him most things are he smiled and in the shadowed light seemed incredibly virile incredibly gentle a wise thing to remember anna before she could think to resist he linked his fingers with hers hands joined they watched the dance together he kept close during intermission catering to her before she could prevent him somehow he maneuvered her until it was too late to make excuses and rejoin her friends for the last half as she took her seat after the intermission anna told herself she was simply being polite by remaining in his box until the final curtain it wasnt a matter of wanting to be there or of enjoying herself but of good manners she managed to sit primly for five minutes before she was again caught up in the romance of the story she felt the tears come as giselle faced tragedy though she kept her face turned and blinked furiously daniel gauged her mood without a word he passed her his handkerchief she took it with a little sigh of acceptance its so sad she murmured it doesnt matter how many times i see it some beautiful things are meant to be sad so we can appreciate the beautiful things that arent surprised she turned to him again with tears still clinging to her lashes he didnt sound like a barbarian when he spoke that way somehow she wished he had disturbed anna turned back for the final dance when the applause died and the lights came up she was composed inside her emotions were still churning but she blamed that on the story without a sign that shed been moved she accepted daniels hand as he drew her to her feet i can honestly say ive never enjoyed a ballet more in the courtly manner he could draw out without warning he brushed his lips over her knuckles thank you anna cautious she cleared her throat you are welcome if youll excuse me i have to get back to the others he kept her hand in his as they walked from the box i took the liberty of telling your friend myra that id see you home you its the least i can do he interrupted smoothly after you were nice enough to educate me it made me wonder why you hadnt thought of going into teaching her voice cooled as they walked down the stairs to the lobby he was laughing at her but shed been laughed at before it isnt wise to take on responsibility for someone else without asking first i might have had plans im at your disposal she didnt lose her patience often but she was close mr macgregor daniel anna opened her mouth then closed it again until she was certain she could be calm i appreciate the offer but i can see myself home now anna youve already accused me of being rude once he spoke cheerfully as he maneuvered her to his car what kind of man would i be if i didnt at least drive you home i think we both know the kind of man you are true he stopped just outside the door where a few people still loitered of course if youre afraid ill get you a cab afraid the light came into her eyes passion fire temper it didnt matter daniel was learning to love it you flatter yourself constantly with a gesture he indicated the door steven was holding open too angry to think anna stepped inside and was struck by the warm sultry scent of roses gritting her teeth she swept them into her arms so that she could sit as close as possible to the far door it only took an instant for her to realize daniel was too overwhelming to make the distance viable do you always keep roses in your car only when im escorting a beautiful woman she wished she had the heart to toss them out the window you planned this carefully didnt you daniel drew the cork out of the chilled champagne no use planning if youre not careful myra tells me i should be flattered my impression of myra is that shes a smart woman where would you like to go home she accepted the wine and sipped to steady her nerves i have to get up early in the morning im working at the hospital working he turned to frown at her as he settled the bottle back in its bed of ice didnt you say you had another year before youd finished your training another year before i have my degree and start my internship right now my training also includes emptying bedpans thats nothing a young woman like you should be doing daniel tossed back the first glass of champagne and poured another i assure you ill take your opinion for what its worth you cant tell me you enjoy it i can tell you i enjoy knowing ive done something to help someone else she drank again and held out her glass that may be difficult for you to understand since it is not business its humanity he could have corrected her then he could have pointed out that hed donated enormous funds toward setting up medical services for the miners in his region of scotland it wasnt something his accountant had advised but something hed had to do instead daniel focused on the one thing designed to make her furious you should be thinking about marriage and a family because a woman isnt able to handle anything more than a toddler tugging on her apron while anothers growing under it his brow lifted he supposed he should be used to the blunt way american women phrased things because a womans meant to make a home and a family a man has it easy anna he only has to go out and make money a woman holds the world in her hands the way he said it made it difficult for her to spit back at him struggling for calm she sat back did it ever occur to you that a man doesnt have to make a choice between having a family or having a career no she nearly laughed as she turned to look at him of course it didnt why should it take my advice daniel look for a woman who doesnt have any doubts about what she was meant to do find one who doesnt have windmills to battle i cant do that she had a half smile on her face but it faded quickly what she saw in his eyes sent both panic and excitement rushing through her oh no she said it quickly and drained her glass thats ridiculous maybe he cupped her face in his hand and watched her eyes widen maybe not but either way ive picked you anna whitfield and i mean to have you you dont pick a woman the way you pick a tie she tried to summon up both dignity and indignation but her heart was beating much too fast no you dont he found the sudden breathlessness in her voice arousing and skimmed a thumb along her jaw to feel the warmth and a man doesnt treasure a piece of cloth the way hell treasure a woman i think youve lost your mind she put her hand to his wrist but his hand didnt budge you dont even know me im going to know you better i dont have time for this she looked around frantic and saw they were still several blocks from her home he was a madman she decided what was she doing in the back of a rolls with a madman her unexpected jolt of panic pleased him for what he murmured and stroked a thumb down her cheek for any of this perhaps she should humor him no she had to be firm flowers champagne moonlight its obvious youre trying to be romantic and i should be quiet for just a minute he told her and decided the point by closing his mouth over hers anna gripped the roses in her lap until a thorn pierced her skin she never noticed how could she have guessed his mouth would be so soft or so quietly clever a man of his size should have been awkward or overbearing when he wrapped his arms around a woman daniel gathered her to him as if hed done so countless times his beard brushed her face and sensitized her skin while she struggled to remain unmoved her fingers itched to comb through his beard and she reached for him before common sense could prevent it something hot and fierce leaped inside her passion shed kept firmly controlled strictly in bounds strained free to make a mockery out of everything she had once believed of herself if he were mad then so was she with a moan that was part protest part confusion she gripped his shoulders and hung on hed expected a fight indignation at the least hed thought she might pull herself away and level one of those cool looks to put him in his place instead she pressed against him and made his impulsive demand flare like a torch in high wind he hadnt known she could peel away his control with such delicate fingers and leave him stripped and vulnerable he hadnt known she would make him want with such gutwrenching desire she was just a woman one hed chosen to complete his plans for success and power she wasnt supposed to make him forget everything but the feel and taste of her he knew what it was to want a woman wealth power now with anna pressed to him with the scent of roses filling his head and the taste of her filling his soul she was all those things in one to want her was to want everything she was breathless when they drew apart breathless aroused and frightened to combat her weakness anna fell back on dignity your manners continue to be crude daniel he could still see the dregs of passion in her eyes still feel it vibrating from her or himself youll have to accept me as i am anna i dont have to accept you at all dignity she told herself at all costs she needed to preserve some semblance of dignity a kiss in the back seat of a car means nothing more than the time it takes to accomplish it it wasnt until that moment that she realized they were parked in front of her house how long she wondered if color surged into her cheeks she told herself it was anger she fumbled with the door handle before the driver could come around and open it for her take the roses anna they suit you she only looked over her shoulder and glared goodbye daniel good night he corrected and watched her run up the walk with the pale blue dress swirling around her legs the roses lay on the seat beside him picking one up he tapped it against his lips the bloom wasnt as soft as she was or as sweet he let it fall again shed left them behind but hed just send them to her in the morning perhaps with another dozen added hed only begun his hand wasnt quite steady when he picked up the bottle of champagne daniel filled his glass to the rim and downed it in one long swallow chapter three contents prev next he next morning anna was at work at the hospital the time she spent there brought her part pleasure part frustration shed never been able to explain to anyone neither her parents nor her friends the excitement she felt when she walked into a hospital there was no one who would understand the satisfaction she gained from knowing she was part of it the learning and the healing most people thought of hospitals with dread to them the white walls glaring lights and smell of antiseptics meant sickness even death to anna they meant life and hope the hours she spent there each week only made her more determined to be a part of the medical community just as the hours she spent each week poring over medical books and journals made her more determined to learn everything there was to learn she had a dream that shed never been able to share with anyone to anna it was both simple and pretentious she wanted to make a difference to accomplish her dream she had to devote years of her life to learning working as a layman sorting linen dispensing magazines she still learned anna watched interns drag themselves through rounds after snatches of sleep a great many of them wouldnt make it to a residency no matter how high their marks had been in medical school but she would anna watched listened and made up her mind she learned something else something she was determined never to forget the backbone of the hospital wasnt the surgeons or the interns it wasnt the administrators though they dispensed the budget and made the policies it was the nursing staff the doctors examined and diagnosed but the nurses anna thought the nurses healed they spent hours on their feet walked miles of corridor each day whatever hat they were wearing clerk maid cleaning woman or comforter anna saw the same thing dedication often laced with fatigue the interns were run ragged to weed out the weak the nursing staff was just run ragged it was then the summer before her last year of medical school that anna made herself a promise she would be a doctor a surgeon but she would be one with a nurses compassion oh miss whitfield mrs kellerman the senior nurse stopped anna with a brisk hand signal then finished filling out a chart shed been a nurse as long as shed been a widow twenty years at fifty she was as tough as iron and as tireless as an adolescent kellerman was as gentle with her patients as she was hard on her nurses mrs higgs in was asking about you anna shifted the stack of magazines she carried five twentyone would be her first stop how is she today stable kellerman answered without looking up she was in the middle of a tenhour shift and hadnt time for chitchat she spent a restful night anna bit back a sigh she knew kellerman would have checked mrs higgss chart personally and could have given her exact information she also knew kellermans opinion of the system women were meant to function in certain areas men in others there was no crossover rather than question kellerman anna walked down the hall shed see for herself the blinds were open in mrs higgss room sunlight poured through and slashed brilliantly over white walls white sheets the radio was on low mrs higgs lay quietly in the bed her thin face was lined more deeply than it should have been on a woman not yet sixty her hair was thinning the gray dull and yellowing the spots of rouge shed applied that morning stood out like fire on her pale cheeks though her color made anna apprehensive she knew everything was being done that could be done at the end of each of her frail hands mrs higgss nails were tinted deep red it made anna smile mrs higgs had told her once that she could lose her looks but never her vanity because the womans eyes were closed anna shut the door quietly after setting down her magazines she walked to the chart at the foot of the bed as kellerman had said mrs higgs was stable no better no worse than she had been for more than a week her blood pressure was a bit low and she was still unable to hold solid food but shed passed the night comfortably satisfied anna moved to the window to draw the shades no dear i like the sun anna turned and found mrs higgs smiling at her im sorry did i wake you no i was dreaming a bit the pain was always there but mrs higgs continued to smile as she held out a hand i was hoping youd come by today oh i had to anna took a seat beside the bed i borrowed one of my mothers fashion magazines wait until you see what paris has in store for us for the fall with a laugh mrs higgs turned off the radio theyll never top the twenties that was fashion with daring of course you had to have good legs and nerve she managed a wink i did you still do the nerve not the legs sighing mrs higgs shifted anna was up immediately to rearrange her pillows i miss being young anna i wish i were older mrs higgs sat back weak and let anna arrange her covers dont wish the years away not years anna sat on the edge of the bed just this next one youll have your degree in the blink of an eye then there will be times youll miss all the work and confusion you went through to get it ill have to take your word for it efficient and unobtrusive anna took her pulse right now all i can think about is getting through the summer and starting again being young is like having a wonderful gift and not being quite sure what to do with it do you know the pretty nurse the tall one with the red hair reedy anna thought as she moved her fingers from the womans wrist she recalled from the chart that mrs higgs wasnt due to have medication for an hour ive seen her she was helping me this morning such a sweet thing shes getting married soon i liked hearing her talk about her sweetheart you never do i never do what talk about your sweetheart there were a few tiredlooking flowers in a glass next to the bed anna knew one of the nurses must have brought them in because mrs higgs had no family leaning over she tried to perk them up i dont have one oh i dont believe that a lovely young woman like you must have a handful of sweethearts they distract me when they line up at my door anna told her then grinned when the older woman chuckled not far from the truth i imagine i was only twentyfive when i lost my husband i thought ill never marry again of course i had sweethearts a little dreamy a little sad mrs higgs stared up at the ceiling i could tell you stories that would shock you with a laugh anna tossed back her hair the sunlight slanted across her eyes making them deeper warmer you couldnt shock me mrs higgs i was a dreadful tease im afraid but i had so much fun now i wish what do you wish mrs higgs i wish id married one of them i wish i married one and had children then thered be someone whod care and remember me you have people who care mrs higgs anna reached for her hand again i care she wouldnt give in to the pain or worse the selfpity mrs higgs gave annas hand a quick squeeze but there must be a man in your life someone special no one special there is a man anna continued in a cooler tone hes just a nuisance what man isnt tell me about him because the tired eyes had brightened anna decided to humor her his name is daniel macgregor is he handsome no yes anna shrugged her shoulders then dropped her chin on her hand hes not the kind of man youd see in a magazine but hes certainly not ordinary hes more than six foot about six three id say big shoulders mrs higgs asked perking up definitely she had decided to make him sound larger than life for mrs higgss sake then realized she didnt have to exaggerate he looks like he could heft two grown men on each one delighted mrs higgs settled back i always liked big men anna started to scowl then admitted to herself that her description of daniel was better for mrs higgs than the paris fashions he has red hair she continued then waited a beat and a beard a beard mrs higgss eyes brightened how dashing no the image of daniel came to her mind much too easily its more ferocious but he does have lovely eyes theyre very blue she frowned again remembering he tends to stare a bold one mrs higgs nodded approval i could never abide a wishywashy man what does he do hes a businessman a successful one arrogant better and better now tell me why hes a nuisance he wont take a simple no for an answer restless anna rose and walked to the window i made it very clear to him that i wasnt interested which has made him determined to change your mind something like that ive picked you anna whitfield i mean to have you hes sent me flowers every day this week what kind amused anna turned back roses white roses oh mrs higgs gave a sigh that was young and yearning its been too many years to count since someone sent me roses touched anna studied her face mrs higgs was tiring ill be glad to bring you some of mine they do smell wonderful youre a sweet child but its not the same is it there was a time her words trailed off and she shook her head well thats passed now perhaps you should take a closer look at this daniel its never wise to toss away affection ill have more time for affection after i finish my internship we always think well have more time with another sigh mrs higgs let her eyes close im betting on daniel she murmured and drifted off to sleep anna watched her a moment leaving mrs higgs with the sunlight and the magazine from paris anna left closing the door behind her hours later anna walked out into the afternoon light her feet were tired but her spirits were high shed spent the last part of her shift in maternity listening to new mothers and holding babies she wondered how long it would be before shed be in on a delivery and share in bringing in new life youre even lovelier when you smile startled anna spun around daniel was leaning against the hood of a dark blue convertible he was dressed more casually than shed seen him before in slacks and a shirt open at the collar as the light breeze ruffled his hair he grinned at her he looked though she hated to admit it wonderful while she hesitated trying to gauge the best way to handle him daniel straightened and walked to her your father told me youd be here she looked so competent he decided in the dark skirt and white blouse not as delicate as shed looked in the rose or blue gowns but every bit as lovely in a casual gesture she tucked her hair behind her ear oh i didnt realize you were well acquainted with my father now that ditmeyers district attorney i needed another lawyer my father anna struggled with a surge of temper i certainly hope you havent retained him because of me daniels smile was slow and easy yes every bit as lovely i dont mix business with personal matters anna you havent answered any of my calls this time she smiled no your manners surprise me they shouldnt considering your own but in any case i did send you a note i dont consider a formal request for me to stop sending you flowers communication you havent stopped sending them either no youve been working all day yes so now if youll excuse me ill drive you home she inclined her head in the cool manner hed come to wait for thats very kind of you but it isnt necessary its a lovely day and i dont live far all right ill walk with you she discovered she was gritting her teeth deliberately anna relaxed daniel im sure ive made myself clear aye that you have and ive made myself clear so he took both of her hands in his its just a matter of seeing which one of us holds out the longest i intend for it to be me there isnt any harm in our getting to know each other better is there im sure there is she began to see one of the reasons he was so successful in business when he chose the charm just oozed out of him it wasnt every man who could lay down a challenge with a friendly smile you have to let go of my hands of course if youll take a drive with me the light came into her eyes i dont respond to bribes fair enough because he was coming to respect her and because he still intended to win he released her hands anna its a lovely afternoon take a drive with me fresh air and sunshine are good for you arent they they are where was the harm maybe if she humored him a bit shed be able to convince him to put his considerable energy elsewhere all right a short drive then you have a beautiful car i like it though steven pouts whenever i go out without him and the rolls pitiful thing for a grown man to pout he started to open the door for her then stopped do you drive of course fine daniel drew the keys out of his pocket and handed them to her i dont understand you want me to drive unless youd rather not her fingers curled around the keys id love to but how do you know im not reckless he stared at her a moment then burst into delighted laughter before she realized it he swung her up and in two dizzying circles anna whitfield im crazy about you crazy she muttered trying to straighten her skirt and her dignity when her feet touched the ground again come along anna he plopped into the passenger seat with a wicked grin my life and my car are in your hands with a toss of her head she rounded the hood and took her own seat unable to resist she sent him a coolly wicked smile a gambler are you daniel aye he settled back as the engine sprang to life why dont you head out of town a bit the airs fresher a mile she told herself as she pulled away from the curb two at the most soon they had somehow gotten ten miles out of town and laughing its wonderful she called over the wind ive never driven a convertible before suits you ill remember that when i decide to buy one of my own she caught her bottom lip between her teeth as she negotiated a curve i just might look into it soon ill be moving into an apartment closer to the hospital but a car is handy youre moving out of your parents home next month she nodded they didnt object as much as id anticipated i suppose the best thing i ever did was to go to college out of state all i have to do is convince them they dont have to furnish it for me i dont like the idea of you living alone she turned her head briefly that isnt an issue of course but in any case im a grown woman you live alone dont you thats different why he opened his mouth then shut it again why because although he didnt worry about himself hed worry about her however that wasnt a reason shed accept hed learned that much about anna i dont live alone he corrected her i have servants smug he waited for her argument i dont think ill have room for any look how green the grass is youre changing the subject yes i am do you often take afternoons off no he grumbled a bit then decided to let it drop he could always check out her apartment for himself and make certain it was safe if it wasnt he could damn well buy it but i decided catching you at the hospital was the only way to see you alone again i could have said no aye i was betting you wouldnt what do you do in there you cant stick needles and knives in people yet she laughed again the wind smelled delicious for the most part i visit patients talk to them pass out magazines i may help sort or change linen if they need me thats not what youre going to school for no but im learning nonetheless doctors or even the nurses cant give patients a lot of personal attention simply because of lack of time and too much volume im free to do that now if only for a short while and it helps me understand what its like to lie there hour after hour sick uncomfortable or just bored im going to remember that when i start my practice hed never thought of it just that way before but he did remember the lingering illness that had taken his mother when hed been ten he remembered too how difficult it had been for her to be confined to bed the sickroom smell was just as clear to him now as the scent of the mines doesnt it bother you to be around sick people all the time if it didnt bother me i wouldnt feel the need to be a doctor daniel watched the way the wind tossed her hair back away from her face hed loved his mother had sat with her every day but hed dreaded facing her illness and watching her fade anna young vital was choosing to spend her life facing illness i dont understand you i dont always understand myself tell me why you go into that hospital every day she thought of her dream why would he understand when no one else did then she thought of mrs higgs perhaps he could understand that theres a woman in the hospital now a couple of weeks ago they operated removed a tumor and part of her liver i know shes in pain but she hardly ever complains she needs to talk and i can give her that its all the doctoring i can do now but its important she turned to him again and her eyes were dark and intense yes to both of us today she was telling me that she wished shed married again after her husband died she wants someone to remember her her bodys giving up but her minds so sharp today i was telling her about you you talked about me she couldve bitten her tongue instead anna carefully explained mrs higgs got on the subject of men and i told her i knew one who was a nuisance he took her hand and kissed it thank you fighting amusement she increased her speed anyway i described you she was impressed how did you describe me are you vain as well daniel absolutely arrogant ferocious i dont know if i remembered to include rude the point is if i can sit and talk to her for a few minutes every day bring a little of the outside world into her room it makes it easier a doctor has to remember that diagnosis and treatment arent enough maybe theyre nothing at all without compassion i dont think youll forget that she felt a tug at her heart youre trying to flatter me again no im trying to understand you daniel how did she deal with him now she could handle the arrogance the flamboyance even the demands but how did she deal with the kindness if you really want to understand me youll listen to me earning my degree starting my practice arent just the most important things in my life for now theyre the only things ive wanted this too long worked too hard to be distracted from it by anything or anyone he trailed a finger down her shoulder are you finding me a distraction anna it isnt a joke no none of it is i want you to be my wife the car swerved as her hands went limp on the wheel hitting the brakes anna came to a screeching halt in the middle of the road does this mean yes because he enjoyed the blatant shock on her face he grinned it took her another ten seconds to find her voice no he wasnt joking he was insane youre out of your mind weve known each other a week seen each other a handful of times and youre proposing marriage if you go into business deals with this kind of abandon i cant understand why youre not bankrupt because i know which deal to make and which to toss out anna he reached out and took her shoulders i could have waited to ask you but i dont see the point when im sure youre sure with a long breath she tried to control the chaos of emotions inside her it may interest you to know that it takes two people to make a marriage two willing dedicated people who love each other he dismissed that there are two of us i dont want to get married not to you not to anyone i have another year of school my internship my residency i may not like the idea of you becoming a doctor nor was he convinced shed pull it off but im willing to make some concessions concessions her eyes went nearly opaque with temper my career is not a concession her voice was entirely too calm too quiet ive tried to be reasonable with you daniel but you simply dont listen try to get this through your head youre wasting your time he drew her closer aroused by her temper infuriated by her rejection its mine to waste not as gently as he had before nor as patiently he crushed his mouth to hers she might have resisted he didnt know in that moment daniel was too absorbed in the needs churning inside of him the emotions swirling through him to be aware of compliance or objection her lips were warmed from the strong sun her skin soft from whatever female magic she performed on it he wanted her it was no longer a matter of his choosing or his planning desire overwhelmed enclosed and ruled him this is how shed thought he would be strong demanding dangerous exciting she couldnt make herself object though she knew it should have been simple cold how could she be cold when her body had so suddenly turned to fire unfeeling how could she not feel the sensations racing through her despite all logic despite all will she melted against him in melting she gave more than shed known she had she took more than shed known she wanted shed want again while her blood thudded frantically in her head she knew it as long as he was near as long as she could remember his touch shed want again how could she stop it why did she want to there were answers she was sure there were answers if only she could find them it was logic she needed but the weakness took over until she was lost in the power they made together when strength returned it was entwined with passion but passion she could control fighting regrets anna pulled away she straightened in the seat and stared directly ahead until she was certain she could speak im not going to see you again the first prick of fear surprised him daniel shoved it away and turned her face toward his we both know thats not true i mean what i say im sure of it but its not true damn you daniel no one can tell you anything it was the first time hed heard her lash out in anger and though she quickly controlled herself he saw that her temper was something to respect even if i were in love with you which im not she continued nothing could come of it he twisted a lock of her hair around his finger and released it well just wait and see we wont she broke off and jumped as a horn blared a car bumped along beside them the elderly man driving paused long enough to glare at them and shout something that was lost under the sound of his motor as he went around them and continued down the road when daniel started to laugh anna laid her forehead on the steering wheel and joined him shed never known anyone who could make her so furious make her so weak and still make her laugh daniel this is the most ridiculous situation ive ever been in still chuckling she lifted her head id almost believe we could be friends if youd stop the rest of this business we will be friends he leaned over and kissed her lightly before she could move away i want a wife a family there comes a time when a man needs those things or nothing else is worthwhile she folded her arms on the wheel and rested her chin on them calm again she stared off into the tall grass along the road i believe that for you i also believe that you made up your mind to marry and set out looking for the most suitable woman to fit the bill he shifted uncomfortable it wouldnt be easy to have a wife who could read you that well but hed picked anna why do you think that because its all business to you she gave him a steady look one way or the other he wouldnt evade couldnt with her maybe so the thing is you fit only you sighing she leaned back marriage isnt a business transaction or it shouldnt be i cant help you daniel anna started the car again its time we went back he laid a hand lightly on her shoulder before she began the turn its too late to go back anna for both of us chapter four contents prev next lightning snaked across the sky and thunder rumbled but the rain held off the night though summer had barely begun was almost sultry now and again the wind moved through the trees with no sound and no power to cool the air enjoying the heat and the threat of a storm myra stopped in front of the ditmeyers with a highpitched squeal of brakes what a dreadful noise she flipped down the mirror on her visor to check her face i really must get that fixed your face annas bland smile was answered with easy good humor before its over certainly but immediately that nasty noise you might try driving with a bit more discretion anna suggested now what fun would that be laughing anna stepped from the car remind me not to let you drive my new car new car myra let the door slam then fussed with the strap of her dress when did you get a new car it must be the air she thought that made her feel so restless so reckless i was thinking perhaps tomorrow great ill go with you a new apartment a new car myra linked arms with anna as they strolled up the walk the scent of their perfumes one subtle one flamboyant merged whats come over our quiet little anna a taste of freedom tossing her head back she looked at the sky it boiled with clouds excitement one taste and ive discovered im insatiable it wasnt a word myra associated with anna except when it came to her studies unless she missed her guess her friends thoughts had strayed from her medical journals speculating she touched her tongue to her top lip i wonder just how much daniel macgregor has to do with it anna paused to lift a brow before she rang the bell she recognized the look in myras eye and knew just how to handle it what would he have to do with my buying a new car i was thinking about the insatiable it was difficult to keep her face sober but anna managed to ignore the wicked smile myra tossed her youre looking around the wrong comer myra ive just decided i want to drive back to connecticut in style something red myra decided and flashy no something white i think and classy itll suit you wont it with a sigh myra stepped back to study anna her dress was the color of the inside of a peach very pale very warm with the sleeves thin and cuffed at the wrists if i tried to wear a dress that color id fade into the wallpaper you look like something in a bakery window with another laugh anna took her arm again i didnt come here to be nibbled on in any case flashy suits you myra the way it suits no one else pleased myra pursed her lips yes it does doesnt it when the ditmeyers butler opened the door anna swept inside she couldnt explain why she felt so good maybe it was because her routine at the hospital was becoming more and more rewarding maybe it was the letter from dr hewitt and the fascinating new surgical technique hed told her of it certainly had nothing to do with the white roses that continued to arrive every day mrs ditmeyer stout and formidable in lavender voile louise ditmeyer came to greet both of her guests anna how lovely you look she stopped to study annas pale peach dress just lovely she continued pastels are so suitable for a young girl and myra she swept a glance down myras vivid emeraldgreen silk the disapproval was evident in her gaze how are you very well thank you myra said sweetly silly old fish youre looking wonderful mrs ditmeyer anna spoke up quickly well able to read myras thoughts to keep her friend in line she gave her the tiniest of nudges in the ribs i hope were not too early not at all there are several people in the salon come along she swept along ahead of them looks like a battleship myra muttered then watch your mouth or youll get torpedoed i do hope your parents are coming mrs ditmeyer paused in the doorway and took a pleased survey of her guests they wouldnt miss it anna assured her and wondered if anyone would dare tell louise ditmeyer that lavender made her look jaundiced mrs ditmeyer signaled to a servant charles some sherry for the young ladies im sure you two can mingle on your own so much to do with that she was bustling off feeling aggressive myra sauntered up to the bar make it bourbon charles and a martini anna put in dry behave yourself myra i know shes annoying but shes herberts mother easy for you to say with a mumble myra took her drink as far as shes concerned youve got halo and wings anna winced at the description youre exaggerating all right just the halo then would it help if i spilled my drink on the carpet anna plucked out the olive you wouldnt myra began then gasped as anna tilted her glass no myra righted it with a giggle id forgotten how easily you take a dare she took the olive from anna and ate it herself i wouldnt mind so much if you spilled it on the dragon but the carpets too lovely poor herbert she turned to study the other guests there he is now cornered by that didactic manhunting mary obrian you know he is attractive in an intellectual sort of way its a pity hes so so what good myra concluded now then she lifted her glass to hide her grin theres someone i dont think anyone would call good she didnt even have to turn the room seemed smaller all at once and warmer warmer and charged she felt the excitement remembered the thrill for a moment she panicked the terrace doors were to her right she could be through them and away in an instant shed make an excuse later any excuse my my myra laid a hand on annas arm and felt her tremble youve got it bad furious with herself anna set her glass down then picked it up again dont be ridiculous amusement mixed with concern anna its me the one who loves you best hes persistent thats all outrageously persistent it makes me nervous all right myra knew better than to try to budge anna off course well leave it at that for now but since it seems to me that you need a minute to pull yourself together lets go rescue herbert anna didnt argue she did need a minute an hour maybe years it didnt matter that shed considered and weighed her reaction to daniel and had judged it to be purely physical the reaction remained and it grew each time she saw him she didnt care for the edgy excitement he could bring to her just by being in the same room so she would ignore him and relax it had always been possible for her to control the reactions of her body breathe slowly she told herself concentrate on individual muscles the strain in her shoulders eased they were after all at a very proper dinner party surrounded by other people it wasnt as if they were sitting in a parked car on a lonely road her stomach tightened hello herbert myra eased her way to his side mary myra obviously annoyed with the interruption mary turned to anna as she did herbert rolled his eyes amused and sympathetic myra tucked her arm through his put any good criminals in jail lately before he could comment mary sent myra a withering look really you make it sound like a game herbert is a very important part of our judicial system really myra arched a brow as only she could and i thought he just tossed crooks in the slammer regularly herbert quipped his voice dry his look solemn he nodded at myra i do my best to make sure the streets are safe you should see the notches on my briefcase delighted he could play the game myra leaned closer and batted her lashes oh herbert i simply adore tough guys it was unfortunately a fiendishly clever mimicry of cathleen donahue marys closest friend she sniffed and stiffened if youll excuse me i think her nose is out of joint myra looked wideeyed and innocent anna whats your medical opinion terminal cattiness anna patted myras cheek careful love its catching quite a performance anna froze then forced herself to relax how could she have guessed that such a big man could move so quietly good evening mr macgregor myra held out a friendly hand the dinner party wouldnt be boring after all did you enjoy the ballet very much but i liked your act every bit as much herbert greeted daniel with a quick handshake youll find that myras never dull flattered and surprised myra turned to him why thank you going with impulse she made up her mind on the spot she loved anna like a sister she decided to do what she thought best for her i think i could use another drink before dinner you too herbert without giving him a chance to agree she pulled him along with a shake of his head daniel watched her maneuver herbert through the crowd shes something anna watched her steam toward the bar oh shes definitely something i like your hair she nearly reached a hand up to it before she stopped herself because she hadnt had the time to fuss with it after her day at the hospital shed simply pulled it straight back shed hoped to look sophisticated at best competent at the least her face was unframed and vulnerable have you been to the ditmeyers before youre changing the subject again yes have you a smile hovered around his mouth no theres a wonderful collection of waterford in the dining room you should take a look at it when we go in to dinner you like crystal yes it seems cold until the light hits it and then there are so many surprises if you agreed to have dinner with me at my home i could show you mine she dismissed the first part of the statement as nonsense but honed in on the second you collect i like pretty things the tone was clear her look was as direct and as calm as ever if thats a compliment ill take it for what its worth but i have no intention of being collected i dont want you on a shelf or in a glass case i just want you he took her hand tightening his fingers on hers when she would have drawn away youre skittish he commented and found that fact pleased him cautious without moving her head anna shifted her gaze to their joined hands you have my hand he intended to keep it have you noticed how well yours fits into it she brought her eyes back to his you have very large hands anyones would fit into it i think not but he released her hand only to take her arm daniel it looks like were going in to dinner she couldnt eat annas appetite was never large which constantly made myra grumble but tonight it was nonexistent at first shed thought it a trick of fate that daniel was seated next to her at the long banquet table but one look at his face and she was certain hed arranged it he made his way without problem through the seafood appetizer and the soup course while she nibbled for forms sake he was attentive infuriatingly so while all but ignoring the woman on his right he leaned close and murmured to her encouraged her to try a bit more of this taste a bit of that forced by upbringing to keep her manners in place anna struggled for composure her parents were seated closer to the head of the table from that direction she saw both speculation and approval she set her teeth and tried to choke down beef wellington it didnt take her long to realize there was speculation going on at other points of the table as well she caught the smiles the nods the whispers behind lifted hands daniel was making it clear publicly that he considered them a couple her temper always so well controlled began to heat very deliberately anna cut a piece of meat if you dont stop playing the lovesick suitor she murmured sending him a smile im going to knock my wineglass in your lap youll be very uncomfortable daniel patted her hand no you wont anna took a deep breath and bided her time as dessert was served she scooted her hand along the table and nudged if he hadnt glanced down just at that instant hed have missed it and would have had a lapful of burgundy he made a quick grab the glass tilted the other way before he could right it half the contents had splatted over the tablecloth he heard anna swear under her breath and nearly roared with laughter clumsy he sent an apologetic look toward his hostess ive such big hands unrepentant he used one of them to pat annas leg under the table he thought but couldnt be sure that he heard her grind her teeth think nothing of it mrs ditmeyer surveyed the damage and decided it could have been worse thats what tablecloths are for you havent spilled any on yourself have you daniel beamed at her then at anna not a drop as the buzz of conversation picked up again daniel leaned toward anna admirable and very quick i find you more and more exciting youd have been more excited if my aim had been better he lifted his glass and touched it to hers what do you think our hostess would do if i were to kiss you right here right now anna picked up her knife and examined it as though admiring the pattern the look she sent daniel was as tough as nails i know what id do this time he did laugh loud and long ill be damned anna youre the only woman for me his announcement carried easily down both ends of the table but i wont kiss you now i dont want you trying your first surgery on me after dinner there was bridge in the parlor though she detested the game anna considered volunteering to keep herself occupied and in a group before she could manage it she was urged along outside by a half dozen younger people the storm still threatened and the moon was covered with clouds but the air was freshened by the building breeze as the rain crept closer the wind began to dance around her skirt there were lights placed strategically here and there so that the trees and the garden were bathed in a muted glow someone had turned on the radio inside so that music flowed through the windows the group started out wandering aimlessly then slowly paired off i wonder if you know much about gardens daniel asked her she hadnt expected to be rid of him easily with a shrug anna kept several of her friends in view a bit stevens a better driver than a gardener daniel leaned over to sniff at a fat white peony hes neat enough but he lacks imagination i was hoping for something more showy anna suggested he liked the word aye showy colorful in scotland we had the heather and the brambles were full of wild roses not the pretty tame sort you buy at the flower shop tough ones with stems as thick as your thumbs and thorns that could rip a hole through you ignoring annas murmur of disapproval he plucked off a bloom and tucked it behind her ear delicate flowers are nice for looking at for seeing in a womans hair but a wild rose they last shed forgotten she didnt want to be alone with him forgotten to keep within a cautious distance of her friends she wondered what a wild rose would smell like and if a man like daniel would rip it out or leave it in the brambles to grow as it chose do you miss scotland he looked down at her for a moment lost in his own memories sometimes when im not too busy to think about it i miss the cliffs and the sea and the grass thats greener than it has a right to be it was in his voice she realized mourning shed never thought it possible to mourn for land only for people are you going to go back she found herself needing to know and afraid of his answer he looked away a moment and the lightning flashed reflecting fast and sharp on his face her heart thudded wildly he looked the way shed always imagined thor would look bold ruthless invulnerable when he spoke his voice was quiet and should have soothed her she felt only more excitement no a man makes his own home in his own time she ran a finger down a fragile vine of wisteria just a trick of the light she told herself it was silly to be moved by a trick of the light dont you have family there no she thought she heard pain in his voice pain that went deeper than mourning but his face was impassive when she looked up im the last of my line i need sons anna he didnt touch her he didnt need to i need sons and daughters i want you to give them to me why when he still spoke the outrageous did it no longer seem so outrageous uneasy anna continued along the path i dont want to argue with you daniel good he caught her around the waist and spun her again the solemn look that had been in his eyes was replaced by a grin well drive to maryland and be married in the morning no though it wounded her dignity she tried to wiggle away all right if you want a big wedding ill wait a week no no no why it struck her as funny she didnt know but she began to laugh as she pushed at his chest daniel macgregor under all that red hair you have the hardest head known to man i will not marry you tomorrow i will not marry you in a week i will not marry you ever he lifted her off her feet so that their faces were level when she got over her shock anna found it an odd and not entirely unpleasant sensation bet he said simply her brow lifted and her voice was cool as a mountain stream i beg your pardon god what a woman he said and kissed her hard the visions that came and went in her head swirled so quickly that she couldnt separate them if i didnt want to do the honorable thing i swear id toss you over my shoulder and be done with it then he laughed and kissed her again instead ill make you a wager if he kissed her just once more shed be too giddy to remember her name clinging to dignity she braced her hands on his shoulders and looked stern daniel put me down damned if i will he said and grinned at her youll be lame if you dont he remembered her threat with the wineglass a compromise daniel decided and set her down but he kept his hands around her waist a wager he repeated i dont know what youre talking about you said i was a gambler and right you were what about you she discovered her hands were resting against his chest and dropped them certainly not hah there was a dare in his eyes she found hard to resist now you lie any woman who takes herself off to be a doctor thumbing her nose at the system has gambling in her blood and right he was she tilted her head whats the wager theres a lass he would have lifted her off her feet again if she hadnt narrowed her eyes at him i say youll have my ring on your finger within the year and i say i wont if i win you spend the first week as my wife in bed well do nothing but eat sleep and make love if hed meant to shock her hed fallen short of the mark anna merely nodded and if you lose his eyes were alive with the challenge with the taste of victory name it her lips curved she believed in making the stakes high you give a grant to the hospital enough for a new wing he didnt hesitate done if she was sure of anything it was that he would keep his word no matter how absurd the circumstances solemnly she extended her hand daniel took it for the official shake then brought it to his lips ive never gambled for higher stakes nor will i again now let me kiss you anna when she backed away he caught her again weve set the wager and named the stakes but what are the odds he brushed his lips against her temple and felt her shiver aye anna my love what are the odds slowly he skimmed his mouth over her skin teasing promising but never quite meeting her mouth his hands at once gentle and confident roamed up her back to toy with the sensitive skin of her neck then retreat again to her waist he could feel the instant when her body gave in to its own needs and to his he could feel his own climb higher but he continued slowly effortlessly to seduce the thunder rumbled again but she thought it was her own heartbeat when lightning flashed it was like the fire in her own blood what was passion what was need what was emotion how could she tell when no man had ever brought her any of those things with such intensity before she knew it was vital to separate them but they flowed together into one incandescent sensation this was beauty as her body went fluid she recognized it this was danger when her muscles went lax she accepted it his mouth brushed over hers again but didnt linger frustrated edgy she moaned and strained closer did he laugh or was it the thunder again then the skies opened and rain poured over them with a curse daniel swooped her off her feet you owe me a kiss anna whitfield he shouted he stood a moment while the rain poured down his wild mane of hair the lightning was in his eyes dont think ill forget with that he bundled her close and ran for the terrace was it any wonder she was distracted in the hospital the next day anna found herself walking down corridors then having to stop and sort out where she was going and what she was doing it worried her it infuriated her what if she had her degree if she had patients and became so easily rattled she simply couldnt permit herself to think of anything but her duties as long as she was in the hospital but she remembered the wild thrill of being carried in daniels arms through the pounding summer storm she remembered too the way hed burst through the terrace doors and sent the quiet bridge game into chaos by demanding towels and a brandy for her it should have been humiliating anna had found it sweet that was something else that worried her thinking of how louise ditmeyers eyes had widened like saucers anna smothered a laugh hed certainly added spice to a sedate dinner party she spent the majority of her day in the wards bringing books and magazines to the patients and talking to them as they lay in beds set side by side lack of privacy anna thought could be as debilitating as the illnesses that had brought them there but there was only so much room so many doctors she smiled a bit thinking that the impulsive bet shed made with daniel would do some good with a glance at her watch she realized she had less than an hour to meet myra today shed pick out her new car something practical certainly she reminded herself but not dull maybe it was foolish to be excited over the purchase of four wheels and an engine but she kept thinking of the long solitary drives shed take shed been speaking no less than the truth when shed told myra that she wanted freedom she thought of it now and longed for it still she couldnt leave for the day without stopping in on mrs higgs planning the rest of her day as she went anna made her way to the fifth floor shed take myra out to dinner and splurge there was nothing myra would like better then maybe theyd drive out of town and give the new car a test some weekend soon theyd drive out to the beach and spend the day in the sun pleased with the idea anna swung through the door of her mouth fell open oh anna we were afraid you wouldnt come by sitting up in bed eyes bright mrs higgs fussed with the edge of her sheet on the table beside her was a vase of red roses fresh flamboyant and fragrant sitting beside the bed like a suitor was daniel i told you anna wouldnt leave without coming in to see how you were daniel rose and offered her a chair no no of course i wouldnt confused anna approached the bed youre looking well today mrs higgs reached for her hair the young redheaded nurse had helped her brush it that morning but she hadnt been able to use a rinse for weeks id have fixed myself up a bit if id known i was having a caller she looked at daniel with nothing less than an adoring smile you look lovely he took one of her thin hands between both of his he sounded as though he meant it what impressed anna most was the fact that his voice carried none of the patronizing tone that so many people used when speaking with the ill or the old something flashed in mrs higgss eyes it was both gratitude and pride its important to look your best when you have a gentleman caller isnt that right anna yes of course anna wandered to the foot of the bed and tried unobtrusively to read the chart the flowers are beautiful you didnt mention you were coming to the hospital daniel he winked at mrs higgs i like surprises wasnt it nice of your young man to come by and visit me hes not anna caught herself and softened her voice yes yes it was now i know you two want to run along and i wont keep you mrs higgs spoke briskly but her energy was flagging youll come again she reached up for daniels hand i so enjoyed talking with you he heard the plea she tried so desperately to hide ill come again leaning over he kissed her cheek when he stepped back anna adjusted mrs higgss pillows and made her more comfortable with a few efficient moves he saw then that annas hands werent just soft delicate things made to be kissed but that they were competent strong and sure it brought him a moments discomfort now you try to rest you mustnt tire yourself dont worry about me mrs higgs sighed go have fun she was already dozing when they walked from the room are you done here for today daniel asked as they started down the hall yes ill drive you home no im meeting myra as always the elevator was slow and temperamental anna pushed the button and waited then ill drop you he wanted her to himself away from the hospital where shed looked so efficient and at home no really im meeting her a couple of blocks away anna stepped into the elevator with him have dinner with me tonight i cant i have plans her hands were locked tightly together as the doors opened again tomorrow i dont know i emotions churning she walked out into sunshine and fresh air daniel why did you come here today to see you of course you went to see mrs higgs she continued to walk shed only mentioned the name once how was it hed remembered why should he have cared shouldnt i have it seemed to me she looked only the better for a bit of company she shook her head struggling to find the right words she hadnt known he could be kind not really kind when the gesture brought no gain he was in business after all where there was profit and loss and accounts to be forever balanced the price of the roses would have meant nothing to him but the gift of them everything to mrs higgs she wondered if he knew what you did means more at this point than any of the medicine they can give her she stopped then and turned he could see the swirl of emotion in her eyes the steady intensity of feeling that locked on him and demanded anna asked why did you do it to impress me no one could lie to eyes like that he had done it to impress her and had been damn pleased with the idea until hed begun to talk to mrs higgs hed seen a mirror of his mothers fading beauty and tired dignity and hed go see her again not for anna but for himself he had no way of explaining it to her and no intention of exposing feelings that had been private for so long the main idea was to impress you i also wanted to see what it was about that place that keeps bringing you back i still dont understand it all but maybe i see part of it now when she said nothing he stuck his hands in his pockets as they walked this woman worried him a good bit more than hed anticipated he wanted to please her he was surprised how much he wanted to see her smile again hed have even settled for one of her cool regal stares frustrated he scowled straight ahead well damn it were you impressed or not she stopped to look up at him her eyes were cool but he couldnt read them then she took him totally by surprise she put her hands on both sides on his face in her strong unhurried way she drew his face down until she could touch her lips to his it was hardly more than a hint of a kiss but it exploded through him she held him there a moment her eyes locked on his then saying nothing she released him and walked away for the first time in his life daniel found himself speechless chapter five contents prev next daniel sat in his office in the old line savings and loan puffing on his cigar and listening to the longwinded report from his bank manager the man knew banking daniel conceded and he was a whiz with figures but he couldnt see more than two feet in front of his face therefore in addition to my other recommendations i further recommend that the bank foreclose on the halloran property auctioning this property off would cover the outstanding principal plus in a conservative estimate yield a five percent profit daniel tapped his cigar in an ashtray extend it i beg your pardon i said extend the halloran loan bombeck bombeck pushed his glasses up on his nose and fluttered through his papers perhaps you didnt understand that the hallorans are six months behind on their mortgage payments in the past two months theyve failed to keep current with the interest even if halloran finds work as he claims he will we cant expect the loan to be brought up to date within this quarter i have all the figures here i dont doubt it daniel muttered bored your work he thought should never bore you or you lose your touch drawing the papers out bombeck placed them on daniels desk they were as bombeck was tidy and assiduously correct if youll just look them over im sure we can give the hallorans another six months to bring the interest up to date bombeck blanched six clearing his throat he shifted in his chair his neat hands worked together mr macgregor im sure your sympathies toward the hallorans are admirable but you must understand that a bank cant be run on sentiment daniel drew on his cigar paused then blew out a haze of smoke there was the slightest of smiles on his mouth but his eyes if bombeck had dared to look at them were cold as ice is that so bombeck i appreciate you telling me bombeck wet his lips as manager of old line which was about to go belly up one month ago when i bought it yes bombeck cleared his throat again yes indeed mr macgregor thats precisely the point as manager i feel it my duty to give you all the benefit of my experience ive been in banking for fifteen years fifteen daniel said as if impressed fourteen yean eight months and ten days he had the employment records of everyone who worked for him down to the cleaning woman thats just fine bombeck maybe if i give this to you in different terms youll understand my way of thinking daniel leaned back in his chair so that the sun shooting through the window behind him turned his hair to fire though he hadnt planned it that way hed have been more than satisfied with the effect you estimate a five percent profit if we foreclose and auction the halloran property have i got that right sarcasm skimmed over bombecks head exactly so mr macgregor good good however over the remaining twelve years of the halloran mortgage we would see a longterm profit of conservatively speaking triple that over the longterm of course i could get you the exact figures but excellent then we understand each other extend it because he enjoyed doing so daniel waited a beat before dropping his bomb well be lowering the mortgage rates by a quarter percent starting next month lowering but mr macgregor and raising the interest on savings accounts to the highest allowable rate mr macgregor that will throw old line deeply in the red in the shortterm daniel agreed briskly in the longterm you were understanding the longterm werent you bombeck in the longterm well make up for it with volume old line will have the lowest mortgage rates in the state bombeck felt his stomach churn and swallowed yes sir and the highest rates on savings accounts he could almost see dollar bills flying away on little wings it will cost the bank bombeck couldnt even imagine i could work up the figures in a few days im sure youll see what im trying to say with a policy like that in six months old line will be the biggest lending institution in the state daniel finished mildly im glad we agree were going to advertise in the papers advertise bombeck murmured as if in a dream something big daniel measured with his hands enjoying himself but distinguished why dont you see what you can come up with and get back to me say by ten tomorrow it took bombeck a few seconds to realize hed been dismissed too dazed to argue he tidied his papers and rose as he walked out daniel ground his cigar in the ashtray dimwitted nearsighted dunderhead what he needed was someone young fresh out of college and eager he could salvage bombecks pride by making up a new position for him daniel felt strongly about loyalty and dunderhead or not bombeck had been with old line for nearly fifteen years it was something he might just discuss with ditmeyer that was a man whose opinion daniel trusted bankers had to realize it was their business to gamble it was certainly daniels rising he walked to the window behind his desk and looked at boston at this point his whole life was a gamble the money hed earned could be lost he shrugged at that hed earn more again the power he now wielded could fade hed build it back up again but there was one thing he was coming to understand that if lost couldnt be replaced anna when had she stopped being part of his master plan and become his life when had he lost track of the deal and fallen in love he could pinpoint it to the instant the instant shed taken his face in her hands looked so solemnly into his eyes and touched her mouth to his hed gone beyond attraction beyond desire beyond the challenge his systematic courtship had been blown to bits the blueprint so carefully drawn was in tatters from that moment hed become only a man totally bewitched by woman so now what that was one question he had no answer for hed wanted a wife who would sit patiently at home while he took care of business that wasnt anna hed wanted a wife who wouldnt question his decisions but go quietly about making them into fact that wasnt anna there was a part of her life that would always remain separate from him if she succeeded in her ambition and he was coming to believe she would shed have doctor in front of her name before a year was out to anna it wouldnt simply be a title but a way of life could a man whose business made such demands took such long hours out of his day have a wife whose profession did exactly the same who would make the home he wondered pulling his fingers through his hair who would tend the children better if he turned his back on her now and found a woman whod be content to do those things and nothing else better if he followed the advice shed given him and chose a woman who had no windmills to battle he needed a home it was difficult for him to admit even to himself just how desperately he needed one he needed family the scent of bread baking in the kitchen flowers sitting in bowls those were the things hed grown up with those were the things hed done too long without he couldnt be sure he would have them with anna and yet if he found them without her he didnt think they would matter damn woman he looked at his watch shed be nearly finished at the hospital now he had a meeting across town in just under an hour determined not to let his life be run by someone elses schedule he sat behind his desk again and picked up bombecks report after one paragraph he slammed it down again grumbling and swearing he stalked out of his office shed spent five hours on her feet with a tired satisfaction anna thought about a long hot bath and a quiet evening with a book perhaps shed just soak and plan how shed decorate her apartment in two weeks shed have the keys in her hand and rooms to furnish if her feet werent certain to object shed poke around a few antique stores now with pleasure she thought of the shiny white convertible waiting for her in the lot next door the car meant more than the fact that she didnt have to walk home it meant independence taking the keys out of her purse she jiggled them in her hand and felt on top of the world anna had never considered her ego very large but when her father had all but drooled on the upholstery then demanded a ride shed felt her head swell hed approved finally shed used her own money her own judgment and there had been no criticism she remembered the way hed dragged her mother outside and pulled her into the back seat with him anna had tooled around boston for nearly an hour with her parents as cozy as teenagers behind her shed understood that theyd begun to think of her as something more than a little girl who needed guidance whether theyd realized it yet or not theyd accepted her as an adult maybe she thought just maybe there would be pride when she earned her diploma giddy with success anna tossed her keys into the air and caught them again she walked straight into daniel you werent looking where you were going shed been happy before but was happier yet to have seen him she could almost admit it no i wasnt hed already decided on the way to deal with her his way youre having dinner with me tonight when she opened her mouth he took her by the shoulders his voice was loud enough to turn heads his eyes fierce enough to turn them forward again i wont have any arguments im tired of them and dont have time at the moment anyway youre having dinner with me tonight be ready at seven there were a number of things she could do in the space of seconds anna thought of them all but she decided the best way was the least expected all right daniel she said very demurely i dont care what what i said id be ready she looked at him her eyes calm her smile serene it threw him completely off balance as shed been certain it would i all right then he scowled and stuck his hands in his pockets see that you are hed gotten precisely what hed wanted but he stopped halfway to his car and looked back anna was standing just where shed been in a pool of sunlight her smile remained as quiet and sweet as an angels kiss damn women daniel mumbled as he yanked open the door of his car you couldnt trust them anna waited until hed pulled off then rocked with laughter seeing him stumble and stutter had been better than any argument still laughing she went to her car an evening with daniel she admitted would certainly be more interesting than a book turning the key in the ignition she felt the power she had control and she liked it he brought her flowers not the white roses he still insisted on sending her day after day but some tiny impudent violets from his own garden it pleased him to watch her arrange them in a little glass vase as he spoke with her parents he looked big and brash in her mothers dainty parlor he felt as nervous as a scrawny boy on his first date edgy he sat on a chair he felt better suited to a dollhouse and shared a tepid cup of tea with mrs whitfield you must come to dinner soon mrs whitfield told him the constant delivery of roses had made her quite hopeful it had also given her something to brag about over bridge the truth was she didnt understand her daughter and never had of course she could tell herself that anna had always been a sweet lovely child but she herself was simply out of her depth when doing something other than choosing material for a dress or a meal from a menu anna with her calm stubbornness and unshakable ambitions was completely beyond her scope still mrs whitfield wasnt a fool she saw the way daniel looked at her daughter and understood very well with a strange mixture of relief and regret she pictured anna married and raising her own family if daniels manners were a bit rough she knew her anna would smooth them out quickly enough perhaps shed be a grandmother in a year or two it was another thought that brought mixed feelings sipping her tea mrs whitfield studied daniel i realize you and john are business associates now but well have to keep that in the office of course i know nothing about the business anyway she reached over to pat daniels hand john wont tell me a thing no matter how i badger him and badger she does mr whitfield put in now john with a light laugh she aimed a killing look if this man had serious intentions toward her daughter and she was certain he did she meant to find out everything there was to find out about him everyones curious about mr macgregors dealings its only natural why just the other day pat donahue told me youd bought some property of theirs in hyannis port i hope youre not thinking of leaving boston daniel didnt have to scent the air to know which way the wind blew im fond of boston deciding shed let him sweat long enough anna handed daniel her wrap grateful he was up like a shot and bundling her into it you children have a lovely evening mrs whitfield would have risen to walk them to the door but her husband put a hand on her shoulder good night mother anna kissed her mothers cheek then smiled up at her father shed never realized he was so perceptive with a smile she kissed him as well enjoy yourself in an old habit he patted her head daniel felt he could finally breathe again when they stepped outside your house is very crowded anna finished then laughed as she tucked her arm through his my mother likes to fill it up with whatever catches her eye i didnt realize until a few years ago how tolerant my father is pleased that hed brought the blue convertible she gathered her skirts and slid into her seat where are we going for dinner he took his own seat and let the engine roar were having dinner at home my home anna felt a quiver of nerves come and go using her best weapon will she eliminated the fluttering in her stomach she hadnt forgotten the feeling of control shed handle him i see im tired of restaurants im tired of crowds his voice was tense and tight why hes nervous she realized and felt a jolt of pleasure he towered over her even when sitting his voice had a timbre that could make the windowpanes rattle but he was nervous about spending an evening with her it wasnt easy but she tried hard not to be smug oh i had the impression you enjoyed being around a i lot of people she said very calmly i dont want a bunch of them staring at us while we eat amazing how rude some people can be isnt it and if i want to talk to you i dont need half of boston listening to me naturally not he fumed and turned into his driveway and if youre worried about propriety i have servants she sent him a bland look im not worried in the least not sure how to take it he narrowed his eyes she was playing games with him of that he was sure he just wasnt sure of what kind or of the rules youre mighty sure of yourself all at once anna daniel she reached for the door handle and let herself out ive always been sure of myself she decided with one sweeping look that she liked his house it was separated from the road by a line of hedges that came to her shoulder the privacy they provided wasnt as cold or impersonal as a wall but it was just as sturdy as she looked at the tall windows some of which were already softly lit behind curtains she could smell the mixture of scents from the side garden sweet peas she recognized and smiled she had a weakness for them hed chosen an imposing house large enough for a family of ten but he hadnt forgotten to make it a home with something as simple as flowers she waited until hed joined her on the edge of the walkway why did you choose it he looked at the house with her he saw the brick attractively faded with age the windows with their shutters freshly painted there was no sense of kinship only of ownership after all someone else had built it as he drew in the evening air he didnt smell the sweet peas but her because it was big she smiled at that and turned to watch a sparrow on a branch of a maple in the front yard i suppose thats reasonable you looked uncomfortable in my mothers parlor as if you thought if you turned around you might knock down a wall this suits you better for the moment he murmured he had other plans you can watch the sunset from those windows he pointed then took her arm to lead her up the walk you wont for very many more years why progress theyre going to toss buildings up and block out the sky not everywhere but enough im breaking ground on one myself next month opening the door he drew her into the hall and waited the swords crossed on the wall to her left drew her eyes first they werent the delicate almost feminine foils used in duels by lacecuffed swashbucklers they were thick heavy deadly broadswords with undecorated hilts and dull wellused blades it would take two hands and a strong man to lift one it would take skill and brute strength to use one to attack or defend unable to resist anna walked closer she had no trouble imagining what one of them could do to flesh and bone still though she could term them lethal she couldnt term them ugly the swords are from my clan my ancestors used them there was pride in his voice and simplicity the macgregors were warriors always was it a challenge she heard from him it might have been anna stepped closer to the swords the edges of the blades werent dulled but as treacherous as ever most of us are arent we her response surprised him but perhaps it shouldnt have he knew she wasnt a woman to shudder and faint over a weapon or spilled blood the english king he nearly spat it and had annas full attention he took our name our land but he couldnt take our pride we hacked off heads when we had to his eyes were deep blue and brilliant when he looked at her she had no doubt he would wield the sword with a ferocity equal to that of his ancestors if he felt justified mostly the heads of campbells he grinned at that and took her arm they thought to wipe us out of scotland but they couldnt she found herself wondering how hed look in the clothes of his country the kilt the plaid the dirk not ridiculous but dramatic anna looked back up at the swords no im sure they couldnt youve good reason to be proud his hand moved up to her cheek and lingered anna mr macgregor mcgee stood still as a stone as daniel whirled on him there was a look in daniels eyes that would have made a strong man shudder aye in the one word daniel conveyed a thousand pungent curses a call from new york sir a mr liebowitz says its quite important show miss whitfield into the parlor mcgee im sorry anna i have to take this ill be as quick as i can its all right relieved shed have a few moments alone anna watched daniel stride down the hall this way miss she noticed the brogue which was heavier than daniels and smiled hed keep his own around him when he could with a last glance at the swords she followed mcgees ramrod back into the parlor it made her mothers look like a closet if big was what daniel wanted big was what he had would you care for a drink miss whitfield distracted anna turned blankly im sorry would you care for a drink oh no thank you im fine he gave her the smallest and staunchest of bows please ring if you require anything thank you she said again anxious to be rid of him the minute she was alone she turned a slow circle big yes much bigger than the average room unless she missed her guess hed had walls removed and combined two into one the unusual size was complemented by unusual furnishings there was a belker table twice the size of the wheel of a car carved so ornately that the edges looked like lace a highbacked chair done in rich red velvet sat beside it he could hold court in it she thought and smiled at the idea why not rather than sit anna simply wandered the colors were flashy and bold but somehow she felt perfectly comfortable with them maybe shed lived with her mothers pastels long enough a sofa took up nearly an entire wall and would have required four strong men to move it with a laugh she decided daniel had chosen it for exactly that reason along the west window was a collection of crystal waterford baccarat a vase two feet high caught the beginnings of the sunset and danced with it anna picked up a bowl that fit into the palm of her hand and wondered what it was doing there among the giants he found her like that standing in the western light smiling at a small piece of glass his mouth went dry though he said nothing could say nothing she turned toward him what a wonderful room enthusiasm added color to her cheeks deepened her eyes i imagine in the winter with a fire it would be spectacular when he didnt speak her smile faded she took a step closer the telephone was it bad news what your call has it upset you hed forgotten it just as hed forgotten everything it didnt sit well with him that a look from her could tie his tongue and his stomach up in knots no ill have to go into new york for a couple of days and straighten out a few things including himself he thought ruefully i have something for you i hope its dinner she said smiling again well have that too it occurred to him that hed never felt awkward around a woman until now drawing a box out of his pocket he handed it to her there was a moment of panic he had no business offering her a ring then as common sense took over panic faded the box wasnt the small velvet sort that held engagement rings but an old cardboard one curious anna opened the lid the cameo was nearly as long as her thumb and perhaps twice as wide old and lovely it sat in a little bed of tissue paper the profile was gentle and serene but the head was tilted up with just a touch of pride as well it favors you daniel murmured i told you once your grandmothers she remembered touched she lifted a finger to trace the outline its beautiful really beautiful it was more difficult than it should have been to close the lid again daniel you know i cant take this no i dont taking the box from her he opened it again and drew out the cameo which hed attached to a velvet ribbon himself ill put it on for you she could almost feel his fingers brush the nape of her neck i shouldnt take a gift from you he lifted a brow you cant tell me you worry about gossip anna if you concerned yourself with what people said or thought you wouldnt be going to your school in connecticut he was right of course but she tried to stand firm its an heirloom daniel it wouldnt be right its my heirloom and im tired of having it shut in a box my grandmother would want it to be worn by someone whod appreciate it in a surprisingly smooth manner he slid the ribbon around her neck and fastened it it fit into the subtle hollow of her throat as if it had been destined to rest there there now thats where it belongs unable to resist she reached up to touch it common sense slipped away thank you well say im keeping it for you if you want it back dont spoil it he interrupted and took her chin in his hand ive wanted to see you wear it she couldnt stop the smile and you always get what you want exactly pleased with himself he rubbed a thumb over her cheek before he dropped his hand will you have a drink theres some sherry id rather not have a drink drink sherry is there another choice he felt his nervousness drop away ive some prime scotch sent smuggled if you want the truth from a friend of mine in edinburgh she wrinkled her nose it tastes like soap soap he looked so astonished that she laughed dont take it personally youll try it he told her as he went to the bar soap while he poured his voice dropped to a mutter this isnt the swill you get at one of your stiffnecked boston parties damn it the longer she knew him the more endearing he became anna found her hand had wandered to the cameo again she took a deep breath and reminded herself of the feeling of being at the wheel control when he handed her a glass she studied it it was very dark and she thought very likely to be as lethal as the swords on the wall ice dont be silly he tossed back his glass and challenged her anna took a deep breath and gulped some down warm potent and smooth frowning a bit she sipped again i stand corrected she told him but handed back the glass and if i drink all of it i wont stand at all then well get some food into you with a shake of her head she offered her hand if thats your way of saying its time for dinner i accept he took her hand and held it you wont get too many pretty words out of me anna im not polished i dont have any plans to be his hair flowed around his face untamed and magnificent the beard gave him the look of the warrior they both knew was in his blood no i dont think you should no he wasnt polished but he surrounded himself with beauty it wasnt the quiet sort anna had become used to but a bold bracing beauty that could grab you by the throat he had a shield and a pike on the wall of the dining room and below them was a chippendale breakfront any collector of fine antiques would have envied the table itself was massive but set on it was the loveliest china anna had ever seen she sat in a chair that would have suited a medieval castle and found herself completely relaxed the sun came in redgold slants through the windows as they ate the light softened and dimmed with silent efficiency mcgee came to light candles then left them again if i told my mother about this meal shed try to steal your cook anna took a bite of chocolate torte and understood the phrase sinfully rich it gave him a quiet sort of pleasure to watch her enjoy his food eat from the plates hed chosen himself you can see why i prefer this to a restaurant absolutely she took another bite because some things werent meant to be resisted im going to miss home cooking when i move into my apartment what about your own my own what cooking it doesnt exist studying him she took another bite your eyebrows come straight together when you frown daniel but dont worry i intend to learn my way around a kitchen selfpreservation linking her fingers she rested her chin on them i dont suppose you cook he started to laugh then thought better of it no she discovered she liked catching him off guard that way but naturally you find it odd that i as a woman dont know how it was difficult not to admire her logic even when he was on the wrong end of it youve a habit of boxing a man into a corner anna i enjoy the way you fight your way out i know this may be a dangerous boon to your ego but youre an interesting man ive a very big ego it takes a lot to fill it why dont you tell me how im interesting she smiled and rose another time perhaps he caught her hand as he stood there will be another time she didnt believe in lies and in evasions only when the truth didnt suit it seems there will mrs higgs talked of nothing but you today she said as they walked back toward the parlor lovely woman she had to grin he said it with such selfsatisfaction she expects you to come back i said i would he saw the question in her eyes and stopped i keep my word yes she smiled again you would its very good of you daniel she has no one uncomfortable he frowned dont put a halo on me anna i intend to win the bet but id as soon do it without false pretenses ive no intention of putting a halo on you she flicked the hair from her shoulder and ive no intention of losing the bet at the doorway to the parlor she stopped again there were candles dozens of them glowing throughout the room moonlight spilled in through the window to compete there was music quiet bluesy it seemed to come from the shadows anna felt her pulse race but continued into the room lovely she commented noting the silver coffee urn had been set up near the sofa as daniel went to pour brandy she stood looking completely at ease she wondered if her muscles could knot any tighter i like the way you look in candlelight he told her as he handed her a snifter it reminds me of the first night i met you when you stood on the terrace near the gardens there were moonbeams on your face shadows in your eyes when he took her hand he thought for a moment that it trembled but her eyes were so steady i knew then when i looked at you that i had to have you ive thought of you every day and every night since it would have been easy too easy to give in to the thoughts bursting in her head if she did she could feel his mouth on hers again and wait tingle for the touch of those big widepalmed hands on her skin it would have been easy but the life that shed already chosen or that had chosen her wasnt a man in your position must know how dangerous it is to make a decision on impulse no he lifted her hand and kissed her fingers slowly one by one the breath backed up in her lungs through sheer will she spoke calmly and she hoped carelessly daniel are you trying to seduce me when would he ever how would he ever get used to that quiet voice and frank tongue after a half laugh he drank some brandy a man doesnt seduce the woman he intends to marry of course he does anna corrected and patted his back when he choked just the same as a man seduces women he doesnt intend to marry but im not going to marry you daniel she turned away to walk to the coffeepot then looked over her shoulder and im not going to be seduced coffee he didnt just love her he realized he very nearly adored her there were a great many things he found he wasnt certain of at that moment but he knew without a doubt he couldnt live without her aye he walked to her and took the cup maybe he was better off with something in his hands you cant tell me you dont want me anna her body was tingling he had only to touch her to feel her need her weakness she made herself look at him no i cant that doesnt change anything he set the coffee down untasted hed have preferred throwing it the hell it doesnt you came here tonight for dinner she reminded him calmly and because for some odd reason i enjoy your company there are some things i have to accept there are others i cant risk i can he reached out and cupped her neck gently though it was difficult to be gentle when he wanted to drag her to him and plunder he felt her quick move of resistance ignored it and pulled her closer i will when his mouth was on hers anna accepted one more thing inevitability shed known they couldnt be together without passion rising up yet shed come to him freely and on equal terms between them there was a fire raging that she could only bank for so long there would come a time she knew when nothing would stop it from consuming both of them she slid her arms up his back and stepped closer to the heat when he lowered her to the sofa she didnt protest but drew him closer just for a moment she promised herself hazily just for a moment shed have a taste of what it could be like his body was so firm against her she could sense the desperation sense it and despite all good judgment she reveled in it his mouth raced over her face her name was murmured again and again against her lips her throat she could taste the fire of brandy as his tongue met hers the scent of candlewax surrounded her with the music came a low pulsing beat that urged teased enticed he had to touch her he thought hed go mad if he couldnt have more then as he slid his hand over her felt the softness the race of her heart he knew hed never get enough his hands so wide so large passed over her with a tenderness that made her tremble when he heard his name in her shaky whisper he fought to keep himself from grabbing what he longed for he brought his mouth back and found hers warm willing and open desperate he fumbled with the buttons running down the front of her dress his hands were so large the buttons so small the blood began to pound in his head then he discovered to his delight that his dignified anna wore silk and lace next to her skin she arched when he found her arched and shuddered then strained for more he was taking her beyond the expected beyond the anticipated and into dreams large widepalmed hands continued to pass over her with incredible gentleness they stroked lingered tested unable to resist she let him guide her control no longer seemed essential ambitions became unimportant need there was only one for one mindless moment she gave herself to it there was a desperation in him that grew sharper each time his heart beat he knew what he wanted what he would want until the grave anna only anna her mouth was hot on his her body cool and slim the images that rushed through his mind were as dark and dangerous as any uncharted land she clung to him and seemed to give everything his head spun with it then she buried her face against his throat and went very still anna his voice was rough his hands still gentle i cant say this isnt what i want the tugofwar going on inside of her left her weak and frightened but i cant be sure it is she shuddered once then drew back he could see her face in the candlelight the skin pale the eyes dark beneath his hand her heartbeat was fast and steady i never expected to feel this way daniel i need to think desire burned inside him i can think for both of us she lifted her hands to his face before he could kiss her again thats what im afraid of shifting she sat up her dress was open nearly to her waist with her soft white skin exposed for the first time to a man but she felt no shame steadily she began to hook the buttons what is happening between us what could happen between us is the most important decision in my life i have to make it myself he took her by the arms its already been made part of her thought he was right part of her was terrified he was youre sure of what you want im not until i am i cant promise you anything the fingers that had been steady trembled before she could control them i may never be able to promise you anything you know when i hold you that its right can you tell me that when i touch you you dont feel that no i cant the more agitated he became the calmer she forced herself to be i cant and thats why i need time i need time because whatever decision i make has to be made with a clear head clear head furious aching with need he rose to stalk the room my head hasnt been clear since the first time i laid eyes on you she rose as well then whether you like it or not we both need time he picked up the brandy shed left unfinished and downed it times what you need anna he turned to her shed never seen him look fiercer more formidable a smart woman would guard her heart anna struggled to remember that ill be in new york for three days theres your time when i come back im coming for you i want your decision then her chin lifted exposing a slender elegant neck dignity covered her in a cool silent wave dont give me deadlines and ultimatums daniel three days he repeated and set down the snifter before he snapped it in two ill take you home chapter six contents prev next when three days turned into a week anna didnt know whether to be relieved or infuriated trying to be neither to simply go about her life as she always had wasnt possible hed given her a deadline then didnt even bother to show up to hear her decision which she admitted she hadnt made yet invariably whenever anna set her mind to a problem she solved it it was a matter of thinking through all the levels and establishing priorities there seemed to be too many levels in her relationship with daniel for her to deal with each or any one of them rationally on the one hand he was a rude boastful annoyance on the other he was fun he could be unbearably arrogant and unbearably sweet his rough edges would never be completely smoothed off his mind was admirably quick and clever he schemed he laughed at himself he was overbearing he was generous if she couldnt successfully analyze daniel how could she hope to analyze her feelings for him desire shed had very little experience with that feeling aside from her ambitions but she recognized it how would she recognize love and if she did what would she do about it the only thing anna became certain of during daniels absence was that she missed him she was certain of it because shed been so sure she wouldnt even give him a second thought she thought of little else but if she gave in if she threw caution to the winds and agreed to marry him what would happen to her dream she could marry him have his children dedicate her life to him and resent everything they built together because she would have divorced herself from her vocation that meant living half a life and anna didnt think she could do it if she refused him and went on with her plans would that mean half a life as well those were the questions that tormented her at night that nagged at her throughout the day those were the questions she found then rejected answers for so she made no decision knowing once it was made it would be final she forced herself to continue her routine to tone down speculation and questions she went to the theater with friends and attended parties during the day she threw herself into her work at the hospital with energy born of frustration habitually she visited mrs higgs first anna didnt need a degree to see that the woman was fading before seeing to all her other duties anna could spend as much time in as needed a week after shed last seen daniel making certain her smile was in place anna opened the door to mrs higgss room this time the shades were drawn and there were more shadows than light they seemed to be waiting anna saw mrs higgs was awake staring listlessly at the faded flowers on her table her eyes brightened when she saw anna im so glad you came i was just thinking of you of course i came anna set the magazines down instinct told her that pictures werent what mrs higgs needed today how else could i give you all the gossip about the party i went to last night on the pretext of tidying the sheets anna scanned the chart her heart sank the deterioration of the past five days was increasing but she was smiling as she took her seat beside the bed you know my friend myra anna was aware how much mrs higgs enjoyed stories about myras escapades last night she wore a strapless black dress cut two inches past discretion i thought some of the older ladies would faint and the men well lets just say myra didnt miss a dance mrs higgs laughed then caught her breath as pain sliced through anna was on her feet instantly lie still ill get the doctor no surprisingly strong the thin hand gripped hers no hell just give me another shot trying to soothe anna rubbed the frail hand as she took her pulse just for the pain mrs higgs you dont have to be in pain calmer mrs higgs settled back again id rather feel pain than nothing im all right now she managed a smile talking to you is much better than medicine did your daniel come back yet still monitoring her pulse anna sat again no it was so kind of him to visit me before he left for new york imagine his coming by here before he went to the airport the fact that he had was just one of the things that added to annas confusion he likes visiting you he told me hed said hed come again when he got back from new york she looked at the weekold roses she refused to let the nurses take away its so special to be young and in love anna felt a stab of pain herself did he love her hed chosen her he wanted her but love was a different matter she wished she had someone to talk to but myra had seemed so preoccupied lately and no one else would understand she could hardly pour her problems out on mrs higgs when shed come to comfort instead she grinned and patted her hand you must have been in love dozens of times at least falling in love thats the roller coaster the ups and downs the thrills being in love thats the carousel around and around with music playing but staying in love she sighed remembering thats the maze anna there are all the twists and turns and dead ends you have to keep going keep trusting i had such a short time with my husband and never tried the maze again what was he like your husband oh he was young and ambitious full of ideas his father had a grocery store and thomas wanted to expand it he was very clever if hed lived but that wasnt meant do you believe some things are meant anna she thought about her need to heal her studies she tried not to think of daniel yes yes i do thomas was meant to die young like a lovely flash fire still he packed so much into the short years i admire him more as i look back your daniel reminds me of him how that drive the kind you can see on their faces it tells you theyre going to do amazing things she smiled again fighting back another surge of pain theres a ruthlessness that means theyll do whatever is necessary to accomplish it and yet theres kindness very basic kindness the kind that made thomas give a handful of candy to a child who didnt have the money the kind that makes your daniel visit an old woman he doesnt know ive changed my will alarmed anna straightened mrs higgs oh dont fret she closed her eyes a moment willing her body to build back some strength i can see on your face youre worried ive tangled you up in it thomas left me a nest egg and i invested its given me a comfortable life i have no children no grandchildren its too late for regrets i need to give something back i need to be remembered she looked at anna again i talked to daniel about it to daniel disturbed anna leaned closer hes very smart just like thomas i told him what i wanted to do and he told me how it could be done ive had my lawyer set up a scholarship daniel agreed to let me name him executor so he can handle the details anna opened her mouth to brush the subject of death aside then realized she would be doing so only for herself what kind of scholarship for young women going into medicine pleased with the stunned look on annas face mrs higgs smiled i knew youd like it i thought about what i could do then i thought of you and of all the nurses here whove been so kind to me its a wonderful thing mrs higgs i could have died alone without anyone to sit and talk to me i was lucky she reached out and curled her fingers around annas hand because it was difficult to feel she tightened them anna felt barely any pressure anna dont make the same mistake i did by thinking you dont need anyone take love where its offered let it live with you dont be afraid of the maze no anna murmured i wont there was barely any pain now barely anything at all mrs higgs stared at the outline of light around the shades do you know what id do if i could start all over again anna what would you do id have it all the light was blurring but she managed to smile its so foolish to think you have to settle for pieces thomas would have known better exhausted she closed her eyes again stay with me a little while of course i will so she sat in the shadowed room keeping the frail hand in hers she listened to the sound of breathing and waited when it was over she fought back the surge of anger the wave of denial carefully anna rose and pressed a kiss to mrs higgss forehead i wont forget you calm controlled she walked down the corridor to mrs kellerman deluged by five new admissions the nurse gave her a brief glance were a bit rushed now miss whitfield she stood very straight when she spoke her voice held both authority and patience youll need to call the doctor for mrs higgs instantly alert mrs kellerman rose shes having pain no anna folded her hands not anymore understanding flickered in her eyes and anna thought for a moment regret thank you miss whitfield nurse bates call doctor liederman immediately five twentyone without waiting for an answer she went down the corridor herself anna followed her as far as the door and again waited moments later kellerman looked back miss whitfield you dont need to stay here now determined anna kept her hands folded and her eyes direct mrs higgs had no one compassion came through and for the first time respect stepping back from the bed kellerman put a hand on her arm please wait outside ill tell the doctor you want to speak to him thank you anna walked down the corridor to the little l that was the waiting room and sat as the minutes passed she grew calmer this was what she would face she reminded herself day after day for the rest of her life this was the first time her stomach knotted and unknotted but not the last death would become an intimate part of her life something to be fought something to be faced starting now this minute she would have to learn to defend herself against it on a deep breath she closed her eyes when she opened them again she saw daniel walking toward her for a moment her mind went blank then she saw the roses in his hand tears welled up brimmed and were controlled when she rose her legs were steady i thought id find you here everything about him was aggressive his walk his face his voice she thought only briefly of the luxury of throwing herself into his arms and weeping im here every day that wouldnt change now more than ever she knew she couldnt let it it took longer than i thought to work things out in new york and hed spent his nights restless and wakeful thinking of her he started to speak again in the same tough nononsense tone but something in her eyes stopped him whats wrong he only had to see her glance at the roses to know damn with a whispered oath he let them fall to his side was she alone that he would ask that first that he would think of that first made her reach out her hand to him no i was with her thats good then her hand was icy in his let me take you home no if he were too kind her composure would never hold up i want to speak with her doctor he started to object then slipped an arm around her shoulders ill wait with you in silence they sat together the scent of the roses flowed over her they were young buds very fresh still moist part of a cycle she reminded herself it wasnt possible to appreciate life unless you understood accepted the cycle anna rose very slowly when the doctor joined them miss whitfield mrs higgs spoke of you to me many times youre a medical student thats right he nodded reserving judgment youre aware that we removed a tumor a malignant one some weeks ago there was another if we had operated again it would have killed her our only choice was to make her as comfortable as possible i understand she understood too that one day shed have to make such decisions herself mrs higgs had no family i want to make the funeral arrangements her composure surprised him as much as her statement studying her face he decided if she made it through medical school hed be interested in having her intern under him im sure that can be easily done well have mrs higgss attorney contact you thank you she offered her hand lieberman found it cool but firm yes hed like to watch her train were leaving daniel told her when they were alone i havent finished my shift and you wont today taking her by the arm he led her to the elevator youre allowed to let yourself breathe dont argue he said anticipating her lets just say youre humoring me theres something i want to show you she could have argued just knowing she had the strength to do so made her relent shed go with him because she knew shed come back tomorrow and do whatever needed to be done ill have my driver take us to my house he told her as they stepped outside well want my car i have mine daniel only lifted a brow and nodded wait a minute walking to the rolls he dismissed steven well use yours do you feel like driving yes yes i do she walked to the little white convertible very nice anna but then ive always admired your taste where are we going north ill direct you content to drive to feel the wind and know no destination she headed out of town for a time he left her to her own thoughts shedding tears doesnt make you weak no she sighed and watched the sun slant across the road i cant yet not yet tell me about new york a mad place i like it he grinned and threw his arm over the seat its not a place to live not for me but the excitement can get into your blood you know dunripple publishing yes of course now its dunripple and macgregor hed been satisfied with the way the deal had swung or more accurately the way hed pushed it prestigious prestigious be damned he told her they needed new blood and cold cash what did you need to diversify i dont like bundling all my interests together she frowned a bit thinking how do you know what to buy old companies losing ground new companies breaking it the first gives me something to fix the second something to he hesitated unsure of what word would suit explore he said finally but you cant be sure all the companies you buy will make it all of them wont thats the game sounds like a vicious one maybe its life he studied her her face was still a bit too pale her eyes a bit too calm a doctor knows all his patients wont make it it doesnt stop him from taking a new one he understood she should have expected it no it doesnt we all take risks anna if were really alive she drove mostly in silence following daniels directions thoughts rushed in and out of her head feelings tossed freely inside of her it was a long quiet drive and should have calmed her by the time they drove along the coast she was tight with nervous energy spotting a little store daniel gave a wave of his hand stop in here agreeable anna pulled into the gravel lot beside it is this what you wanted to show me no but youre going to get hungry she pressed a hand on her stomach before she opened the door i think i already am thinking theyd hardly do better than a box of crackers anna followed him inside it was a crowded little hodgepodge of a store with canned goods lined on shelves dry goods packed in doorless cupboards a freshly waxed floor shone back at her a fan creaked in slow circles swirling the heat mr macgregor with obvious pleasure a round woman eased herself from a stool behind the counter ah mrs lowe pretty as ever she had a face like a horse and knew it she greeted the flattery with a loud guffaw what can i do for you today she gave anna an unconcealed survey grinned and showed a missing incisor the lady and i need the makings of a picnic he leaned over the counter tell me you have some of that mouthwatering roast beef you gave me last time not an ounce she winked at him but i have some ham thatll make you roll your eyes and thank your maker all charm he took her pudgy hand and kissed it ill roll my eyes and thank you mrs lowe ill make a sandwich for the lady and two for you the look she gave him was as shrewd as it was friendly ill throw in a thermos of lemonade if you buy the thermos done with a cackle she made her way into a back room youve been here before anna said dryly now and again quite a little place he knew the lowes ran it themselves and kept it stocked and spotless im thinking if they added themselves another room put in a counter and a grill mrs lowe could make herself famous with her sandwiches she saw the look in his eyes and smiled lowe and macgregor with a laugh he leaned on the counter no sometimes its best to be a silent partner when mrs lowe came back she carried a huge wicket basket have your picnic and bring the basket back its not new she winked again but the thermos is daniel took out his wallet and pulled out bills enough to make annas eyebrow lift my best to your husband mrs lowe the bills disappeared into some handy pocket you and the lady have a good time we will toting the basket daniel swung through the door do you trust me to drive anna already had the keys in her hands she hadnt allowed anyone behind the wheel but herself though her father had hinted and myra had nagged hesitating only a moment she handed them to him moments later they were driving straight up shed never seen a road so narrow so winding the view over the side took her breath away with its sheer cliffs there was color among the endless gray touches of red hints of green in places it seemed as though the rock had been hewn away with a broadax in others hacked at with a pick waves crashed free against rock then washed back only to crash again there was violence here she thought an endless war that was also a cycle with the smell of the sea around her she leaned back mile after mile they climbed trees that dotted the sides of the road grew slanted leaning away from the constant wind anna wondered what daniel would do if another car came down the road toward them it didnt worry her she watched a sea bird skim over the surface of the water below then soar up toward the sun when the road leveled again she was almost disappointed then she saw the stretch of land ahead overgrown rocky desolate it spread out to the very edge of the cliff something shot into her sharp as an arrow sweet as a kiss recognition daniel stopped the car and stood absorbing everything as it always did the wildness of it drew him he could feel the sea feel the wind he was home saying nothing anna stepped from the car she was buffeted by the turbulence there but she could also sense the peace whether it was in the air of the land itself she knew this sense of constant movement and inner stillness would always remain this is your land she murmured when he stood beside her aye the wind blew her hair into her face but she pushed it back impatient she wanted to see clearly its beautiful she said it so simply that he couldnt speak until that moment he hadnt realized just how desperately he wanted her to accept it to understand it more he hadnt known how important it was to him that she love it as he had from the first moment hed seen it the sun beat down on his face as he brought her hand to his lips the house will go there he pointed and began to walk with her near the cliff so youll hear the sea almost be part of it itll be made of stone tons of it so itll rise up and hold its own some of the windows will come nearly to the ceiling and the front door will be as wide as three men here he stopped gauging the position with his eyes there will be a tower towers almost hypnotized anna looked up at him you make it sound like a castle thats right a castle the macgregor seal will stand above the door she tried to imagine it and shook her head she found it both exciting and incomprehensible why so much itll last my greatgrandchildren will know it leaving her he walked back to the car for the basket unable to judge his mood or her own anna helped spread the blanket mrs lowe had provided besides the sandwiches there was a bowl of wellspiced potato salad and two thick slices of cake with her skirt flowing over her knees anna sat crosslegged and ate while she watched the clouds so much was happening so fast and yet it seemed her life was suspended in some kind of limbo she no longer knew what shed find if she turned right if she turned left the path that had once seemed so clear to her had taken on some odd curves she couldnt see around them because daniel was quiet she kept her silence aware he was no more comfortable than she in scotland he began as if talking to himself we lived in a little cottage no bigger than the garage on your house i was five maybe six when my mother took sick after shed delivered my brother she was never really well again my grandmother would come every day to cook and help tend the baby id sit with my mother talk to her i didnt realize then how young she was anna sat with her hands in her lap and her eyes intense a few weeks before she would have listened politely if he had spoken of his past now it seemed half her world hinged on what he would say go on please it wasnt easy for him nor had he planned to speak of it now that hed begun he discovered hed needed to tell her all along my father would come home from the mines his skin black his eyes red god how tired he must have been but he sat with my mother played with the baby listened to me she hung on nearly five years and when i was ten she just slipped away she was suffering the whole time but she never complained anna thought of mrs higgs this time she let the tears fall daniel said nothing for a moment but listened to the sea my grandmother came to live with us tough old bird she made me tow the line study in books when i was twelve i went to work in the mines but i could read and write and work with figures better than the grown men i was as big as some of them already he laughed at that and flexed his hand into a fist more than once hed been grateful for it the mines were hell dust in your lungs in your eyes every time the earth shook you waited to die and hoped itd be quick i was about fifteen when mcbride who owned the mine took notice of me he found out i was clever with numbers so he used to have me come in and do a bit of figuring for him in his way he was a fair man so i was paid for the extra work within a year i was out of the mines and doing his books my hands were clean as soon as id started working my father had me put half my earnings in a tin jar we could have used the money day to day but he wouldnt have it even when i was making more in the office he made me put half the money aside in that jar it was the same with my brother alan he wanted you to get out anna murmured aye he had a dream for me and alan to get out of the mines away from everything hed had to live with he turned to her his eyes hot and angry i was twenty when the main shaft caved in we dug for three days three nights twenty men were gone my father and my brother with them oh daniel she reached out resting her head against his shoulder it was more than grief she could feel the fury the resentments the guilt im sorry when we buried them i swore it wasnt the end it was the beginning id make enough to get out by the time i did it was too late to take my grandmother shed lived a long time and only asked me one thing before she died that i see the line go on that i not forget where wed come from im keeping that promise anna he turned her so shed look at him for her for me with every stone that goes into this house she understood him now perhaps too well for her own good she understood that there on the windswept cliff in the middle of the barren land hed chosen shed finally irreversibly fallen in love with him but with understanding came only more questions rising she walked toward the plot of land where he envisioned his home hed build it she knew and it would be magnificent theyd be proud of you ill go back one day to see it all again to remember it all ill want you with me she turned and as she did wondered if shed been waiting to make that move all of her life perhaps it was the first step into the maze im afraid ill never be able to give you everything you want daniel im more afraid that ill try he stood and walked toward her there was still too much space between them when he stopped you told me you needed time i asked you to make a decision now im asking you what it is anna stood poised on the edge of everything chapter seven contents prev next she wanted to give him everything he asked to give him things hed never even dreamed of she wanted to take everything she could grab and hold on to in that moment she understood what taking just one step forward could mean to both of them she wondered if he did one step forward would irrevocably change their lives even if a step back could somehow be taken later one step and there would be no altering what was said what was done or what was given anna believed in destiny destiny met with eyes open and mind clear though common sense fought to remain in charge her heart slowly willfully took command what was love in that moment she understood only that it was a force larger stronger than the logic she had always lived by love had started wars toppled empires driven men mad and turned women into fools she could reason for hours but she would never diminish the power of that one allencompassing force they stood on the cliffs with the wind roaring against the rocks moaning through the high grass beating against the land hed chosen to fulfill a dream and a promise if daniel was her destiny she would meet him head on he looked fiercer than ever almost frightening with his eyes burning into hers and the sun fiery at his back zeus thor he might have been either but he was flesh and blood a man who understood destiny and would break mountains to achieve the one he had chosen hed chosen her she took her time determined to make her decision with a clear head but the emotions boiling inside her werent calm how could she look at him read the need in his eyes and be calm hed spoken of family of promises of a future she wasnt sure she could share with him but there was something she could share now something she could give and give only once leading with her heart anna stepped forward and into his arms they came together like thunder urgent tempestuous strong her mouth met his with all the chaotic longing shed held down she felt the power soar the fire spread fast and out of control there was only here there was only now his hands were in her hair his fingers raking desperately through it so that the combs she wore fell unheeded to the ground his mouth was restless and urgent rushing over her face meeting her lips then moving on as if it were vital that he taste everything at once she heard her name come low and vibrant then tasted it herself as he murmured against her mouth even as she pressed strongly against him she felt the give of her own body the incredible fluid yielding only a woman can experience her mind leaped forward with the pleasure of discovering the magic of submission when mixed with demand then her thoughts scattered leaving only one she was where she wanted to be together they lowered themselves to the grass wrapped so tightly that even the wind couldnt come between them like lovers separated for years they rushed together with no holding back no hesitation eager to feel the delight of flesh against flesh she tugged on his shirt muscles hed earned while still a boy corded his arms rippled over his back aroused by the sheer strength of him she allowed her hands free play and learned the spiraling joy of having a man her man groan at her touch he wanted her here now exclusively she could feel it with every beat of her own pulse until that moment she hadnt realized just how important it had been to her to be sure of it whatever else he wanted from her whatever plans hed scrupulously made were tossed to oblivion by one overpowering force desire it was pure it was desperate it was theirs hed wanted to be careful to be gentle but she was driving him beyond anything hed experienced fantasies dreams paled foolishly beside reality she was much more than a goal to be won or a woman to be wooed her hands were slim and strong and curious her mouth warm and insistent the need that pounded through him concentrated at the base of his neck so that the sound of it roared through his brain leaving him deaf to the crash of the waves far below he could smell the wild grass as he buried his lips at her throat but her scent subtle quiet was more pervasive she was so small so heartbreakingly soft that he fought to keep his worktoughened hands easy as he undressed her but she arched against each touch wantonly demanding more he couldnt resist her nor could he resist any longer the pressure building inside him racing against passion he yanked the rest of her clothes aside and gave himself to need her skin was pale as milk under the hot summer sun her body as trim and efficient as her mind no other woman no dream had ever aroused him more with a sound that rumbled deep in his throat he met her gasp of astonished pleasure there was more she had thought it impossible but everywhere his lips tarried brought her fresh bursts of unspeakable delight should she have known a man and a woman could share something so dark so sultry under a full sun could she have known that she always so selfdisciplined so rational would give herself to passion in a field of grass on a cliff top all she understood was that it didnt matter when it didnt matter where it was and would always be daniel her emotions seemed to race just ahead of reason she wanted to savor each new experience but before she could absorb one another tumbled down on her layering all into a mass of sensations impossible to separate with a breathless laugh she realized it wasnt necessary to understand each one but simply to feel there was no fear in her as desire began to peak but a wild anticipation the blood pounded in his veins swam in his head until he thought hed explode from it her body burned with the same fire as his she moved to the same throbbing music but she was innocent he knew even as he ached to take her with fury and speed that control was vital her arms clutched him her hips thrust up in uninhibited offering and the fear of harming something so precious snaked through him he struggled to catch his breath when she reached for him anna i want you her murmur was like thunder in his ear i need you daniel in hearing it sweet pain spread through him in saying it she felt glorious i wont hurt you he lifted his head to see her lips curve her eyes cloud no you wont hurt me he called on all his strength of will as he slipped into her she was so warm so moist that his head nearly burst with a new flood of emotion hed had women before but not like this hed given himself to passion before never never like this she felt him enter her pierce her fill her her innocence was gone in a heartbeat with a pleasure so vast that all pain was smothered power it swept over her like the wind like the thunder eclipsing that first surge of wonder drunk with it she gripped him tighter she heard him call her name before his mouth fastened on hers they hurled aside control and took each other he knew about the cat that swallowed the canary as he lay on the wild grass with anna at his side daniel felt like a cat whod feasted on a bakers dozen the contentment that had somehow always skidded just out of his reach settled through him with a sleepy sigh hed chosen a lovely intelligent woman to marry it was a logical choice for a man who intended to build an empire that would last for generations wasnt it lucky hed fallen in love and discovered she was also caring sweet and passionate his wifetobe the mother of his yettobeborn children fit him like a glove he decided it paid to be lucky as well as shrewd she was quiet beside him but he knew from the easy way she breathed the content way her hand rested in his that she was lost in thoughts not in regrets her head was nestled in the crook of his shoulder so naturally that he could have sworn theyd lain just like this before grass soft at their backs the sky clear and blue above cloud watchers he thought children would toss themselves on the ground to find images and dreams in the clouds hed never had much time for it as a boy with anna he could make time and he wouldnt have to look for dreams he could have lain there for hours with the surf and the wind and the sun he had his woman his land and it was only the beginning but he knew of course that they had to leave for the city soon what he wanted with her and for her couldnt be accomplished in an empty field but he kept his arm around her and lingered while dozens of plans formed and shifted in his head theres more than enough room for us in the house he said half to himself with his eyes nearly closed and the quiet glow of loving still lingering he could picture her there shed add the touches he too often forgot bowls of flowers music of course you might want to change some things flounce it up some she watched the way the sun played through leaves shed just taken the step forward it was already time for the step back your house is fine the way it is daniel aye well its only temporary he stroked his fingers through her hair while he looked at the plot where he would build his dream their dream now how much sweeter it was now that he had someone to share it with when this ones finished well sell the one in boston or maybe well keep it for business ill be cutting down on my traveling once i have a wife overhead clouds moved slowly too lofty to be persuaded by the wind that rustled the grass travelings important to your business for now she felt his shoulder move under her head in a careless shrug before long theyll come to me and theyll come here i dont intend to marry then spend my time away from my wife her hand rested lightly on his chest she wondered if he knew how smugly he used the phrase my wife a man might use the same tone to describe his shiny new car im not going to marry you daniel ill still have to fly into new york now and again but you can go with me i said im not going to marry you with a laugh he pulled her up until she lay half across him her skin was warm from sun and loving what do you mean youre not going to marry me of course you are no she laid a hand on his face her touch was as soft as her eyes im not how can you say that now he had her by the shoulders panic was his first reaction as he recognized the calm patient look part of his success was the ability to turn panic to anger and anger to determination its not the time for games no its not calm she shifted away and began to dress torn between puzzlement and fury he grabbed her wrists before she could slip into her blouse weve just made love you came to me i came to you freely she returned we needed each other and were going to go on needing each other thats why youre going to marry me she tried to let out her breath slowly soundlessly i cant why in hell not her stomach muscles were beginning to quiver her skin was chilled under the bright summer sun she wanted him to release her but knew hed ignore any resistance suddenly she wanted to run to run faster than she ever had instead she remained still you want me to marry you start a family pick up and go whenever and wherever your business or whims take you she had to swallow because she knew she spoke the truth to do that id have to give up something ive wanted almost as long as i can remember i wont do it daniel not even for you this is nonsense to prove it he gave her a brisk shake if the damn degree is so important go on and get it then you can study just as easily married to me no easing away she busied her hands with her clothes she wouldnt be bullied and she wouldnt be charmed though he seemed to be an expert on both if i went back to school as mrs daniel macgregor id never finish youd stop me even if you didnt mean to damn it thats ridiculous he stood naked and glorious with the sun at his back for a moment anna wanted to open her arms and invite him back to her to agree with anything he said purposefully she stood its not and im going to earn my degree daniel i have to so youre choosing your doctoring over me hurt angry he didnt care if his words were unfair he saw the one thing that would make his life whole make it real slipping away i want you both she swallowed how could she judge his reaction when she still wasnt sure of her own i wont marry you she repeated but ill live with you his eyes narrowed into slits youll what ill live with you in your house in boston until september after that we could get an apartment off campus and then and then what his words shot out like sand from under a tire she lifted her hands then let them fall then i dont know her head was thrown back in pride so that the wind tossed her hair but her face was very pale her eyes unsure he loved her to the point of madness and his anger was nearly as great damn you anna i want you for a wife not for a mistress the doubts cleared from her eyes to be replaced by a fury to match his own no longer pale her skin glowed with indignation and im not offering to be one turning on her heel she started back to the car he grabbed her by the arm and whirled her around so quickly that her feet nearly slid out from under her what the hell are you offering then to live with you it wasnt often she shouted but when she did she gave it everything if he hadnt been so angry there would have been room for respect not be kept by you i dont want your money or your big house or your dozen roses a day its you i want god knows why then marry me still naked still raging he dragged her against him do you think you can have anything you want just by yelling louder just by being stronger she shoved him away and stood small and slim and stunning ill give you only so much and no more he dragged both hands through his hair how was a man to deal with such a woman if you wont think of your reputation i have to she lifted a brow you have to do nothing but think of your own in the regal manner she could assume so effortlessly she let her gaze drift over him you dont seem very concerned about it now in one furious move he swept up his pants another man might have looked foolish daniel looked magnificent a few minutes ago i seduced you he began dont delude yourself cool and confident she picked up his shut a few minutes ago we made love it had nothing to do with seduction he took the shirt from her and slipped it on youre tougher than you look anna whitfield thats right pleased with herself she started to gather up the picnic things you told me once to take you as you are now im telling you the same if you want me daniel it has to be on my terms think about it she left him halfdressed and walked to the car they barely spoke on the long drive back anna was no longer angry but drained so much had happened in a short span of time and none of it had been in her carefully worked out plans she needed time to think to evaluate and to recharge daniel was electric he didnt have to speak for her to read his temper the hell with his temper she thought recklessly let him be angry it was something he did well not everyone looked magnificent when he ranted and raged his mistress her own temper began to sizzle but she waited for it to subside shed be no mans mistress anna told herself as she settled back and folded her arms and no mans wife until she was ready she would though the thought still made her pulse skittish be one mans lover in her own quiet fashion she was as determined as daniel to have her way live with him daniel gripped the wheel tightly as he took a turn faster than a rational man would have dared he was offering her half of everything he had half of everything he was most importantly he was offering her his name and she was tossing it back in his face did she think he would have taken her innocence if he hadnt believed they were committed to each other what kind of woman would refuse an honest proposal and opt to run off like a renegade child thumbing her nose at what was proper he wanted a wife damn it a family she wanted a piece of paper that said she could poke needles into people he should have taken her advice from the beginning anna whitfield was the last woman in boston who would make him a suitable wife so he would forget about her hed drop her at her door say a cool goodbye and drive away but he could still taste her still feel the way her skin had slid under his fingers still smell the scent of her hair as it had floated around her body and his i wont have it with a squeal of brakes he stopped at the curb in front of her house a few yards away annas mother clipped roses at the explosion she looked up and nervously gripped her shears the fact that a quick glance showed her none of her neighbors were about relieved her only a little as daniel gunned the convertibles engine that anna said with perfect calm is your privilege now you listen to me turning slightly daniel gripped her by both shoulders he didnt want to argue he didnt want to fight the moment those patient brown eyes met his he wanted to drag her against him and make love with her until they were both too exhausted to speak anna lifted a brow im listening he groped for what needed to be said what happened between us doesnt happen with everyone i know she smiled a little ill have to take your word for that frustration boiled thats part of the problem he mumbled and ordered himself to be as calm as she i want to marry you anna in the rose bushes mrs whitfield dropped her shears with a quiet thump ive wanted to marry you from the first minute i saw you thats part of the problem because most of her heart was already his anna lifted both hands to his face you wanted what was suitable and decided i was it you want me to fit a slot in your life perhaps i could but i wont its more than that now much more as he dragged her closer she saw the flare of desire in his eyes then tasted it on his lips without hesitation without artifice anna met his greed with her own yes it was more than that now perhaps more than either of them could deal with when they were together like this everything else faded into insignificance thats what frightened her thats what exhilarated her desperately he pushed her away again you see what we have together what we could have yes her voice wasnt as steady now but her determination hadnt wavered and i want it i want you but not marriage i want you to share my name and i want to share your heart first youre not thinking clearly neither was he cautious he dropped his hands from her shoulders you need a little time no i dont before he could stop her she slipped from the car but its obvious you do goodbye daniel mrs whitfield watched her daughter stride easily toward the house moments later she watched daniel drive recklessly down the street then remembering whose car he was driving he ground the gears into reverse and backed up as recklessly as hed gone forward he slammed the door shot a ferocious look at the house and stamped away in the opposite direction hand to her heart she dashed up the walk and through the front door anna fluttering her hands she caught her daughter at the base of the staircase whats going on anna wanted to be alone she wanted to go to her room shut the door and lie on the bed there was so much to absorb so much to savor she needed to weep and wasnt even sure why patient she waited going on i was clipping the roses flustered mrs whitfield shook her halffilled basket and i heard well i couldnt help but hear she let her words trail off unnerved by annas calm brown eyes which suddenly seemed so mature to give herself a minute mrs whitfield carefully pulled off her gardening gloves and laid them on a table i understand you werent eavesdropping mother of course not i wouldnt dream she caught herself sliding away from the point and straightened her shoulders anna are you and mr macgregor did you the sentence wandered away as she shifted her hands on the basket yes with a private smile anna stepped from the landing we made love this afternoon oh it was a feeble response but the only one she could come up with mother anna took the basket from her hands im not a child any longer obviously with a deep breath mrs whitfield faced her duty however if mr macgregor has seduced you then he didnt having revved herself up mrs whitfield could only blink at the interruption but you said i said we made love he didnt have to seduce me anna took her mother by the arm maybe we should sit down yes shaky she let herself be led maybe we should in the parlor anna sat beside her mother on the sofa how should she begin never in her wildest dreams had she imagined sitting with her mother in this fussy parlor and discussing romance love and sex taking a deep breath she plunged mother id never been with a man before i wanted to be with daniel it wasnt something i did impetuously but something i gave a great deal of thought to ive always said you think too much mrs whitfield responded automatically im sorry used to parental criticism anna laid her hands quietly in her lap i know its not something you want to hear but i cant lie to you love propriety and confusion warred together love won oh anna in a rare gesture mrs whitfield gathered anna close are you all right of course i am touched anna let her head rest against her mothers shoulder i feel wonderful its like i dont know being unlocked yes she blinked back tears thats how it should be i know weve never really talked of such things we should have but then you went off to that school and those books she remembered her shock when she had picked one up to give it a casual glance i suppose it all made me feel inadequate its nothing like books anna discovered she could savor it after all no its not she shifted to take both her daughters hands books can be closed anna i dont want you to be hurt daniel wont hurt me she was warmed even now remembering how gentle hed struggled to be in fact hes much too concerned about not hurting me he wants me to marry him mrs whitfield breathed a sigh of relief i thought i heard him say so but you sounded as though you were fighting not fighting disagreeing im not going to marry him anna when her mother drew away her face was stern what kind of nonsense is this i admit i dont always understand you but i know you well enough to be sure nothing would have happened between the two of you if you hadnt cared very deeply i do losing some of her composure anna pressed her fingers to her eyes maybe too much its frightening he wants a wife mother almost the way a man wants a shoe that fits well thats just their way on firmer ground mrs whitfield sat back some men are poets some are dreamers but most are just men i know girls think there should be pretty words and lovely music but life is much more basic than that curious anna studied her her mother she knew from experience had never been much of a philosopher did you want pretty words of course with a smile mrs whitfield thought of her past your father is a good man a very good man but most of his words come out of law books i think mr macgregors a good man he is i dont want to lose him but i cant marry him anna im going to live with him mrs whitfield opened her mouth shut it again and swallowed i think id like a drink rising anna walked to the liquor cabinet sherry scotch a double tension dissolved in amusement as anna poured daniel had a very similar reaction she handed her mother the glass and watched her gulp it down ive never hidden anything from you the scotch burned through her system no no youve always been painfully honest i care very much for daniel honest anna reminded herself and let out a long breath im in love with him that isnt something i chose so now i feel as though i have to take back some control if i marry him ill lose everything ive been working for mrs whitfield set down the empty glass your degree i know you dont understand that either no one seems to she ran her hands through her hair it fell loose to her shoulders and made her remember that her combs still lay where they had fallen in the grass the combs didnt matter they could be replaced other things had been lost on that cliff top that couldnt what i know in my heart is that if i marry daniel now ill never finish and if i dont ill never forgive myself or him mother ive tried to explain to you before that being a doctor isnt simply what i want to do its what i have to do sometimes we have to weigh one important thing against another anna and choose and sometimes we dont desperate for reassurance she knelt at her mothers feet i know its selfish to want it all but ive thought it through over and over i have to be a doctor and i dont want to live without daniel and daniel he wants marriage he cant see beyond that but he will always so sure of yourself anna she recognized the look in her daughters eyes calm clear and filled with ruthless determination she nearly sighed you would never ask for anything and i was fooled into thinking you were absolutely content then all at once you would demand everything i didnt choose to be a doctor any more than i chose to fall in love with daniel both things just are anna a step like this can bring you a lot of pain a lot of unhappiness if you love daniel then marriage it isnt time and i cant be sure it ever will be frustrated she rose and paced the room im terrified to make that kind of mistake for him as well as for myself all i know is that now right now i dont want to be without him maybe its wrong but would it be better would it be right if we continued to be lovers in secret can you tell me it would be more acceptable if we stole a few hours here and there a night an afternoon i could never tell you anything her mother murmured oh please more frightened than she wanted to admit anna went to her mother again now more than ever i want your understanding its not just desire though thats certainly part of it its a need to be with him to share some of his dreams because im not sure ill be able to share them all to love him in secret would be hypocrisy he means too much for that i wont hide what i feel i wont hide what i am mrs whitfield looked at her only child at her dark earnest eyes her soft sculpted mouth she wished she had the answers you know what youll be up against what people will say that doesnt matter to me it never has her mother muttered i know how impossible it is to talk you out of anything once your minds made up and youre too old for me to forbid anything but anna you cant ask me to approve i know for a moment she laid her head in her mothers lap but if somewhere inside you if in some little part you could understand it would be enough sighing she touched her daughters hand i havent forgotten what it is to be in love maybe i do understand and maybe thats why im afraid for you anna youve never been anything but a good daughter but she had to smile just a little but youve also always been a puzzle i know ive never actually told you i was proud of you but i am anna felt a little quiver of relief work through her i know i never actually told you i needed you to be proud but i do i have to admit that i always hoped that youd forget about medicine and settle down into a marriage where i could see you happy and yet another part of me has watched you and cheered her fingers curled around her mothers i dont know how to tell you how much that means to me i think i know now your father she closed her eyes unable to even imagine his reaction hell be upset i know im sorry ill handle him the words came out on impulse but she discovered they were true mrs whitfield straightened her shoulders with a smile anna rifted her head for a moment for the first time she and her mother looked at each other woman to woman i love you mother and i love you she drew her up on the sofa i dont have to understand you for that with a sigh anna laid her head on her mothers shoulder is it too much to ask for you to wish me luck as a mother yes she found herself smiling but not as a woman chapter eight contents prev next as the days passed anna began to fear that shed lost there were no phone calls no irate visits no white roses were delivered to the door the ones still cluttering her room and her mothers parlor were a testimony to what might have been and they were wilting more and more often she caught herself looking out the window at the sound of a car passing dashing to the phone on the first ring each time she did so she swore at herself and promised not to do it again but of course she did she never left the hospital without scanning the lot for the blue convertible each time she stepped out of the wide white building she expected to see a big broadshouldered redbearded man waiting impatiently by the curb he was never there but she never stopped looking it was disconcerting to learn that shed come to depend on him but it was even more disconcerting to discover what shed come to depend on him for happiness she could be content without him she could certainly be satisfied with her life and her career but anna was no longer sure she could be happy unless daniel was a part of her daytoday life one day as she read aloud to a young patient with a broken leg her mind wandered to her annoyance she had caught herself daydreaming several times during working hours since daniel had driven away from her house lecturing herself she brought her attention back to the patient and the story like sand her thoughts scattered again the happyeverafter tale she spun to the sleepy little girl wasnt reality certainly the last thing anna wanted was to sit quietly by and wait for a prince to fit her with a glass slipper and of course she was too practical to believe in castles in the clouds or magic until midnight it was nice perhaps in a story to dream about white chargers and heroes but a woman wanted more in real life in real life a woman wanted well a partner anna supposed not a knight or a prince who would always have to be looked up to and admired a real woman wanted a real man and a smart one wasnt going to sit around in a tower and wait for one to come along she was going to live her own life and make her own choices anna had always been a firm believer in the making of ones own destiny of fighting with logic and patience for ones needs so why was she waiting around she asked herself abruptly if she was as independent as she professed and as she intended to behave then why was she mooning around and waiting for the phone to ring anyone who sat placidly by until someone else called the shots was a fool and a loser she didnt intend to be either her mind made up anna continued to read until the little girls eyes closed shutting the book she strode out into the hall on the way down she passed a frazzled heavyeyed intern and nearly smiled at the moment she was certain he wouldnt understand her twinge of envy perhaps no one would but another med student still in a few months she wouldnt be able to leave the hospital on her own whim it wouldnt hurt to take advantage of the time she had left outside the weather was nasty it was gray and stormy and so hot that the rain seemed to steam the moment it hit the concrete by the time she made it to her car she was humming and soaked to the skin she drove across town with the radio turned up as high as her spirits the building that housed old line savings and loan was dignified staid and trustworthy as she raced across the little patch of lawn anna wondered if daniel had made any changes inside there was fresh paint and new carpeting but business was still transacted in hushed whispers anna ran a hand through her hair scattering water then headed for the nearest clerk she crossed her fingers behind her back upstairs daniel looked over the ads that would run in the paper the following week his manager had cringed when hed brought in the files but the young assistant daniel had hired had been enthusiastic some decisions were meant to be made on instinct instinct told daniel that the ads would increase both his business and his reputation and one was every bit as important as the other he was not only going to put old line back on its feet he would have a branch in salem within two years even as the idea germinated his thoughts drifted away from business he remembered a windy cliff top and a woman with sable hair and dark eyes the thrill that rippled through him was as fresh as it had been when his arms had been around her her taste was a lingering sensation nothing else had been able to replace even here in the privacy of his office he could smell her quiet and sweet with an impatient mutter he pushed the papers aside and strode to the window he should be seeing other women hadnt he sworn he would when hed driven away from anna hed meant to even started to but each and every time he tried to so much as think of another woman anna was there she was so firmly planted in his mind that there wasnt room for anyone else he wasnt going to get over her daniel stared out at the steadily driving rain from the window the boston he looked at seemed gray and depressed it suited his mood after he was finished with his stacks of paperwork and meetings hed take a walk along the river fair weather or foul he needed to be alone away from servants employees but not away from anna he could follow the charles from end to end and never escape anna how could you escape what was in your blood in your bone and anna was there no matter how he tried to pretend he had a choice anna was there he wanted to marry her daniel whirled away from the window to pace the room with his hands thrust in his pockets and his brows lowered hed chosen anger over despair and fury over fear damn the woman he thought yet again he wanted to marry her he wanted to wake up in the morning and know she was there he wanted to come home at night and be able to reach for her he wanted to see his child grow inside her and he wanted these things with a desperation as foreign to him as failure failure the word alone had him clenching his teeth he was far from ready to admit failure the hell with other women daniel decided abruptly there was only one he was going after her when the phone on his desk rang he was halfway to the door cursing all the way he went back to yank it up macgregor mr macgregor this is mary miles head cashier i apologize for interrupting you but theres a young woman down in the lobby who insists on seeing you have her make an appointment with my secretary yes sir i suggested that but she insists on seeing you now she says shell wait i dont have time to see everyone who walks in off the street mrs miles daniel checked his watch anna would be out of the hospital hed have to catch her at home yes sir the cashier felt herself being squeezed between two ungiving forces i explained that to her but shes very insistent shes very polite mr macgregor but i dont think shes going to budge losing patience daniel swore again tell her his voice trailed off as the cashiers words formed a picture in his mind whats her name whitfield anna whitfield what have you got her waiting in the lobby for he demanded send her up the cashier rolled her eyes and reminded herself of the raise mr macgregor had given across the board when hed bought the bank yes sir right away shed changed her mind victory didnt settle over him he soared with it his patience though it had cost him dearly had paid off she was ready to be sensible true he hadnt imagined discussing marriage in his office but he was willing to make some concessions the plain truth was he was willing to make a great many concessions but she was coming to him he would have everything he wanted including his pride the knock on his door was brisk and businesslike before his secretary pushed it open miss whitfield to see you sir he briefly nodded a dismissal before his gaze and every thought in his head focused on anna she stood on the thick gray carpet hed recently had installed dripping from head to foot the rain had washed her face clean and left her hair dark and shiny and curling to her shoulders she quite simply took his breath away youre wet his words came out sounding more like an accusation than a statement of concern she met it with a smile its raining good god it was good to see him for a moment she could only smile foolishly and take him in his tie was off his collar open his hair showed evidence of being combed impatiently with his fingers she wanted to open her arms and take him to her where she was beginning to understand he belonged instead she continued to smile and drip quietly on his elegant carpet while she smiled he stared for several humming seconds neither of them spoke catching himself daniel cleared his throat and scowled at her seems to me anybody studying medicine should know better than to run around soaking wet he pulled open the door to a cabinet and took out a bottle of brandy youll find yourself spending more time in that hospital of yours than youd like i dont think a little summer shower should do me much harm for the first time it occurred to her how she must look with her hair dripping and tangled her clothes splattered with rain and her shoes damp she kept her chin up wet or not she had her dignity drink this anyway he thrust a snifter into her hand sit no ill ruin sit he repeated in one terse bark lifting a brow she walked to a chair very well she sat but he didnt the sweet taste of victory had already faded he knew just by looking at her that she hadnt changed her mind not anna the truth was he never would have fallen so helplessly in love with a woman whose mind could be swayed she hadnt come to accept his offer of marriage and he was far from ready to accept her alternative his lips curved a bit his eyes took on a light that those accustomed to doing business with him would have recognized and been wary of stand off daniel told himself but there was no way he would let miss anna whitfield know she had him on edge he let his gaze run down her once more as she sat ruining the upholstery of his chair interested in a loan anna she sipped and let the brandy calm her sudden nervousness the easy tone and slight smile didnt fool her for an instant so he was still angry what else should she have expected would she have fallen in love with a man who could be too easily cajoled no shed fallen in love with daniel because he was precisely what he was not at the moment to give herself time she studied the room your office is very nice daniel dignified but not stuffy there was a bold abstract on the wall done in different tones and shades of blue though it seemed to be no more than random shapes and lines the sense of sexuality was throbbingly clear she shifted her gaze from it to his definitely not stuffy hed seen her study the abstract and knew she understood it hed paid a stiff price for the picasso because it had appealed to him and because his instincts had told him the value would skyrocket within a generation youre a hard woman to shock anna thats true and because it was she found herself relaxing ive always felt life was too important to go through it pretending to be offended by it ive missed the roses he leaned a hip against the corner of his massive desk i thought you didnt like me sending them to you i didnt until you stopped she left it at that deciding that even she was entitled to some quirks i hadnt heard from you in several days and i wondered if id shocked you shocked me a few moments before hed wavered between tension and boredom with anna here everything seemed settled into place again im not one to shock easily either offended then she suggested because id choose to live with you rather than marry you he nearly smiled had he once said he liked a woman to speak her mind to a point it didnt seem odd at all that his opinion on that had already changed radically annoyed he corrected we might even go to infuriated she remembered his reaction yes i think we might youre still angry aye youre still set in your mind yes thoughtfully he drew out a cigar running his fingers over it once before lighting it in business he knew how to handle an opponent force him to make the pitch it kept a man in the drivers seat when the other player had to do the explaining smoke wreathed over his head as he watched her and waited why did you come here anna so he didnt intend to give an inch she took another slow sip of brandy all right then neither would she because i realized i didnt want to go another day without seeing you she set the brandy aside as the haze of his smoke billowed then cleared do you mind he let out an impatient huff of breath business and personal matters didnt always have the same rules still the aim was to win its hard for a man to mind the woman he intends to marry wanting to be with him good she rose then and made a vain attempt to tidy her damp skirts then youll have dinner with me to night his eyes narrowed a man usually likes to do the asking she sighed and gave a little shake of her head as she walked to him youre forgetting what century youre in again ill pick you up at seven youll pick you up at seven she finished then rose to her toes when she found his lips with hers it was soft and easy and completely right thanks for the brandy daniel i wont keep you any longer he found his voice by the time shed walked to the door anna she turned a half smile on her lips yes he saw in the smile that she expected even anticipated an argument change tactics and confuse daniel thought and easily drew on his cigar itll have to be seventhirty i have a late meeting he had the satisfaction of seeing a quick flicker of doubt cross her face before she nodded fine when she shut the door at her back she let out a long pentup breath by his desk daniel grinned chuckled and ultimately roared with laughter though he wasnt sure whod gotten the best of whom he discovered it didnt matter hed always been one to try a new game new rules hed give anna the cards and the deal but by god hed still win the rain had slowed to a drizzle by the time anna arrived home she found the house empty but the scent of her mothers perfume still lingered in the hallway pleased to find herself alone she went upstairs to indulge in a long hot bath it was a good feeling she discovered to have taken the initiative once again she was in control though her foundation was a bit shakier than it could have been daniel macgregor was not a man who could be manipulated shed learned that right from the beginning but she did believe he was a man who would respond to negotiation her main problem would be to keep him from seeing just how much shed give everything she closed her eyes as she squeezed the sponge and dripped hot water over her throat and breasts if he discovered that if pressed into a corner shed give him anything he wanted hed press her there without hesitation a man like daniel hadnt made it to the top by being a pushover but she intended to make it to the top in her own profession as well so she had to be equally strong equally determined after she picked him up theyd have a quiet dinner easy conversation over coffee theyd discuss rationally their situation before it was over he would understand her feelings and her position anna sank down in the waters with a sigh who was she trying to fool that didnt sound like dinner with daniel macgregor for a minute theyd spar with each other argue disagree and probably laugh a great deal hed very likely shout it was entirely possible shed shout as well when it was over she doubted hed understand anything except that he wanted her to marry him something fluttered inside her at the thought he did want her she might have gone through her entire life without anyone looking at her in just the way daniel did she might have gone through her life without anyone opening those sturdy locks shed kept on her passion what would her life have been like then bland she smiled at the word that sprang to mind she certainly wouldnt settle for that now she wanted daniel macgregor and she was going to have him keeping her selfconfidence at a peak was half the battle she realized as she stepped from the tub it was so easy for it to slip away degree by degree while he looked at her she wouldnt allow it to happen tonight with a towel wrapped around her hair she bundled into a robe she was taking him to dinner whatever slight edge that gave her she wouldnt lose it opening her closet she frowned usually she knew precisely what best suited an evening she had planned tonight everything she pulled out seemed too fussy too plain or simply too ordinary calling herself a fool she grabbed a seafoamgreen silk and laid it on her bed perhaps it was almost severely simple but that was very possibly the best idea for the evening if she wanted something dashing she mused she should have raided myras closet as the thought came and went she heard the doorbell chime she found herself grumbling at the interruption something so out of character that she lectured herself all the way downstairs as she opened the door myra dashed inside and grabbed both her hands oh anna im so glad youre home myra i was just thinking about you by the time the words were out she noticed the death grip on her fingers whats wrong i have to talk to you for perhaps the first time in her life myra found herself almost beyond words alone are your parents in no good i need a drink first offer me a brandy all right amused anna began to lead her to the parlor terrific hat is it myra lifted a worried hand to the offwhite cap and veil its not too fussy too fussy anna poured her a double brandy let me get this straight youre asking me if something youre wearing is too fussy dont be cute anna turning to a mirror myra toyed with the veil maybe i should pull out the feather anna glanced at the saucy little feather curling over myras ear now i know somethings wrong how about the dress myra slipped out of a vivid red raincoat to reveal a trim silk suit with lace at the collar and cuffs its exquisite is it new its twenty minutes old anna sat on the arm of a chair while her friend gulped down brandy you didnt have to dress up for me myra let out a quick breath and straightened her shoulders before she set the empty snifter down this is no time for jokes i can see that but she smiled anyway what is it time for how soon can you toss on something wonderful and pack an overnight bag pack she watched as myra fingered the lace at her throat myra whats going on im getting married she said it in a rush then let out a small explosion of breath because her legs were unsteady she dropped onto the sofa getting married stunned anna sat exactly where she was myra i know you work fast and i havent seen much of you in a couple of weeks but married it wouldnt hurt to say it a few times so id stop losing my breath every time i hear the word ive already babbled to the clerk in the dress shop and i dont want to do that again if theres one thing i refuse to do its make a fool of myself married anna repeated for both of them to whom as myra fastened and unfastened the top button of her jacket anna groped for a candidate peter who no no of course not of course not anna murmured i know jack holmes dont be ridiculous steven marlowe myra fiddled with the hem of her skirt anna really i hardly know the man hardly know him why six months ago you that was six months ago myra interrupted blushing for the first time since anna had known her and id appreciate it if youd forget anything id ever written you about him better yet burn those letters darling they selfdestructed the moment i read them you should have used fireproof paper despite herself myra grinned youre speaking to an engaged woman ive put all that behind me look breathy with excitement myra held out her left hand oh she was usually very casual about jewelry herself but the simple squarecut diamond on myras finger seemed impossibly beautiful its exquisite really exquisite myra im so happy for you she was up and gathering myra close for a hug before she laughed how do i know im happy for you i dont know who youre going to marry herbert ditmeyer myra waited for the look of astonishment and wasnt disappointed i know i was pretty damn surprised myself but i didnt think you even that is you always said he was catching herself anna cleared her throat stuffy myra finished and smiled beautifully and he is hes stuffy and rather sober and frustratingly proper hes also the sweetest man ive ever known these past couple of weeks she sat back a little dreamy a little stunned i never knew what it could be like to have a man treat you as though you were special really special i went out with him the first time because hed had such a hard time asking me and i felt sorry for him and flattered she admitted i went out with him the second time because id had such a good time herbert can be so funny it kind of sneaks up on you touched anna watched love bloom in myras eyes i know you were always such a good friend to him im lucky he didnt fall in love with you the thing is hes been in love with me for years with a little shake of her head she pulled a cigarette from her purse wed been going out for a couple of weeks when he told me i was so stunned i could hardly speak then i tried to ease myself out gently after all he was very sweet and i didnt want to hurt him anna lifted the ringed hand again it doesnt appear you eased yourself out no still dazed myra stared at the diamond winking up at her it occurred to me all at once that i didnt want to ease myself out that i was crazy about him isnt that wild i think its wonderful me too she stubbed out the cigarette without having taken the first puff and tonight tonight he put this ring on my finger told me we were flying to maryland at eight and getting married tonight anna took myras hand again tonight its so quick myra why wait why wait indeed she could think of hundreds of reasons but none of them would have gotten past that dreamy look in myras eyes are you sure im more sure about this than ive ever been about anything in my life be happy for me anna i am tears swam in her eyes as she held myra again you know i am then get dressed half laughing half crying myra pushed her away youre my maid of honor you want me to fly to maryland tonight we agreed to elope because it was simpler than dealing with his mother she doesnt like me and probably never will oh myra it doesnt matter herbert and i love each other anyway i dont want a big fancy wedding it takes too long but i dont want to be married without my best friend there i really need you anna i want this more than anything in the world and im scared to death any objections she might have had disappeared i can be dressed and packed in twenty minutes grinning myra gave her a last hug because its you i believe it just let me leave a note for my parents she already had the pen in her hand ah anna myra ran her tongue over her teeth i know your sense of honesty wont let you lie exactly could you just not mention what youre going away for herbert and i really want to keep this quiet until we tell his mother anna thought a moment then began to write taking a short trip with myra may do some antique shopping which i may she added half to herself ill be home in a day or two she signed it and glanced up showing it to myra vague enough perfectly thanks come on give me a hand as she dashed into the hall she remembered oh i have to call daniel and cancel dinner daniel macgregor myras brows arched as only they could thats right ignoring the look anna headed for the phone ill have to let him know i cant make it tonight you can have dinner with him in maryland myra took the receiver from her and replaced it herberts asking him to be best man i see anna brushed a hand casually down her robe well thats handy isnt it very with a grin myra pulled her upstairs chapter nine contents prev next shed never flown before at twenty anna had sailed to europe in luxury and comfort shed traveled hundreds of miles on trains lulled by the swaying motion and watching the landscape whiz by but shed never been in the air if anyone had told her shed be climbing into a small private plane that looked as though it could land safely in her backyard shed have thought them mad love she thought as she set her teeth and took the last step inside if she didnt love myra shed turn around and run for her life she was certain the tin can with propellers could get off the ground she wished she felt as confident about how it would get down again quite a machine isnt it daniel watched anna take her seat before he settled in his own quite she muttered and wondered if it came with parachutes first flight she started to give him a stiff and dignified yes then saw he wasnt laughing at her yeah the word came out on a little breath try to think of it as an adventure he suggested she glanced at the ground outside the window and wished she were still standing on it im trying not to think of it at all youve more guts than that anna i should know then he grinned at her it should be an adventure the first time after a while flying becomes routine and you really dont think much about it she told herself to relax and used the old trick of starting her toes and working up she never got past her knees i guess youre used to it is this the sort of plane you fly to new york in with a chuckle he fastened her seat belt then his own this is the plane i fly to new york in i own it oh as his words sank in she found that the fact that it was daniels plane somehow made flying in it all right she glanced over to where myra and herbert were seated and strapped in heads together an adventure she decided shed enjoy one so when do we start theres a lass he murmured and signaled to the pilot the engine started with a roar and they were off though her anxiety had passed there was an air of both celebration and tension all through the flight anna saw the tension in myra as her friend twisted a lace handkerchief into knots as she laughed and talked herbert sat a little pale a little stiff and spoke only when prodded for herself anna heard the voices around her watched the landscape beneath her with a sense of unreality it was all happening so fast if it hadnt been for daniels easy jokes and constant banter the celebrational part of the flight might have dissolved into mild hysteria he was anna noted as he flirted outrageously with myra enjoying himself and while he was about it he was keeping the bridetobe from climbing the walls of the cabin he wasnt just an interesting man she realized he was a good friend pulling herself out of her thoughts anna made an effort to be as good you have excellent taste herbert what he swallowed and straightened his tie oh yes thank you then he looked at myra with his heart in his eyes shes wonderful isnt she the best i dont know what id have done without her life certainly would have been a great deal duller we seriousminded people need someone with a little sparkle in our lives dont we he gave anna a nervous smile otherwise wed just crawl into our careers and forget there was anything else out there serious minded she let the phrase play in her head yes she supposed she was in addition she was coming to understand that herbert was right and people with sparkle she murmured with a glance at myra and daniel need a seriousminded person in their lives to keep them from running off cliffs im going to make her happy because his words sounded more like a question than a statement anna took his hands oh yes youre going to make her very happy the small private plane touched down in a rural airport in maryland the lingering drizzle had been left behind here the lateevening sky was as clear as glass and crowded with stars the sliver of moon was like a smile it might have been a wedding night chosen on impulse but it was perfect taking myra by the arm herbert led the way to the little terminal the justice of the peace who was recommended to me is only about twenty miles from here ill check about getting a cab or a car that wont be necessary when they entered the terminal daniel quickly scanned it then signaled to a tall uniformed chauffeur mr macgregor aye give him the directions he told herbert i took the liberty of arranging for transportation without fuss the chauffeur gathered the suitcases and led the way outside at the curb was a pearlgray stretch limo you didnt give a body much time to come up with a wedding present daniel explained this was the best i could do its perfect with a laugh myra swung her arms around him absolutely perfect daniel winked at herbert over her head the best mans supposed to handle the details anna waited until herbert had helped myra inside this was very sweet of you im a sweet man he told her she laughed and accepted his hand maybe i wouldnt depend on it inside myra already had her arm linked through herberts two bottles of champagne one for before daniel lifted one from its bucket of ice one for after he let out a cork with a hiss and a pop then poured four glasses to happiness four glasses clinked solemnly together but when daniel drank he looked at anna as the champagne exploded in her mouth she realized the adventure was far from over by the time they arrived at the little white house all the champagne and the lingering tension had been drained with her usual aplomb myra tidied her hair and makeup in a powder room off the hall while anna stood by and held her hat she took her time but anna noted that her hands were steady how do i look myra demanded and managed a quick turn in the cramped room beautiful ive always been a couple of degrees away from beautiful but tonight i think ive nearly managed stunning hands firm anna turned her toward the mirror again tonight youre beautiful take a good look looking at their reflections together myra grinned he really loves me anna i know she slipped her arm around myras shoulder youre going to make quite a team yes we are as her chin tilted up her grin softened into a smile i dont think he realizes just how much of a team yet but he will on a quick breath she turned and took anna by the shoulders i dont like to get sentimental but since i only intend to get married once this seems to be the time youre my best friend and i love you i want you to be as happy as i am this minute im working on it satisfied myra nodded okay then lets go and listen she put her hand on the knob and paused if i stutter dont tell anyone especially catherine donahue solemn eyed anna put a hand over her heart i wont tell a soul in a parlor with a tiny marble fireplace and summer flowers in glass vases anna watched her closest friend promise to love honor and cherish when her eyes misted she felt foolish and tried to blink them clear it was silly to cry over two adults making a legal contract with each other marriage was after all a contract that was why it had to be approached so cautiously so practically but the first tear escaped and ran slowly down her cheek she felt daniel press his handkerchief into her hand as hed done once before even as she sniffed into it the ceremony was over and she found herself hugging a dazed myra i did it myra murmured then laughed and gave anna a ribcrushing squeeze and without one single stutter i did it she repeated and held out her hand snuggled next to the diamond was a slim gold band engaged and married within five hours daniel took the hand she was admiring and kissed it formally mrs ditmeyer chuckling myra curled her fingers around his be sure to call me that several times this evening so ill learn to answer to it oh anna im going to cry and destroy my mascara its all right anna handed her daniels already crumpled handkerchief herberts stuck with you now anna wound her arms around him and held tight he laughed and gave anna a long hard squeeze and shes stuck with me shell complicate your life i know isnt it wonderful anna kissed him hard i dont know about you but im starving the wedding supper is on me through the recommendation of the justice of the peace and the help of the chauffeur they found a country inn at the peak of a wooded hill it was as theyd been told small quaint and possibly closed with a little persuasion and the exchange of a few bills they persuaded the owner to open the restaurant and wake up the cook while the others were led into the dining room anna made an excuse about freshening up and slipped aside moments later she waylaid the owner again mr portersfield i cant thank you enough foraccommodating us though he was always glad to receive paying guests the lateness of the hour had put him a bit out of sorts he found it difficult however to resist the smile anna sent him my doors are always open he told her unfortunately the kitchen closes at nine so the meal may not quite live up to our reputation im sure everything will be wonderful as a matter of fact i can almost promise that my friends will tell you its the best meal theyve ever eaten you see linking her arm through his she strolled a little farther away from the others they were just married a half hour ago thats why you and i have to arrange a few things newlyweds mr portersfield wasnt a man completely without romance were always pleased to have newlyweds at the inn if wed had just a bit of notice oh im sure the few things we need wont be too much bother did i mention that mr ditmeyer is the district attorney in boston im sure when he gets back from his honeymoon with his new bride hes going to praise your inn to all his friends and mr macgregor she lowered her voice well i dont have to tell you who he is he didnt have the vaguest idea but implied importance was enough no of course not a man in his position doesnt often find a quiet place like this to relax home cooking country air i can assure you hes very impressed by your establishment tell me mr portersfield do you have a record player a record player i have one in my room but perfect anna patted his hand and tried the smile again i knew youd be able to help me fifteen minutes later she was back in the dining room at the table was a loaf of crusty bread a pot of butter and little else whered you disappear to daniel asked as she took her seat details to the bride and groom she said and lifted her water glass as they toasted myra laughed and i was just about to say to herbert that he can look forward to many meals just like this she indicated the bread and water until we get a cook he took her hand and brought it to his lips i didnt marry you for your culinary prowess a good thing anna said then added she hasnt any a sleepy boy of about fifteen came into the room with a vase of wildflowers a look at the dew on the petals told anna theyd just been picked it looked as if mr portersfield was going to come through oh how pretty myra reached to pluck one out as the boy wandered away and began to pull tables across the floor loudly mr portersfield shuffled into the room lugging a phonograph within moments there was music the first dance for the herbert ditmeyers anna stated and gestured to the space the boy had cleared on the floor when they were alone at the table daniel buttered a chunk of bread and handed it to her you accomplished quite a lot in a short time hungry anna bit into the bread just the beginning mr macgregor you know when you asked me to dinner tonight i had no idea wed be having it in a country inn in maryland anna broke off another hunk of bread buttered it and handed it to him id intended to keep things a bit closer to home myself they look happy she glanced over to see myra and herbert smiling at each other as they moved around the tiny cleared space yes they do funny i never pictured them together now that i see them it seems so perfect contrasts he took his palm and pressed it against hers his was wide and hard hers narrow and soft they make life more interesting ive come to believe it she linked fingers with him lately with a smile that spread from ear to ear mr portersfield brought over a tray of salad youll enjoy this he told them as he served everything straight from our own garden the dressing is an old family recipe after setting down the salad bowls he fussed briefly with the flowers and then was off again he certainly looks more cheerful daniel commented and so he should anna murmured thinking just how much shed paid to put a smile on his face daniel thoughtfully she stabbed her fork into the salad about that loan you mentioned this afternoon she took her first bite of the salad and found it as good as advertised i might want to take you up on it just until we get back to boston daniel glanced over in time to see portersfield heading into the kitchen then looked back to see annas eyes dark with humor hed never needed anyone to add two and two for him on a roar of laughter he took her face in his hands and kissed her interest free for you love there was champagne the only two bottles to be had at the inn there was pot roast that melted on the fork and a scratchy billie holiday record when daniel took myra to the impromptu dance floor she didnt waste time beating around the bush youre in love with anna because he saw no reason to deny it he ignored her bluntness aye what do you intend to do about it he looked down in the comfort of his beard his lips twitched i could say that was none of your business you could myra agreed but i intend to find out anyway after a moments thought he decided it was best to have her on his side id have married her tonight but shes too damn stubborn or smart myra smiled when she saw the heat flash in his eyes oh i like you daniel i did right away but i know a steamroller when i see one like recognizes like exactly pleased rather than insulted myra matched her steps to his annas going to be a doctor probably the best surgeon in the country he scowled down at her what would you know about doctors i know about anna she said easily and i think i know enough about men to guess that that doesnt suit you very well i want a wife he muttered not a knife wielder i imagine youd have more respect for a surgeon if you needed your appendix out i wouldnt want my wife to do the cutting if you want anna youd better be prepared to take her career have you asked her to marry you youre nosy of course have you american women he thought would he ever acclimatize i did and she says she wont marry me but shell live with me that sounds sensible daniel drew her hand down so they both could see the ring gleam on myras ringer oh thats entirely different i love herbert very much but i wouldnt have married him unless i was certain he accepted me for what i am which is nosy meddling flamboyant and ambitious her gaze drifted toward the table im going to make him a hell of a wife daniel looked down at her her eyes might have been dewy with love but her chin was set i believe you will daniel had just pulled back myras chair when portersfield wheeled up a cart with a small layer cake with frothy white icing and pink rosebuds with considerable charm he handed myra a silver flatedged knife with the compliments of the inn he told her knowing he could afford to be generous our best wishes to both of you for a long and happy marriage thank you finding herself near tears myra waited until herbert wrapped his fingers around hers on the handle anna waited until the champagne was empty and the cake little more than crumbs one more thing she took a key from her purse and gave it to herbert the bridal suite he slipped it into his pocket with a grin i didnt think a little place like this would have one it didnt until a couple of hours ago she accepted the hugs then watched the newlyweds walk away together i like your style anna whitfield do you buoyed by success and champagne she smiled at him with her eyes on his she reached in her purse again i have another key daniel glanced down to the single key in her palm you tend to take matters in your own hands lifting a brow she rose if it doesnt suit you you can wake porterfield up again im sure he can find you another room he stood took her wrist and plucked the key from her hand thisll do with her hand in his they left the remains of the wedding supper behind they didnt speak as they climbed the stairs which creaked slightly under their weight there was a light at the top to guide them shielded in beveled glass and dim all the doors they passed were closed the inn so recently disturbed for a celebration was quiet when daniel unlocked the door to their room he smelled the spicy mix of potpourri it made him think of his grandmother of scotland of all hed left behind when anna closed the door behind them he thought of nothing but her still they didnt speak she turned the key on a little globed lamp by the door subtle light spilled into the room and pooled at their feet the windows were open to let in the warm summer air thin curtains stirred with it and just barely audible from the woods beyond came the melancholy song of a night bird she waited once on a cliff top shed gone to him now she needed him to turn to her her heart was already his though she feared to tell him her body would never belong to another but she waited touched by lamplight surrounded by summer air he thought shed never looked more lovely though he already had dozens of memories of her locked in his mind dozens of fantasies passion needs love dreams she was all of them his heart took the first step and he followed his hands cupped her face gently so gently that she could barely feel the pressure of his fingers on her skin still the touch rippled through her his eyes never left hers as he lowered his mouth the kiss was soft a bare meeting of lips a mingling of breath eyes open bodies close they explored the sensations evoked by the teasing and brushing of mouth against mouth the tangling and retreating of tongues he touched only her face she touched him not at all and yet in seconds two hearts were pounding how long they stood like that she couldnt be sure it might have been hours or only seconds while their needs built and twisted together into a desire that bordered on pain with a moan of delight she let her head fall back her arms came around him for an instant the kiss deepened toward delirium she felt her bones liquefy from her toes up until her body was a fluid mass of sensation reveling in it she went limp in his arms in unqualified surrender it nearly drove him mad to have anna strong and eager made his blood heat and his passion soar but to have anna soft and pliant was devastatingly arousing it made him weak it made him strong she seemed to seep into him degree by degree until there was no room for anything but her he drew back shaken by the intensity wary of the merging but she stood as she was head thrown back arms twined around him it was more than need he saw in her eyes more even than knowledge it was acceptance he waited his body pulsing until his mind was nearly clear again then he undressed her the thin almost transparent jacket she wore over her dress slid away like an illusion he let his hands roam up her arms over her shoulders and back again so that he could feel the skin the muscles the texture and as he lingered bewitched by the thrill of his flesh against hers she loosened his tie then tossed it aside slowly while her own blood heated to his touch she drew his jacket from his shoulders he was losing himself in her again but now it didnt seem to matter while the summer breeze sighed through the windows behind them he pulled down the zipper of her dress like the breeze it drifted to the floor she heard him catch his breath and felt a wild almost wanton pride in her own body while she stood he seemed to drink in the sight of her inch by inch her skin hummed as though his hands had stroked it the cameo he had given her nestled in the hollow of her throat he could trace it with his finger and feel her profile come to life the lacy fantasy she wore was caught snug at her breast and draped lazily at her thighs the lamplight threw her silhouette into relief and made him hunger for what he already had her fingers werent steady as she unbuttoned his shirt but her eyes never left his more from desire than confidence her palms stroked over him as his shirt joined her dress on the floor somewhere in the inn a clock rang out the hour but theyd long since forgotten such things as time and place in unspoken agreement they lowered themselves to the bed under their weight the old mattress creaked softly feather pillows yielded he braced himself above her needing to see her all of her he might have stayed like that for hours but she reached for him mouth against mouth heated impatient flesh to flesh trembling sensitive the lamplight cast their shadows on the wall the breeze carried off their sighs the night bird still sang plaintively in the woods they no longer heard the world they both knew so much of the world they both were so determined to discover had been whittled down to one room ambitions faded and died in the face of more desperate desires to give to take and to experience to possess and to be possessed he buried his face against her skin and no longer noticed the scent of spices and dried flowers that wafted through the room there was no fragrance but anna no taste but anna no voice but annas slowly but not so gently he took his mouth on a searing journey down her throat over the lace and silk clinging to her breasts need thundered in his blood as she strained against him with their hands caught tightly together he let his tongue lap at the subtle curve just above the lace with their legs tangled he let his teeth scrape lightly over her flesh when she called out his name he vowed to bring her the thrill and the glory of madness through the silk his lips pulled and tugged on her nipple until it was hard and hot in his mouth and her body was as taut as a bowstring he heard her breath tremble when he paused then heard it catch in her throat as he turned all his skill to her other breast just as slowly just as ruthlessly just as devastatingly he worked his way over her body touching off fires she hadnt known were there to be kindled with his tongue and widepalmed hands he took her again and again to the edge of release shed never known torture could be so glorious or pleasure so painful her skin was damp when he pulled the last barrier away from it she was caught in a haze of delights dark secret desperate delights the air was heavy and tasted of him as she drew in labored breaths everywhere he touched flames burned his beard brushed over the soft skin of her belly and set off an inferno of sensation her hands found his hair and stroked it as the lamplight turned even this to fire her mind spinning she locked her arms around his waist still riding a crest of sensation she rolled with him her hands seeking reaching finding she felt him quiver and pressed her mouth to his skin tasting desire before he could anticipate before he could prepare she slid down and took him into her sounds burst in her head perhaps it was her name on daniels lips chills coursed along her flesh they might have been his strong fingers caressing her as she threw her head back abandoned delighted she saw his eyes on hers the deep brilliant blue held its own fire hotter stronger than any other love clinging to it she took them both beyond reason sated and breathless she still held tight and with her eyes closed locked everything into her the scent of him the feel of his skin warmed from hers the sound of his breathing fast and harsh in her ear the look of his hand closed tight around hers it was here she wanted to stay and if the rest of the world and all other needs could be ignored she would if he were to ask now if he were even to demand now she was afraid she would give him all a hand moved down her back in one long stroke possession she trembled a bit and knew she could do little to prevent it whatever else she wanted whatever else she was she belonged to him her body was so small that it seemed almost weightless as she lay on him he could feel the slight trembles the aftershocks of passion he couldnt live without her he could wheel and deal and blithely slit the throat of a competitor but he couldnt function any longer without the small serious woman whose hand was still locked in his your way then damn it even as he cursed her he hooked an arm around her youll move in with me tomorrow grabbing a handful of hair he drew her head back her way but he wasnt giving in youll pack what you have when we get back to boston i wont spend another night without you unable to speak she stared at him there were dregs of desire in his eyes mixed with the fury just breaking how did she handle a man like daniel anna had a feeling it would take more than a few weeks to learn tomorrow thats right you move into my house tomorrow do you have anything to say about it she thought a moment then smiled youd better make room in your closet chapter ten contents prev next anna had her first tour of her new home under the guidance of a stiffbacked tightlipped mcgee she wondered which of them was more uncomfortable her bags had barely been carried upstairs when daniel had been called to the bank on urgent business hed left annoyed with a quick kiss of reassurance for her and an absentminded order to mcgee to show her around so she was there alone with a politely indignant butler and a cook who had yet to poke her head out of the kitchen her first reaction was to think of an excuse and go to the hospital where she belonged taking the afternoon off hadnt been anything she could afford to do any more than daniel could now he was gone and she was here something about the straight unyielding back of the man who led her up the stairs had her holding her ground for anna pride went hand in hand with dignity shed made her decision and if a butler happened to be the first to disapprove shed accept it more she was going to learn to live with it starting now we have several guest rooms on this floor mcgee told her in his low rolling brogue mr macgregor also keeps his office on this level as he finds it convenient i see mcgee tested a small tilttop table for dust as they went anna had a moment to reflect that it was fortunate for whoever was in charge of the dust department that mcgee didnt find any mr macgregor entertains outoftown business associates from time to time we keep two guest rooms prepared this is the master bedroom so saying he opened a thick handtooled door the room was large as daniel seemed to prefer but sparsely decorated as though he spent little time there she imagined his office would be cluttered with furniture and piled with papers more revealing of the inner man than his bedroom which should have been the more personal room there were no photographs no mementos the paint was new and the curtains stiff with starch she wondered if hed ever pushed them aside to look at the view the bed was big enough for four and of lovingly carved oak her bags sat neatly at the foot shed expected to feel odd walking into this intimate room for the first time she felt little but a sense of vague curiosity there was more of daniel macgregor on a cliff above the sea than there was in the room where he spent his nights but this wasnt the time to try to dissect a puzzle where she hadnt expected to find one her chin was lifted just a tad higher than usual when she turned back to mcgee mr macgregor wasnt clear on the housekeeping arrangements is that your responsibility if mcgee could have stiffened his already ramrodstraight back he would have a day maid comes in three times a week otherwise i oversee the housekeeping however mr macgregor informed both myself and the cook that you may wish changes if daniel had walked in the door at that moment anna would cheerfully have strangled him instead she took another deliberate study of the room i hardly think that will be necessary mcgee you seem to be not only a man who knows his job but his own worth her coolly delivered compliment didnt soften him a whit nor was it intended to thank you miss would you care to see the rest of the second floor not at the moment i think ill unpack and be alone she thought desperately very well miss with a bow he walked to the door if you need anything youve only to ring thank you mcgee i wont the moment he shut the door she sank down on the enormous bed what had she done every doubt shed been able to hide thrust aside or bury until that point came rushing out shed moved out of her childhood home not into her own pretty little apartment but into a big rambling house where she was a stranger a usurper and to the stifflipped mcgee obviously a jezebel if she hadnt had her own nerves to deal with that one point might have amused shed left a nervous mother and a stunned father and had come to a huge halfempty room she wasnt at the hospital where the hurdles she had to navigate were at least familiar if difficult nothing here belonged to her but what was in the bags at the foot of the bed slowly she ran her hand over the thick white bed cover now night after night she thought shed be sharing this bed with daniel sleeping with him waking with him thered be no more simple goodnights and a retreat into privacy hed be there within reach and so would she what had she done panic rose gamely anna swallowed it her hand still stroked the cover in a mirror on the far wall she saw herself small pale and wideeyed on the toobig bed she saw too the reflection of an oak chest of drawers clean lined and masculine her legs were a little shaky as she rose to walk to it her fingers seemed a bit numb as she slipped the lid from a bottle of cologne then she smelled him brash vivid and very male her world seemed to steady when she replaced the lid her hands were firm and competent again what had she done she asked herself for the last time exactly what shed wanted to do with a little laugh of relief she began to unpack it didnt take long to distribute her things throughout the room shed taken little more than clothes and a few favorite pictures from her room still after her things were tidied away she felt more at ease and somehow more at home of course they would have to see about getting a dresser to match the nineteenthcentury oak furniture daniel had chosen for the room the curtains would have to go in favor of something softer and more friendly pleased she glanced around again it had never occurred to her that she would get such a charge out of making a few basic domestic decisions perhaps it wasnt anything like deciding whether to operate or treat internally but it did bring a sense of satisfaction perhaps she could indeed have everything at the moment she thought she was going to start by cornering mcgee and going in search of a couple of comfortable chairs for the master bedroom and a good reading lamp she thought as she walked into the hall if possible shed add a small desk for herself the room was certainly big enough surely in a house this size they could find a few things that would suit if they couldnt shed simply do a bit of shopping after her shift at the hospital the next day once on the first floor she was tempted to poke into the parlor or library and do some shifting herself she held herself back for the simple reason that she understood pride if she were to take on the project herself it would surely damage mcgees she would find a way to tactfully change what she wanted changed without damaging his butlerly ego mcgee was part of daniels life if she were to make a success out of her decision she would have to see that he was a part of hers because she could think of no other logical place to find him she headed for the kitchen a few steps away from the door she heard the voices and paused if the lass is good enough for the macgregor shes good enough for me it was a feminine voice but as musically scottish as the butlers i see no reason for your griping mcgee i dont gripe even through the wood anna detected the cool indignation the girl has no business here without a marriage license pish posh with that chuckled exclamation anna decided she could like the cook very well since when are you judge and confessor id like to know the macgregor knows his mind and so id wager does the lass or he wouldnt give her the time of day its what she looks like that i want to know is she pretty pretty enough mcgee muttered at least she has the good sense not to flaunt herself flaunt herself the cook repeated even as anna indignantly mouthed the phrase a woman makes herself up for a man and shes flaunting herself she doesnt and she has good sense i dont know which is more of the insult now go on about your business and ill be about mine or ill be too busy to have a look at her before dinner anna was trying to decide whether to retreat or brazen it out when a cry of pain made her rush into the room mcgee was already bending over a plump whitehaired woman on the floor between them was a longhandled knife smeared with blood even as anna dashed toward them more blood was pooling at their feet let me see miss whitfield move abandoning propriety she shoved the butler aside it only took a glance to show her that a slip of the knife had gashed the cooks wrist and knicked an artery in an instant she pressed her fingers over it and stopped the pump of blood its nothing miss but tears were coursing down the womans face ill make a mess of you hush anna plucked up a dry dishcloth and tossed it at mcgee tear this into strips then go bring my car around used to responding to authority he began to rip still holding the cooks wrist anna led her to a chair just be calm she soothed blood the cook managed and went parchment white were going to take care of it anna continued to talk calmly knowing how difficult it would be to manage the big woman if she keeled over mcgee tie a strip on her arm just here she indicated where he should fasten the tourniquet while she continued to close the artery with her fingers all right now whats your name sally miss all right sally i want you just to close your eyes and relax not too tight she cautioned mcgee bring the car around quickly ill want you to drive yes miss at twice his normal gait and none of his usual dignity he scurried from the room now sally can you walk ill try i feel lightheaded of course you do anna murmured lean on me were going right out the kitchen door to the car well be at the hospital in five minutes to the hospital beneath annas hand the womans arm began to shake i dont like hospitals theres nothing to worry about ill stay with you i work there some of the doctors are very handsome as she spoke she eased the cook up and began to help her to the door so handsome youll ask yourself why you didnt cut yourself before by the time they got through the door mcgee was there to take most of the womans weight a fine job of emergency first aid miss whitfield dr liederman rinsed his hands in a basin as he spoke to anna without it id wager that woman would have bled to death before she made it to the hospital anna had gotten a good look at the wound and estimated the need for ten stitches once the artery had been sealed a bad place for the knife to slip we get suicides that dont do that good a job a lucky thing for her you didnt panic anna lifted a brow wondering if he considered that a compliment if blood made me panic id make a poor surgeon surgery is it she hadnt chosen an easy road he glanced over his shoulder as he finished scrubbing the cooks blood from his hands it takes more than skill to use a scalpel you know it takes confidence i thought it was arrogance she said with a small smile it took him several seconds before he returned the smile a more accurate term now as to our patient shell be weak for a day or two and probably favor that hand for two or three weeks you want the dressing changed every day yes and kept dry ill want her back in a couple of weeks to take the stitches out he turned then drying his hands though i dont imagine youd have any trouble doing that for her she smiled again i wouldnt think of it for another few months you know miss whitfield you have a good reputation in this hospital that surprised her but she reserved the pleasure do i yes you do and thats from the horses mouth he tossed the towel aside when she only stared the nurses the pleasure came now i appreciate that youre going into your last year of medical school ive seen enough to judge your confidence how are your grades pride lifted her chin excellent with a little laugh he studied her i appreciate that where do you want to intern here he held out a hand look me up anna accepted it ill do that so where in hell was everybody daniel had come home to find the house empty impatient to be with anna hed taken the steps two at a time and burst into the master bedroom hed had to look at the closet to assure himself shed actually been there though hed found himself pleased to see her clothes hanging neatly beside his it wasnt quite the welcome hed had in mind after a quick check of the second floor hed started down again mcgee cursing all servants he came to a halt on the landing and scowled bad enough his woman wasnt home but now his butler had disappeared mcgee opening and slamming doors as he went he worked his way down the hall he hadnt expected a brass band but hed thought someone might have found the time to be around when he got home by the time he had entered the kitchen door his temper was peaking where the devil is everyone will you stop shouting her voice pitched low anna stepped into the room ive just this minute gotten her into bed a man ought to be able to shout in his own home daniel began then his temper cleared enough for him to see the blood splattered over annas blouse and skirt sweet god he closed the distance between them in two steps then swept her against him what have you done to yourself where are you hurt ill get you to the hospital ive just been there but she wasnt quick enough to stop him from taking her up in his arms daniel its not my blood im not hurt daniel he was nearly out the kitchen door before she could stop him sally had an accident not me sally your cook she began i know who sally is he snapped at her then gathered her close as relief shuddered through him youre not hurt no her tone softened he was trembling who would have expected it im fine she managed to tell him just before his mouth closed over hers passion soared and through it she felt his relief which was nearly as wild moved she let him take whatever comfort he wanted daniel i didnt mean to frighten you well you did he kissed her again hard and was steadier what happened to sally apparently her hands were wet and she wasnt paying as close attention to her chopping as she might have been the knife slipped and slashed her at the wrist she hit an artery thats why theres so much blood its a serious cut but mcgee and i got her to the hospital shes resting now shell need a couple of days off for the first time he noticed the chopping knife and the blood on the floor by the sink with an oath he tightened his grip on anna ill go in to her no please from her position in his arms she managed to stop him shes sleeping it would really be better to wait until morning his cook like his butler like every one of his employees was his responsibility he glanced at the knife again and swore youre sure shes all right im sure she lost a good bit of blood but i was right outside the door when it happened then once mcgee realized i knew what i was doing he couldnt have been more helpful and where is he parking my car here he is now anna corrected herself as the butler came through the kitchen door mr macgregor a bit pale but as proper as ever mcgee stopped just inside the door ill have this mess cleaned up right away im afraid dinner will be delayed so im told miss whitfield said you were very helpful mcgee something it might have been an emotion flickered across his face im afraid i did very little sir miss whitfield was very efficient and if i may say so sir plucky anna had to swallow a chuckle thank you mcgee dont worry about dinner well see to ourselves very good sir good night miss good night mcgee the kitchen door swung shut behind them daniel you can put me down now no easily he started up the stairs this isnt the welcome id wanted for you she hadnt realized how good it could feel to be carried as though you were something precious i hadnt planned it this way myself he paused on the stairs to nuzzle her neck im sorry it wasnt anyones fault god she tasted so good every hunger he had could be sated with her alone youve ruined your blouse now you sound like sally she muttered about that all the way to the hospital ill buy you a new one thank goodness she said and laughed at him daniel dont we have anything more important to do than worry about my blouse do you know what i was thinking of the entire time i sat through that damned meeting no what making love to you in my bed our bed i see as he pushed open the door she linked her hands behind his head her pulse was already beginning to race anticipation imagination do you know what i thought about as i was unpacking my things no what making love to you in your bed our bed hearing her say that made the room he rarely noticed seem special then we should do something about it with her hands still linked behind his head he tumbled with her onto the thick white cover it was easier to live with daniel to wake with him to sleep with him than anna could have imagined it seemed to her that the part of her life she had lived without him had been no more than anticipation yet their first weeks together werent without adjustments though she had lived most of her life with her parents and the rest in the regimentation of college anna had always managed to move at her own pace and protect her privacy it was an entirely different matter to wake up with someone beside her especially when that someone was a man who viewed the hours spent in sleep as a waste of vital time daniel macgregor wasnt one to loiter in bed or to linger over coffee mornings were for business and morning started the moment his eyes opened because her system was on a different time clock she usually found herself wandering down for her first cup of coffee when daniel was finishing his second and last cup goodbyes were brief and hurried and anything but romantic daniel and his briefcase were out the door before her mind was completely ready to function not exactly a honeymoon shed thought more than once when she settled down to a solitary breakfast but it was a routine she could live with by the time she drove to the hospital daniel was already wheeling and dealing while she folded linens and read to patients he played the stock market and planned mergers and takeovers in living with him anna had a better view of just how powerful daniel was and how potentially powerful he could become she herself had taken a call from a senator and relayed a message from the governor of new york politics she began to realize was an aspect of his career she had never considered he also had contacts and interests in the entertainment field a telegram from a wellknown producer or a fledgling playwright wasnt uncommon though he rarely attended the ballet or the opera she learned that he made enormous contributions to the arts it would have pleased her more if she hadnt understood they were made for business purposes culture politics stockmarket ventures or housing projects it was all business to daniel and though she learned that business consumed his time and his life he passed off her inquiries into it with the equivalent of a pat on the head each time he did she tried to ignore the little twinge of frustration in time she told herself hed share in time hed give her both his trust and respect her life and her time were consumed by the hospital her studies and her preparation for her final year of medical school daniel rarely asked her about her hours involving medicine when and if he did anna took it as no more than polite interest and said little they spent their evenings lingering over a meal or over coffee in the parlor neither of them spoke of ambitions of what drove them or of professional needs while they were content just being with each other it seemed to both as though a shade had been drawn over a part of their lives neither of them wanted to be the first to lift it they became misers with their social time spending most of it alone at home when they did socialize it was with the newlywed ditmeyers now and again there was a film and they could sit in a darkened theater holding hands forgetting about the pressures of the day or the uncertainty of the future they learned of each other of habits whims and annoyances love soothed and left to itself deepened but even as it did they both fretted about what was missing from their relationship daniel wanted marriage anna wanted partnership they hadnt yet discovered how to combine the two summer heat soared in august it boiled in the streets and hung mistily in the air those who could escaped to the shore on the weekends daniel and anna took drives out of the city with the top down twice they picnicked on daniels lot in hyannis port they could make love there as freely and unrestrainedly as they had the first time they could laugh or simply doze in the grass and it was there unexpectedly that daniel began to pressure her again theyll be breaking ground here next week daniel told her one day as they shared the last of a bottle of chablis next week surprised anna glanced over to see him staring at the empty plot where his house would be he could see it she knew as though there were already stone and mortar standing sturdy in the sun i didnt realize it would be so soon he hadnt told her she thought he hadnt shown her though shed asked any of the plans of blueprints for the house that was so important to him he merely moved his shoulders it would have been sooner but i had some other things to tidy up first i see and he hadnt considered the other things worth mentioning either anna bit back a sigh and tried to accept it i know the house is important to you and itll be beautiful but ill miss this when he looked at her she smiled and reached out to touch his face its so peaceful here so isolated just water and rock and grass itll be all of those things after the house is up after were living in it because he felt her slight withdrawal he took her hand it wont be quick the best things arent it may be two years before the house is ready for us but our children will grow up here daniel they will his fingers tightened on hers as he cut her off and whenever we make love in that house ill remember our first time here fifty years from now ill still remember our first time here it was all but impossible to resist him when he was like this he was more dangerous when he spoke quietly when his voice flowed over her for a moment she almost believed him then she thought about how very far they had to go youre asking for promises daniel aye i expect promises dont and why not youre the woman i want the woman who wants me its time for promises between us keeping a firm hold on her hand he reached into his pocket and drew out a small velvet box i want you to wear this anna with a flick of his thumb he opened the box to reveal a fiery pearshaped diamond something caught in her throat part of it was astonishment at the sheer beauty of the ring the rest was fear of what the symbol meant promises vows commitments she wanted she yearned she feared i cant of course you can when he started to pluck the ring from the box she put both hands over his no i cant im not ready for this daniel ive tried to explain to you and ive tried to understand but his patience was wearing thin every day he lived with her he had to accept half of what he needed you dont want marriage at least not yet but a rings not marriage just a promise a promise i cant give you but she wanted to with each day that passed she wanted to more if i took the ring id be giving you a promise that might be broken i cant do that with you youre too important you dont make sense hed expected to feel frustration even when hed bought the ring hed known she wouldnt wear it in some odd way hed even known shed be right but that knowledge didnt soothe the hurt im important to you but you wont accept a ring from me oh daniel i know you regrets washed over her as she took his face in her hands if i took this ring youd be pressuring me to accept a wedding ring in a months time sometimes i think you look at the two of us like a merger maybe i do anger flared in his eyes but he controlled it hed discovered he could when it was anna he was angry with maybe its the only way i know maybe it is she agreed quietly and maybe im trying to understand that you look at it as a trial he said it flatly when she looked up stunned he continued in the same tone im not sure whether im on trial anna or you are its not like that you make it sound so cold and calculated no more calculated than a merger im not looking at whats between us as a business daniel was he he realized uncomfortably that he had been but he wasnt so sure any longer maybe its time you told me just how youre looking at it you frighten me her words came out so fast and strong that both of them sat in silence for several moments anna because her statement was the last response hed expected from her his voice was low and tentative id never do anything to hurt you i know she thought of the ring in the box of the image of the house at their backs and rose with her nerves jumping if you could i believe youd treat me like glass like something to be protected cared for and admired somehow its easier for me when you lose sight of that and shout at me he couldnt pretend to understand her but he rose and stood behind her then ill shout more often im sure you will she murmured when i frustrate you or disagree but what happens when i give you everything you want she turned then and her eyes were glowing with emotion what happens when i say all right i give up he grabbed her hands for fear shed turn away again i dont know what youre talking about i think you do deep down i think you know that part of me wants just what you want but do either of us know if i want it for myself or just to please you if i said yes and married you tomorrow id have to toss away everything else im not asking for that i wouldnt wouldnt you she closed her eyes a moment and struggled for composure can you tell me can you be sure that youll accept care for dr anna whitfield the same way you do for me now he started to speak quickly but her eyes were too dark too vulnerable there could be nothing with anna but the truth i dont know she let out a quick quiet sigh would he have lied if hed known how much shed wanted to hear it and if he had lied would she have taken the ring and given the promise then give us both the time to be sure because hed released her hands her arms were free to go around him if i accept your ring itll be with my whole heart with everything i am and itll be forever once its there daniel its there to stay that i can promise you we both have to be sure it belongs there itll keep the ring was back in his pocket anna was in his arms they were alone and the air was swirling with summer when she lifted her face he crushed his mouth to hers this wont he murmured and drew her down with him chapter eleven contents prev next anna took the news that they would be entertaining the governor calmly enough both her parents and her grandparents had entertained dignitaries from time to time shed been trained how to prepare a properly impressive menu what wines to order and what brandy to serve it really wasnt the doing it that bothered her it was the fact that daniel had simply assumed she would she could have told him no anna lectured herself on this as she drove home from the hospital she could have reminded him that she put in a full day between the hospital and her studies and didnt have the time or inclination to plan whether to serve oysters rockefeller or coquilles st jacques as an appetizer she could have and would have gained a brief moment of selfsatisfaction then she would have spent the rest of her time feeling guilty for being petty and mean it would after all be their first dinner party as a couple and it was so important to him he wanted she knew to show her off as much as he wanted to give the governor a memorable meal it should have infuriated her somehow she found it endearing with a shake of her head anna admitted that loving daniel could do strange things to common sense so he could show her off she wouldnt disappoint him the time it took to plan the evening would be as much fun as work to be honest she had to admit that preparing for a dinner party came as naturally to her as reciting the names of bones in the hand which reminded her she wanted to look at sallys the moment she got home home it made her smile only three weeks had passed since shed unpacked in what had been daniels bedroom it was their bedroom now she might have her doubts about tomorrow next week next year but she had none about today she was happy living with daniel had added a dimension to her life she had never expected because that was true how could she explain that going on just as they were seemed the best way the thought of marriage still sent a chill of unease down her back and of distrust she admitted but whom did she distrust daniel or herself she hadnt forgotten that hed accused her of putting them both on trial perhaps she was but only because she feared hurting him as much as she feared being hurt there were moments when it all seemed so clear to her shed marry him bear his children share his life shed be a doctor and develop her skill to the very height of its potential he would be every bit as proud of her accomplishments as she was of his she would have everything any woman could ever want and so much more it could happen it would happen then she would remember how carelessly uninterested he was in her work at the hospital she would remember how he closeted himself in his office with business he never discussed with her and how he never asked about the medical books that now littered the bedroom not once had he mentioned the fact that she was due back in connecticut in a matter of weeks or if he planned to be with her could two people share a life share a love and not share what was most vital to them if she had the answer to that one question she could stop asking herself any other with a shake of her head anna pulled into the driveway she refused to be gloomy now she was home and that was enough as she walked in the kitchen door sally was bending over to pop something into the oven youre supposed to rest that hand its had all the rest it needs without turning around sally reached for a cup youre a bit late today there was a car accident lots of bumps and scratches in emergency i stayed to hold some hands sally poured coffee and set the cup on the table youd rather have been cutting and sewing on a little sigh anna sat down with the coffee yes its so hard not being allowed to do even the little things i could do im not even allowed to take a blood pressure it wont be long until youll be doing a great deal more than that i keep telling myself one more year just one more but im so impatient sally you and the macgregor have that in common knowing shed be welcome sally brought over a cup of her own he called to say hed be late himself and for you to eat your supper if you didnt want to wait but i could tell he was hoping youd hold off till he got here i can wait are you having any pain in that hand its a bit stiff when i wake up but theres barely a twinge even when i use if heavily she held it out admiring the scar that ran down the wrist theres a nice neat seam dont think i could do better myself then with a grin she lowered her hand i dont suppose sewing up flesh is much like mending a tablecloth the techniques pretty close anna gave the injured hand a pat since daniels going to be late this might be a good time for us to go over the guest list and menu for next week i have some ideas but if youve a specialty youd rather she broke off and sniffed the air sally what have you got in the oven peach pie she preened my grandmas recipe oh anna closed her eyes and let the aroma flow through her warm peach pie on a summers evening how late was daniel going to be eight he said anna glanced at her watch you know i have a feeling that working on this menu is going to take a lot out of me she smiled as she rose to fetch a pad and pencil ill probably need a bit of something to tide me over a piece of peach pie perhaps that should do it when daniel came in anna was still in the kitchen recipe cards lists and scraps of paper littered the table where she and sally sat between them was half of a peach pie and the remains of a bottle of white wine i dont care how much we want to impress the governor anna said with her head close to sallys were not serving haggis i know for a fact id turn green if i had to eat anything with entrails a fine surgeon youll make if youre squeamish im not squeamish about what i have to look at or what i have to get my hands in what goes in my stomach is a different matter i vote for the coq au vin good evening ladies annas head came up and the smile that was already on her face grew when she saw him daniel she was up and taking both his hands sally and i have been planning the dinner party im afraid i may have offended her about the haggis but i think our guests might be more comfortable with coq au vin ill leave that to the two of you he said and leaned down for a kiss things took longer than id thought im glad you didnt wait supper for me supper she still held his hands as much now for support as anything else until shed stood she hadnt realized how fuzzy her mind was sally and i were just testing out her peach pie would you like some later though i could use a glass of that wine if youve left any his eyes were burning from reading pages of fine print oh she looked blankly at the bottle wondering how it had come to be nearly empty ill have a shower first ill go up with you anna rummaged through the piles of paper until she found the one she wanted id like to read you this guest list so you can add anyone ive forgotten before we send the invitations out fine go on to bed sally ill help myself to the pie when im ready yes sir thank you you look tired daniel was it a difficult day no more than most he slipped his arm around her as they started up the stairs a few problems with the fine points of a deal im working on i think we ironed them out can you talk about it i dont bring my troubles home he gave her a little squeeze i spent the afternoon with your father you did she felt a little skip of emotion but kept her voice level how is he well and keeping business and personal matters well apart yes her smile was a bit tight when they reached the top landing i suppose thats for the best he asked about you his voice was gentle now because hed come to know her he did aye she entered first when daniel pushed open the door to the bedroom because she felt so warm she walked to the window to lean out maybe if i hired him hed stop avoiding me hes just worried about his daughter theres nothing to worry about hell see that for himself at dinner next week anna looked over the guest list still clutched in her hand hell come hell come she let out a quick breath before she smiled again i suppose i have you to thank for that some but i think your mother had more to do with it he tossed his jacket and tie on one of the chairs anna had arranged in front of the fireplace as he unbuttoned his shirt he could smell the summery scent of sweet peas that brimmed out of a bowl on a table by the window small things enormous things daniel stopped undressing to fold her tight in his arms she sensed the abrupt flurry of intense emotion that had taken hold of him anna circled his waist with her arms and let the feeling rush through her daniel kissed the top of her head before he drew her away what was that for for being here he told her for being you he slid off his shoes with a little sigh of relief i wont be long why dont you just call out the names on that list to me with economy of movement daniel stripped off the rest of his clothes then walked into the bath with only a small frown anna looked at the pile of clothes on the floor she wondered if shed ever get used to his carelessness about such things ignoring the obvious alternative she stepped over them a woman who picked up after a grown man was asking for trouble theres the governor and his wife of course she called out and councilman and mrs steers daniel answered with a crude and accurate description of the councilman anna cleared her throat and made a note on the list to seat that particular couple at the opposite end of the table from their host myra and herbert the maloneys and the cooks she lifted her voice over the sound of water still feeling warm she unfastened the first three buttons of her blouse the donahues with john fitzsimmons to balance out cathleen anna peered at the list blinking because her vision seemed blurred john who fitzspimmons simmons fitzsimmons she repeated when she managed to get her tongue around it and carl benson and judith mann myra told me theyre about to be engaged shes built like a daniel caught himself very attractive woman he amended who else anna walked into the bathroom with her eyes narrowed built like what behind the curtain daniel merely grinned i beg your pardon to his surprise anna drew the curtain back woman is nothing sacred just what is judith mann built like now how would i know for safetys sake he stuck his head under the spray youd better pull the curtain to youll get wet and how would you know she demanded and stepped fully dressed into the shower anna laughing he watched the water plaster her blouse against her what in hell are you doing trying to get a straight answer she waved the now soaking list at him just what do you know about judith manns anatomy only what a man with good eyesight can see he caught her chin in his hand and took a good look now that i think about it i see something else she put a hand to his soapy chest for balance and whats that youre drunk anna whitfield dignity streamed from her as thick as the water i beg your pardon her haughtily delivered reply delighted him daniel brushed wet hair out of her eyes youre drunk he repeated dont be ridiculous its drunk you are drunk as an irish roof thatcher and twice as pretty ill be damned you may well be but ive never been drunk a day in my life youre just trying to avoid the question whats the question she opened her mouth shut it again then grinned i dont remember have i ever told you what a magnificent body you have daniel no he drew her against it before he began the task of peeling off her clothes why dont you such welldeveloped pectoral muscles her blouse fell with a muffled splash and where might they be just here she murmured and ran a hand over his chest the deltoids are very firm and of course the biceps are impressive not obviously bulging just hard her fingers slid over his shoulders and down as he tugged off her skirt it shows not simply strength but discipline like the abdomen very flat and tight his breath caught as she explored there tell me anna he lowered his mouth to her ear and began to trace it with his tongue just how many muscles are there her head fell back and the water sluiced over her naked wet pliant she smiled up at him there are over six hundred muscles in the body all attached to the two hundred and six bones that make up the skeleton fascinating im wondering how many of mine you might point out we could start with the muscles of the lower limbs i admire your walk do you yes its very firm and arrogant but not quite a swagger this naturally has something to do with your personality but you also need your antigravity muscles such as the soleus she bent down just enough to run a finger up his calf water poured over her hair the vasti she continued running a finger up his thigh and with a sound of approval she slid her hands around to his bottom he grinned and let himself enjoy hed never had a woman give him quite so interesting a lesson i thought that muscle had more to do with sitting the things you learn in anatomy class he switched off the water then reached for a towel to cover both of them the gluteus maximus with an approving murmur she ran her hands over him again has to stretch sufficiently or else youd have a tendency to jackknife forward as you walk cant have that he murmured as he gathered her up in his arms especially when youre carrying precious cargo and this is one of your most attractive muscles thank you flinging the towel aside he lay with her on the bed warm night air played over damp skin now the adductors the muscles on the inside of the thighs show me just here her fingers reached down and skimmed over him just as his mouth closed over hers with her eyes half shut she sighed and nuzzled into him i dont think youre paying attention oh but i am the adductors just here strong fingers pressed into firm thighs just here he repeated where your skins like silk and already warm for me and here his hand journeyed up to tease the sensitive area where hip and thigh joined what are these muscles here theyre but she could only moan and arch against him he caught the lobe of her ear in his teeth have you forgotten just touch me she whispered it doesnt matter where with a sound of triumph he took his hands over her skimming caressing kneading arousing like putty she seemed willing to be molded like fire she tempted and dared like a woman she softened and tensed and gave her hands were as eager as his her lips as hungry their skin dried in the warm summer air then became damp again with excitement each time she thought hazily each time they made love it was more thrilling more beautiful the first time the hundredth time the edge of desire was never dulled in a field of grass on feather pillows it was just as volatile in the bright light of day in the dark secret night it was just as frenzied shed never stop wanting him of all the questions shed asked herself she was sure of that answer need for him would never fade they rolled over the big bed frantic for each other lost in each other trapped in pleasure she rose up back arched eyes closed her hair a wild wet tangle the sliver of light from the next room shot a nimbus around her that seemed to shiver with her ecstasy halfmad he came to her so that kneeling on the bed they could pour pleasures over each other weak vibrating they tumbled down again and took the last step into passion her limbs were wrapped around him her face was buried against his throat as her breath heaved in and out her fingers dug into his back and felt hard flesh and sweat and as he moved into her moved with her she rode on the carousel flew on the roller coaster and lost herself in the maze youre stunning daniel stared at her as she studied herself in the mirror absolutely stunning it pleased her to hear it though shed never thought much of compliments the dress left her shoulders bare and fell in a loose sweeping line to just above her ankles pearls crusted the bodice and danced along the skirt myra had talked her into it though shed needed little persuasion true it had taken a healthy chunk out of the money shed put aside for board during the fall but she was confident shed find a way to balance her books the look on daniels face and the satisfaction she felt seeing her own reflection made it worthwhile you like it how could he explain that though he knew every intimate inch of her just looking at her could still take his breath away shed been right when shed thought he wanted to show her off when a man had something exquisite he needed to share it no he couldnt explain i like it so well im wishing the evening was already over she gave a last swirl as much for herself as for him you look wonderful in a dinner jacket elegantly barbarian his brow lifted barbarian never change that she held out both hands and took his no matter what else has to change dont change that he brought her hands to his lips kissed one then the other i doubt i could any more than you could change being a lady even after too much wine and peach pie she tried to look stern but laughed youll never let me forget that god no it was one of the most fascinating evenings of my life im crazy about you anna so youve said she lifted their joined hands to her cheek thats something else i dont want you to change i wont i like seeing you wear the cameo he brushed a finger over it as was his habit it means a great deal to me you wouldnt take my ring daniel you wouldnt take my ring he continued but you took the cameo id like you to take this drawing a box out of his pocket he waited anna folded her hands together daniel you dont have to buy me presents i think ive figured that out but hed yet to figure out how to accept that fact it might be why i want to humor me he said and made her smile youve said that before because he smiled back she accepted the box thank you then she opened the box and found she could say nothing is something wrong with them she managed to shake her head pearls and diamonds pure in simplicity arrogant in beauty the earrings lay against black velvet and nearly breathed with life from the simple orbs of milky white pearls dripped the tearshaped glamour of diamonds one gleamed the other flashed and together they made a stunning unit daniel theyre she shook her head and looked back up at him theyre absolutely beautiful i dont know what to say you just said it relieved he took the box and removed the earrings i suppose youll have to thank myra i asked her advice she said something about class and flash making the best team did she anna murmured as daniel fastened the earrings on her himself there now pleased he stepped back to inspect yes theyll do nicely now maybe theyll draw the attention and keep mens eyes off all that beautiful skin youve exposed laughing again anna lifted a hand to her ear ah an ulterior motive its hard not to worry that youll take a good look around and see someone who appeals to you more dont be silly taking it as a joke she linked arms with him i suppose wed better go down or the guests will be arriving then mcgee will scowl at us for being late and unpardonably rude hah as they walked through the door daniel found her hand with his as if you hadnt twisted him around your finger already anna gave him an innocent look as they started downstairs i dont know what you mean fixes scones for you in the middle of the week never did that for me ah theres the door now she paused on the bottom landing promise not to glare even at councilman steers i never glare he lied easily and led her down the hall to greet the first guests in less than twenty minutes the big parlor was crowded with bodies and buzzing with conversation though anna was perfectly aware that she and daniel were often the topic of the moment she made her way calmly from group to group she hadnt needed her mothers warning to know that her decision would alienate her from some but her choices were never made with other peoples opinions in mind louise ditmeyers greeting was a bit stiff but anna ignored it and chatting steered her to a group of friends more than once she caught someone aiming a speculative look in her direction it was easy enough to meet this calmly that was her way anna had no idea that her cool confidence and natural graciousness did more to squelch gossip than daniels power or her own family name if there was a shadow on the evening it came from the governors careless request for her opinion on daniels projected textile factory how could she have an opinion or even an intelligent comment daniel had never mentioned it to her and she was faced with the governors glowing praise of a project that would bring employment to hundreds and fat revenues to the state training kept her smile in place and brought easy answers there was no time for anger as she introduced the governor and his wife to another couple there was time for only a moments envy that the governors wife appeared to be deeply involved in his work pressed by her duties as hostess anna pushed personal disappointment to the back of her mind not until her parents arrived did she feel any real tension holding her breath she approached her father im so glad you came she rose on her toes to kiss his cheek though she was far from sure of her reception you look well he didnt speak coldly but she felt his reserve so do you hello mother she pressed her cheek against her mothers and smiled at the encouraging squeeze you look beautiful anna she shot her husband a quick look happy i am happy let me get you both a drink now dont fuss with us her mother told her you have all these guests theres pat donahue i see just run along well be fine all right then as she started to turn away her father caught her hand anna as he hesitated he felt her hand tighten on his its good to see you it was enough she wrapped her arms around his neck and held for just a moment if i came by your office one day would you play hooky and go for a ride with me you going to let me drive your car she smiled brilliantly maybe he winked and patted her head as hed always done see to your guests when she turned it was to see daniel a few feet away smiling at her she walked to him with her heart in her eyes now you look even more beautiful he murmured to her whats all this myra came up to stand between them the host and hostess arent even supposed to have time to speak to each other at an affair like this daniel i really believe you should go rescue the governor from our esteemed councilman before he loses his appetite the governor that is when daniel muttered something rude she merely nodded just so now anna why dont we walk over to where cathleen is boring the daylights out of the maloneys im dying to see her gag over your earrings subtle myra anna warned as they maneuvered through the groups remember the beauty of subtlety darling of course but id really appreciate it if youd be sure to toss your head just a little now and then why cathleen what a nice dress cathleen stopped her dissertation on her summer schedule to study myra anna wasnt sure but she thought the maloneys sighed in unison thank you myra i suppose congratulations and best wishes are in order i havent seen you since you and herbert ran away no you havent myra sipped her drink and ignored the less than complimentary description of her marriage envy was the simplest of things to ignore when you were happy i suppose theres something to be said for elopements though for myself id find it a rather cutanddry way of marrying to each his own myra returned and tried to remember it was annas dinner party oh indeed cathleen gave a little nod but what a shame you and herbert have decided to be hermits even after cheating us all out of a big wedding im afraid herbert and i havent entertained on a grand scale yet we want to finish our redecorating before we have more than our most intimate friends over you understand seeing the need to intervene anna stepped a bit closer im sure youve had a busy summer cathleen oh quite busy she gave anna a cool smile though others seem to get more accomplished in a shorter time i took a little trip to the shore and when i got back to boston i learned myra and herbert had run off and youd changed addresses are congratulations of a different sort in order anna laid a hand on myras arm to silence her not at all youve brought back a beautiful tan im sorry i missed getting to the beach i didnt seem to find the time im sure you didnt lifting her drink cathleen took a long slow sip it wasnt easy to accept that two of the women shed debuted with had snagged two of the most influential men in the city particularly when shed all but decided to set her sights on daniel tell me anna just how do i introduce you and daniel if the occasion comes up im afraid im naive about these things even annas patience only lasted so long why should it matter oh it does as a matter of fact im thinking of giving a little dinner party myself i havent a clue how to write your invitation i wouldnt worry about it oh but i do her eyes widened and rounded id hate to make a faux pas what a pity if cathleen couldnt get a rise one way shed get one another well after all one doesnt know how to politely address a mans mistress then she let out a gasp and squeal as myras drink ran down her bodice oh how dreadfully clumsy of me rocking back on her heels myra surveyed the damage to cathleens pink crepe de chine it was almost enough to satisfy myra i feel like such a mule she said lightly come ill go up with you cathleen ill be more than happy to sponge you off i can take care of myself she said between gritted teeth just keep away from me myra lit a cigarette and blew smoke at the ceiling whatever you say feeling obligated anna started to take her arm here let me take you up keep your hands off me she hissed you and your imbecile friend skirts swirling she was pushing herself through the crowd subtlety anna sighed didnt we speak of subtlety i didnt toss it in her face myra said and to tell the truth ive been wanting to do that for so long this was the first time i could and feel absolutely justified she gave anna a wide grin do i have time for another drink before dinner chapter twelve contents prev next perhaps if daniel hadnt overheard the incident with cathleen donahue he would have handled things differently but he had perhaps if his anger at the insult hadnt eaten away at him their relationship could have continued smoothly enough but it didnt throughout the rest of the evening he managed to remain the congenial host guests left his home well fed and content he could barely wait to close the door behind the last of them we need to talk he told anna before she could take her first sigh of relief though she was wilting a bit around the edges she nodded others might have been fooled by daniels easy conversation and careless generosity through the evening but she had sensed both strain and anger in tacit agreement they walked upstairs to the privacy of the bedroom something has upset you she began and sat on the arm of chair though she longed to take off her clothes and fall mindlessly into bed i know you had business with the governor did something go wrong my business is fine he paced to the window and pulled out a cigar its my personal life thats the problem she folded her hands in her lap a sure sign of annoyance or nerves i see no you dont he turned to her then ready to snipe or charge if you understood thered be no argument about marriage it would simply be a fact simply a fact she repeated and struggled to remember how unproductive anger was daniel our biggest problem seems to stem from our diverse outlooks on marriage i dont see it as simply a fact but as the biggest step one person can take with another i cant take that step with you until im ready if you ever are he shot back she moistened her lips behind her growing temper were regrets if i ever am the anger hed held in all evening gnawed at him so youll give me no promises anna nothing i told you before i wouldnt give a promise i may have to break ill give you everything i can daniel its not enough he drew on the cigar then watched her through a haze of smoke im sorry if i could id give you more if you could fury whipped through him blinding him to reason if you could nothings stopping you but your own stubbornness if that were true id be a fool she rose because it was time to face him time in fact to face herself and perhaps i am because i expect you to give my needs and ambitions as much respect as you give your own what in hell does that have to do with marriage everything in nine months ill have my degree a piece of paper he shot back everything about her turned cold her skin her voice her eyes a piece of paper i wonder if you would call your deeds and stocks and contracts pieces of paper pieces of paper too lofty too important to ever be discussed with me or perhaps as with the textile factory the governor asked me about tonight you dont consider me intelligent enough to understand your work ive never doubted your intelligence he shot back what do deeds and stock have to do with us theyre part of you just as my degree will be part of me ive devoted years of my life to earning it i would think you could understand that ill tell you what i understand rigid with anger he crushed out his cigar i understand im tired of coming in second place to this precious degree damn you daniel no one can tell you anything fighting for control she leaned both hands on her dresser it isnt a matter of places it isnt a competition what is it then just what in hell is it a matter of respect she said more calmly and turned to him again its a matter of respect and what about love he spoke of love so seldom that his question nearly broke her tears swam in her eyes and smothered her voice love is an empty word without respect id rather not have it from a man who cant accept me for what i am id rather not give it to a man who wont share his problems with me as well as his successes his pride was as strong as hers even as he felt her slip away from him he gripped his pride as though it were all he had left then perhaps youd prefer it if i stopped loving you ill do my best with that he turned on his heel moments later anna heard the front door slam she could have fallen on the bed and given in to tears she wanted to maybe too much because she couldnt there seemed to be only one thing left to do mechanically she began to pack the drive to connecticut was a long and lonely one weeks later anna could remember it vividly she drove through the night until her eyes were gritty and the sun was up exhausted she checked into a motel and slept until dusk when she woke she tried to forget what shed left behind the first few days were spent finding a small apartment near the campus she needed privacy and indulged herself by having her own place her days were full with planning preparing anna thought it a pity that her nights couldnt be full as well anna could block daniel out of her mind for long stretches during the day but at night she would lie in her bed and remember what it had been like to curl up against him she would eat alone at her little table in her little kitchen and remember how she and daniel had lingered over coffee in the dining room simply because it was so comfortable just to talk she deliberately refused to install a phone it would have made it too easy to call him when classes began she fell into them with an almost desperate relief her fellow students noticed a change in her the usually friendly if slightly reserved miss whitfield was now completely withdrawn she rarely spoke unless it was to ask or answer a question in class those who happened to drive by her apartment in the evening or late on a saturday night invariably saw a light burning in her window incessant study brought shadows to eyes that even her professors began to note she blocked any comment or question with polite but firm withdrawal the days blurred together as she wanted them to if she studied hard enough long enough she could fall into oblivion for six hours a night and not think at all connecticut in midseptember was brisk and beautiful but anna had taken little time to notice the foliage the strong colors and rich scents of fall were bypassed in favor of medical journals and anatomy classes in previous years shed managed to enjoy her surroundings while devoting herself to her studies now if she stopped for a moment to admire the wild riot of leaves she would think only of a cliff top and the roar of water on rock and she would wonder in that moment before she pulled herself away if daniel was building his house in defense she had even avoided contacting myra though her friend sent her long annoyed letters when the telegram arrived anna realized she couldnt hide forever it read simply if you dont want me on your doorstep in twentyfour hours call stop myra stop with the telegram mixed in with her notes on the circulatory system anna stopped between classes at a pay phone in the student lounge armed with change she put the call through and waited hello myra if you arrived on my doorstep youd have to sleep there i dont have an extra bed anna good god i was beginning to think youd slid into the atlantic anna heard the quick snap of a lighter and an indrawn breath that was easier to believe than that youd been too rude to answer my letters im sorry ive been busy youve been hiding myra corrected and ill tolerate that as long as its not from me ive been worried about you dont be im fine of course no im not fine she admitted because it was myra but i am busy up to my ears in books and notes you havent called daniel no i cant she closed her eyes and rested her forehead against the cool metal of the phone how is he have you seen him seen him anna could almost see myra roll her eyes he went crazy the night you left woke herbert and i up after two am demanding if you were here herbert calmed him down the mans positively amazing herbert that is we havent seen a great deal of daniel since but i hear hes spending a lot of time in hyannis port supervising the building of his house yes he would and she could see him there watching the machines dig and the men laying stone anna did you know that daniel overheard that little incident with cathleen the night of the dinner party she caught herself wallowing in selfpity and shook her head no no he didnt tell me oh she remembered the underlying fury shed sensed in him the same fury hed turned on her it explained a great deal i heard him tell herbert hed like to wring her skinny neck though i approved herbert talked him out of it it did seem though that the entire business had thrown him off the man has the idea that you should be protected from any kind of insult its sweet really though we can certainly take care of ourselves i cant marry daniel in order not to be insulted she murmured no and though im sure he deserves a kick in the behind darling id swear his hearts in the right place he loves you anna only part of me she closed her eyes and willed herself to be strong im sorry we involved you oh please you know i thrive on being involved anna do you want to talk about it would you like me to come no really at least not yet though she rubbed at her temple anna laughed im glad i didnt answer your letters talking to you has done me more good than anything else then give me your number theres no reason why we cant talk instead of writing i dont have a phone no phone there was a shocked and pregnant pause anna darling how do you survive she stopped rubbing at her temple and really laughed im very primitive here youd be shocked if you saw my apartment and she wondered if even myra would understand the enthusiasm shed felt while spending the best part of the afternoon with a dozen other students and a cadaver some things were best left unsaid look i promise ill sit down and write you a long letter tonight ill even call again next week all right then but one word of advice before you go daniels a man so he starts with one strike against him just try to remember that thanks give my love to herbert i will im counting on that letter tonight she promised again bye myra when anna hung up she felt truly steady for the first time in weeks true shed taken charge of her own life when shed left boston shed leased her own apartment registered for classes she set her own study time and was responsible for her own success her own failure but she hadnt been happy she was responsible for that as well she reminded herself as she walked back down the hall it was time to face the fact that shed made her choice if she had to live as it seemed she did alone then she had to make the best of it a glance at her watch showed her she had ten minutes before her next class this time shed step outside and enjoy the autumn weather instead of hurrying to the next building and burying her face in a book outside she saw the symphony of color she had almost deliberately ignored for weeks she saw other students hurrying to class or stretched on the grass reading by sunlight she saw the slight slope and the old red brick of the hospital and she saw the blue convertible at the curb for an instant she couldnt move weeks peeled away and she was coming out of the hospital in boston to find daniel waiting for her her fingers tightened on the books she carried but it wasnt boston she thought more calmly and daniels wasnt the only blue convertible on the east coast it was simply a mean twist of fate that had made her walk out and see it pulling herself together she started to walk away seconds later she was going back to the car for a closer look want a ride at the sound of his voice she felt her heart roll over in her chest when she turned her face was touched with both wariness and pleasure daniel what are you doing here and what did she care it was enough just to look at him it appears im waiting for you he wanted to touch her but if he touched hed grab deliberately he kept his hands in his pockets what time is your last class over last class shed forgotten what day it was ah an hour or so i only have one more today all right then ill be back be back dazed she watched him walk around the hood and open the drivers door before she realized she intended to do it anna pulled open the passengers what are you doing im going with you she blurted out he gave her a long cool stare what about your class she gave a desperate look around the campus before she climbed in the car ill borrow someones notes i can make it up but she couldnt make up another hour away from him youre not the type to skip classes no im not giddy she set her books in her lap my apartment isnt far we can have some coffee just turn left past the hospital then i know where it is he interrupted but didnt add hed known almost before the ink had dried on the lease the fiveminute drive went quickly as dozens of thoughts ran through her head how should she treat him politely was he still angry for the first time since shed known him anna couldnt gauge his mood her nerves were jumping by the time he stopped the car again he seemed perfectly calm i wasnt expecting anyone she began as they walked up the steps to her apartment on the second floor a person might be able to call if you had a phone i hadnt given it much thought she told him then unlocked the door come in she invited the moment he stepped inside she realized how impossibly small the apartment was in the living area daniel could all but touch the walls if he were to spread out his arms she had a divan a coffee table and a lamp and hadnt seen the necessity for anything else sit down she offered discovering she desperately needed a moment to herself ill make coffee without waiting for his answer she fled to the kitchen when he was alone daniel unclenched his hands he didnt see simply a small room but the touches of charm she had colorful pillows tossed on the couch and a bowl of shells on the coffee table more than that the tiny sunwashed room carried her scent the same scent that had faded from their bedroom he couldnt sit and he couldnt stand alone clenching his hands again he followed her into the kitchen he couldnt tell how much cooking she did in the cramped space but she obviously worked here on the table by the window was a portable typewriter and stacks of notes and books pencils worn down to nubs and freshly sharpened ones were held in a china cup he was out of his element he felt it he fought it coffee will just be a minute she said to fill the silence he was there again and she hadnt had enough time she couldnt know that he was feeling precisely the same i dont have anything else to offer you i havent shopped this week she was nervous he realized hearing the jumps in her usually smooth voice curious he watched and saw her hands tremble lightly as she reached for cups he felt the knots in his stomach loosen just a little how did he approach her daniel pulled up a chair and sat youre looking pale anna i havent been getting much sun the schedules always frantic the first few weeks and weekends theres the hospital mmm if you were a doctor you might diagnose overwork im not a doctor yet she set the coffee down then hesitated after a moment she sat across from him it was so much like their time together before yet it was nothing like it at all i happened to talk to myra today she said that youve started the house in hyannis port thats right hed watched them break the ground seen the foundation rise and it had meant nothing nothing at all if we stay on schedule the main part will be livable by next summer you must be pleased her coffee tasted like mud and she pushed it aside i have the blueprints in the car you might like to see them her chest was tight as she lifted her head he saw the surprise in her eyes and cursed himself for a fool of course i would for a moment he scowled down at his own hands he was a gambler wasnt he it was time to take another chance im thinking of buying an office building downtown small businesses and low rent but i think the property value should double in five to seven years he added a lump of sugar to his coffee but didnt stir it ive run into some problems with the textile factory your fathers working on the kinks so we can be in production by spring she kept her gaze steady on his why are you telling me he took a minute confessions didnt come easily to him but her eyes were so dark so patient hard as it was hed realized he needed her as much as his own pride a man doesnt like to admit he was wrong anna but more than that he doesnt like to face that his woman turned away from him because he couldnt admit it he could have said nothing that could have made her love him more i didnt turn away from you daniel ran away she swallowed all right i ran away from both of us do you realize youve offered me more of yourself in the last five minutes than you did the entire time we lived together it never occurred to me that youd want to know about factories and interest rates he started to rise then changed his mind when he saw the impatience in her eyes youd better say whats on your mind the first time i walked into the bedroom i saw how little of yourself was there after a while i figured out why you were so determined to go forward daniel as much as you spoke of the home and family you wanted youve had it in your head to do it yourself i was to be swept along thered be no family without you anna but you wanted to give not to share you never offered to show me the blueprints of the home you said you wanted for both of us you never asked for an opinion or a suggestion no and as i watched them build the foundation i realized i was going to have the house i wanted but not the home i needed he set down his spoon with a snap i never thought it really mattered to you i didnt know how to show you she smiled a little stupid because she needed just a bit of distance she rose to stand at the window strange she realized she worked here every evening and hadnt noticed the big red maple that spread in the yard it was beautiful how much beauty was she cutting out of her life part of me wanted to share that home with you more than anything but only part i guess its the part you cant accept that held me back that held us both back do you know you never asked about my work at the hospital about the books or about why i want to be a surgeon he rose too hed already faced himself now he had to face her a man doesnt ask the woman he loves about her other lover torn between anger and confusion she turned daniel dont ask me to be reasonable he interrupted im damn near ready to crawl if i have to but dont ask me to be reasonable on a huff of breath she shook her head all right i wont lets just say then that some women can have two lovers and be happy spending their lives trying to give each what they need its a hard life not if the woman has two lovers that are willing to give her back what she needs there was no room to pace in the little kitchen instead daniel rocked back on his heels his hands still clenched in his pockets you know i did a lot of thinking about your doctoring these last few weeks more i guess than ive wanted to do since i first saw you there were times anna when i could see you were meant for something more but i managed to block it out when you left and i spent my nights alone i didnt have any choice but to think i remembered the way youd been with mrs higgs and the way youd look when youd walk out of the hospital in the evening i remembered how youd stood in the kitchen with blood on your blouse and explained very calmly how youd dealt with sallys wrist she told me the doctor said youd saved her life something youd learned in one of these he said indicating the stack of books not so hard to learn maybe but i wouldnt think so easy to do he picked up a book and held it as he faced her no i havent asked you before why you want to be a surgeon im asking now she hesitated afraid he might make some cutting or worse patronizing remark hed come to her a gamble she could gamble as well i have a dream she told him quietly i want to make a difference he studied her in silence his eyes narrowed the irises a deep intense blue i have a dream he said at length then set the book down again for the first time he stepped toward her its a small apartment anna but i think theres room enough for two he heard her long broken breath before she wrapped her arms around him well need a bigger bed theres a lass on a laugh he picked her up off the floor and gave himself the pleasure of her mouth relief poured through him like wine until he was drunk with it ive missed you anna i cant do without you again no with her face buried against his throat she drew in his scent and filled herself with it not again daniel ive only been halfalive here without you i tried to crowd the day with studies to work harder longer at the hospital but it just didnt mean anything i want you with me need you with me youll have me a bigger bed and three phones should do it with a laugh she found his lips with hers he could have his phones as long as she had him i love you you never told me that unsteady he drew her away you never once told me that before i was afraid to i thought if you knew how much i loved you you might use it to make me give up the rest he started to deny it then swore at himself because it was true and now the rest doesnt mean much if youre not with me he drew farther away once i told you id thought of you looking around and seeing someone who appealed to you more i wasnt joking she gave him a little shake you should have been didnt she realize how lovely she was how regal didnt she know how clumsy she could make a man feel with just a smile dont believe ive taken you for granted or ever will i may act like it but it wont be true youre my answer anna and i want to be yours she rested her cheek on his shoulder a moment it had never occurred to her that his confidence would ever waver she loved him more knowing it could you are daniel i havent been sure i could give you what you seemed to want i wanted a wife a woman whod be there at night when i came home one whod keep flowers in the vases and lace at the windows one whod be content with whatever i could give her she looked at the books stacked on the table then at the man standing in front of her and now im beginning to think a woman like that would bore me within a week she pressed her fingers to her eyes to hold back the tears id like to think so im not backing down his voice was suddenly rough as he dragged her back against him youre going to marry me anna the day after you have that degree youll be dr whitfield for less than twentyfour hours her fingers curled into his shirt daniel i then its dr macgregor her fingers froze she took three quiet breaths before she dared to speak do you mean that aye i always mean what i say and youll have to put up with me introducing my wife as the best surgeon in the country i want to share your dream anna as much as i want you to share mine it wont be easy for you while im an intern the hours will be hateful and in twenty years well look back and wonder how we got through them i like the long view anna i wanted you to marry me because i thought you fit a slot you didnt fit it he took her hands in his now im asking you to marry me because i love you exactly as you are she took a long time to study him this time there would be no stepping back do you still have the ring aye he reached in his pocket i got into the habit of carrying it with me laughing she lifted both hands to his face ill take it now as he started to slip it on she closed her hand over his heres a promise for you daniel ill do my best the ring slid on thats good enough epilogue contents prev next anna had slept in snatches through the night rejecting the cot an orderly had brought her preferring the chair beside daniels bed from time to time during the night hed murmured in his sleep whenever shed heard her name she tried to soothe him talking to him reminiscing until he was restful again only once did she leave him to go down and check on shelby the rest of the time she sat watching him sleep and listening to the all too familiar beeps and clicks of machines the nurses changed shifts someone brought her coffee before going off duty the moon began to set she thought of the man she loved of the life theyd built and sat in silence to wait just before dawn she leaned over to rest her head on the bed beside his hand when daniel woke he saw her first she was sleeping lightly he was disoriented for only a moment even though the drugs were still swimming in his system he remembered the accident with perfect clarity he thought briefly of his car he was very fond of that particular toy then he felt the pressure in his chest saw the tubes running from his arm he remembered more than the accident now he remembered anna leaning over him talking reassuring him as he was being wheeled on a gurney down the hospital corridor he remembered the fear hed read in her eyes and before he slipped into unconsciousness his one moment of blind naked terror that he was being taken away from her oddly he thought he remembered looking down at himself from somewhere while doctors and nurses scrambled around then it seemed hed been sucked back into his body but the sensation was too vague to pinpoint he remembered one more thing anna again leaning over him cursing at him kissing his hand then he had simply dreamed she looked so tired he realized then it came home to him how old and battered his own body felt furious at his weakness he struggled to sit up and couldnt because the effort it cost him embarrassed him he reached out to touch annas cheek she was awake in an instant daniel her fingers curled around his in a matter of seconds he saw it all on her face terror relief grief weariness and strength through sheer will she controlled the need to simply drop her head to his chest and weep daniel her voice was as cool and calm as the first time hed ever heard it do you know me though it cost him he lifted a brow why in hell wouldnt i know the woman ive lived with for almost forty years why in hell not she agreed and gave herself the pleasure of pressing her lips to his you might be more comfortable if you climbed in here with me maybe later she promised and lifted one of his eyelids to study his pupil dont start poking and prodding at me i want a real doctor he managed to grin at her she pressed a button beside the bed is your vision blurred i can see you well enough youre as pretty as you were the first night we waltzed hallucinating she said dryly then looked up as a nurse came in please call dr feinstein mr macgregor is awake and requesting a real doctor yes dr macgregor i love it when they call you that he murmured and shut his eyes for just a minute how much damage did i do anna you were concussed youve broken three ribs and not to me he said impatiently to the car setting her teeth she folded her arms you never change i dont know why i bothered to worry im terribly sorry i disturbed the children the children the light in his eyes wasnt as fierce as it might have been but it was there you called the children hed given her precisely the reaction shed needed for her own reassurance anna pretended indifference yes i must apologize to them they came she knew his tactics too well of course what were you going to do have a wake she tidied his top sheet we wanted to be prepared he scowled at her and nearly managed to gesture toward the door well send them in i wouldnt have them spend the night here theyre at home his mouth dropped open home you mean they didnt stay here they left their father on his deathbed and went to drink his scotch yes im afraid theyre very feckless children daniel take after their father heres dr feinstein now she gave his hand a quick pat before she walked to the door ill leave you two alone anna she paused at the door and smiled back at him yes daniel dont stay away long she saw him then as hed been so many years before indomitable arrogant and strong enough to need do i ever she walked straight out of intensive care to her own office locking the door she gave herself the luxury of a twentyminute weeping spell shed cried there before after losing a patient this time she wept from a relief too great to measure and a love too strong to soothe after rinsing her face several times in cold water she went to the phone hello caine mom we were just about to call is he your father wants to see you she said easily hes afraid youve been drinking his scotch he swore and she heard his momentary struggle for control tell him we didnt put much of a dent in it are you okay im terrific ask rena to bring me a change of clothes when you come well be there in a half hour its a shame when a man has to all but die to get his children to visit him propped on pillows swathed in bandages daniel held court a couple of broken ribs serena said lightly and tweaked his toe from her position at the foot of the bed shed lain wakeful through the night in justins arms hah tell that to the doctor who put this tube in my chest and you didnt even bring my grandson he glared briefly at serena before turning to caine or my granddaughter theyll be in college before i see them again wont even know who i am we show laura your picture once a week caine offered he continued to hold dianas hand wondering if he would have made it through the past twentyfour hours without her quiet unflagging strength dont we love every sunday diana agreed with a grumpy mutter he turned to grant and gennie i suppose your sister has an excuse for not coming up he said to grant and its only right alans with her though hes my firstborn after all shes due to give me another grandchild in a couple of weeks any excuse grant said smoothly as caine grinned and examined his nails youre looking well lass he told gennie a woman just blooms when shes carrying a child and spreads gennie returned touching a hand to her rounded stomach another couple of months and i wont be able to reach my easel see that you use a stool he ordered a pregnant woman shouldnt be on her feet all day and see that youre out of this place and on your own feet by spring grant told him as he slipped an arm around his wife youll have to come to maine to be the babys godfather godfather he preened its a sad thing for a macgregor to be godfather to a campbell he ignored grants grin though it made his lips twitch and looked at gennie but ill do it for you are you getting enough rest anna slipped a hand to his wrist to unobtrusively monitor his pulse he forgets that i was pregnant with alan the last three months i interned never felt better in my life i felt wonderful during pregnancy myself serena commented i suppose thats why im doing it again it only took daniel a minute again serena rose on her toes to kiss justin before she smiled at her father again seven months to go well now no scotch daniel anna said anticipating him at least not until youre out of intensive care he scowled muttered then opened his arms as best he could come here then little girl serena leaned over the bed and held him as hard as she dared dont you ever scare me like this again she whispered fiercely now now dont scold he murmured and stroked her hair bad as your mother you take good care of her he ordered justin i dont want my next grandchild born in front of a slot machine eight to five this ones a girl justin answered youre on grinning he turned to diana you have to catch up dont be greedy she told him and took his hand a mans entitled to greed when he reaches a certain age isnt that right anna a womans entitled to make her own decisions at any age hah enormously pleased with himself he surveyed the room i never mentioned that your mother picketed for equal rights before it was stylish did i living with hers been nothing but a trial and stop taking my pulse woman no better medicine for a man than family then maybe we should give you a bit more anna nodded to the nurse outside the door with a sigh she leaned against the bed they were breaking all manner of hospital rules already what was one more she felt daniels fingers tighten on hers as alan wheeled shelby into the room whats this he demanded and would have attempted to sit up if anna hadnt eased him back this shelby began uncovering the bundle in her arms is daniel campbell macgregor hes eight hours and twenty minutes old and wanted to see his grandpa alan took his son to set him in his fathers arms hed spent the night praying hed be able to do just that what a sight daniel murmured not bothering to blink the tears from his eyes a grandson anna he has my nose look he smiled at me as anna leaned down he laughed and dont give me that hogwash about gas doctors i know a smile when i see one looking up he grinned at his son fine job alan thanks still awed by his son alan sat on the edge of the bed with one hand he covered his fathers over the babys for a moment three generations of macgregor males were content campbell daniel said abruptly did you say campbell his gaze locked on shelby i most certainly did her hand slipped into alans as she rose she might be less than nine hours out of the delivery room but she felt as strong as a bull certainly as strong as a macgregor youd better accept the fact that hes half campbell macgregor at her brothers chuckle her chin lifted higher very possibly the best half his eyes flashed anna took note of his color and approved he opened his mouth then laughed until he was weak from it what a tongue the girl has at least you had the good sense to name him daniel i named him after someone i love and admire flattery he signaled reluctantly for alan to take the baby taking shelbys hand he held it between both of his you look beautiful she smiled a bit stunned by the tears that swam in her eyes i feel beautiful you should have heard her swear at the doctor delighted with her alan pressed a kiss to her temple she threatened to get up and go home to have the baby without his interference she would have too if young daniel hadnt had different ideas good for you daniel decided and thought his name suited his grandson very well nothing worse than having a doctor fussing around when you just want to get on with your business after sending anna a bland smile he turned back to shelby now i want you to get back in bed where you belong i dont want to worry about you youve given us all a gift she leaned down to kiss his cheek you gave me one alan i love you you old badger just like a campbell go to bed im afraid youre all going to have to run along before the hospital board calls me on the carpet now anna if your father gets enough rest she turned to give him a telling look hell be moved out of icu in the morning it wasnt quick and it wasnt quiet but anna finally managed to clear the room she pretended not to hear daniels muttered request to justin for a game of poker later or his demand to caine for the cigars daniel had hidden in his office if he hadnt made the demands shed have worried no matter how daniel had protested she knew visits were as much a strain as a blessing until she was satisfied with his condition shed keep the future ones short the trick would be making him think it was his idea shed had years of practice now she walked back to the bed and smoothed the hair from his brow ive a dozen things to see to that i let go while i was fussing unnecessarily over you i want you to sleep he could be weaker now now that it was only her i dont want you to go yet anna i know youre tired but i need you to stay just a little longer all right dropping the bed guard again she sat beside him just rest we did a good job didnt we she smiled knowing he spoke of the children yes we did a very good job no regrets puzzled she shook her head what a foolish question no he took her hand in his last night i dreamed i dreamed of you it started on the night we met that first waltz the summer ball she murmured she had only to smile to see the moonlight smell the flowers odd it had been in her dreams as well it was a beautiful night you were beautiful he corrected and i wanted you more than id ever wanted anything in my life you were arrogant she remembered smiling and desperately attractive leaning over she kissed him softly lingeringly the same passion that theyd felt in the beginning hovered over them you still are daniel im old anna were both old he pressed her hand to his lips the ring hed given her so many years before was cool against his skin and i still want you more than ive ever wanted anything in my life ignoring rules and procedure anna lay next to him and rested her head on his shoulder ill lose my reputation for this she closed her eyes its worth it a fine one you are to talk of reputations he brushed his lips over her hair the scent was the same after all the years its a funny thing anna i keep having this fierce craving for peach pie she lay still a minute drifting then her eyes opened on a laugh they were young and wicked as she tilted her head toward his the minute you have a private room in from the cold chapter one contents prev next his name was macgregor he clung to that even as he clung to the horses reins the pain was alive capering down his arm like a dozen dancing devils hot branding hot despite the december wind and blowing snow he could no longer direct the horse but rode on trusting her to find her way through the twisting paths made by indian or deer or white man he was alone with the scent of snow and pine the muffled thud of his mounts hooves and the gloom of early twilight a world hushed by the sea of wind washing through the trees instinct told him he was far from boston now far from the crowds the warm hearths the civilized safe perhaps safe the snow would cover the trail his horse left and the guiding path of his own blood but safe wasnt enough for him it never had been he was determined to stay alive and for one fierce reason a dead man couldnt fight by all that was holy he had vowed to fight until he was free shivering despite the heavy buckskins and furs teeth chattering now from a chill that came from within as well as without he leaned forward to speak to the horse soothing in gaelic his skin was clammy with the heat of the pain but his blood was like the ice that formed on the bare branches of the trees surrounding him he could see the mares breath blow out in white streams as she trudged on through the deepening snow he prayed as only a man who could feel his own blood pouring out of him could pray for life there was a battle yet to be fought hed be damned if hed die before hed raised his sword the mare gave a sympathetic whinny as he slumped against her neck his breathing labored trouble was in the air as well as the scent of blood with a toss of her head she walked into the wind following her own instinct for survival and heading west the pain was like a dream now floating in his mind swimming through his body he thought if he could only wake it would disappear as dreams do he had other dreams violent and vivid to fight the british for all they had stolen from him to take back his name and his land to fight for all the macgregors had held with pride and sweat and blood all they had lost he had been born in war it seemed just and right that he would die in war but not yet he struggled to rouse himself not yet the fight had only begun he forced an image into his mind a grand one men in feathers and buckskins their faces blackened with burnt cork and lampblack and grease boarding the ships dartmouth eleanor and beaver ordinary men he remembered merchants and craftsmen and students some fueled with grog some with righteousness the hoisting and smashing of the chests of the damned and detested tea the satisfying splash as broken crates of it hit the cold water of boston harbor at griffins wharf he remembered how disgorged chests had been heaped up in the muck of low tide like stacks of hay so large a cup of tea for the fishes he thought now aye they had been merry but purposeful determined united they would need to be all of those things to fight and win the war that so many didnt understand had already begun how long had it been since that glorious night one day two it had been his bad luck that he had run into two drunk and edgy redcoats as dawn had been breaking they knew him his face his name his politics were wellknown in boston hed done nothing to endear himself to the british militia perhaps they had only meant to harass and bully him a bit perhaps they hadnt meant to make good their threat to arrest him on charges they hadnt made clear but when one had drawn a sword macgregors weapon had all but leaped into his own hand the fight had been brief and foolish he could admit now he was still unsure if he had killed or only wounded the impetuous soldier but his comrade had had murder in his eye when he had drawn his weapon though macgregor had been quick to mount and ride the musket ball had slammed viciously into his shoulder he could feel it now throbbing against muscle though the rest of his body was mercifully numb he could feel that small and agonizing pinpoint of heat then his mind was numb as well and he felt nothing he woke painfully he was lying in the blanket of snow faceup so that he could see dimly the swirl of white flakes against a heavy gray sky hed fallen from his horse he wasnt close enough to death to escape the embarrassment of it with effort he pushed himself to his knees the mare was waiting patiently beside him eyeing him with a mild sort of surprise ill trust you to keep this to yourself lass it was the weak sound of his own voice that brought him the first trace of fear gritting his teeth he reached for the reins and pulled himself shakily to his feet shelter he swayed grayed out and knew he could never find the strength to mount holding tight he clucked to the mare and let her pull his weary body along step after step he fought the urge to collapse and let the cold take him they said there was little pain in freezing to death like sleep it was a cold painless sleep and how the devil did they know unless theyd lived to tell the tale he laughed at the thought but the laugh turned to a cough that weakened him time distance direction were utterly lost to him he tried to think of his family the warmth of them his parents and brothers and sisters in scotland beloved scotland where they fought to keep hope alive his aunts and uncles and cousins in virginia where they worked for the right to a new life in a new land and he he was somewhere between caught between his love of the old and his fascination with the new but in either land there was one common enemy it strengthened him to think of it the british damn them they had proscribed his name and butchered his people now they were reaching their greedy hands across the ocean so that the halfmad english king could impose his bloody laws and collect his bloody taxes he stumbled and his hold on the reins nearly broke for a moment he rested his head against the mares neck his eyes closed his fathers face seemed to float into his mind his eyes still bright with pride make a place for yourself hed told his son never forget youre a macgregor no he wouldnt forget wearily he opened his eyes he saw through the swirling snow the shape of a building cautious he blinked rubbed his tired eyes with his free hand still the shape remained gray and indistinct but real well lass he leaned heavily against his horse perhaps this isnt the day to die after all step by step he trudged toward it it was a barn a large one well built of pine logs his numb fingers fumbled with the latch his knees threatened to buckle then he was inside with the smell and the blessed heat of animals it was dark he moved by instinct to a mound of hay in the stall of a brindled cow the bovine lady objected with a nervous moo it was the last sound he heard alanna pulled on her woolen cape the fire in the kitchen hearth burned brightly and smelled faintly cheerfully of apple logs it was a small thing a normal thing but it pleased her shed woken in a mood of happy anticipation it was the snow she imagined though her father had risen from his bed cursing it she loved the purity of it the way it clung to the bare branches of trees her father and brothers had yet to clear it was already slowing and within the hour the barnyard would be tracked with footprints hers included there were animals to tend to eggs to gather harnesses to repair and wood to chop but for now for just a moment she looked out the small window and enjoyed if her father caught her at it he would shake his head and call her a dreamer it would be said roughly not with anger she thought but with regret her mother had been a dreamer but she had died before her dream of a home and land and plenty had been fully realized cyrus murphy wasnt a hard man alanna thought now he never had been it had been death too many deaths that had caused him to become rough and prickly two bairns and later their beloved mother another son beautiful young rory lost in the war against the french her own husband alanna mused sweet michael flynn taken in a less dramatic way but taken nonetheless she didnt often think of michael after all she had been three months a wife and three years a widow but he had been a kind man and a good one and she regretted bitterly that they had never had the chance to make a family but today wasnt a day for old sorrows she reminded herself pulling up the hood of her cape she stepped outside today was a day for promises for beginnings christmas was coming fast she was determined to make it a joyful one already shed spent hours at her spinning wheel and loom there were new mufflers and mittens and caps for her brothers blue for johnny and red for brian for her father she had painted a miniature of her mother and had paid the local silversmith a lot of pennies for a frame she knew her choices would please just as the meal she had planned for their christmas feast would please it was all that mattered to her keeping her family together and happy and safe the door of the barn was unlatched with a sound of annoyance she pulled it to behind her it was a good thing she had found it so she thought rather than her father or her young brother brian would have earned the raw side of his tongue as she stepped inside the barn she shook her hood back and reached automatically for the wooden buckets that hung beside the door because there was little light she took a lamp lighting it carefully by the time she had finished the milking brian and johnny would come to feed the stock and clean the stalls then she would gather the eggs and fix her men a hearty breakfast she started to hum as she walked down the wide aisle in the center of the barn then she stopped dead as she spotted the roan mare standing slack hipped and weary beside the cow stall sweet jesus she put a hand to her heart as it lurched the mare blew a greeting and shifted if there was a horse there was a rider at twenty alanna wasnt young enough or naive enough to believe all travelers were friendly and meant no harm to a woman alone she could have turned and run sent up a shout for her father and brothers but though she had taken michael flynns name she was born a murphy a murphy protected his own head up she started forward ill have your name and your business she said only the horse answered her when she was close enough she touched the mare on her nose what kind of a master have you who leaves you standing wet and saddled incensed for the horses sake she set down her buckets and raised her voice all right come out with you its murphy land youre on the cows mooed with a hand on her hip she looked around no ones begrudging you shelter from the storm she continued or a decent breakfast for that matter but ill have a word with you for leaving your horse so when there was still no answer her temper rose muttering she began to uncinch the saddle herself and nearly tripped over a pair of boots fine boots at that she thought staring down at them they poked out of the cow stall their good brown leather dulled with snow and mud she stepped quietly closer to see them attached to a pair of long muscled legs in worn buckskin sure and there was a yard of them she thought nibbling on her lip and gloriously masculine in the loosefitting breeches creeping closer she saw hips lean a narrow waist belted with leather and a torso covered with a long doublet and a fur wrap a finer figure of a man she couldnt remember seeing and since hed chosen her barn to sleep she found it only right that she look her fill he was a big one she decided tilting her head and holding the lamp higher taller than either of her brothers she leaned closer wanting to see the rest of him his hair was dark not brown she realized as she narrowed her eyes but deep red like brians chestnut gelding he wore no beard but there was stubble on his chin and around his full handsome mouth aye handsome she decided with feminine appreciation a strong bony face aristocratic somehow with its high brow and chiseled features the kind of face a womans heart would flutter over she was sure but she wasnt interested in fluttering or flirting she wanted the man up and out of her way so that she could get to her milking sir she nudged his boot with the toe of hers no response setting her hands on her hips she decided he was drunk as a lord what else was there that caused a man to sleep as though dead wake up you sod i cant milk around you she kicked him none too gently in the leg and got only a faint groan for an answer all right boyo she bent down to give him a good shake she was prepared for the stench of liquor but instead caught the coppery odor of blood anger forgotten she knelt down to carefully push aside the thick fur over his shoulders she sucked in a breath as she saw the long stain along his shirtfront her fingers were wet with his blood as she felt for a pulse well youre still alive she murmured with gods will and a bit of luck we might keep you that way before she could rise to call her brothers his hand clamped over her wrist his eyes were open now she saw they were green with just a hint of blue like the sea but there was pain in them compassion had her leaning closer to offer comfort then her hand plunged deep into the hay as he tugged her off balance so that she was all but lying on him she had the quick impression of a firm body and raging heat her sound of indignation was muffled against his lips the kiss was brief but surprisingly firm before his head fell back again he gave her a quick cocky smile well im not dead anyway lips like yours would have no place in hell as compliments went shed had better before she could tell him so he fainted chapter two contents prev next he drifted on a turbulent sea that was pain and relief and pain whiskey the good clean kick of it warming his belly and dulling his senses yet over it he remembered a searing agony a hot knife plunged into his flesh curses raining on his head a warm hand clutching his in comfort in restraint blissfully cool cloths on his fevered brow hateful liquid poured down his throat he cried out had he cried out had someone come all soft hands soft voice lavender scent to soothe him had there been music a womans voice low and lovely singing in gaelic scotland was he is scotland but no when the voice spoke to him it was without that soft familiar burr but instead with the dreamy brogue of ireland the ship had the ship gone astray and taken him south instead of home he remembered a ship but the ship had been in port men laughing among themselves their faces blackened and painted axes swinging the tea the cursed tea ah yes he remembered there was some comfort in that they had taken their stand he had been shot not then but after at dawn a mistake a foolish one then there had been snow and pain he had awakened to a woman a beautiful woman a man could ask for little more than to wake to a beautiful woman whether he awakened live or dead the thought made him smile as he opened his heavy eyes as dreams went this one had its virtues then he saw her sitting at a loom beneath a window where the sun was strong it glistened on her hair hair as black as the wing of any raven that flew in the forest she wore a plain wool dress in dark blue with a white apron over it he could see that she was wand slender her hands graceful as they worked the loom with a rhythmic click and clack she set a red pattern among deep green wool she sang as she worked and it was her voice he recognized the same voice had sung to comfort him when he had toiled through the hot and the cold of his dreams he could see only her profile pale skin of white and rose a faint curve to a mouth that was wide and generous with the hint of a dimple beside it a small nose that seemed to tilt up just a bit at the tip peaceful just watching her gave him such a full sense of peace that he was tempted to close his eyes and sleep again but he wanted to see her all of her and he needed her to tell him where he was the moment he stirred alannas head came up she turned toward him he could see her eyes now as deep and rich a blue as sapphires as he watched struggling for the strength to speak she rose smoothed her skirts and walked toward him her hand was cool on his brow and familiar briskly but with hands that were infinitely gentle she checked his bandage so have you joined the living then she asked him as she moved to a nearby table and poured something into a pewter cup youd know the answer to that better than i he managed she chuckled as she held the cup to his lips the scent was familiar as well and unwelcome what the devil is this whats good for you she told him and poured it ruthlessly down his throat when he glared she laughed again youve spit it back at me enough times that ive learned to take no chances how long how long have you been with us she touched his forehead again his fever had broken during the last long night and her gesture was one of habit two days its the twentieth of december my horse shes well alanna nodded pleased that he had thought of his mount youd do well to sleep some more and ill be fixing you some broth to strengthen you mr macgregor he answered ian macgregor rest then mr macgregor but his hand reached for hers such a small hand he thought irrelevantly to be so competent your name alanna flynn his was a good hand she thought not as rough as das or her brothers but hard youre welcome here until you are fit thank you he kept her hand in his toying with her fingers in a way that she would have thought flirtatious if he hadnt just come out of a fever then she remembered he had kissed her when hed been bleeding to death in her barn and carefully removed her hand he grinned at her there was no other way to describe that quick curve of lips im in your debt miss flynn aye that you are she rose all dignity and its mrs flynn he couldnt remember a swifter or weightier disappointment not that he minded flirting with married women if they were agreeable but he would never have considered taking it further than a few smiles and murmurs with another mans woman it was a bloody shame he thought as he studied alanna flynn a sad and bloody shame im grateful to you mrs flynn and to your husband give your gratitude to my father she softened the order with a smile that made her dimple deepen he was a rogue of that she hadnt a doubt but he was also a weak one and at the moment in her care this is his house and hell be back soon with her hands on her hips she looked at him his color was better she noted though the good lord knew he could use a good clipping on that mane of hair he wore and a shave wouldnt have hurt him despite it he was an excellentlooking man and because she was woman enough to have recognized the light in his eyes when he looked at her she would keep her guard up if youre not going to sleep you might as well eat ill get that broth she left him to go into the kitchen her heels clicking lightly on the plank floor alone ian lay still and let his gaze wander over the room alanna flynns father had done well for himself ian mused the windows were glazed the walls whitewashed his pallet was set near the fire and its stone hearth was scrubbed clean above it was a mantelpiece of the same native stone on it candles were set and a pair of painted china dishes there were two fowling pieces above it all and a good flintlock as well the loom was under the window and in the comer was a spinning wheel the furniture showed not a speck of dust and was brightened a bit by a few needlepoint cushions there was a scent apples baking he thought and spiced meats a comfortable home he thought hacked out of the wilderness a man had to respect another who could make his mark like this and a man would have to fight to keep what he had made there were things worth fighting for worth dying for his land his name his woman his freedom ian was more than ready to lift his sword as he tried to sit up the cozy room spun isnt it just like a man alanna came back with a bowl of broth undoing all my work sit still youre weak as a babe and twice as fretful mrs flynn eat first talk later out of selfdefense he swallowed the first spoonful of broth she shoveled into his mouth the broth is tasty mistress but i can feed myself and spill it all over my clean linens in the bargain no thank you you need your strength she placated him as she would have her own brothers you lost a great deal of blood before you got to us more when the ball was removed she spoke as she spooned up broth and her hand didnt tremble but her heart did there was the scent of herbs and her own lavender fragrance ian began to think being fed had its advantages if it hadnt been so cold she continued you would have bled all the quicker and died in the forest so ive nature as well as you to thank she gave him a measured look its said the lord works in mysterious ways apparently he saw fit to keep you alive after youd done your best to die and put me in the hands of a neighbor he smiled again charmingly ive never been to ireland but im told its beautiful so my father says i was born here but theres ireland on your tongue and scotland on yours its been five years since ive seen scotland this time a shadow came and went in his eyes ive been spending some time in boston i was educated there and have mends educated she had already recognized his schooling by his speech and envied him for it harvard he smiled a little i see and she envied him all the more if her mother had lived ah but her mother had died and alanna had never had more than a hornbook to learn to write and read youre a ways from boston now a days ride would you be having any family or friends who will worry no no one to worry he wanted to touch her it was wrong against his own code of honor but he wanted to see if her cheek could be as beautifully soft as it looked if her hair would feel as thick and heavy her mouth as sweet her lashes lifted and her eyes clear and cool met his for a moment he could see only her face drifting over his and he remembered he had already tasted those lips once despite his best intentions his gaze lowered to them lingered when she stiffened his eyes flickered up there was not so much apology in them as amusement i must beg your pardon mrs flynn i was not myself when you found me in the barn you came to yourself quickly enough she snapped back and made him laugh until he winced at the pain then ill beg your pardon all the more and hope your husband wont call me out theres little danger of that hes been dead these three years he looked up quickly but she only shoveled another spoonful of broth in his mouth though god might strike him dead he couldnt say he was sorry to hear flynn had gone to his maker after all ian reasoned it wasnt as if he had known the man and what better way to spend a day or two than recovering in the lap of a pretty young widow alanna scented desire the way a hound scents deer and was up and out of reach youll rest now i feel that ive rested weeks already lord she was a lovely thing all curves and colors he tried his most ingratiating smile could i trouble you to help me to a chair id feel more myself if i could sit perhaps look out the window she hesitated not because she was afraid she couldnt move him alanna considered herself strong as an ox but she didnt trust the gleam shed seen come and go in his eyes all right then but youll lean on me and take it slow with gladness he took her hand and raised it to his lips before she could snatch it away he turned it over and brushed his lips as no man ever had over the cup of her palm her heart bounded into her throat you have eyes the color of jewels i once saw around the neck of the queen of france sapphires he murmured a seductive word she didnt move couldnt never in her life had a man looked at her this way she felt the heat rush up from the knot in her belly along her suddenly taut breasts up her throat where her pulse hammered and into her face then he smiled that quick crooked shifting of lips she snatched her hand away youre a rogue mr macgregor aye mrs flynn but that doesnt make the words less true youre beautiful just as your name says alanna he lingered over each syllable she knew better than to fall for flattery but the center of her palm still burned its my name and youll wait till youre asked to use it it was with relief that she heard the sounds outside the house her brow lifted a bit when she saw that ian had heard them as well and braced thatll be my father and brothers if youd still be having a mind to sit by the window theyll help you so saying she moved to the door they would be cold and hungry she thought and would gobble down the meat pies and the apple tarts she had made without a thought for the time and care she had given them her father would fret more over what hadnt been done than what had johnny would think about how soon he could ride into the village to court young mary wyeth brian would put his nose into one of the books he loved and read by the fire until his head drooped they came in bringing cold and melting snow and loud masculine voices ian relaxed as he noted it was indeed her family perhaps it was foolish to think the british would have tracked him all this way in the snow but he wasnt a man to let down his guard he saw three men or two men and a boy nearly grown the elder man was barely taller than alanna and toughly built his face was reddened and toughened by years of wind and weather his eyes a paler version of his daughters he took off his work cap and beneath it his hair was thin and sandy the older son had the look of him but with more height and less bulk there was an ease and patience in his face that his father lacked the younger matched his brother inch for inch but there was the dew of youth still on his cheeks he had the same coloring as his sister our guest is awake alanna announced and three pairs of eyes turned to him ian macgregor this is my father cyrus murphy and my brothers john and brian macgregor cyrus said in a voice that rumbled an awkward name despite the pain ian stiffened and pushed himself as straight as possible one im proud of a man should be proud of his name cyrus said as he took ians measure its all hes born with im glad you decided to live for the grounds frozen and we couldnt have buried you till spring its a bit of a relief to me as well satisfied with the answer cyrus nodded well wash for supper johnny alanna detained her brother with a hand on his arm will you help mr macgregor into the chair by the window before you eat with a quick grin johnny looked at ian youre built like an oak macgregor we had the very devil of a time getting you into the house give me a hand here brian thanks ian bit back a groan as he lifted his arms over the two pairs of shoulders cursing his watery legs he vowed to be up and walking on his own by the next day but he was sweating by the time they settled him into the chair youre doing well enough for a man who cheated death johnny told him understanding well the frustrations of any sick man i feel like i drank a case of grog then took to the high seas in a storm aye johnny slapped his good shoulder in a friendly manner alanna will fix you up he left to wash for supper already scenting the spiced meat mr macgregor brian stood in front of him there was both a shyness and intensity in his eyes youd be too young to have fought in the fortyfive when ians brow lifted the boy continued hurriedly ive read all about it the stuart rebellion and the bonny prince and all the battles but youd be too young to have fought i was born in ian told him during the battle of culloden my father fought in the rebellion my grandfather died in it the intense blue eyes widened then you could tell me more than i can find in books aye ian smiled a little i could tell you more brian alannas voice was sharp mr macgregor needs to rest and you need to eat brian edged back but he watched ian we could talk after supper if youre not weary ian ignored alannas stormy looks and smiled at the boy id like that alanna waited until brian was out of earshot when she spoke the barely controlled fury in her voice surprised ian i wont have you filling his head with the glory of war and battles and causes he looked old enough to decide what he wants to talk about hes a boy yet and his head is easily filled with nonsense with tense fingers she pleated the skirt of her apron but her eyes remained level and uncompromising i may not be able to stop him from running off to the village green to drill but ill have no talk of war in my house there will be more than talk and soon ian said mildly its foolish for a man and a woman not to prepare for it she paled but kept her chin firm there will be no war in this house she repeated and fled to the kitchen chapter three contents prev next ian awoke early the next morning to watery winter sunlight and the good yeasty smell of baking bread for a moment he lay quiet enjoying the sounds and scents of morning behind him the fire burned low and bright shooting out comforting heat from the direction of the kitchen came alannas voice this time she sang in english for a few minutes he was too enchanted with the sound itself to pay attention to the lyrics once they penetrated his eyes widened first in surprise then in amusement it was a bawdy little ditty more suitable to sailors or drunks than a proper young widow so he thought the lovely alanna had a ribald sense of humor he liked her all the better for it though he doubted her tongue would have tripped so lightly over the words if she had known she had an audience trying to move quietly he eased his legs from the pallet the business of standing took some doing and left him dizzy and weak and infuriated he had to wait wheezing like an old man one big hand pressed for support against the wall when he had his breath back he took one tentative step forward the room tilted and he clenched his teeth until it righted again his arm throbbed mightily concentrating on the pain he was able to take another step and another grateful that no one was there to see his tedious and shambling progress it was a lowering thought that one small steel ball could fell a macgregor the fact that the ball had been english pushed him to place one foot in front of the other his legs felt as though theyd been filled with water and a cold sweat lay on his brow and the back of his neck but in his heart was a fierce pride if he had been spared to fight again he would damn well fight and he couldnt fight until he could walk when he reached the kitchen doorway exhausted and drenched with the effort alanna was singing a christmas hymn she seemed to find no inconsistency in crooning about amply endowed women one moment and heralding angels the next it hardly mattered to ian what she sang as he stood watching listening he knew as sure as he knew a macgregor would always live in the highlands that her voice would follow him to his grave he would never forget it the clear rich notes the faint huskiness that made him imagine her with her hair unbound and spread over a pillow his pillow he realized with a quick jolt it was there he wanted her without a doubt and so strongly that he could all but feel the smooth silky tresses shift through his fingers most of those thick raven locks were tucked under a white cap now it should have given her a prim and proper look yet some strands escaped to trail seductively he thought along the back of her neck he could easily imagine what it would be like to trail his fingers just so to feel her skin heat and her body move against his would she be as agile in bed as she was at the stove perhaps he wasnt so weak after all ian mused if every time he saw this woman his blood began to stir and his mind shot unerringly down one particular path if he hadnt been afraid he would fall on his face and mortify himself he would have crossed the room and spun her around against him into him so that he could steal a kiss instead he waited hopefully for his legs to strengthen she kneaded one batch of dough while another baked he could see her small capable hands push and prod and mold patiently tirelessly as he watched her his rebellious mind filled with such gloriously lusty thoughts that he groaned alanna whirled quickly her hands still wrapped around the ball of dough her first thoughts shamed her for when she saw him filling the doorway dressed in rough trousers and a full open shirt she wondered how she might lure him to kiss her hand again disgusted with herself she slapped the dough down and hurried toward him his face was dead white and he was beginning to teeter from previous experience she knew that if he hit the ground shed have the very devil of a time getting him back into bed there now mr macgregor lean on me since the kitchen chair was closer and he was of a considerable weight she led him to that before she rounded on him idiot she said with relish more than real heat but most men are ive found youd best not have opened your wound again for ive just scrubbed this floor and wouldnt care to have blood on it aye mistress it was a weak rejoinder but the best he could do when her scent was clouding his mind and her face was bent so close to his he could have counted each one of her silky black eyelashes you had only to call you know she said mollified a bit when she noted his bandage was dry as she might have for one of her brothers alanna began to fasten his shirt ian was forced to suppress another groan i had to try my legs his blood wasnt just stirring now but was racing hot as a result his voice had a roughened edge i can hardly get on my feet again by lying on my back youll get up when i say and not before with this she moved away and began to mix something in a pewter cup ian caught the scent and winced ill not have any more of that slop youll drink it and be grateful she slapped the cup on the tabletop if you want anything else in your belly he glared at her in a way he knew had made grown men back away or run for cover she simply placed her fisted hands on her hips and glared back his eyes narrowed so did hers youre angry because i talked with young brian last night her chin lifted just an inch but it was enough to give her anger an elegant haughtiness and if youd been resting instead of jabbering about the glory of war youd not be so weak and irritable this morning im not irritable or weak when she snorted he wished fervently that he had the strength to stand aye then hed have kissed her to swooning and shown her what a macgregor was made of if im irritable he said between clenched teeth its because im near to starving she smiled at him pleased to hold the upper hand youll get your breakfast after youve drained that cup and not a moment before with a twitch of her skirts she returned to her bread making while her back was turned ian looked around for a handy place to dump the foultasting liquid finding none he folded his arms and scowled at her alannas lips curved she hadnt been raised in a house filled with men for naught she knew exactly what was going through ians mind he was stubborn she thought as she pushed the heels of her hands into the dough but so was she she began to hum he no longer thought about kissing her but gave grave consideration to throttling her here he sat hungry as a bear with the enticing smell of bread baking and all she would give him was a cup of slop still humming alanna put the bread into a bowl for rising and covered it with a clean cloth easily ignoring ian she checked the oven and judged her loaves were done to a turn when she set them on a rack to cool their scent flooded the kitchen he had his pride ian thought but what good was pride if a man expired of hunger shed pay for it he promised himself as he lifted the cup and drained it alanna made certain her back was to him when she grinned without a word she heated a skillet in short order she set a plate before him heaped with eggs and a thick slab of the fresh bread to this she added a small crock of butter and a cup of steaming coffee while he ate she busied herself scrubbing out the skillet washing the counters so that not a scrap of dough or flour remained she was a woman who prized her mornings alone who enjoyed her kitchen domain and the hundreds of chores it entailed yet she didnt resent his presence there though she knew he watched her with his steady seacolored eyes oddly it seemed natural even familiar somehow that he sit at her table and sample her cooking no she didnt resent his presence but neither could she relax in it the silence that stretched between them no longer seemed colored by temper on either side but it was tinted with something else something that made her nerves stretch and her heart thud uncomfortably against her ribs needing to break it she turned to him he was indeed watching her she noted not with temper but with interest it was a weak word for what she saw in his eyes but a safe one alanna had a sudden need to feel safe a gentleman would thank me for the meal his lips curved in such a way that let her know he was only a gentleman if and when he chose to be i do thank you mrs flynn most sincerely i wonder if i might beg another cup of coffee his words were proper enough but she didnt quite trust the look in his eyes she kept out of reach as she picked up his cup tea would be better for you she said almost to herself but we dont drink it in this house in protest aye we wont have the cursed stuff until the king sees reason others make more foolish and dangerous protests he watched her lift the pot from the stove such as she moved her shoulders johnny heard word that the sons of liberty arranged to destroy crates of tea that were sitting in three ships in boston harbor they disguised themselves as indians and boarded the ships all but under the guns of three menofwar before the night was done they had tossed all of the east indian companys property into the water and you think this foolish daring certainly she said with another restless movement even heroic especially in brians eyes but foolish because it will only cause the king to impose even harsher measures she set the cup before him so you believe it best to do nothing when injustice is handed out with a generous hand simply to sit like a trained dog and accept the boot murphy blood rose to her cheeks no king lives forever ah so we wait until mad george cocks up his toes rather than stand now for what is right weve seen enough war and heartache in this house there will only be more alanna until its settled settled she shot back as he calmly sipped his coffee settled by sticking feathers in our hair and smashing crates of tea settled as it was for the wives and mothers of those who fell at lexington and for what for graves and tears for liberty he said for justice words she shook her head words dont die men do men must of old age or at swords point can you believe it better to bow under the english chains over and over until our backs break or should we stand tall and fight for what is ours by right she felt a frisson of fear as she watched his eyes glow you speak like a rebel macgregor like an american he corrected like a son of liberty i should have guessed as much she murmured she snatched up his plate set it aside then unable to stop herself marched back to him was the sinking of the tea worth your life absently he touched a hand to his shoulder a miscalculation he said and nothing that really pertains to our little tea party tea party she looked up at the ceiling how like a man to make light of insurrection and how like a woman to wring her hands at the thought of a fight her gaze flew back down and locked with his i dont wring my hands she said precisely and certainly wouldnt shed a tear over the likes of you his tone changed so swiftly she blinked ah but youll miss me when ive gone the devil she muttered and fought back a grin now go back to bed i doubt im strong enough to make it on my own she heaved a sigh but walked to him to offer him a shoulder he took the shoulder and the rest of her in one quick move she was in his lap she cursed him with an expertise he was forced to admire hold now he told her differences in politics aside youre a pretty package alanna and ive discovered its been too long since ive held a warm woman in my arms son of a toad she managed and struck out he winced as the pain shimmered down his wounded arm my father would take exception to that sweetheart im not your sweetheart you posturing spawn of a weasel keep this up and youll open my wound and have my blood all over your clean floor nothing would give me more pleasure charmed he grinned and caught her chin in his hand for one who talks so righteously about the evils of war youre a bloodthirsty wench she cursed him until she ran out of breath her brother john had said nothing but the truth when hed claimed that ian was built like an oak no matter how she squirmed absolutely delighting him she remained held fast a pox on you she managed and on your whole clan hed intended to pay her back for making him drink the filthy medicine shed mixed hed only pulled her into his lap to cause her discomfort then as shed wiggled hed thought it only right that he tease her a little and indulge himself with just one kiss one quick stolen kiss after all she was already fuming in fact he was laughing as he covered her mouth with his it was meant in fun as much a joke on himself as on her and he wanted to hear the new batch of curses she would heap on his head when he was done but his laughter died quickly her struggling body went stone still one quick friendly kiss he tried to remind himself but his head was reeling he found himself as dizzy and as weak as hed been when hed first set his watery legs on the floor this had nothing to do with a wound several days old yet there was a pain a sweet ache that spread and shifted through the whole of him he wondered dazedly if he had been spared not only to fight again but to be given the gift of this one perfect kiss she didnt fight him in her womans heart she knew she should yet in that same heart she understood that she could not her body rigid with the first shock softened yielded accepted gentle and rough all at once she thought his lips were cool and smooth against hers while the stubble of his beard scraped against her skin she heard her own sigh as her lips parted then tasted his on her tongue she laid a hand on his cheek adding sweetness he dragged his through her hair adding passion for one dazzling moment he deepened the kiss taking her beyond what she knew and into what she had only dreamed she tasted the richness of his mouth felt the ironhard breath of his chest then heard his sharp quick curse as he dragged himself away he could only stare at her it unnerved him that he could do little else he had dislodged her cap so that her hair streamed like black rain over her shoulders her eyes were so dark so big so blue against the creamy flush of her skin that he was afraid he might drown in them this was a woman who could make him forget about duty about honor about justice this was a woman he realized who could make him crawl on his knees for one kind word he was a macgregor he could never forget he could never crawl i beg your pardon mistress his voice was stiffly polite and so cold she felt all the warmth leach out of her body that was inexcusable carefully she got to her feet with blurred vision she searched the floor for her cap finding it she stood straight as a spear and looked over his shoulder i would ask you again macgregor to go back to your bed she didnt move a muscle until he was gone then she dashed away an annoying tear and went back to work she would not think of it she promised herself she would not think of him she took out her frustrations on the newly risen dough chapter four contents prev next christmas had always given alanna great joy preparing for it was a pleasure to her the cooking the baking the sewing and cleaning she had always made it a policy to forgive slights both small and large in the spirit of giving she looked forward to putting on her best dress and riding into the village for mass but as this christmas approached she was by turns depressed and irritated too often she caught herself being snappish with her brothers impatient with her father she became teary over a burnt cake then stormed out of the house when johnny tried to joke her out of it sitting on a rock by the icy stream she dropped her chin onto her hands and took herself to task it wasnt fair for her to take out her temper on her family theyd done nothing to deserve it she had chosen the easy way out by snapping at them when the one she truly wanted to roast was ian macgregor she kicked at the crusty snow oh hed kept his distance in the past two days the coward hed managed to gain his feet and slink out to the barn like the weasel he was her father was grateful for the help with the tack and animals but alanna knew the real reason macgregor had taken himself off to clean stalls and repair harnesses he was afraid of her her lips pursed in a smug smile aye he was afraid she would call down the wrath of hell on his head as well she should what kind of man was it who kissed a woman until she was blind and deaf to all but him then politely excused himself as if he had inadvertently trod on her foot hed had no right to kiss her and less to ignore what had happened when he had why she had saved his life she thought with a toss of her head that was the truth of it she had saved him and he had repaid her by making her want him as no virtuous woman should want a man not her husband but want him she did and in ways so different from the calm comforting manner she had wanted michael flynn that she couldnt describe them it was madness of course he was a rebel once and forever such men made history and widows out of wives all she wanted was a quiet life with children of her own and a house to tend to she wanted a man who would come and sleep beside her night after night through all the years a man who would be content to sit by the fire at night and talk over with her the day that had passed such a man was not ian macgregor no she had recognized in him the same burning she had seen in rorys eyes there were those who were born to be warriors and nothing and no one could sway them there were those who were destined before birth to fight for causes and to die on the battlefield so had been rory her eldest brother and the one she had loved the best and so was ian macgregor a man she had known for days only and could never afford to love as she sat brooding a shadow fell over her she tensed turned then managed to smile when she saw it was her young brother brian its safe enough she told him when he hung back a bit im no longer in the mood to toss anyone in the stream the cake wasnt bad once you cut away the burnt edges she narrowed her eyes to make him laugh could be ill take it in my mind to send you swimming after all but brian knew better once alannas hot temper was cooled she rarely fired up again youd only feel badly when i took to bed with a chill and you had to douse me with medicine and poultices look ive brought you a present he held out the holly wreath hed hidden behind his back i thought you might put ribbons on it and hang it on the door for christmas she took it and held it gently it was awkwardly made and that much more dear brian was better with his mind than with his hands have i been such a shrew aye he plopped down into the snow at her feet but i know you cant stay in a black mood with christmas almost here no she smiled at the wreath i suppose not alanna do you think ian will be staying with us for christmas dinner her smile became a frown quickly i couldnt say he seems to be mending quickly enough da says hes handy to have around even if he isnt a farmer absently brian began to ball snow and he knows so much imagine going to harvard and reading all those books aye her agreement was wistful for herself and for brian if weve a good harvest the next few years brian youll go away to school i swear it he said nothing it was something he yearned for more than breath and something hed already accepted he would live without having ian here is almost as good he knows things alannas mouth pursed aye im sure he does he gave me the loan of a book he had in his saddlebag its shakespeares henry v it tells all about the young king harry and wonderful battles battles she thought again it seemed men thought of little else from the moment they were weaned undaunted by her silence brian chattered on its even better to listen to him brian continued enthusiastically he told me about how his family fought in scotland his aunt married an englishman a jacobite and they fled to america after the rebellion was crushed they have a plantation in virginia and grow tobacco he has another aunt and uncle who came to america too though his father and mother still live in scotland in the highlands it seems a wondrous place alanna with steep cliffs and deep lakes and he was born in a house in the forest on the very day his father was fighting the english at culloden she thought of a woman struggling through the pangs of labor and decided both male and female fought their own battles the female for life the male for death after the battle brian went on the english butchered the survivors he was looking out over the narrow icepacked stream and didnt notice how his sisters gaze flew to him the wounded the surrendering even people who were working in fields nearby they hounded and chased the rebels cutting them down where they found them some they closed up in a barn and burned alive sweet jesus she had never paid attention to talk of war but this kept her riveted and horrified ians family lived in a cave while the english searched the hills for rebels ians aunt the one on the plantation killed a redcoat herself shot him when he tried to murder her wounded husband alanna swallowed deeply i believe mr macgregor exaggerates brian turned his deep intense eyes on her no he said simply do you think it will come to that here alanna when the rebellion begins she squeezed the wreath hard enough for a sprig of holly to pierce through her mittens there will be no rebellion in time the government will become more reasonable and if ian macgregor says any different it isnt only ian even johnny says so and the men in the village ian says that the destruction of tea in boston is only the beginning of a revolution that was inevitable the moment george iii took the throne ian says its time to throw off the british shackles and count ourselves for what we are free men ian says she rose skirts swaying i think ian says entirely too much take the wreath in the house for me brian ill hang it as soon as im done brian watched his sister storm off it seemed that there would be at least one more outburst before her black mood passed ian enjoyed working in the barn more he enjoyed being able to work at all his arm and shoulder were still stiff but the pain had passed and thanks to all the saints alanna hadnt forced any of her foul concoctions on him that day alanna he didnt want to think about her to ease his mind he set aside the tack he was soaping and picked up a brush he would groom his horse in preparation for the journey he had been putting off for two days he should be gone ian reminded himself he was surely well mended enough to travel short distances though it might be unwise to show his face in boston for a time he could travel by stages to virginia and spend a few weeks with his aunt uncle and cousins the letter he had given brian to take to the village should be on its way by ship to scotland and his family they would know he was alive and well and that he wouldnt be with them for christmas he knew his mother would weep a little though she had other children and grandchildren she would be saddened that her firstborn was away when the family gathered for the christmas feast he could see it in his mind the blazing fires the glowing candles he could smell the rich smells of cooking hear the laughter and singing and with a pang that was so sudden it left him breathless he hurt from the loss yet though he loved his family he knew his place was here a world away aye there was work to do here he reminded himself as he stroked the mares coat there were men he had to contact once he knew it was safe samuel adams john avery paul revere and he must have news of the climate in boston and other cities now that the deed was done yet he lingered when he should have been away daydreamed when he should have been plotting he had sensibly he thought kept his distance from alanna but in his mind she was never more than a thought away there you are and she was there her breath puffing out in quick white streams her hands on her hips her hood had fallen from her head and her hair swung loose inky black against the plain gray fabric of her dress aye because his knuckles had whitened on the brush he made an effort to relax his hand its here i am what business are you about filling a young boys head with nonsense would you have him heave a musket over his shoulder and challenge the first redcoat he comes to i gather you are speaking of brian he said when she stopped to take a breath but when i go a step further than that i lose my way would you had lost it before you ever came here agitated she began to pace her eyes were so hot a blue he wondered they didnt fire the straw underfoot trouble and only trouble from the first minute i came across you sprawled halfdead in the hay if id only known then what ive come to know now i might have ignored my christian duty and let you bleed to death he smiled he couldnt help it and started to speak but she plunged on first you nearly pull me down in the hay with you kissing me even though youd a ball in you then almost on the moment when you open your eyes youre kissing my hand and telling me im beautiful i ought to be flogged he said with a grin imagine telling you that youre beautiful floggings too kind for the likes of you she snapped with a toss of her head then two days ago after id fixed you breakfast which is more than a man like you deserves indeed it is he agreed keep quiet until im done after id fixed you breakfast you drag me down on your lap as though i were a a common do words fail you doxy she spit out and dared him to laugh and like the great oaf you are you held me there against my will and kissed me and was kissed right back sweetheart he patted his horses neck and very well too she huffed and stammered how dare you thats difficult to answer unless youre more specific if youre asking how i dared kiss you ill have to confess it was more a matter of not being able to stop myself youve a mouth thats made for it alanna she felt herself go hot and began to pace again on unsteady legs well you got over it quickly enough his brow lifted so she wasnt in a temper over the kiss but over the fact that hed stopped looking at her now in the dim light of the barn he wondered how hed managed to do so and knew he wouldnt again if its my restraint that troubles you sweetheart dont call me that not now not ever gamely he swallowed a chuckle as you wish mrs flynn as i was saying i told you to be still until ive finished she stopped to catch her breath where was i we were talking about kissing eyes glowing he took a step toward her why dont i refresh your memory dont come near me she warned and snatched up a pitchfork i was simply using that as a reference to the trouble youve caused now on top of everything else youve got brians eyes shining over the thought of a revolution i wont have it macgregor hes just a boy if the lad asks questions ill give him true answers and make them sound romantic and heroic in the bargain i wont see him caught up in wars others make and lose him as i did my brother rory it wont be a war others make alanna he circled her carefully keeping away from the business end of the pitchfork when the time comes well all make it and well win it you can save your words good quick as a flash he grabbed the staff of the pitchfork dodged the tines and hauled her against him im tired of talking when he kissed her this time he was prepared for the jolt it was no less devastating no less exciting her face was cold and he used his lips to warm it running them over her skin until he felt them both begin to shudder he dragged a hand through her hair until he cupped the back of her neck his other arm banded her hard against him for gods sake kiss me back alanna he murmured it against her mouth his eyes were open and hot on hers ill go mad if you dont mad if you do damn you then she threw her arms around him i will she all but took him to his knees there was no hesitation no demur her lips were as hungry as his her tongue as adventurous she let her body press to his and thrilled at the sensation of his heart hammering against her she would never forget the scent of hay and animals the drifting motes of dust in the thin beams of sunlight that broke through the chinks in the logs nor would she forget the strong solid feel of him against her the heat of his mouth the sound of his pleasure she would remember this one moment of abandonment because she knew it could never last let me go she whispered he nestled into the sweet fragrant curve of her neck i doubt i can you must i didnt come here for this he trailed his mouth to her ear and smiled when she shivered would you really have stabbed me alanna aye because he believed her he smiled again heres a likely wench he murmured and nipped at her ear stop it but she let her head fall back in surrender lord help her she wanted it to go on and on and on this isnt right he looked at her then his smile gone i think it is i dont know why or how but i think its very right because she wanted so badly to lean against him she stiffened it cant be you have your war and i have my family i wont give my heart to a warrior and theres the end of it damn it alanna i would ask you for something she eased quickly out of his arms another moment in them and she might have forgotten everything family and all her secret hopes for her own future you could consider it your christmas gift to me he wondered if she knew that at that moment he would have pledged her all that was his even his life what is it you want that youll stay until christmas is passed its important to brian and she added before he could speak that you will not speak of war or revolts until the holy day is over its very little to ask not to me to me it is a very great deal then you have it she took a step back but with a lift of his brow he took her hand firmly in his raised it to his lips and kissed it thank you she regained her hand quickly and hid it behind her back i have work to do his voice stopped her as she hurried toward the door alanna it is right she pulled the hood over her head and hurried out chapter five contents prev next he snow that fell on christmas eve delighted alanna in her heart she held the hope that the storm would rage for days and prevent ian from traveling as she knew he planned to do in two days time she knew the hope was both selfish and foolish but she hugged it to her as she bundled into scarf and cloak to walk to the barn for the morning milking if he stayed she would be miserable if he left she would be brokenhearted she allowed herself the luxury of a sigh as she watched the flakes whirl white around her it was best if she thought not of him at all but of her responsibilities her footsteps were the only sound in the barnyard as her boots broke through the new dusting to the thin crust beneath then in the thick hush the door creaked as she lifted the latch and pulled it open inside she reached for the buckets and had taken her first step when a hand fell on her shoulder with a yelp she jumped sending the buckets clattering to the floor your pardon mrs flynn ian grinned as alanna held both hands to her heart it seems ive startled you she would have cursed him if there had been any breath remaining in her lungs not for a moment could she have held her head up if hed known shed just been sighing over him instead she shook her head and drew air in deeply what are you doing sneaking about i came out of the house moments behind you he explained he had decided after a long night of thought to be patient with her the snow must have masked my approach her own daydreaming had prevented her from hearing him she thought irritated and bent down to snatch the buckets just as he did the same when their heads bumped she did swear just what the devil would you be wanting macgregor other than to scare the life from me he would be patient he promised himself as he rubbed his own head if it killed him to help you with the milking her narrowed eyes widened in bafflement why ian blew out a long breath patience was going to be difficult if every word she spoke to him was a question or an accusation because as i have observed over the past days youve too many chores for one woman pride was stiff in her voice i can care for my family no doubt his voice was equally cool again they reached down for the buckets together ian scowled alanna straightened to stand like a poker as he retrieved them i appreciate your offer but im only going to milk a damn cow alanna so much for patience cant you take the help in good grace of course spinning on her heel she stalked to the first stall she didnt need his help she thought as she tugged off her mittens and slapped them into her lap she was perfectly capable of doing her duty the very idea of his saying she had too much to do why in the spring there was twice as much with planting and tending the kitchen garden harvesting herbs she was a strong capable woman not some weak whimpering girl he was probably used to ladies she thought with a sneer polished sugar faces that simpered and fluttered behind fans well she was no lady with silk dresses and kid slippers and she wasnt a bit ashamed of it she sent a glare in ians direction and if he thought she pined for drawing rooms he was very much mistaken she tossed her head back as she began the tug and squeeze that squirted the brindled cows milk into the bucket ungrateful wench ian mused as he with less ease and finesse milked the second cow hed only wanted to help any fool could see that her duties ran from sunup to sundown if she wasnt milking she was baking if she wasnt baking she was spinning if she wasnt spinning she was scrubbing the women in his family had never been ladies of leisure but they had always had daughters or sisters or cousins to help all alanna had were three men who obviously didnt realize the burdens that fell on her well he was going to help her if he had to throttle her into accepting she finished her bucket long before ian and stood impatiently tapping her foot when he was done alanna reached for the bucket but he held it away from her what are you doing im carrying the milk in for you he took up the other bucket now why would you be doing that because its heavy he all but bellowed then muttering about stubborn emptyheaded women he marched to the door keep swinging those buckets like that macgregor and youll have more milk on the ground than in your belly she couldnt quite catch what he muttered at her but it wasnt complimentary suspicious she brushed snow from her face since you insist on carrying the milk ill just go gather the eggs they stalked off in different directions when alanna returned to her kitchen ian was still there feeding the fire if youre waiting for breakfast youll wait a while longer ill help you he said between gritted teeth help me what with breakfast that did it with little regard for how many eggs cracked she slammed down the bucket you find fault with my cooking macgregor his hands itched to grab her shoulders and give her a brisk shake no hmm she moved to the stove to make coffee turning she all but plowed into him if youre going to be standing in my kitchen macgregor then move aside youre not so big i cant push you out of my way are you always so pleasant in the morning mrs flynn rather than dignify the question with an answer she took the slab of ham shed gotten from the smokehouse and began to slice ignoring him as best she could she began to mix the batter for the pancakes she considered her specialty shed show ian macgregor a thing or two about cooking before she was done he said nothing but clattered the pewter dishes he set on the table to make his point by the time her family joined them the kitchen was filled with appetizing smells and a tension thick enough to hack with an ax pancakes johnny said with relish sure and its a fine way to start christmas eve you look a bit flushed girl cyrus studied his daughter as he took his seat youre not coming down sick are you its the heat from the stove she snapped then bit her tongue as her father narrowed his eyes ive applesauce made just yesterday for the pancakes she set the bowl she was carrying on the table then went back for the coffee flustered because ian had yet to take his eyes from her she reached for the pot without remembering to wrap a cloth around the handle as she singed the tips of two fingers she let out a cry and followed it with an oath no use bringing the lord into it when youve been careless cyrus said mildly but he rose to smear cooling butter on the burns youve been jumpy as a frog with the hiccups these past days alanna its nothing she waved him back to the table with her good hand sit the lot of you and eat i want you out of my kitchen so i can finish my baking i hope theres a fresh raisin cake on the list johnny grinned as he heaped applesauce on his plate no one makes a better one than you alanna even when you burn it she managed to laugh and nearly mean it but she had little appetite for the meal as she joined the table it was just as well she decided some time later though the men in her life had chattered like magpies through breakfast they hadnt left a scrap for the rest of the birds with relief she watched them bundle up for the rest of the days work shed have the kitchen and the rest of the house to herself in short order alone she should be able to think about what and how she felt about ian macgregor but he had been gone only minutes when he returned with a pail of water what are you up to now she demanded and tried in vain to tuck some of her loosened tresses into her cap water for the dishes before she could do so herself he poured the water into a pot on the stove to heat i could have fetched it myself she said then felt nasty but thank you youre welcome he shrugged out of his outer clothes and hung them on a hook by the door arent you going to go with the others then there are three of them and one of you she tilted her head thats true enough and so so today im helping you because she knew her patience was thin she waited a moment before speaking im perfectly capable more than from what ive seen he began to stack the dishes shed yet to clear you work like a pack mule that is a ridiculous and a very uncomplimentary description boyo her chin jutted forward now get out of my kitchen i will if you will ive work to do fine then lets be at it youll be in my way youll work around me when she drew her next breath he cupped her face in his hands and kissed her hard and long im staying with you alanna he said when she managed to focus on him again and thats that is it to her mortification her voice was only a squeak aye well then she cleared her throat stepped back and smoothed her skirts you can fetch me apples from the storage cellar ive got pies to bake she used the time it took him to return to try to compose herself what was becoming of her when she lost her brains and every other faculty over a kiss but it wasnt an ordinary kiss not when they were ians lips doing the work something strange was happening when one moment she was pinning her heart on the hope that he would stay a while longer the next she was resenting him so that she wished him a thousand miles away and a moment later she was letting him kiss her and hoping hed do so again at the first opportunity shed been born in the colonies a child of a new world but her blood was irish irish enough that words like fate and destiny loomed large as she began to scrub dishes she thought that if her destiny was in the shape of one ian macgregor she was in trouble deep its simple enough to peel an apple she insisted later fuming over ians clumsy hacking attempts you put the knife under the skin i did and took most of the meat with it a little time and care works wonders he smiled at her all too strangely for her comfort so im thinking mrs flynn so im thinking try again she told him as she went back to her piecrusts and rolling pin and youll be cleaning up all those peelings youre scattering on my floor aye mrs flynn holding the rolling pin aloft she glared at him are you trying to rouse my temper macgregor he eyed the kitchen weaponry not while youre holding that sweetheart ive told you not to call me that so you have he watched her go back to her pies she was a pleasure to watch he thought quick hands limber fingers even when she moved from counter to stove and back again there was a nimbleness in her movements that sent his heart thudding who would have thought hed have had to be shot all but bleed to death and end up unconscious in a cow stall to fall in love despite her criticism and her tendency to jump whenever he got too close he was having the best day of his life perhaps he didnt want to make a habit out of peeling apples but it was a simple way to be near her to absorb that soft lavender scent that seemed to cling to her skin it melded seductively with the aromas of cinnamon ginger and cloves and in truth though he was more at home in political meetings or with a sword in his hand than in the kitchen he had wanted to ease what he saw as an unfair burden of responsibility she didnt appear to deem it so he mused indeed she seemed content to toil away hour by hour he wanted needed he admitted to show her there was more he imagined riding with her through the fields of his aunts plantation in the summer he thought when the rich green might remind her of an ireland shed never seen he wanted to take her to scotland to the glory of the highlands to lie with her in the purple heather by a loch and listen to the wind in the pine he wanted to give her a silk dress and jewels to match her eyes they were sentimental romantic notions he knew surely he would have choked on the words if he had tried to express them but he wanted to give that much he knew if he could find a way to make her take alanna felt his stare on her back as though it were tickling fingers shed have preferred the fingers she thought those she could have batted away struggling to ignore him she covered the first pie fluted and trimmed the crust and set it aside youll slice a finger off if you keep staring at me instead of watching what youre about your hairs falling out of your cap again mrs flynn she took a hand and shoved at it only succeeding in loosening more curls and i dont think i care for the tone you use when you call me mrs flynn merely grinning ian set aside a pared apple what should i call you then you object to sweetheart though it suits so nicely your nose goes in the air when i call you alanna without your permission now youre ready to spout into temper when i very respectfully call you mrs flynn respectfully hah youll go to hell for lying ian macgregor she waved the rolling pin at him as she turned theres not a dab of respect in your tone when you use it not with that smug smile on your mouth and that gleam in your eye if you dont think i know just what that gleam means youre mistaken other men have tried it and gotten a good coshing for their pains it gratifies me to hear it mrs flynn she made a sound he could only describe as hot steam luffing out of a kettle youll call me nothing at all why took brians part and asked you to stay for christmas will always be a mystery to me the good lord knows i dont want you here cluttering up my kitchen giving me another mouth to cook for grabbing me and forcing your unwelcome attentions on me at every turn he leaned against the counter youll go to hell for lying sweetheart it was the reflex of the moment that had the rolling pin lying out of her hand and toward his head she regretted it immediately but she regretted it even more when he nagged the flying round of wood the instant before it cracked into his forehead if she had hit him she would have apologized profusely and tended his bruise the fact that shed been foiled changed the matter altogether you cursed scotsman she began lathering up you spawn of the devil a plague on you and every macgregor from now till the last reckoning since shed missed with the rolling pin she grabbed the closest thing at hand fortunately the heavy metal pie plate was empty ian managed to bat it away from his head with the rolling pin alanna dont call me that she hefted a pewter mug and tried her aim with that this time ian wasnt so quick and it bounced off his chest sweetheart the sound she made at that would have caused even a battletried scotsman to shudder the plate she hurtled struck ians shin he was hopping on one leg and laughing when she reached for the next weapon enough roaring with laughter he grabbed her and swung her around twice even when she bashed him over the head with the plate damned hardheaded scot aye and thank god for it or youll have me in my grave yet he tossed her up and caught her nimbly at the waist marry me mrs flynn for your name was meant to be macgregor chapter six contents prev next it was a close thing as to whom was the most shocked ian hadnt realized hed meant to ask her hed known he was in love was both amused and dazzled by it but until that moment his heart hadnt communicated to his brain that marriage was desired marriage to alanna he thought and let loose another laugh it was a fine joke he decided on the pair of them his words were still echoing in alannas head bouncing from one end of her brain to the other like balls in a wheel marry me surely she hadnt mistaken what hed asked her it was impossible of course it was madness they had known each other only days even that was long enough for her to be certain ian macgregor would never be the life companion of her dreams with him there would never be peaceful nights by the fire but another fight another cause another movement and yet yet she loved him in a way she had never thought to love wildly recklessly dangerously life with him would be would be she couldnt imagine it she put a hand to her head to still her whirling brain she needed a moment to think and compose herself after all when a man asked a woman to marry him the very least she could do was then it occurred to her that he was still holding her a foot off the floor and laughing like a loon laughing her eyes narrowed to sharp blue slits so it was a great joke he was having at her expense tossing her in the air like a sack of potatoes and chortling marry him marry him indeed the jackass she braced a hand on his broad shoulder for balance rolled the other into a fist and struck him full on the nose he yelped and set her down so abruptly she had to shift to keep upright but she recovered quickly and feet planted stuck her hands on her hips and glared at him tentatively he touched his fingers to his nose aye it was bleeding he noted the woman had a wicked right watching her warily for any sudden moves he reached for his handkerchief is that a yes out so deep was her rage her voice shook even as it boomed out of my house you poxridden son of satan the tears that sprang to her eyes were tears of righteous fury she assured herself if i were a man id murder you where you stand and dance a jig on your bleeding body ah after an understanding nod he replaced his handkerchief you need a bit of time to think it over perfectly understandable speechless she could only make incoherent growls and hisses ill speak with your father he offered politely she shrieked like a banshee and grabbed for the paring knife i will kill you on my mothers grave i swear it my dear mrs flynn he began as he cautiously clamped a hand on her wrist i realize a woman is sometimes overcome with the proposal or marriage but this he trailed off when he saw that tears had welled from her eyes and run down her cheeks what is this uncomfortable he brushed a thumb over her damp cheek alanna my love dont id rather have you stab me than cry but when he gallantly released her hand she tossed the knife aside oh leave me be wont you go away how dare you insult me this way i curse the day i saved your miserable life he took heart that she was cursing him again and pressed a kiss to her brow insult you how how behind the veil of tears her eyes burned like blue suns laughing at me speaking of marriage as if it were a great joke i suppose you think because i dont have fine clothes or fancy hats that i have no feelings what do hats have to do with it i suppose all the elegant ladies in boston just smile indulgently and rap your hand with their fans when you play the flirt but i take talk of marriage more seriously and wont stand by while you speak of it and laugh in my face at the same time oh sweet god who would have thought that he a man reputed to be smooth and clever with the ladies could muck things up so badly when it mattered i was a fool alanna please listen was and are a fool now take your paws off me he gathered her closer i only want to explain before he could cyrus murphy pushed open the door he took one look at the wreckage of the kitchen at his daughter struggling against ian and reached calmly for the hunting knife in his belt let go of my girl macgregor and prepare to die da eyes widened at the sight of her father pale as ice with a knife in his hands alanna threw herself in front of ian dont move aside lass murphys protect their own it isnt the way it looks she began leave us alanna ian said quietly ill have a word with your father the hell you will she planted her feet perhaps she would have shed his blood herself and had if one counted his nose but she wouldnt have her father kill him after shed worked for two days and nights to keep him alive we had an argument da i can handle it myself he was he was proposing marriage to your daughter ian finished only to have alanna round on him again you lying polecat you didnt mean a word of it laughing like a loon while you said it you were i wont be insulted i wont be belittled but you will be quiet he roared at her and had cyrus raising a brow in approval when she did indeed subside i meant every word he continued his voice still pitched to raise the roof if i was laughing it was at myself for being so big a fool as to fall in love with a stubborn sharptongued shrew whod as soon stab me as smile at me shrew her voice ended on a squeak shrew aye a shrew ian said with a vicious nod thats what i said and thats what you are and a enough cyrus shook the snow from his hair sweet jesus what a pair with some reluctance he replaced his knife get on your coat macgregor and come with me alanna finish your baking but da i do as i say lass he gestured ian out the door with all the shouting and the wailing its hard for a body to remember its christmas eve he stopped just outside and planted his hands on his hips in a gesture his daughter had inherited ive a job to do macgregor youll come with me and explain yourself aye he cast a last furious look at the window where alanna had her nose pressed ill come with you ian trudged across the snow and through the billowy curtain that was still falling he hadnt bothered to fasten his coat and stuck his ungloved hands in its pockets wait here cyrus said he went inside a small shed and came out with an ax noting ians cautious stare he hefted it onto his shoulder i wont be using it on you yet he moved off toward the forest with ian beside him alannas partial to christmas as was her mother there was a pang as there always was when he thought of his wife shell be wanting a tree and time for her temper to cool does it ever as a matter of habit cyrus studied the forest floor for signs of game theyd want fresh venison soon youre the one whos thinking of shackling his leg to hers why is that if i could think of one good reason id give it to you he hissed his breath out between his teeth i ask the woman to marry me and she hits me in the nose he touched the still sore appendage then grinned by god murphy im halfmad and in love with the woman which amounts to the same thing ill have her to wife cyrus stopped in front of a pine studied it rejected it then moved on that remains to be seen im not a poor man ian began the bloody british didnt get everything in the fortyfive and ive done well enough with investments ill provide well for her mayhap you will mayhap you wont she took michael flynn and he had no more than a few acres of rocky land and two cows she wont have to work from dawn to dust alanna doesnt mind work she takes pride in it cyrus stopped in front of another tree nodded then handed the ax to ian thisll do when a mans frustrated theres nothing like swinging an ax to sweat it out of him ian spread his legs planted his feet and put his back into it wood chips flew she cares for me i know it might cyrus agreed then decided to treat himself to a pipe tis her habit to shout and slap at those she cares for most then she must love me to distraction the ax bit into the meat of the pines trunk ians expression was grim ill have her murphy with or without your blessing that goes without saying cyrus patiently filled his pipe shes a woman grown and can make up her own mind tell me macgregor will you fight the british with as much passion as youll woo my daughter ian swung the ax again the blade whistled through the air the sound of metal on wood thudded through the forest aye then ill tell you now it may be hard for you to win both satisfied the pipe was well packed he struck a match against a boulder alanna refuses to believe there will be war ian paused and you ive no love for the british or their king cyrus puffed on his pipe and sent smoke drifting through the snow and even if i did my visions sharp enough yet to see what will come it may take a year or two or more but the fight will come and it will be long and it will be bloody when it comes ill have two more sons to risk two more sons to lose he sighed long and heavy i dont want your war ian macgregor but there will come a point when a man will have to stand for what is his its already begun murphy and neither wanting it nor fearing it will change history cyrus studied ian as the tree fell to the cushioning snow a strong man he thought one of those damned scot giants with a face and form a woman would find pleasing enough a good mind and a good name but it was ians restless and rebellious spirit that concerned him ill ask you this will you be content to sit and wait for what comes to come or will you go out in search of it macgregors dont wait to stand for what they believe in nor do they wait to fight for it with a nod cyrus helped ian heft the fallen tree i wont stand in your way where alanna is concerned you may do that for yourself alanna rushed into the front of the cabin the moment she heard ians voice da i want to oh she stopped short at the sight of her father and ian with a pine tree held between them youve cut a christmas tree did you think id be forgetting cyrus took off his cap and stuffed it in his pocket how could i with you nagging me day and night thank you it was with both pleasure and relief that she crossed the room to kiss him its beautiful and i suppose youll want to be hanging ribbons and god knows what else on it but he gave her a quick squeeze as he spoke i have mamas box of ornaments in my room because she understood him so well she kissed him again ill fetch it after supper ive other chores to see to you can devil macgregor about where you want the thing he gave her hand a quick pat before he went out again alanna cleared her throat by the front window if you please ian dragged it over balancing it on the flat wooden boards cyrus had hammered to the trunk the only sound was the rustling of needles and the crackle of the fire thank you she said primly you can go about your business now before she could escape to the kitchen again he took her hand your father has given me permission to wed you alanna she tugged once on her hand then wisely gave up im my own woman macgregor youll be mine mrs flynn though he stood a foot over her head she managed to convey the impression of looking down her nose at him id sooner mate a rabid skunk determined to do it right this time he brought her rigid hand to his lips i love you alanna dont she pressed her free hand to her nervous heart dont say that i say it with every breath i take and will until i breathe no more undone she stared at him into those bluegreen eyes that had already haunted her nights his arrogance she could resist his outrageousness she could fight but this this simple almost humble declaration of devotion left her defenseless ian please he took heart because she had at long last called him by his given name and the look in her eyes as the word left her lips could not be mistaken you will not tell me youre indifferent to me unable to resist she touched a hand to his face no i wont tell you that you must see how i feel every time i look at you we were meant to be together with his eyes on hers he pressed the palm of her hand to his lips from the moment i saw you bending over me in the barn i felt it its all so soon she said fighting both panic and longing all so quick and right ill make you happy alanna you can choose whatever house you want in boston boston for a time at least we would live there i have work to do later we could go to scotland and you could visit your homeland but she was shaking her head work what work is this a shield seemed to come down over his eyes i gave you my word i would not speak of it until after christmas aye she felt her bounding heart still and freeze in her breast you did after a deep breath she looked down at their joined hands i have pies in the oven they need to come out is that all you can say she looked at the tree behind him still bare but with so much promise i must ask you for time tomorrow on christmas ill give you my answer there is only one ill take that helped her to smile theres only one ill give chapter seven contents prev next here was a scent of pine and wood smoke the lingering aroma of the thick supper stew on the sturdy table near the fire alanna had placed her mothers prized possession a glass punch bowl as had been his habit for as long as alanna could remember her father mixed the yuletide punch with a hand generous with irish whiskey she watched the amber liquid catch the light from the fire and the glow from the candles already lighted on the tree she had promised herself that this night and the christmas day to follow would be only for joy as well it should be she told herself whatever had transpired between her father and ian that morning they were thick as thieves now she noted that cyrus pressed a cup of punch on ian before he ladled one for himself and drank deeply before she could object young brian was given a sample well they would all sleep that night she decided and was about to take a cup herself when she heard the sound of a wagon theres johnny she let out a huff of breath and for his sake hed best have a good excuse for missing supper courting mary brian said into his cup that may be but she broke off as johnny came in with mary wyeth on his arm automatically alanna glanced around the room relieved everything was as it should be for company mary how good to see you alanna went quickly to kiss the girls cheek mary was shorter and plumper than she with bright gold hair and rosy cheeks they seemed rosier than usual alanna noted either with cold from the journey from the village or with heat from johnnys courting merry christmas always shy mary flushed even more as she clasped her hands together oh what a lovely tree come by the fire youll be cold let me take your cape and shawl she shot her brother an exasperated look as he just stood by and grinned foolishly johnny fetch mary a cup of punch and some of the cookies i baked this morning aye he sprang into action punch lapping over his fingers in his rush well have a toast he announced then spent considerable time clearing his throat to my future wife he clasped marys nervous hand in his mary accepted me this evening oh alanna held out her hands and since mary didnt have one to spare grabbed the girl by the shoulder oh welcome though how youll stand this one is beyond me cyrus always uncomfortable with emotion gave mary a quick peck on the cheek and his son a hearty slap on the back then well drink to my new daughter he said tis a fine christmas present you give us john we need music alanna turned to brian who nodded and rushed off to fetch his flute a spritely song brian she instructed the engaged couple should have the first dance brian perched himself with one foot on the seat of a chair and began to play when ians hand came to rest on her shoulder alanna touched her fingers briefly gently to his wrist does the idea of a wedding please you mrs flynn aye with a watery smile she watched her brother turn and sway with mary shell make him happy theyll make a good home together a good family thats all i want for him he grinned as cyrus tossed back another cup of punch and began to clap his hands to the music and for yourself she turned and her eyes met his its all ive ever wanted he leaned closer if you gave me my answer now we could have a double celebration this christmas eve she shook her head as her heart broke a little this is johnnys night then she laughed as johnny grabbed her hands and pulled her into the dance a new snow fell softly outside the cabin but inside the rooms were filled with light and laughter and music alanna thought of her mother and how pleased she would have been to have seen her family together and joyful on this most holy of nights and she thought of rory bright and beautiful rory who would have outdanced the lot of them and raised his clear tenor voice in song be happy impulsively she threw her arms around johnnys neck be safe here now whats all this touched and embarrassed he hugged her quickly then pulled her away i love you you idiot i know that he noted that his father was trying to teach mary to do a jig it made him almost split his face with a grin here ian take this wench off my hands a mans got to rest now and then no one can outdance an irishman ian told her as he took her hand unless its a scotsman oh is that the way of it with a smile and a toss of her head she set out to prove him wrong though the candles had burned low before the house and its occupants slept the celebrations began again at dawn by the light of the tree and the fire they exchanged gifts alanna gained a quiet pleasure from the delight on ians face as he held up the scarf she had woven him though it had taken her every spare minute to work the blue and the green threads together on her loom the result was worth it when he left he would take a part of her her heart softened further when she saw that he had gifts for her family a new pipe for her father a fine new bridle for johnnys favorite horse and a book of poetry for brian later he stood beside her in the village church and though she listened to the story of the saviors birth with the same wonder she had had as a child she would have been blind not to see other women cast glances her way glances of envy and curiosity she didnt object when his hand closed over hers you look lovely today alanna outside the church where people had stopped to chat and exchange christmas greetings he kissed her hands though she knew the gossips would be fueled for weeks she gave him a saucy smile she was woman enough to know she looked her best in the deep blue wool dress with its touch of lace at collar and cuffs youre looking fine yourself macgregor she resisted the urge to touch the high starched stock at his throat it was the first time shed seen him in sunday best with snowy lace falling over his wrists buttons gleaming on his doublet and a tricoraered hat on his mane of red hair it would be another memory of him to treasure sure and its a beautiful day he glanced at the sky it will snow before nightfall and what better day for a snowfall than christmas then she caught at the blue bonnet johnny had given her but the wind is high she smiled as she saw johnny and mary surrounded by wellwishers wed best get back ive a turkey to check he offered his arm allow me to escort you to your carriage mrs flynn why thats kind of you mr macgregor he couldnt remembered a more perfect day though there were still chores to be done ian managed to spend every free moment with alanna perhaps there was a part of him that wished her family a thousand miles away so that he could be alone with her at last and have her answer but he determined to be patient having no doubt what the answer would be she couldnt smile at him look at him kiss him that way unless she was as wildly in love as he he might have wished he could simply snatch her up toss her on his horse and ride off but for once he wanted to do everything properly if it was her wish they could be married in the church where they had observed christmas then he would hire or better buy a carriage blue picked out in silver that would suit her in it they would travel to virginia where he would present her to his aunt and uncle and cousins somehow he would manage a trip to scotland where she would meet his mother and father his brothers and sisters they would be married again there in the land of his birth he could see it all they would settle in boston where he would buy her a fine house together they would start a family while he fought with voice or sword for the independence of his adopted country by day they would argue and fight by night they would lie together in a big feather bed her long slender limbs twined around him it seemed since he had met her he could see no further than life with her the snow did fall but gently by the time the turkey and potatoes the sauerkraut and biscuits were devoured ian was halfmad with impatience rather than join the men by the fire he grabbed alannas cloak and tossed it over her i need a moment with you but i havent finished the rest can wait as far as he could see her kitchen was already as neat as a pin i will speak with you in private she didnt object couldnt because her heart was already in her throat when he pulled her out into the snow hed barely taken time to jam on his hat when she pointed out that he hadnt buttoned his coat against the wind he swept her up in his arms and with long strides carried her to the barn theres no need for all of this she pointed out i can walk as well as you youll dampen your dress he turned his head and kissed her snowbrushed lips and i like it very well after he set her down inside he latched the door and lighted a lamp she folded her hands at her waist it was now alanna told herself firmly that the christmas celebration had to end ian no wait he came to her put his hands gently on her shoulders the sudden tenderness robbed her of speech did you not wonder why i gave you no gift this morning you gave me your gift we agreed did you think i had nothing more for you he took her hands chilled because he had given her no time for mittens and warmed them with his on this our first christmas together the gift must be special no ian there is no need there is every need he reached into the pocket of his doublet and withdrew a small box i sent a village lad into boston for this it was in my quarters there he placed the box in her hand open it her head warned her to refuse but her heart her heart could not inside she saw a ring after a quick gasp she pressed her lips together it was fashioned of gold in the shape of a lions head and crown this is the symbol of my clan the grandfather whose name i carry had it made for his wife before she died she gave this to my father to hold in trust for me when i left scotland he told me it was his hope i would find a woman as strong as wise and as loyal to wear it her throat was so tight the words hurt as she forced them out oh ian no i could not i dont there is no other woman who will wear it he took it from the box and placed it on her finger it might have been made for her so perfect was the fit at that moment he felt as though the world were his there is no other woman i will love he brought her ring hand to his lips watching her over it with this i pledge you my heart i love you she murmured as she felt her world rip in two i will always love you there would be time she knew as his mouth came to hers for regrets for pain for tears but tonight for the hours they had she would give him one more gift gently she pushed his coat from his shoulders with her mouth moving avidly beneath his she began to unbutton his doublet with unsteady hands he stilled hers alanna she shook her head and touched a finger to his lips i am not an untried girl i come to you already a woman and i ask that you take me as one i need you to love me ian tonight this christmas night i need that this time it was she who captured his hands and brought them to her lips it was reckless she knew but it was right and i need to love you never before had he felt so clumsy his hands seemed too big too rough his need too deep and intense he swore that if he accomplished nothing else in his life he would love her gently and show her what was written in his heart with care he lowered her onto the hay it was not the feather bed he wished for her but her arms came willingly around him and she smiled as she brought his mouth to hers with a sound of wonder he sank into her it was more than shed ever dreamed the touch of her loves hands in her hair on her face with such patience with such sweetness he kissed her until the sorrows she held in her heart melted away when he had unbuttoned her frock he slipped it from her shoulder to kiss the skin there to marvel at the milky whiteness and to murmur such foolish things that made her want to smile and weep at once he felt her strong capable fingers push aside his doublet unfasten his shirt then stroke along his chest with care he undressed her pausing lingering to give pleasure and to take it with each touch each taste her response grew he heard her quick unsteady breath at his ear then felt the nip of her teeth as he gave himself over to the delights of her body soft lavender scent twining with the fragrance of hay smooth pale skin glowing in the shadowed lamplight quiet drifting sighs merging with his own murmurs the rich shine of her hair as he gathered fistfuls in his hands she was shuddering but with heat such heat she tried to say his name but managed only to dig her nails into his broad shoulders from where had come this churning this wild river that flowed inside her and where would it end dazzled desperate she arched against him while his hands traveled like lightning over points of pleasure she hadnt known she possessed her mouth was on his avid thirsty as he pushed her to the first brink then beyond her stunned cry was muffled against his lips and his own groan of satisfaction then he was inside her deep at the glory of it her eyes flew open she saw his face above her the fire of his hair glinting in the lamplight now we are one his voice was low and harsh with passion now you are mine and he lowered his mouth to hers as they gave each other the gift of self chapter eight contents prev next they dozed turned to each other her cloak carelessly tossed over their tangled forms their bodies warmed and replete from loving he murmured her name she woke midnight had come and gone she thought and her time was over still she stole a bit more studying his face as he slept learning each plane each angle though she knew his face was already etched in her head and on her heart one last kiss she told herself as she brushed her lips to his one last moment when she shifted he mumbled and reached out you dont escape that easily mrs flynn her heart suffered a new blow at the wicked way he said her name tis almost dawn we cant stay any longer very well then he sat up as she began to dress i suppose even under the circumstances your father might pull his knife again if he found me naked in the hay with his daughter with some regret he tugged on his breeches he wished he had the words to tell her what the night had meant to him what her love meant to him with his shirt unbuttoned he rose to kiss the back of her neck youve hay in your hair sweetheart she sidestepped him and began to pluck it out ive lost my pins i like it down he swallowed and took a step forward to clutch handfuls of it by god i like it down she nearly swayed toward him before she caught herself i need my cap if you must obliging he began to search for it in truth i dont remember a better christmas i thought id reached the peak when i was eight and was given a bay gelding fourteen hands he was with a temper like a mule he found her cap under scattered hay with a grin he offered it but though its close in the running you win over the gelding she managed to smile its flattered i am to be sure macgregor now ive breakfast to fix fine we can tell your family over the meal that were to be married she took a deep breath no theres no reason to wait alanna no she repeated im not going to marry you for a moment he stared then he laughed what nonsense is this it isnt nonsense at all im not going to marry you the bloody hell you arent he exploded and grabbed both her shoulders i wont have games when it comes to this its not a game ian though her teeth had snapped together she spoke calmly i dont want to marry you if she had still had the knife in her hand and had plunged it into him she would have caused him less pain you lie you look me in the face and lie you could not have loved me as you did through the night and not want to belong to me her eyes remained dry so dry they burned i love you but i will not marry you she shook her head before he could protest my feelings have not changed nor have yours nor can yours understand me ian i am a simple woman with simple hopes youll make your war and wont be content until it comes to pass youll fight in your war if it takes a year or ten i cannot lose another i love when i have already lost so many i will not take your name and give you my heart only to see you die so you bargain with me incensed he paced away from her you wont share my life unless im content to live it ignoring all i believe in to have you i must turn my back on my country my honor and my conscience no she gripped her hands together tightly and fought not to twist them i offer you no bargain i give you your freedom with an open heart and with no regrets for what passed between us i cannot live in the world you want ian and you cannot live in mine all i ask is for you to give me the same freedom i give you damn you i wont he grabbed her again fingers that had been so gentle the night before bruising how can you think that a difference in politics could possibly keep me from taking you with me you belong with me alanna there is nothing beyond that it is not just a difference in politics because she knew she would weep in a moment she made her voice flat and cold it is a difference in hopes and in dreams all of mine and all of yours i do not ask you to sacrifice yours ian i will not sacrifice mine she pulled away to stand rigid as a spear i do not want you i do not want to live my life with you and as a woman free to take or reject as she pleases i will not there is nothing you can say or do to change that if in truth you do care for me you wont try she snatched up her cape and held it balled in her hands your wounds are healed macgregor its time you took your leave i will not see you again with this she turned and fled an hour later from the safety of her room she heard him ride off it was then and only then that she allowed herself to lie on the bed and weep only when her tears wet the gold on her finger did she realize she had not given him back his ring nor had he asked for it it took him three weeks to reach virginia and another week before he would speak more than a few clipped sentences to anyone in his uncles library he would unbend enough to discuss the happenings in boston and other parts of the colonies and parliaments reactions though brigham langston the fourth earl of ashburn had lived in america for almost thirty years he still had high connections in england and as he had fought for his beliefs in the stuart rebellion so would he fight his native country again for freedom and justice in his home all right thats enough plotting and secrets for tonight never one to pay attention to sanctified male ground serena macgregor langston swept into the library her hair was still fiery red as it had been in her youth the few strands of gray didnt concern a woman who felt she had earned them though ian rose to bow to his aunt the womans husband continued to lean against the mantel he was serena thought as handsome as ever more perhaps though his hair was silver the southern sun had tanned his face so that it reminded her of oak and his body was as lean and muscular as she remembered it from nearly thirty years before she smiled as her eldest son daniel poured her brandy and kissed her you know we always welcome your delightful company mama youve a tongue like your fathers she smiled well pleased that he had inherited brighams looks as well you know very well you wish me to the devil ill have to remind you again that ive already fought in one rebellion isnt that so sassenach brigham grinned at her she had called him by the uncomplimentary scottish term for the english since the first moment they had met have i ever tried to change you youre not a man who tries when he knows he must fail and she kissed him full on the mouth ian youre losing weight serena had already decided shed given the lad enough time to stew over whatever was troubling him as long as his mother was an ocean away she would tend to him herself do you have a complaint for cook your table as always is superb aunt serena ah she sipped her brandy your cousin fiona tells me youve yet to go out riding with her she spoke of her youngest daughter i hope she hasnt done anything to annoy you no he caught himself before he shifted from foot to foot no ive just been a bit ah distracted ill be sure to go out with her in the next day or so good she smiled deciding to wait until they were alone to move in for the kill brig amanda would like you to help her pick out a proper pony for young colin i thought i raised my eldest daughter well but she apparently thinks youve a better eye for horseflesh than her mama oh and daniel your brother is out at the stables he asked me to send for you the lad thinks of little but horses brigham commented he takes after malcolm id remind you my younger brother has done well enough for himself with his horses brigham tipped his glass toward his wife no need to remind me ill go daniel set down his snifter if i know kit hes probably working up some wild scheme about breeding again oh and brig parkins is in a lather over something the state of your riding jacket i believe i left him up in your dressing room hes always in a lather brigham muttered referring to his longtime valet then he caught his wifes eye and her meaning ill just go along and see if i can calm him down you wont desert me will you ian spreading her hooped skirts she sat satisfied that shed cleared the room we havent had much time to talk since you came to visit have some more brandy and keep me company for a while she smiled disarmingly it was another way she had learned other than shouting and swearing to get what she wanted and tell me about your adventures in boston because her feet were bare as she had always preferred them she tucked her legs up managing in the wide plumcolored skirts to look both ladylike and ridiculously young despite the foul mood that haunted him ian found himself smiling at her aunt serena you are beautiful and you are trying to distract me she tossed her head so that her hair never quite tamed flowed over her shoulders i know all about your little tea party my lad she toasted him with her snifter as one macgregor to another i salute you and she continued i know that the english are already grumbling would that they would choke on their own cursed tea she held up a hand but dont get me started on that its true enough that i want to hear what you have to say about the feelings of those in new england and other parts of america but for now i want to know about you about me he shrugged and swirled his drink its hardly worth the trouble to pretend you dont know all about my activities my allegiance to sam adams and the sons of liberty our plans move slowly but they move she was nearly distracted enough to inquire further along these lines but brigham and her own sources could feed her all the information she needed on a more personal level ian more serious she leaned forward to touch his hand you are my brothers first child and my own godchild i helped bring you into this world and i know as truly as i sit here that youre troubled by something that has nothing to do with politics or revolutions and everything to do with it he muttered and drank tell me about her he gave his aunt a sharp look i have mentioned no her you have mentioned her a thousand times by your silence she smiled and kept his hand in hers tis no use trying to keep things from me my lad were blood what is her name alanna he heard himself saying damn her to hell and back with a lusty laugh serena sat back i like the sound of that tell me and he did though he had had no intention of doing so within thirty minutes he had told serena everything from his first moment of regaining hazy consciousness in the barn to his furious and frustrated leavetaking she loves you very much serena murmured as he told his tale ian had risen to pace to the fire and back to the window and back and to the fire again though he was dressed like a gentleman he moved like a warrior he stood before the fire now the flames snapping at his back she was reminded so completely of her brother coll that her heart broke a little what kind of love is it that pushes a man away and leaves him with half a heart a deep one a frightened one she rose then to hold out her hands to him this i understand ian more than i can tell you pained for him she brought his hands to her cheeks i cannot change what i am no you cannot with a sigh she drew him down to sit beside her neither could i we are children of scotland my love spirits of the highlands even as she spoke the pain for her lost homeland was ripe we are rebels born and bred warriors since time began and yet when we fight we fight only for what is ours by right our land our homes our people she doesnt understand oh i believe she understands only too well perhaps she cannot accept by why would you a macgregor leave her when she told you to would you not fight for her shes a hardheaded shrew who wouldnt listen to reason ah hiding a smile she nodded she had been called hardheaded time and again during her life and by one man in particular it was pride that had set her nephew on his horse and had him licking his wounds in virginia pride was something she also understood very well and you love her i would forget her if i could he ground his teeth perhaps i will go back and murder her i doubt it will come to that rising she patted his hand take some time with us here ian and trust me all will be well eventually i must go up now and rescue your uncle from parkins she left him scowling at the fire but instead of going to brigham she went into her own sitting room and composed a letter i cannot go cheeks flushed eyes bright and blazing alanna stood in front of her father the letter still clutched in her hand you can and will cyrus insisted the lady langston has invited you to her home to thank you in person for saving the life of her nephew he clamped his pipe between his teeth and prayed he wasnt making a mistake your mother would want this for you the journey is too long she began quickly and in another month or two it will be time for making soap and planting and wool carding ive too much to do to take such a trip and and i have nothing proper to wear you will go representing this house he drew himself up to his full height it will never be said that a murphy cowered at the thought of meeting gentry im not cowering youre shaking in your boots girl and it makes me pale with shame lady langston wishes to make your acquaintance why i have cousins who fought beside her clan in the fortyfive a murphys as good as a macgregor any day better than one if it comes to that i couldnt give you the schooling your good mother wanted for you oh da he shook his head fiercely she will turn her back on me when i join her in the hereafter if i dont push you to do this tis my wish that you see more of the world than these rocks and this forest before my life is done so youll do it for me and your mother if not for yourself she weakened as hed known she would but if ian is there she doesnt say he is does she well no but then its likely hes not hes off rabblerousing somewhere more like aye glumly she looked down at the letter in her hand aye more like she began to wonder what it would be like to travel so far and to see virginia where the land was supposed to be so green but who will cook who will do the wash and the milking i cant were not helpless around here girl but he was already missing her mary can help now that shes married to johnny and the widow jenkins is always willing to lend a hand aye but can we afford were not penniless either he snapped go and write a letter back and tell lady langston you kindly accept her invitation to visit unless youre afraid to meet her of course im not that served to get her dander up i will go she muttered stomping up the stairs to find a quill and writing paper aye cyrus murmured as he heard her door slam but will you be back chapter nine contents prev next alanna was certain her heart would beat so fast and hard that it would burst through her breast never before had she ridden in such a wellsprung carriage with such a fine pair of matched bays pulling it and a driver all in livery imagine the langstons sending a carriage all that way with a driver postilions and a maid to travel all the miles with her though she had traveled by ship from boston to richmond again with a companion the langstons had provided she would journey by road the remainder of the way to their plantation they called it glenroe after a forest in the highlands oh what a thrill it had been to watch the wind fill the sails of the ship to have her own cabin and the dainty maid to see to her needs until the maid had taken sick from the rocking of the boat of course then alanna had seen to her needs but she hadnt minded a bit while the grateful lass had slept off her illness alanna had been free to walk the decks of the great ship and watch the ocean glimpsing occasional stretches of coastland and she wondered at the vastness and beauty of the country she had never truly seen it was beautiful though she had loved the farm the forest and the rocks of her native massachusetts she found the land even more glorious in its variety why when she had left home there had still been snow on the ground the warming days had left icicles gleaming on the eaves of the house and the bare branches of the trees but now in the south she saw the trees greening and had left her cloak unfastened to enjoy the air through the carriage window in the fields there were young calves and foals trying out their legs or nursing in others she saw dozens and dozens of black field hands busy with spring planting and it was only march only march she thought again only three months since she had sent ian away in a nervous habit she reached up to touch the outline of the ring she wore on a cord under her traveling dress she would have to give it back of course to his aunt for surely ian wouldnt be on the plantation couldnt be she thought with a combination of relief and longing she would return the ring to his aunt with some sort of explanation as to her possession of it not the full truth she reflected for that would be too humiliating and painful she wouldnt worry about it now she told herself and folded her hands in her lap as she studied the rolling hills already turning green in virginias early spring she would think of this journey and this visit as an adventure one she would not likely have again and she must remember everything to tell brian the curious one she would remember everything she thought with a sigh for herself for this was ians family people who had known him as a babe as a growing lad for the few weeks she remained on the plantation with ians family she would feel close to him again for the last time she promised herself then she would return to the farm to her family and her duties and be content there was no other way but as the carriage swayed she continued to hold her fingers to the ring and wish she could find one the carriage turned through two towering stone pillars with a high iron sign that read glenroe the maid more taxed by the journey than alanna shifted in the seat across from her youll be able to see the house soon miss grateful that the weeks of traveling were almost at an end the maid barely restrained herself from poking her head out the carriage window its the most beautiful house in virginia heart thudding alanna began to fiddle with the black braid that trimmed the dovegray dress she had labored over for three nights her busy fingers then toyed with the ribbons of her bonnet smoothed the skirts of the dress before returning to pluck at the braid again the long wide drive was lined with oaks their tiny unfurling leaves a tender green as far as she could see the expansive lawns were tended here and there she saw trimmed bushes already in bud then rising over a gentle crest was the house alanna was struck speechless it was a majestic structure of pristine white with a dozen columns gracing the front like slender ladies balconies that looked like black lace trimmed the tall windows on the second and third stories a wide sweeping porch skirted both front and sides there were flowers a deep blood red in tall urns standing on either side of stone steps that led to double doors glittering with glass alanna gripped her fingers together until the knuckles turned as white as the house it took all her pride and will not to shout to the driver to turn the carriage around and whip the horses into a run what was she doing here in such a place what would she have to say to anyone who could live in such richness the gap between herself and ian seemed to widen with each step of the prancing bays before the carriage had drawn to a halt at the curve of the circular drive a woman came through the doors and started down the porch her billowing dress was a pale watery green trimmed with ivory lace her hair a lovely shade of red gold was dressed simply in a coil at her neck and shone in the sunlight alanna had hardly alighted with the assistance of a liveried footman when the woman stepped forward hands extended mrs flynn youre as beautiful as i expected there was a soft burr to the womans speech that reminded alanna painfully of ian but i will call you alanna because i feel were already friends before alanna could decide how to respond the woman was smiling and gathering her into an embrace im ians aunt serena welcome to glenroe lady langston alanna began feeling dusty and crumpled and intimidated but serena was laughing and drawing her toward the steps oh we dont use titles here unless they can be of some use to us your journey went well i hope aye she felt she was being borne away by a small redhaired whirlwind i must thank you for your generosity in asking me to come in opening your home to me tis i who am grateful serena paused on the threshold ian is as precious to me as my own children come ill take you to your room im sure youll want to refresh yourself before you meet the rest of the family at tea of course we dont serve the bloody stuff serena continued blandly as alanna gaped at the entrance hall with its lofty ceilings and double curving stairs no no of course not alanna said weakly as serena took her arm to lead her up the righthand sweep of the stairs there was a shout a yell and an oath from somewhere deep in the house my two youngest children unconcerned serena continued up they squabble like puppies alanna cleared her throat how many children do you have lady langston six serena took her down a hall with pastel wall covering and thick carpeting payne and ross are the ones you hear making a din theyre twins one minute theyre bashing each other the next swearing to defend each other to the death alanna distinctly heard something crash but serena didnt blink an eye as she opened the door to a suite of rooms i hope youll be comfortable here she said if you need anything you have only to ask what could she possibly need alanna thought dumbly the bedroom was at least three times the size of the room she had slept in at home someone had put fresh fragrant flowers into vases cut flowers in march the bed large enough for three was covered in pale blue silk and plumped with pillows there was a wardrobe of carved wood an elegant bureau with a silvertrimmed mirror a dainty vanity table with a brocade chair the tall windows were open so that the warm fragrant breeze ruffled the sheer white curtains before she could speak a maid scurried in with a steaming pitcher of water your sitting room is through there serena moved past a beautifully carved fireplace this is hattie serena smiled at the small wiry black maid shell tend to your needs while youre with us hattie youll take good care of mrs flynn wont you oh yes maam hattie beamed well then serena patted alannas hand found it chilled and unsteady and felt a pang of sympathy is there anything else i can do for you oh no youve done more than enough ive not even begun serena thought but only smiled ill leave you to rest hattie will show you down whenever youre ready when the door closed behind the indomitable lady langston alanna sat wearily on the edge of the bed and wondered how she would keep up because she was too nervous to keep to her rooms alanna allowed hattie to help her out of the traveling dress and into her best frock the little maid proved adept at dressing hair and with nimble fingers and a chattering singsong voice she coaxed and brushed and curled until alannas raven locks were draped in flirty curls over her left shoulder alanna was just fastening her mothers garnet eardrops and drumming up her courage to go downstairs when there were shouts and thumping outside her door intrigued she opened her door a crack then widened it at the sight of two young male bodies rolling over the hall carpet she cleared her throat good day to you gentlemen the boys mirror images of each other with ruffled black hair and odd topaz eyes stopped pummeling each other to study her as if by some silent signal they untangled themselves rose and bowed in unison and who might you be the one with the split lip asked im alanna flynn amused she smiled and you must be payne and ross aye this came from the one with the black eye im payne and the eldest so ill welcome you to glenroe ill welcome her as well ross gave his brother a sharp jab in the ribs with his elbow before he stepped forward and stuck out a hand and ill thank both of you she said hoping to keep the peace i was about to go down and join your mother perhaps you could escort me shell be in the parlor its time for tea ross offered his arm of course we dont drink the bloody stuff payne offered his as well alanna took both the english could force it down our throats and wed spit it back at them alanna swallowed a smile naturally as the trio entered the parlor serena rose ah alanna i see youve met my young beasts with a considering look she noted the black eye and bloody lip if its cake the pair of you are after then youll wash first as they raced off she turned to introduce alanna to the others in the room there was a boy of perhaps eighteen she called kit who had his mothers coloring and a quick smile a young girl she measured as brians age with hair more blond than red dimpled prettily kit and fiona will drag you off to the stables at every opportunity serena warned my daughter amanda hopes to join us for dinner tonight with her family they live at a neighboring plantation she poured the first cup of coffee and offered it to alanna we wont wait for brigham and the others theyre off overseeing the planting and the good lord knows when they might come in mama says you live on a farm in massachusetts fiona began aye alanna smiled and relaxed a little there was snow on the ground when i left our planting season is much shorter than yours the conversation was flowing easily when the twins came back apparently united again as their arms were slung around each others shoulders with identical grins they walked to their mother and kissed each cheek its too late serena told them i already know about the vase she poured two cups of chocolate its a good thing it happened to be an ugly one now sit and try not to slop this over the carpet alanna was at ease and enjoying her second cup of coffee when a burst of male laughter rolled down the hall papa the twins cried and leaped up to race to the door serena only glanced at the splotch of chocolate on the rug and sighed brigham entered ruffling the hair of the boys on either side of him so what damage have you done today alanna observed that his gaze went first to his wife there was amusement in it and something much deeper much truer that lighted a small spark of envy in her breast then he looked at alanna nudging the boys aside he crossed the room alanna serena began this is my husband brigham im delighted to meet you at last brigham took her hand between both of his we owe you much alanna flushed a little though he was old enough to be her father there was a magnetism about him that set a womans heart aflutter i must thank you for your hospitality lord langston no you must only enjoy it he shot his wife a strange and what seemed to alanna exasperated look i only hope you will remain happy and comfortable during your stay how could i not you have a magnificent home and a wonderful family he started to speak again but his wife interrupted coffee brig she had already poured and was holding out the cup with a warning look their discussions over her matchmaking attempt had yet to be resolved you must be thirsty after your work and the others were right behind me they stopped off briefly in the library even as he spoke two men strode into the room alanna only vaguely saw the tall darkhaired man who was a younger version of brigham her stunned eyes were fixed on ian she wasnt even aware that she had sprung to her feet or that the room had fallen into silence she saw only him dressed in rough trousers and jacket for riding his hair windblown he too had frozen into place a dozen expressions crossed his face as indeed they crossed hers then he smiled but there was an edge to it a hardness that cut her to the quick ah mrs flynn what an unusual surprise i i she stumbled to a halt and looked around wildly for a place to retreat but serena had already risen to take her hand she gave alannas fingers a short firm squeeze alanna was good enough to accept my invitation we wanted to thank her in person for tending you and keeping you alive to annoy us i see when he could tear his gaze from alanna he sent his aunt a furious look clever arent you aunt serena oh aye she said complacently that i am at his side ians hands curled into fists they were twins of the one in his stomach well mrs flynn since youre here ill have to welcome you to glenroe i she knew she would weep and disgrace herself excuse me please giving ian a wide berth she raced from the room how gracious of you ian with a toss of her head serena went after her guest she found alanna at the wardrobe pulling out her clothes now whats all this i must go i didnt know lady langston i thank you for your hospitality but i must go home immediately what a pack of nonsense serena took her firmly by the shoulders and led her toward the bed now sit down and catch your breath i know seeing ian was a surprise but she broke off as alanna covered her face with her hands and burst into tears oh there there sweetheart in the way of all mothers she put her arms around alanna and rocked was he such a bully then men are you know it only means we must be bigger ones no no it was all my fault all my doing though humiliated she couldnt stem the tears and laid her head on serenas shoulder whether it was or not thats not something a woman should ever admit since men have the advantage of brawn we must use our better brains smiling she stroked alannas hair i wanted to see for myself if you loved him as much as i could see he loved you now i know he hates me now and who could blame him but its for the best she wept its for the best he frightens you aye and your feelings for him frighten you oh aye i dont want them my lady i cant have them he wont change hell not be happy until he gets himself killed or hanged for treason macgregors dont kill easily here now have you a handkerchief i can never find one myself when its most needed sniffling alanna nodded and drew hers out i beg your pardon my lady for causing a scene oh i enjoy a scene and cause them whenever possible she waited to be sure alanna was more composed i will tell you a story of a young girl who loved very unwisely she loved a man who it seemed was so wrong for her she loved in times when there was war and rebellion and death everywhere she refused him time and time again she thought it was best drying her eyes alanna sighed what happened to them oh he was as pigheaded as she so they married and had six children two grandchildren her smile blossomed ive never regretted a single moment but this is different love is always the same and it is never the same she brushed the hair from alannas cheek i was afraid you oh aye the more i loved brigham the more frightened i was and the harder i punished us both by denying my feelings will you tell me of yours often it helps to speak with another woman perhaps it would alanna thought surely it could hurt no more than it already did i lost my brother in the war with the french i was only a child but i remember him he was so bright so beautiful and like ian he could think of nothing but to defend and fight for his land for his beliefs so he died for them within a year my mother slipped away her heart was broken and it never mended ive watched my father grieve for them year after year there is no loss greater than that of ones you love my father died in battle twentyeight years ago and i still see his face so clear i left my mother in scotland soon after she died before amanda was born but still lives in my heart she took both of alannas hands and her eyes were damp and intense when the rebellion was crushed my brother coll brought brigham to me he had been shot and was near death in my womb i carried our first child we were hiding from the english in a cave he lingered between life and death so ians stories to brian were true she thought as she stared at the small slender woman beside her how could you bear it how could i not she smiled he often says i willed him back to life so that i could badger him perhaps its true but i know the fear alanna when this revolution comes my sons will fight and there is ice in my blood at the thought that i could lose them but if i were a man i would pick up a sword and join them youre braver than i i think not if your family were threatened would you hide in a corner or would you take up arms and protect them i would die to protect them but aye serenas smile bloomed again but it was softer more serious than before the time will come and soon when the men of the colonies will realize we are all one as a clan and we will fight to protect each other ian knows that now is that not why you love him aye she looked down at their joined hands if you deny that love will you be happier than if you embraced it and took what time god grants you together no she closed her eyes and thought of the past three months of misery ill never be happy without him i know that now and yet all of my life i dreamed of marrying a strong quiet man who would be content to work with me and raise a family with ian there would be confusion and demands and risks i would never know a moments peace no serena agreed you would not alanna look into your heart now and ask yourself but one question if the power were yours would you change him she opened her mouth prepared to shout a resounding aye but her heart more honest than her head held another answer no sweet jesus have i been so much a fool not to realize i love him for what he is not for what i wish he might be satisfied serena nodded life is all risk alanna there are those who take them wholeheartedly and move forward and there are those who hide from them and stay in one place which are you for a long time alanna sat in silence i wonder my lady serena i wonder serena she said and managed a smile if i had had you to talk with would i have sent him away serena laughed well thats something to think about you rest now and give the lad time to stew he wont want to talk to me she muttered then set her chin but ill make him youll do serena said with a laugh aye youll do well chapter ten contents prev next ian didnt come to dinner nor did he appear at breakfast the next morning while this might have discouraged most women for alanna it presented exactly the sort of challenge she needed to overcome her own anxieties added to that were the langstons themselves it was simply not possible to be in the midst of such a family and not see what could be done with love determination and trust no matter what odds they had faced serena and brigham had made a life together they had both lost their homes their countries and people they loved but had rebuilt from their own grit could she deny herself any less of a chance with ian he would fight certainly but she began to convince herself that he was too stubborn to die and if indeed she were to lose him was it not worth the joy of a year a month or a day in his arms she would tell him so if she ever ran the fool to ground she would apologize she would even though it grated beg his forgiveness and a second chance but as the morning whiled away she found herself more irritated than penitent she would apologize all right alanna thought right after shed given him a good swift kick it was the twins who gave her the first clue as to where to find him you were the one who spoiled it payne declared as they came poking and jabbing at each other into the garden hah it was you who set him off if youd kept your mouth shut we could have gone off with him but youve such a bloody big all right lads serena stopped clipping flowers to turn to them fight if you must but not here i wont have my garden trampled by wrestling bodies its his fault they said in unison and made alanna smile i only wanted to go fishing ross complained and ian would have taken me along if he hadnt started jabbering fishing alanna crushed a blossom in her hand before she controlled herself is that where ian is he always goes to the river when hes moody payne kicked at a pebble id have convinced him to take us too if ross hadnt started in so ian was snarling and riding off without us i dont want to fish anyway ross stuck up his chin i want to play shuttlecock i want to play shuttlecock payne shouted and raced off to get there first ive a fine mare in the stables a pretty chestnut that was a gift from my brother malcolm he knows his horseflesh serena went on clipping flowers do you like to ride alanna aye i dont have much time for it at home then you should take advantage of your time here she gave her young guest a sunny smile tell jem at the stables i said to saddle prancer for you you might enjoy riding south theres a path through the woods just beyond the stables the rivers very pretty this time of year thank you she started to dash off then stopped i i dont have a riding habit hattie will see to it theres one of amandas in my trunk it should suit you thank you she stopped turned and embraced serena thank you within thirty minutes alanna was mounted ian did indeed have a line in the water but it was only an excuse to sit and brood hed given brief consideration to strangling his aunt for her interference but before hed gotten the chance she had burst into his room and raked him so completely over the coals that hed had nothing to do but defend himself aye hed been rude to her guest hed meant to be if it didnt smack so much of running away hed have been on his horse and headed back to boston hed be damned if hed ride away a second time this time she could go and the devil take her why had she had to look so beautiful standing there in her blue dress with the sun coming through the window at her back why did it matter to him how she looked he thought viciously he didnt want her any longer he didnt need a sharptongued shrew of a woman in his life there was too much work to be done by god hed all but begged her to have him how it grated on his pride and she the hussy had lain with him in the hay given herself to him made him think it mattered to her hed been so gentle so careful with her never before had he opened his heart so to a woman only to have it handed back to him well he hoped she found some weakkneed spineless lout she could boss around and if he discovered she had he would cheerfully kill the man with his own two hands he heard the sound of a horse approach and swore if those two little pests had come to disrupt his solitude he would send them packing soon enough taking up his line he stood feet planted and prepared to roar his nephews back to the house but it was alanna who came riding out of the woods she was coming fast a bit too fast for ians peace of mind beneath the jaunty bonnet she wore her hair had come loose so that it streamed behind her a midnight flag a few feet away she reined the horse even at the distance ian could see her eyes were a brilliant and glowing blue the mare well used to reckless women riders behaved prettily when he got his breath back ian shot her a killing look well youve managed to scare away all the fish for ten miles dont you have better sense than to ride through unfamiliar ground at that speed it wasnt the greeting shed hope for the horse knew the way well enough she sat waiting for him to help her dismount when he merely stood glaring she swore and struggled down herself youve changed little macgregor your manners are as foul as ever you came all the way to virginia to tell me so she fixed the mares reins to a nearby branch before she whirled on him i came at your aunts kind invitation if i had known you were anywhere in the territory i wouldnt have come seeing you is the only thing that has spoiled my trip for in truth ill never understand how a man such as yourself could possibly be related to such a fine family it would be my fondest wish if you would she caught herself blew out a breath and struggled to remember the resolve she had worked on all through the night i didnt come here to fight with you god help me if that had been your intention then he turned back to pick up his line you got yourself off the horse mrs flynn i imagine you can get yourself back on and ride i will speak with you she insisted already youve said more than i wish to hear and if he stood looking at her another moment he would crawl now mount and ride before you push me too far ian i only want to damn you to hell and back again he threw down the line what right have you to come here to stand here and make me suffer if i had murdered you before i left id be a happy man today you let me think you cared for me that what happened between us meant something to you when all you wanted was a toss in the hay every ounce of color fled from her cheeks then rushed back again in flaming fury how dare you how dare you speak so to me she was on him like a wildcat all nails and teeth ill kill you for that macgregor as god is my witness he grabbed wherever he could to protect himself lost his balance and tumbled backward with her into the river the dunking didnt stop her she swung spit and scratched even as he slid on the slippery bottom and took her under with him hold woman for pitys sake youll drown us both because he was choking coughing up water and trying to keep her from sinking under again he didnt see the blow coming until his ears were already ringing by god if you were a man dont let that stop you you bloody badger she swung again missed and fell facedown in the river cursing all the way he dragged her onto the bank where they both lay drenched and breathless as soon as ive the strength to stand ill kill her he said to the sky i hate you she told him after shed coughed up river water i curse the day you were born and i curse the day i let you put your filthy hands on me she managed to sit up and drag the ruined bonnet out of her eyes damn her for being beautiful even wet and raging his voice was frigid when he spoke a dangerous sign you asked me to put them on you as i recall madam aye that i did to my disgust she threw the bonnet at him tis a pity the roll in the hay wasnt more memorable oh she was too busy wringing out her hair to note the reckless light in his eyes wasnt it now no it wasnt in fact id forgotten all about it until you mentioned it with what dignity she still had in her possession she started to rise he had her flat on her back in an instant well then let me refresh your memory his mouth came down hard on hers she responded by sinking her teeth into his lip he cursed her gathered her dripping hair in his hand and kissed her again she fought herself all the glorious feelings that poured through her she fought him the long firm body that so intimately covered hers like scrapping children they rolled over the grassy bank blindly seeking to punish for hurts old and new then she whimpered a sound of submission and of joy her arms were around him her mouth opening hungrily to his all the force of her love burst out in that one meeting of lips and fueled a fire already blazing frantic fingers tore at buttons desperate hands pulled at wet heavy clothing then the sun was steaming down on their damp bodies he wasnt gentle now she didnt wish it all the frustration and the need they had trapped within themselves tore free in a rage of passion as they took from each other under the cloudless spring sky with her hands in his hair she pulled his mouth to hers again and again murmuring wild promises wild pleas as they lay on the carpet of new grass he absorbed the scent that had haunted him for weeks he stroked his hands along the smooth white skin he had dreamed of night after night when she arched against him ruthlessly stoking his fires he plunged into her her name was on his lips as he buried his face in her hair his was on hers as she wrapped her long limbs around him together they raced toward the end they both craved until at last they lay still each hounded by their own thoughts he drew himself up on his elbow and with one hand cupped her face as she watched loving him she saw the temper return slowly to his eyes i give you no choice this time alanna willing or weeping we marry ian i came here today to tell you i dont give a bloody damn what you came to tell me his fingers tightened on her chin he had emptied himself in her body and soul she had left him with nothing not even pride you can hate me and curse me from now until the world ends but youll be mine you are mine and by god youll take me as i am she gritted her teeth if youd let me say a word but a desperate man didnt listen ill not let you go again i should not have before but youve a way of scraping a man raw whatever i can do to make you happy ill do except abandon my own conscience that i cannot do and wont not even for you i dont ask you to and never would i only want to tell you damn it what is it thats digging a hole in my chest still swearing he reached between them and held up the macgregor ring that dangled from a cord around her neck it glinted in the sunlight as he stared at it slowly he closed his fingers around it and looked down at her why he took another moment to be sure he could trust his voice why do you wear this i was trying to tell you if you would only let me speak im letting you speak now so speak i was going to give it back to you she moved restlessly beneath him but i couldnt it felt dishonest to wear it on my finger so i tied it to a cord and wore it by my heart where i kept you as well no damn you let me finish she said when he opened his mouth i think i knew even as i heard you ride away that morning that i had been wrong and you had been right the beginnings of a smile teased his mouth i have river water in my ears mrs flynn would you say that again i said it once ill not repeat it if shed been standing she would have tossed her head and lifted her chin i didnt want to love you because when you love so much it makes you afraid i lost rory in the war my mother from grief and poor michael flynn from a fever and as much as they meant to me i knew that you meant more he kissed her gently dont let me interrupt i thought i wanted a quiet home and a family a husband who would be content to work beside me and sit by the fire night after night she smiled now and touched his hair but it seems what i wanted all along was a man who would never be content one who would grow restless by the fire after the first night or two one who would fight all the wrongs or die trying thats a man i would be proud to stand beside now you humble me he murmured and rested his brow on hers only tell me you love me i do love you ian macgregor now and always i swear to give you that home that family and to sit by the fire with you whenever i can and i promise to fight beside you when the need comes shifting he snapped the cord and freed the ring his eyes were on hers as he slipped it onto her finger never take it off again no she took his hand in hers from this moment im a macgregor epilogue contents prev boston christmas eve no amount of arguments could keep ian out of the bedroom where his wife struggled through her first birthing though the sight of her laboring froze his mans heart he stood firm his aunt gwen in her quiet persuasive way had done her best but even she had failed its my child as well he said and ill not leave alanna until its born he took his aunts hand and prayed hed have the nerve to live by his words its not that i dont trust your skills aunt gwen after all i wouldnt be here without them its no use gwen serena chuckled hes as stubborn as any macgregor hold her hand then when the pain is bad it wont be much longer now alanna managed a smile when ian came to her side she hadnt known it would take so long to bring such a small thing as a child into the world she was grateful that he was with her and for the comforting presence of gwen who had brought so many dozens of babies into the world gwens husband who was a doctor would have attended the birth as well had he not been called away on an emergency you neglect our guests alanna said to ian as she rested between contractions theyll entertain themselves well enough serena assured her i dont doubt it she closed her eyes as gwen wiped her brow with a cool cloth it pleased her that her family was here for christmas both the murphys and the langstons she should have been doing her duties as hostess on this first christmas in the house she and ian had bought near the river but the babe not due for another three weeks was putting in an early appearance when the next pang hit she squeezed ians hand and tensed relax relax mind your breathing gwen crooned theres a lass the pains were closer now and stronger a christmas baby she thought struggling to rise over the wave their child their first child would be a priceless gift to each other on this the most holy night of the year as the pain passed she kept her eyes closed listening to the soothing sound of ians voice he was a good man a solid husband she felt his fingers twine around hers true her life was not a peaceful one but it was eventful he had managed to draw her into his ambitions or perhaps the seeds of rebellion had always been inside her waiting to be nurtured she had come to listen avidly to his reports of the meetings he attended and to feel pride when others sought his advice she could not but agree with him that the port bill was cruel and unjust like ian she scorned the idea of paying for the tea that had been destroyed in order to escape the penalty no they had not been wrong she had learned there was often right in recklessness she had to smile it was recklessness and right that had brought her here to a birthing bed and she thanked god for it and hadnt other towns and provinces rallied to support boston just as her family and ians had rallied to support them in this the birth of their first child she thought of their honeymoon in scotland where she had met his family and walked in the forests of his childhood one day they would go back and take this child show him or her the place of roots and to ireland she thought as the pain returned dizzying the child would not forget the people who had come before and while the child remembered he would choose his own life his own homeland by their struggles they would have given him that right the babes coming gwen shot ian a quick reassuring smile youll be a papa very soon the birth of our child alanna panted fighting to focus on ian and soon the birth of our nation though he could taste his own fear for her he laughed youre becoming more of a radical than i mrs macgregor i do nothing by half measures oh sweet jesus he fights for life she groped for her husbands hand there can be little doubt he will be his fathers son or her mothers daughter ian murmured looking desperately at gwen how much longer he demanded she suffers soon she let out a little sound of impatience as there was a knock on the door dont worry serena pushed at her already rolledup sleeves ill send them packing it surprised her to find her husband at the threshold brig the babes all but here i dont have time for you now youll have time he stepped inside tossing one arm around his wife ive just gotten a message ive waited for a confirmation from london i wanted before i spoke to you damn messages from london serena muttered as she heard alanna groan uncle news can wait ian you need to hear this as well tonight of all nights then say it and be gone his wife snapped at him last month a petition was debated by parliament brigham took serena by the shoulders and looked into her eyes the act of proscription has been repealed he cupped her face in his hands as her eyes filled the macgregor name is free with her tears fell a weight she had carried all of her life gwen gwen did you hear aye i heard and i thank god for it but ive my hands full at the moment dragging her husband with her serena hurried to the bed since youre here she told brigham youll help within minutes there was the sound of church bells heralding midnight and the birth of a new christmas and the sound of a babys lusty cry heralding life a son gwen held the squirming child in her arms hes all right exhausted alanna lay back against brighams bracing hands is he all right hes perfect serena assured her mopping her own tears youll hold him in a moment i love you ian pressed alannas hand to his lips and i thank you for the greatest gift that man can have here now gwen shifted the newly swaddled infant to his fathers arms take your son sweet god stunned he looked from the baby to alanna it was an image she would treasure all of her life hes so small hell grow serena smiled up at her husband they always do she put an arm around her sister as ian transferred the baby to alannas waiting arms oh hes so beautiful reaching for ian she drew him down beside her last christmas we were given each other this christmas were given a son gently she stroked the downy dark hair on the babys head i cant wait to see what the years will bring well give you time alone brigham took his wife and his sisterinlaw by the hand and go down and tell the others aye tell them ian stood and because she understood alanna gave him the child to hold once again tell them that murphy macgregor is born this christmas day after kissing his son he held him up for the others to see and the baby let out a lusty wail a macgregor who will say his name proudly to all that can hear who will walk in a free land tell them that aye tell them that alanna agreed as ians hand closed around hers from both of us
