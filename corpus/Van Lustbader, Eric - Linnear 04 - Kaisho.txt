 autumn his name was do duc fujiru but everyone who knew him in hollywood florida called him donald true because all the forged papers he was using identified him by this name do duc a physically intimidating man claimed that while his muscles came from his father a vietnamese martial arts expert his inner spirit came from his mother not that anyone in hollywood was that interested in his inner spirit or anyone elses for that matter at least no one at the auto mechanic shop where he worked in fact do ducs father was not vietnamese at all at thirtyeight he was the oldest mechanic there while the younger mechanics all surfed in their spare time do duc worked out at a gym and a martial arts dojo that by his standards was woefully inadequate but better than nothing at all he was an exceedingly handsome man in a dark exotic manner charismatic to women frightening to other men he had thick blueblack hair and bold explorers eyes the sharp planes of his face gave him an aura he could intensify from deep inside himself when he deemed it necessary what he was doing wasting his time in an auto shop was anyones guess save for the fact that he quite obviously had an extraordinary affinity for vehicular devices he could remake engines of any kind so that they far outperformed their factory specs in fact do duc had chosen hollywood because he could blend into the ethnic stew could most easily remain anonymous within the grid of the bleak postmodern metroscape of endless strip malls nearly identical housing developments and shoreline freeways he had been married for the past two years to a beautiful allamerican woman named hope she was a tall lithe blueeyed blonde who had been born and raised in fort lauderdale besides adoring do duc she was deeply in love with fast cars fast food and a life without responsibilities to do duc who had been raised to treat the myriad responsibilities of adulthood with care and respect she was like some gorgeous alien creature unfathomable a curiosity from a zoo whom he took to bed as often as he liked in those moments when her screams of ecstasy echoed in his ears when her strong firm body arched up uncontrollably beneath him do duc came closest to finding life in america bearable but in truth those moments were fleeting he was in the bedroom of his ranch house pulling on his oil and greasesmeared overalls when the front doorbell rang it was a clear hot late october morning the sunlight already so strong it would have made a northerners eye sockets ache with the glare he looked first at his wife lying asleep on her stomach amid the rumpled bedclothes he was abruptly overcome by a sense of distaste all eroticism drained from the sight of her naked buttocks this feeling was not new to him it was more like a toothache if not constant then recurring when one bit down on a roll the sound of the doorbell came again more insistent this time but the woman did not stir making a hissing sound in the back of his throat do puc padded in his bare feet down the hall through the kitchen and the livingroom to open the front door there a young federal express agent bade him sign his name on a clipboard then handed him a small package as the agent did so he caught a glimpse of the image tattooed on the inside of do ducs left wrist it was a human face the left side was skincolored its eye open the right side was blue with dye and where the eye should have been was a vertical crescent the agent gave an involuntary start then recovered himself and hurried off do duc turned the package over he saw that it had come from a store in london called avalon ltd he offered a strange smile to the already insubstantial house around him with the door closed behind him he unwrapped the package inside was a darkbfue matt box within which he found a pair of socks swaddled in huntergreen tissue paper the socks green and white striped had what seemed to be a pattern running down their outsides do duc stepped into the kitchen where the sunlight slanted in through the large easternfacing window it was then that he saw the words emerging from the pattern they were in a vertical strip down the outside of each sock primo zanni they said the packaging dropped from do ducs hand and he felt the slow thud of his heartbeat he sat on an aluminum and plastic chair while he donned the green and white socks then he walked through the house looking around each room as he passed through it fixing them all in his mind at length he returned to the bedroom he went to his closet pulled down his dusty overnight bag thrust into it what he needed from the closet and his dresser drawers he found it wasnt much in the bathroom he did the same back in the bedroom he gave one swift glance toward his still sleeping wife before moving his dresser to one side he took out a folding pocket knife inserted the blade beneath the exposed edge of the carpet pried it up he removed two lengths of floorboard he had sawn through when he had first moved into the house before he had met hope and removed the old olivemetal ammo box he opened this pushed aside the cushioning wads of unmarked bills plucked out a mask it was a remarkable item it appeared old and was handpainted in rich burnished black with accents of green and gold on the cheeks over the eyeholes and the lips it was constructed of papiermache and depicted a man with a rather large nose prominent brows and cheekbones and a crowned forehead in the shape of a v the mask ended just above where a persons mouth would be do duc held the mask as tenderly as he would the body of an infant whats that he started looking around to find hope sitting naked on the corner of the bed what are you doing she ran a hand through her long blonde hair stretching in that sinuous manner she had its nothing he said hurriedly thrusting the mask back into its incongruous container its not nothing donald hope said standing up dont tell me that you know i hate secrets she came across to where he was still crouched he saw her with the morning sun firing the tiny pale hairs along the curve of her arm and the air around her exploded in a rainbow hue of arcs the aura emanated from her seemed to pulsate with the beat of her heart or the firing of the nerve synapses in her brain do ducs lips opened just a bit as if he wanted to taste this aura with his tongue a sly smile spread across hopes face were supposed to tell each other everything didnt we promise do duc drove the blade of the pocket knife into hopes lower belly and using the strength coming up through the soles of his feet ripped the knife upward through her flesh and muscle and reached her heart he watched with a trembling of intensity as surprise disbelief confusion and terror chased each other across her face it was a veritable smorgasbord of delicious emotions which he sopped up with his soul he stepped quickly back from the bright fountain of blood that erupted a foul stench filled the bedroom silence not even a scream he had been trained to kill in this manner do duc looked down staring at his wifes viscera which gleamed dully in the morning light steam came off them the iridescent coils seemed to him beautiful in both pattern and texture speaking to him in a language that had no rules no name the sight and the smell familiar as old companions reminded him of where soon he would be headed on the plane ride up to new york do duc had time to think he drew out the strip of color headshots of himself he had taken in an automated booth in a mall where he had stopped on his way to the airport in lauderdale then he put it away along with his ticket stub which was made out in the name of robert ashuko and opened a copy of forbes while he stared at the text he pulled out of memory the information he had memorized just after he had moved to hollywood it had been sent to him in a book of john singer sargents paintings remarkable for the extraordinary sensuality of their women the lushness of their landscapes the information was contained on a page on which was printed a fulllength photo of sargents magnificent painting madame x which seemed to do duc to secure the imperious eroticism that smoldered in these female creatures of another age he had decoded the information memorized it then had burned it flushing what ashes remained down the toilet the book he had kept to gaze at again and again it was the one item he regretted leaving behind but it was far too large and cumbersome to take with him on this particular journey deplaning at kennedy airport do duc went immediately to the wall of lockers in the main terminal there he produced a key with a number stamped into it he inserted it into the appropriate lock and removed the contents of the locker which consisted of what appeared to be a physicians black bag do duc rented a car he used a false drivers license and a protected credit card one that could not be traced to him and would not show up on a hot sheet he had spent some time in new york and so had no trouble finding the belt parkway even through the tricky maze of the airport grounds some miles east in nassau county the highway became the southern state parkway it was heading toward evening and traffic was barely moving a mack truck loaded with gravel heading west had jumped the divider and plowed headon into first a vw bug then a toyota mr and finally a chevy citation do duc didnt mind the slow going he had time to kill and besides the vectors of the disaster interested him by the degree of the carnage he began calculating the speeds of the respective vehicles then he began to imagine what it must have been like inside them death whether quick or drawnout was his meat and he was never sated he could hear a howling filling his ears flooding his mind until his fingers resonated to its frequency feral lights danced before his eyes like forest sprites and every manifestation of civilization dropped away time thus naked turned primeval and do duc a beast in the forest was fearless omnipotent he thought briefly of hope not of her life but of her death and he feasted on it all over again do duc took the wantaugh state parkway exit and headed north for two exits he was now on old country road by this time the world had reverted to normal except for the slight aura visible to him around each person he passed old country road took him into hicksville where he came upon the sprawling lilco building on his right at first glance it could have passed for a school a twostory redbrick structure he pulled over unfolded a handdrawn map of the buildings interior everything he needed to know was clearly marked he memorized the map put a lit match to one corner watched it burn into his fingertips he mashed what ashes remained into the cars ashtray then got out and went quickly across old country road he was in and out within seven minutes having retrieved boots overalls shirt webbed utility belt and most important an official laminated clipon id the photo of the man roger burke looked nothing like do duc but it made no difference three miles from the building do duc stopped the car and changed into the lilco uniform working with an artists knife provided for him in the capacious doctors satchel he pried up the outer layer of lamination he cut one of his photos from the strip he had taken outside lauderdale glued it over burkes black countenance replaced the lamination the result would fool no one for long but do duc didnt need long he looked at his watch just after seven dinner time he found a chinese takeout restaurant ordered brought the loaded plastic bag back to the car he broke open several cardboard containers extended the first and second fingers of his right hand with this utensil he shoveled into his mouth cold rice lacquered with a glutinous fish sauce he washed this down with draughts of strong black tea refreshed he was ready to go he made his way back to the packed northbound wantaugh parkway which soon turned into the northern state parkway heading west the first exit was post avenue and he took this north just after he crossed jericho turnpike he found himself in the tony suburb of old westbury he went under the long island expressway made a left onto the north service road just past the old westbury police station he made a right onto wheatley road here in stark contrast with the industrial clutter of hicksville he cruised slowly past large oldmoney estates complete with whitebrick walls stately oaks winding driveways and massive brick or fieldstone houses with whitewashed porticos or columned portecocheres the house he was looking for stood well back from the road behind a tenfoothigh serpentine redbrick wall it had a black wroughtiron gate and an electronic security squawkbox do duc pulled up to it roger burke lilco he said into the grill set into the metal box in response to a thin electronicized voice he had to put his head and shoulders out the window of his car to do it and this afforded him an excellent view between the posts of the gate along the wide crushedclamshell drive that swept up to the white and darkgreen house he noted a large blackandtan rottweiler bounding through the thick privet hedges dangerous beasts they had originally been roman cattle dogs centuries ago nowadays they were most popular as police and guard dogs because of their ferociousness and their strength he gave burkes lilco id number and a line about having to check the feeder cables because of a dangerous outage in the area the simplest lies were the most believable he had been taught and the risk of raw electricity made even the most stouthearted people nervous a moment later he heard electronic servos start up and the gates began to swing slowly inward do duc pulled on padded gloves with a black rubberized exterior put the car in gear went slowly up the driveway he drove with his left hand only his right hand was buried in the open jaws of the black physicians bag he saw the armed guard coming toward him across the wide sloping lawn and he stopped obediently not far away the rottweiler unleashed was urinating nervously in some sheared boxwood as he eyed do duc with a halfopen mouth the guard came up made eye contact and asked for do ducs id he was clad in sneakers jeans a chambray workshirt and a corduroy jacket beneath which his piece bulged from its shoulder holster mafia buttonman or excop do duc mused these days it was difficult to say in either case he was not a stupid man and do duc had made his move before the guard could get suspicious about the hand in the bag with his left hand do duc grabbed a fistful of chambray jerked the man toward him the guards hand was on his way to the butt of his gun when do ducs right hand wrapped around a slender steel blade flashed upward there was a certain amount of galvanic reaction when the blade buried itself in the soft flesh of the guards throat do duc was ready for it but even so the guard who was very strong almost jerked out of do ducs grip do duc rose up off his seat slamming the blade through the roof of the guards mouth into the base of his brain the body in his hands trembled there was the quick offensive stench as the guards bowels gave way the rottweiler was downwind and it began to whine then growl as its nostrils filled with the scent of death couldnt be helped do duc said as if to an invisible companion as he heard the dog coming fast at him he let go of the corpse and opened the car door in almost the same motion the rottweiler ears flat back teeth bared was already upon him the frightening stubby muzzle was white with saliva do duc led with his left hand catching it between the dogs snapping jaws as it leapt flinging him back against the car roof the long teeth penetrated into the rubberized glove and while the animal was thus occupied do duc took the bloody blade and inserted it into the rottweilers left ear punching it right through to the other side the teeth almost came through the padding then as the dog bit down in reflex do duc stepped away from the fountain of blood holding the twitching beast at arms length grunting at its weight but happy at the resistance in his biceps and deltoid muscles in the end he was obliged to slip off the glove because even in death the rottweiler would not relinquish its hold do duc bent extracting the blade from the dog he wiped it on the leg of the guards jeans then climbed back into the car resuming his journey up the driveway to the massive portecochere the mock doric columns rose above him as he pulled in turned off the ignition he took the physicians bag from the seat beside him went up the brick steps to the front door mr goldoni the welldressed man standing in the doorway shook his head dominic goldoni is ah away do duc frowned consulting papers on a steel clipboard papers that were meaningless to the situation this the goldoni residence yes it is the welldressed man said he was handsome in a largefeatured mediterranean manner his brown eyes were hooded liquid he was pushing fifty and seemed foreign almost courtly in his rich brioni suit roman silk shirt and thousanddollar loafers are you the lilco man right do duc said flashing his id briefly as he stepped across the threshold the mans eyes tracked the plastic badge tm tony decamillo mr goldonis brotherinlaw yeah i know do duc said burying his fist in decamillos solar plexus he held the man up almost gently as decamillo retched and gasped for air then he brought a knee up into decamillos chin snapping his head back do duc let decamillos unconscious form slide to the floor while so bent over he took the time to inventory the mans gold jewelry rings watch cufflinks tie pin then he took decamillo under the arms and dragged him into the coat closet in the huge marblefloored foyer do duc used flex he produced from his bag to tie decamillos wrists and ankles he took a scarf from a shelf balled it up and stuffed it in decamillos mouth then secured it with more flex there was no cook margarite decamillo prided herself on being a firstclass chef but there was a livein cleaning woman do duc found her in the kitchen pantry preparing her own dinner he came up silently behind her looped apiece of flex around her neck and exerted pressure she gasped tried to cry out hernails flailed the air scratched him down one burly forearm before her breath gave out and she pitched forward into the cans of redpack tomatoes he left her there hunched over cooling quickly he crossed to the phone on the wall next to the enormous builtin refrigerator cautiously picked up the receiver it was not in use and he dialed a local number listened while the electronic clicks and relays sent it caroming on its way out of state he counted off the requisite five rings before the call was answered then said into the silence im in back in the foyer do duc mounted the wide mahogany staircase the wood was polished to such a high gloss he could see himself reflected in it his shoes made no sound on the persian runner margarite decamillo was luxuriating in a steamy bath in the master bedroom wing her head was back against a rubber pad her eyes half closed as she felt the heat seep through her muscles into her bones this was her favorite time of the day when she could shut the world away relax and let her thoughts drift free the added responsibilities her husband had taken on recently had changed him irrevocably she knew he was worried definitely over his head and probably in trouble she knew she was the only person in the world who could help him but he was sicilian and she knew she would have to tread a careful path it would do no good reminding him of the roster of show business personalities who had become his clients because of her contacts serenissima her highly successful boutique cosmetics company catered to many of the biggest stars of hollywood and new york and because she was the creator of all the products they wanted to meet her because she was such a shrewd judge of character it wasnt difficult to pass some of them on to tony as her mind drifted her fingertips almost unconsciously explored her body pressing those spots that hurt the bruises that recurred the heat of the bath drew the pain out like the tendrils of some sea creature and she relaxed eventually as they inevitably did her thoughts turned to francine at fifteen her daughter was at a difficult age too old to be considered a child too young for the responsibilities of adulthood the fact that she already had the body of a woman only compounded the problem several times before her brother dominic had entered the witsec program margarite had been forced to go to him and ask for his help in extricating francie from difficulties at school or with a boyfriend too old for her margarite sighed she loved francie more than anything in life and perhaps the resonances of that love were overwhelming to her she had been torn between following a career and raising francie virtually alone she was all too aware that she had never spent enough time with her daughter but what was she to do she would shrivel and die if she were chained to the house tony had no time or patience for a female child she believed he continued to resent her for not giving him the male heir he so desperately wanted but now margarite could no longer bring a baby to term and there would only be francie no wonder tony was angry all the time the outsized tub was carved from a monstrous piece of blackandbrown onyx an oval bowl filled now with hot water aromatic salts and margarite decamillos voluptuous form the water spigot was gold carved in the shape of a swans head and artfully curved neck the taps also gold its wings the niche into which the steeping tub had been set was dad with floortoceiling mirrors which now reflected the image of do duc as he entered the humid room margarite decamillo started simultaneously sitting up straight and clasping her hands over her naked breasts her amber eyes opened wide her ample lips forming an o who are you what do you mean by coming im here to make you an offer do ducs deep voice was soft nevertheless margarite was compelled to silence she stared at this interloper and somewhat to do ducs surprise had the presence of mind to say what have you done to my husband hes not dead do duc said if thats what youre thinking he approached her slowly across the steamsheened tiles her eyes watched him as a mongoose will scrutinize a cobra with equal degrees of fascination and dread hes not even badly injured just sleeping do duc now stood at the edge of the tub looking down at margarite she was an exceedingly handsome woman in her midthirties with high cheekbones wideset direct eyes prominent nose and a thick head of curling dark hair wet now at the ends so strands stuck to the pearlized flesh of her shoulders and neck it was an altogether aggressive face yet he could see that she had learned to guard her private thoughts well she had that canny intelligent look that he had seen in many a successful gambler the initial fright was over and color returned to her cheeks as she recovered her composure do duc gauged that she was not as frightened of him as she ought to be you said something about an offer do duc nodded noting the choice of her response as well as the coolness of her voice thats right we both have something the other wants he allowed a smile to spread over his face for instance i want to know where dominic goldoni is a look of relief came over margarite and she laughed then youve come to the wrong person ask the feds i have no idea where my brother is then she snorted derisively now get the hell out of here you cheap hustler do duc ignored her he said dont you want to know what i have that you want she smiled sweetly what could you possibly do duc had already stepped into the tub the water slopping noisily over the side he put one hand over her face the other on her chest and pressed her violently down until her head disappeared beneath the hot water he sidestepped her thrashing legs and dug his fingers into her thick hair pulling her sputtering and coughing from the water her eyes were tearing her heavy breasts heaving he saw that at last he had gotten her attention now he said can we agree that we have something to talk about bastard she moaned bastard to do this to me you havent seen anything yet do duc thought with a measure of satisfaction ive got nothing to say to you margarite pulled her hair off her face she sat on the edge of the tub seemingly oblivious now to her nudity my own life means nothing to me id never betray my brother even if i knew where theyve put him do duc drew an oversized bath towel from a rack above his head threw it at her dry yourself off he said stepping out of the tub ive got something to show you he herded margarite out of the bathroom she had wrapped the towel around her so that it covered her from just above her breasts to just above her knees how stupid are you dont you understand it doesnt matter what you do to me i dont know anything the feds made sure of that he took her through the vast master bedroom with its canopied fourposter bed and sunken sitting area complete with curved velvet loveseat and ornate marble fireplace its mantel held aloft by carved cherubim a hideous ormolu clock ticked sonorously in the center of the mantel halfway down the hall margarite felt her throat catch she knew where they were headed no she said in a very small voice oh please god no he allowed her to break away from him and she ran the rest of the way through a halfopen door into another bedroom suite do duc followed after her stopped at the threshold stooping to retrieve the bath towel that had come undone he put it over his left arm as he entered a room painted pale pink ruffled curtains covered the windows and a number of large stuffed animals sat or stood on the bed francie do duc watched the scene the naked mother distraught teary hands clasped to her face staring in horror at her fifteenyearold daughter strung up by her ankles to the central light fixture oh my god francie the teenagers oval face flushed with blood was wholly inexpressive her eyes were closed her lips half open she isnt dead do duc said but she will be if you dont do as i say margarite whirled yes yes anything but take her down when youve done as i ask do ducs voice was gentle ive no wish to hurt her you see but know that her life is in your hands he came across the room handed margarite the towel do we understand one another now margarite again gave him that look he had seen so often in canny gamblers and he knew that she was thinking of slipping a letter opener between his ribs he wondered whether she had it in her to actually commit such an act of finality to be party to an act that would forever alter the core of her contemplating her this was the question that intrigued him the most because now that he had come in contact with her he recognized something in her and was drawn to it what is it you want from me she asked downstairs in the library he poured them both brandies he had allowed her to dress but only while he watched she had put on a short black pleated skirt a creamcolored blouse and suede slippershoes worked with gold thread he was impressed that she dressed with an economy of movement and a dignity to try to protect herself from his presence at first she refused his offer drink he insisted the brandy will calm your nerves he eyed her it will be to your benefit she accepted the glass balloon from him sipped slowly evenly do duc took his drink sat down on the plush sofa beside her all right he said this is what i require when your brother calls you you will contrive a way to get him to tell you where he is margarite put her balloon onto the glass and brass coffee table youre crazy itll never happen for one thing calling me or anyone else in his family for that matter is strictly against the rules nevertheless do duc said hell call margarite studied him for a moment before leaning forward to extract a cigarette from a silver filigree box as she did so her breasts strained against the blouse it was the first provocative gesture she had made and do duc knew she had begun to think the situation through that was good for both of them better the demon you knew you stupid beast my brother dominic was put into the federal witness security program almost a year ago he was allowed to take his wife and children with him since then i have not heard from him neither has his mother he was told in no uncertain terms what the rules were no contact with family or friends otherwise the feds could no longer guarantee his safety she watched him as he picked up the tooled silver lighter lit the flame for her she hesitated only fractionally before leaning forward to light the end of her cigarette she inhaled deeply blew out a stream of smoke in such a way that he could mark her agitation are you aware that in the entire history of witsec not one inductee who has stuck to the rules has been gotten to she continued to watch him as she smoked the witsec deputy marshal at the office of enforcement operations told us that and after what dominic had done i know he took it to heart hes got no death wish just the opposite hes got everything to live for suddenly she stopped speaking and do duc knew that she desperately wanted a response from him this had been her first shot at trying to gain the upper hand and for this he awarded her more points he said nothing margarite continued to smoke until the cigarette was finished then she stubbed it out in a steuben ashtray do duc expected her to reach for another but again she surprised him with her willpower she sat with her hands in her lap let my daughter go she said softly we were speaking about your brother dominic do duc watched with interest the single line of perspiration make its way from her hairline down her temple onto her cheek he was aware of the tension in the same way he often saw the auras around people there was a tangible humming in the air he could see the tiny tremble of her lips before she put her head down okay say dominic does call she said in capitulation then what set up an immediate meeting without his witsec handler he wont do that he took another cigarette out of the silver box lit it and handed it to her but he will margarite he said i know that hes phoned you several times before the last time lets see wasnt it because he found out what tony d does to you behind closed doors margarite gave a tiny cry she drew her knees up just as if his words had assaulted her physically her face was white and she was breathing hard through her halfopen mouth this time information will come to dominic that your husband has beaten francie he seemed as calm as if he were reading a number from the phone book and this matteroffact delivery was the most horrifying element hell call you margarite wont he and when he does youre going to act the part youll be properly hysterical and if dominic doesnt suggest it youll insist on a meeting ah you bastard she closed her eyes hes mined everything she thought she felt her control slip away salty tears sliding down her cheeks panic turning her mind to jelly she fought to put one coherent thought in front of another you know what youre asking me to do she whispered do duc abruptly slammed his hands together her brandy balloon was between them and it shattered with a loud crackle making margarite jump he liked what that did to her eyes and he was poignantly reminded of the sargent painting of madame x he said i have killed your bodyguard your rottweiler and your maid dont think for a moment that i will hesitate to take your daughters life his glittery eyes would not let hers go as i have pointed out francines life is quite literally in your hands margarite stubbed out her cigarette christ how do you manage to sleep at night do duc stood up an interesting question coming from dominic goldonis sister dont you use your maiden name his name in your own business of course you do giving her a small convincing smile he said i wonder how tony d feels about you being known as margarite goldoni is that part of the rage he feels for you she watched him with a kind of fascinated awe that walked the razors edge of revulsion he went around behind the sofa stood looking at a large painting by henri martin of a wheatfield fecund with color and texture margarite youre intelligent enough to know we all have our ways of rationalizing what we do thats hardly the sole province of the fanatical and the righteous he waited losing part of himself in the provencal landscape martin had conjured with the arcane power of a sorcerer do duc thought that he would gladly give up everything even the constant proximity to death that kept him focused and stable to be able to paint just one canvas like this one he had no children at least none that he knew of but this masterpiece was better than a child because it sprang godlike from your head and stayed exactly as you had envisioned it he could imagine no greater reward in life how interesting a beast who appreciates fine an margarite said at his elbow he had heard her coming or more precisely had felt it and he recalled his own question of whether she would have the guts to wield the letter opener he did not turn his head away from the martin but said dominic will call within the next two hours are you ready to keep your side of the bargain give me a moment she said ive never made a deal with the devil before perhaps not he said as he swung toward her but ill bet your brother has more times than he can count you know nothing about my brother she wanted to shout at him but she was terribly afraid that he would prove to her in quite precise terms just how wrong she was their eyes locked and do duc recognized the ambivalence lurking behind the overt animosity she projected he doubted whether she was yet aware of how attracted she was to him he was certain that she had no knowledge of his use of the classic interrogators tactic of personalizing then making intimate what was in all respects a cutanddried relationship but she could recognize the other side of what he was doing it was not so much that women wanted to be dominated he had concluded some years ago but that they appreciated more than men what such domination could produce in others margarines tongue came out moistening her lips do you have a name a few do duc said you can call me robert robert she took a step toward him so that she was very close she studied his face curious thats not an oriental name and youre so obviously oriental she cocked her head at an angle or are you what other race let me see polynesian she smiled im venetian myself so i know what its like what whats like to be an outsider margarite walked away from him back to the sofa i live among sicilians no one trusts you not really she sat down crossed her legs youre always being put in the position of having to prove your loyalty even to family do duc smiled to himself he liked this part of her the schemer he stared at the long expanse of her legs with desire which was hardly difficult in order to encourage her just because his desire was deliberate didnt mean she had to know that he wanted no to be truthful he needed to know how far she would go what she might be capable of under the most extreme conditions now he knew one thing she was going to allow him to find out do you have family the question knifed through him so he smiled at her charming her with one of his many masks that was a long time ago but his voice sounded hollow even to his own ears and margarite was clever enough to pick up on this were you an orphan the seeds of my destruction were sown when i was very young margarite held his gaze what an extraordinary thing to say is it true you have no family it was so he shrugged in order that she should discount it he was appalled at what had come out of his own mouth was he mad he broke the connection with her that was beginning to disturb him as profoundly as it did her what do you want with dominic margarite asked to his back information do duc said that only he can provide that simplifies things she said i can get it for you when he calls do duc smiled coldly so that she knew in her heart he was nothing more than a weapon margarite i will tell you now that if you deviate at all from our prepared scenario francine will die and you will witness it all right she shuddered and put her face in her hands just dont say it again i dont want you even thinking it she looked up at him her eyes searching his face through her tears you know despite what dominic did hes still got a number of friends he saved from the feds and theyre very powerful yes i know just how powerful do duc said who do you think sent me it was a calculated risk but a necessary one to help him maintain his control over her christ you cant mean it margarite said in alarm that would kill him do duc shrugged as he came and sat down beside her life is full of surprises even for me no no no she said in a breathless voice youre to me she shuddered i know dominics friends theyre utterly loyal if you harm him theyll come after you doesnt that worry you on the contrary i welcome it he watched the emotions flurry across her lace my god who are you she whispered what sins have i committed that would bring you here tell me are you as innocent as your brother is guilty she ignored the tears as they rolled slowly down her cheeks no one is wholly innocent but i this is like judgment day no matter what i do i will have blood on my hands in the end were all animals he said weve got to get dirty sometime this is your time she pulled out another cigarette become like you you mean no never i wish you wouldnt do duc said margarite put her hand around the lighter then apparently thought better of it she returned the unlit cigarette to the filigreed box it frightens me that you know dominic is going to call yes i know his friends he has no more friends he dipped his fingertip into the sticky residue of the spilled brandy brought up on it not only the sweet liquor but a tiny shard of glass she watched as he pressed the glass until it pierced his skin and drew blood by this gesture of machismo she reckoned that pain in one form or another was a significant component of his personality she filed this inference away not yet able to deduce its usefulness she wondered why he hadnt assaulted her he had had every opportunity to take advantage of an entire array of provocative situations while she was naked in the bath while she was dressing as he watched any time while they had been here in the library certainly after she had recovered from the initial shock of his presence she had given him every opportunity knowing that he would not be thinking clearly trapped between her thighs with his blood filled with testosterone she had to try something to extricate herself from this nightmare she shifted on the sofa in the process hiking up her skirt to the tops of her thighs she saw his gaze shift from the blood on his fingertip to her flesh his gaze had weight as it rested on her and heat she could feel her cheeks beginning to burn what is it about you she did not recognize her own voice do duc looked at her his fingertip traced a red crescent on the trembling flesh of her inner thigh he stroked higher into the spot where she was warm even now she felt a kind of connection and she did what she could to draw him on to make the heat rise in his blood the harsh jangle of the phone made her start she stared at it as if it were a deadly adder he took his hand away and her one chance was gone answer it do duc ordered staring into her terrified eyes margarite hesitated trembling it didnt have to be dominic it could be anyone she told herself please let it be anyone but him she snatched up the receiver with a convulsive gesture she swallowed then said hopefully hello margarite bellissima dominics voice said in her ear and she slowly closed her eyes book one old friends year after year on the monkeys face a monkeys mask matsuo basho one tokyo marine on st croix new york so early in the morning tokyo smelled like fish perhaps it was the sumida river still home to hundreds of fishermen plying their ancient trade or thought nicholas linnear perhaps it was the steelhued haze that squatted like a gluttonous guest over the sprawling metropolis somewhere in the countryside far away the sun was struggling up over the mountaintops but here in the heart of the city it was still dark just a hint of predawn light turned the shadows nacreous as nicholas ascended the shinjuku suiryu building in the nonstop chairmans elevator he considered the formidable array of decisions awaiting him at sato international the vast keiretsu industrial conglomerate he ran jointly with tanzan nangi nangi was the canny japanese a former viceminister of mitt japans allpowerful ministry of international trade and industry with whom nicholas had decided to join forces merging his own company tomkin industries with nangis sato international it was interesting that both men had inherited the top position in their respective conglomerates nangi from his best mends dead brother nicholas from his late fatherinlaw for this and many other reasons there was a unique bond between the two men which could never be severed nicholas stepped off the elevator at the fiftysecond floor walked past the deserted teak and chrome reception lobby past silent offices and work stations into his own office which together with nangis comprised the entire westernfacing end of the floor he crossed to a low couch in the welled seating area alongside a huge window and sat staring out at the city the haze pale as green tea was a filthy nimbus occluding his coveted view of mt fuji he knew that very soon he needed to return to america not only to sit down face to face with harley gaunt but also to lobby in person in washington against the rising tide of animosity toward the admittedly arrogant japanese gaunt had hired a man named terrence mcnaughton a professional lobbyist to work on their behalf but nicholas was beginning to believe that in these retrogressive times persuasion by proxy was not enough nicholas ld thought of flying to washington many times during the last several years but always nangi convinced him of the need to stay here to lobby their prointernational stance with the japanese themselves nicholas nangi had argued with unassailable logic was uniquely qualified to do this since the japanese did not view him as an iteki a barbarian outsider nicholass father the englishman colonel denis linnear held a special place in the hearts of the older generation of japanese for he had been seconded to general douglas macarthurs scap headquarters just after the end of world war ii it was he who had liaised so successfully with the upperechelon officials when macarthur had given the defeated japanese a new democratic constitution which had survived into the present when colonel linnear died his funeral was as widely attended and reported as that of any japanese emperor nicholas became aware of tanzan nangi emerging onto the floor before he actually saw him nangi was now well past middle age his face was striking but not in any normal way his right eye was an unseeing milkywhite orb set behind a damaged lid forever frozen half shut otherwise his face might have been that of a topflight diplomat who knew the exigencies of his world and how to maneuver among them nangi tapped on the halfopen door to nicholass suite with the end of his walking stick which was capped by a carving of a dragon depending on the time of day his state of health and the weather he moved more or less stiffly on legs that had been damaged during the war in the pacific the two men greeted each other with warmth and the minimum of formality it would have been far different had anyone else been in the room with them they savored their green macha tea in the silence of close companionship then commenced their morning business the strategic planning for sato which they liked to have set before the rest of the staff arrived the news is very bad nangi began i have been unable to come up with the capital you feel we so desperately need to expand into vietnam nicholas sighed ironic since business is so good look at the last quarters figures demand for the sphynx tpram is far exceeding our current production capabilities the tpram was sato internationals proprietary computer chip the first and only programmable random access memory chip on the market thats why we need to expand into vietnam as quickly as possible ramping up new manufacturing facilities which meet our standards and which also hold down production costs is an exhausting marathon nangi sipped his tea unfortunately sphynx is only one kobun in the keiretsus vast network of businesses not all of them are doing so well kobun was a divisional company within the keiretsu the conglomerate nicholas understood the reference unlike tomkin industries before the merger sato international had always had ready access to capital until now when the ground rules in japan had suddenly changed the most radical difference between american and japanese corporations had in recent years turned from being a valuable asset to a dangerous liability all major keiretsu in japan were either owned by or folded into a commercial bank in satos case it was the daimyo development bank this cozy relationship within the keiretsu allowed it to borrow money for expansion or research and development at low rates and with exceedingly generous terms now however japan was in the grip of an economic crunch of a size and gravity unknown since the horrors of the immediate postwar period it had begun in with the governments misguided efforts to prop up an economy already suffering the first effects of a far too strong yen by artificially creating a land boom investing within their own country these ministers reasoned would mitigate at least to some extent the value of the yen and the theory worked up to a point then values began to stretch the bounds of reality and still japanese businessmen cashrich and arrogant in their seemingly unflagging success poured money into real estate inevitably the bubble burst overleveraged on property they could no longer unload even at steep discounts many businessmen went under losing vast fortunes virtually overnight the carnage grew widening like ripples in a pond moneycenter banks which had blithely extended credit for what had appeared to be giltedged real estate were left with foreclosed properties that could not resupply them with sufficient capital they were forced to draw down assets to pay the huge loan losses and within the space of a year their balance sheets were stained with the red that is the only blood a banker recognizes daimyo development bank was no exception though hit less hard than some that were now out of business the bank was weathering an exceptionally rocky period and its losses had recently become a significant drag on sato internationals bottom line as recently as six months ago nangi had had to replace daimyos chairman and still the mess was far from being under control it was a source of particular humiliation to him since he had once been the banks director the new watchword in japan was risutora something heretofore unheard of industrial contraction japan inc was coming to terms with restructuring a painful reduction in factories consumer goods and japans most precious resource superbly trained and loyal personnel in a country where the expansionist bigger and better had been the key economic phrase for over four decades risutora was a bitter reverse course indeed thankfully nangi and nicholas had never allowed their keiretsu to become bloated and inefficient and nicholass role within the conglomerate was increasing exponentially since he had more experience with significant economic downturns than any japanese nevertheless the crunch in their operating capital was real enough still one way or another weve got to come up with the capital nicholas urged if we dont get involved there in a major way and quickly were going to find ourselves run over by all the other major keiretsu i need to give the situation some more time nangi cautioned not for the first time vietnam is still newly opened and i dont fully trust the government what you mean is you dont trust the vietnamese at all nangi swirled the dregs of his tea around in his cup he disliked this tension between them ever since nicholas had first gone to saigon several years ago to recruit this man vincent tinh as their director in vietnam nangi had been worried tinh was a vietnamese and he supposed nicholas was right he did not trust them so much money already committed to this strange newly capitalist vietnam and nicholas had been pushing him to commit so much more what if the communists returned and nationalized all private business he and nicholas would lose everything these people are opaque to me nangi said raising his eyes from the shifting runes of the tea leaves theyre just different nangi shook his head the hong kong chinese are different and i deal with them all the time theyre devious but i must admit i enjoy their intrigues i have no feel for the vietnamese which is why im handling them nicholas said but just look at the bottom line profits from the small amount of goods we now manufacture out of saigon under vinnies direction are astronomical think what these lower manufacturing costs would do for the kobun whose profits are currently in a downward spiral of course nicholas was right nangi thought he most often was in these matters also he could not minimize nicholass success in predicting trends in business he nodded all right ill do what i can to squeeze the capital we need out of some rock somewhere excellent nicholas said pouring them both more tea you wont regret your decision i hope not nangi said i am going to have to call on some of my yakuza contacts if only you knew the kaisho nicholas said with no little sarcasm i know you have no respect for the yakuza nangi said but then again youve never made any effort to understand them i find that particularly curious considering the pains youve taken in assimilating virtually every other aspect of japanese life the yakuza are gangstersnicholas said flatly of what use would understanding them be to me i cannot answer that nangi said no one can save yourself what i cant fathom is your connection with them leave them to their own dirty business that is like saying please dont inhale nitrogen with your oxygen its just not possible you mean its not practical nangi sighed knowing he was not going to win this argument with his friend he never did go see your kaisho then nicholas said or whoever he is nangi shook his head the kaisho is purported to be the oyabun of all oyabun the boss of all the yakuza family bosses but let me assure you he does not exist it is a term some clever yakuza concocted to keep the police in their place kaisho meant the mysterious commander as long as there is a sense among us outsiders that there is a quasimythical boss of all the oyabun theres a level of the yakuza hierarchy no one can penetrate it aids their mystique enhances their face whenever the cops stage a gamblingparlor raid or two for the media he shifted in his seat all of my yakuza contacts deny any knowledge of a kaisho their conversation eventually turned to the hive computer nicholass pet project which was now on hold because hyrotechinc the american firm designated by the us government to design the computer for all its branches had inexplicably reneged on the deal nicholas had negotiated to manufacture it the most worrisome aspect of this is that no one at hyrotech will return harley gaunts calls nicholas said ive told him to go ahead and institute a lawsuit claiming breach of contract in addition i instructed him to name the us government as codefendant the government nangi said concerned yes i think theyre behind the whole thing stonewalling is their forte not hyrotechs he brought nangi up to date on the companys progress on the chi project nicholas had chosen the name chi which meant wisdom it had been his idea to turn one entire kobun division of the company over to the chi project the chi was a new kind of computer that required no software it was literally as flexible as its user it needed no software because it was a neuralnet machine the chi prototype contained over a thousand minuscule cubes as opposed to chips composed of sixtyfour electronic neurons whose design was based on those in the human brain this machine operated by example a correct decision as determined by its user produced one kind of current through the neural net a wrong decision another kind of current in this way the computer actually learned the functions required of it and how to best perform them without having to be configured for different software interfaces though it looks as if ricoh will be the first to market with a neuralnet computer nicholas said im convinced chi will be far more advanced and will gain us market share very quickly after its introduction the earlymorning meeting ended nangi rose took up his walking stick and went down the hall to his office nicholas spent the next hour and fortyfive minutes calling his manufacturing managers in bangkok singapore saigon kuala lumpur indonesia and guangzhou in southeastern china it should have taken less than half the time but the phone systems in such places were maddeningly inefficient and he had to accustom himself to busy signals being cut off in midsentence and dialing one number and reaching an altogether different one but these calls to what had once been remote unvisited backwashes were becoming increasingly important at last the arduous task of dealing with thirdworld telephone communication was done he glanced at the time then set about making a pot of green tea he had just taken up the whisk when his private line rang he put the heavy iron kettle down stared at the phone too early in the morning for this line to be ringing he thought he picked up the receiver with a distinct sense of foreboding moshimoshi mr linnear nicholas linnear said an unfamiliar voice in his ear who is calling i represent mikio okami does the name mean anything to you nicholas could feel his heartbeat strong and heavy in his throat he fought to control his breathing how did you get this number mikio okami extends his personal greetings the voice said okamisan takes care of everything there was a brief pause during which nicholas was certain he could hear the other person breathing softly okamisan wishes to nicholas said here is a phone number he reeled off eight digits use it in ten minutes he took the first sixty seconds after replacing the phone to regain complete control of his breathing then he did five minutes of zazen but even the meditation could not stop his mind from racing backward in time before nicholass father had died he told him that mikio okami was a friend of his a very special friend the colonel had told nicholas that he owed okami his life that if okami should contact nicholas the situation would be such that okami had no other recourse but to ask for nicholass help now after all these years the call had come nicholas went out of his office down the stilldeserted corridor to the bank of elevators the chairmans elevator was waiting for him patient as a loyal servant but he wondered as he pressed the button for the mezzanine level where it was taking him this time nicholas and nangi had decided to buy the mezzanine space in the shinjuku suiryu building late last year after an unconscionably overpriced french restaurant went bust since then they had gutted the vast threestory space installed their own interior walls and begun work on an opulent nightclub called indigo the smells of lathe and plaster varnish paint and heated flex greeted nicholas as he stepped off the elevator the foreman recognized him at once bowed and handed him a hardhat which nicholas wordlessly put on he went straight to a wall phone he had only thirty seconds to wait before it rang yes mr linnear speaking ah there was a great deal of emotion in that one brief exclamation i understand it is safe now to speak i am gratified that we have connected so quickly nicholas was gazing into a space composed of a series of curlededged platforms large enough to hold three or four small tables each with a semicircular banquette which the architect had designed to appear as if they were floating like magic carpets above a cuneiform dancefloor laseretched to resemble a persian rug who is this nicholas asked tou obviously know me but i am employed by mikio okami my name is therefore of no matter the voice waited a beat do you remember your promise yes of course nicholas said okamisan is in need of your most immediate help i understand he requires you to go to venice italy a firstclass ticket in your name is waiting for you at the air france counter at narita please be prompt and pick it up at least two hours before flight time pm this evening i cant just drop every nicholas stopped realizing he was speaking to dead air the voice had already hung up nicholas replaced the receiver plaster dust hung in the air made sharp and glittery by the many workers tungsten clamplights which were strong enough to define every edge and sweeping curve reveal even the most minute flaw in the skin of sanddusted stucco being applied to the major vertical surfaces he thought about what little his father had told him about the mysterious mikio okami there are times nicholas when one exhausts every ordinary means of accomplishing ones goal denis linnear had told him when nicholas was no more than thirteen still that goal must be achieved at any cost you are young now but believe it or not there are such times when the end is so vital that the means to that end must be overlooked it may be unfortunate but one cannot live ones life as a saint one must oftentimes make compromises painful and questionable though they may be so there are times when one is grateful one knows a man such as mikio okami suddenly in the wake of the call the colonels words had taken on a very sinister cast indeed nicholas had surmised even then so long ago that mikio okami had to be yakuza in fact given the difficult and demanding nature of his fathers work in the muddy postwar flux of japanese political circles it seemed natural that he would have come into contact with this potent and rather ubiquitous element of japanese society nicholas remembered hearing persistent rumors of factions of yakuza being hired by the american occupation hierarchy to quell certain labor strikes in said to be coordinated and funded by the communists the fierce and intimidating yakuza were the logical foot soldiers in such an internecine war since they were the quintessential capitalistloyalists ready and willing to die for the freedom of their country virulently opposed to any leftist tilt but if mikio okami had been a yakuza oyabun family boss just after the war and assuming generously nicholas thought that he was thirty at the time he would be in his late seventies now possibly over eighty too old to continue the neverending orchestration required to maintain the yakuzas unique symbiosis with the police government and bureaucracies or old enough to be in need of reinforcements against the encroachment of the other yakuza families on the rise in power and influence either way he did not like the possibilities back in his office nicholas hastily dictated two memos to seiko ito his assistant the first to tell her of his trip and to confirm his reservations the second regarding the eight most vital matters that required followups letters calls faxes he faxed vinnie tinh in the saigon office that he would be postponing his planned trip for at least a week then made a raft of calls which he was planning to put off until after the saigon trip that done he thought about justine she would be livid of course bad enough he had refused to take her back to the states now he was leaving her alone in japan how was it he thought that she had come to despise this place was it her refusal to learn japanese her eternal homesickness or just her intolerance of the japanese themselves perhaps it was a combination of all three other than her friendship with nangi she had made precious few connections in tokyo and thus found herself isolated enisled on an elba of her own making or was it of her own making nicholas wondered if he was being unfair to her or whether he was simply fed up with her complaining of course there were pressures peculiar to their circumstance justine had been pregnant twice the first time she had given birth to a girl who had quickly died the second time less than a year ago she had miscarried in her sixth month now there seemed to be no solace for her agony nicholas put his head in his hands his mind haunted still by the face of his threeweekold daughter her bluewhite face distorted by the oxygen tent his dreams echoed with the feeble sound of her small cries like the iebrile panting of a wolf snapping at his heels he heard sounds from the corridors as the offices began to fill up he had no interest in facing anyone at the moment so he slipped out the side door to his office took the spiral staircase down one flight to the fully equipped gymnasium there stripped to shorts tshirt and sneakers he spent the next three hours working first on aerobics then abdominals weightcircuittraining and finally his beloved martial arts aikido kendo as well as the various subdisciplines of akshara that were so ancient that they had no names in the japanese language in this manner he cleansed first his body then his mind and finally his spirit of the various negative toxins that the postmodern world invariably built up nicholas was longmuscled and wideshouldered it was obvious that he was an athlete of some kind but it was his presence what the japanese called hara that made him such an extraordinarily intimidating figure he moved from the waist down as if his feet were a part of the floor or the earth he walked upon seeing him for the first time one had the distinct feeling that he could not be moved from the spot on which he stood even with extreme measures he had the unusually upswept eyes that were a legacy of his mother along with the angular rugged cheeks nose and chin of his father he was handsome in a charismatic rather than a posterboy manner with dark curling hair flecked here and there with silver he himself did not see it but those old enough to have known colonel denis linnear saw the striking resemblance between father and son in the overall shape of nicholass face the line of his nose lips and jaw the father who counted among his ancestors calculating romans and wild celts rather than barbarous saxons had that extraordinary gift of being both warrior and statesman it was said by those who knew them both that the son possessed the same quality nicholass mother cheong was oriental and it was only recently that he had been able to unravel the puzzle of her origins she had been secretly tanjian like nicholass chinese grandfather sopeng who had adopted her so was nicholas trained in the arcane mysteries of tautau the tanjian whose origins harked back to mythshrouded ancient china were ancient magewarriors who wielded a knowledge so potent so elemental that most humans had been cut off from it for centuries the basis of tautau was kokoro the heart of the cosmos kokoro was the membrane of life just as in physics the excitation of the atom caused the most extraordinary reactions of energy light heat and percussion so too did the excitation of the cosmic membrane manifest its own ethereal energy akshara and kshira the way of light and the path of darkness were the two main branches of tautau nicholas who had been only recently trained in the basics of akshara had nevertheless some experience as well battling those versed in the deadly path of shadows he was perhaps the only man on earth who had faced and defeated two kshira adepts this he had done partly by utilizing the gift sopeng had passed down to him the mystic emeralds of the tanjian they had become a kind of psychic weapon which had penetrated even kansatsus kshira and at nicholass bidding had destroyed him kansatsu had instructed nicholas in akshara but all the while he was also secretly an adept in kshira and it was kshira which had almost destroyed nicholas in a very real way it was kshira which had destroyed kansatsu he had believed himself capable of containing the two separate disciplines inside himself he had believed himself powerful enough to keep kshira harnessed using it only when required but he was wrong its pollutant had seeped out and so slowly that he had not been able to recognize it it had poisoned him turning him from good to evil the more nicholas studied akshara the more he understood kansatsus temptation for it was becoming clear to him that the way of light was in some aspects an incomplete discipline no records existed that far back in time but he suspected that in the first days of tautau the two disciplines were part of one whole at what point they were riven in two or why he could not say perhaps at some date now long forgotten the mind of man even a tanjian mind could no longer be trusted to use the knowledge of kshira in a prudent fashion perhaps the lure of massive power became too great even for these ancient mages of the mind in any event what was once one was now forever separated by such a profound philosophical abyss that proponents of akshara were forbidden to plunge into the dark mysteries of kshira once kansatsu had spoken of koryoku the illuminating power with the kind of reverence he reserved only for gods if there had ever been a focal point real or imagined between akshara and kshira kansatsu had been convinced koryoku was it his anguish that for all his expertise in tautau he could not achieve the illuminating power must have been a crushing blow to him one so deeply felt that he had not allowed anyone to suspect in his studies after kansatsus death nicholas had come to believe that koryoku might be the path the needlelike fulcrum from which the whole would open up like a flower he had named this whole shuken the dominion where one mind could contain akshara and kshira both hemispheres of tautau without being destroyed by the dark side but koryoku was not like other states of deep meditation though little was known about it it seemed clear that one needed to be born with a kind of psychic trigger that would access the doorway without that trigger no amount of study concentration or incantation at kokoro would prove useful nicholas had never encountered anyone with koryoku and so had never been able to test his theories he did not even know whether he himself possessed the trigger that would access the doorway only another so gifted could tell him sometimes lying in the shallows of night nicholas started awake to discover that he had been dreaming in his dreamworld he existed in shuken as he believed his forebears had once done open to the full limits of tautau the full sphere of akshara and kshira at his command and he knew with the certainty that comes in dreams that koryoku was the sole path to shuken as he rose out of theta parted from his dream he could almost reach out and touch koryoku the doorway just another second and but when he became fully awake the knowledge was lost to him and he could not help but feel an acute sense of loss which brought tears to his eyes still he knew he had an entire new world to explore this reason perhaps more than any other had compelled him to remain in japan even though this was a source of increasing friction between him and his wife justine who longed to return to america the thought of justines unhappiness was as painful as the sight of a stunned sparrow he put his hand across his eyes as he closed them even this far from her he could feel her distress like a childs cry in the night and yet there was a kind of abyss between them dark and unfathomable how long had it been there nicholas beginning to slide into tautau tasted it found it as familiar as an old jacket with a start he realized that it had begun to form at the time he had discovered he was tanjian was he slipping further away from the world most people knew were his explorations of the tautau universe giving rise to a form of anomie from which he could not extricate himself he did not think so and yet there was that abyss yawning between him and justine sometimes his anger at justine was palpable she had been in japan for years now yet she had failed to make the requisite effort in joining in she had no japanese friends of her own save nangi and that was at his instigation and continuing effort she still exhibited the westerners typical bewilderment at the complex net of customs courtesies and expressions of respect that defined japanese society and worst of all she was beginning to exhibit that kind of blind impatience and outright resentment toward the japanese nicholas had witnessed in a number of american business contacts as kansatsu had taught him he began the journey inward until he reached kokoro the heart of all things then he selected the proper rhythm began to beat at the membrane of kokoro creating the psychic resonance that would transform thought into deed sinking deeper into akshara the reverberations of kokoro filling the space around him nicholass consciousness expanded until it filled the entire gym then burst beyond the confining walls in his mind he saw the city stretched out before him and then as if he were gathering enormous speed the image of its bustling sprawl blurred that familiar sensation of confinement fell away as with a burst of psychic energy he broke through the womb of time outside in the spangled darkness past present and future existed only as meaningless definitions of concepts that did not exist he did not yet know his way through this space or how to most effectively utilize its infinite horizons that would take many years of trial and error instruction would have been preferable of course but the only other tanjian who had been qualified to teach him was now dead at his own hands and the inexorable forces of tautau how long nicholas spent in exploration of his new world it was difficult to say because time as humans knew it did not correspond in that state they had a taste of what it was like to be outside in the midst of dreams when hours even days could seemingly be compressed into the space of microseconds when he again opened his eyes he felt refreshed and invigorated the ghost of justines unhappiness was a scent in the air soon dissipated during his workout the cordless phone at one end of the gym rang several times and even though he knew the calls must be for him he ignored them his staff was used to his eccentric schedules and they understood that if he did not answer he should only be disturbed in case of a fullscale emergency he stood beneath a cold shower took a steam then showered again and dressed in new clothes even the terrible image of his infant daughter as she took her last gasping breath had been expunged for a time seiko was waiting for him outside the gymnasium true to her work ethic she had taken several folders of paperwork and while she sat on a low rung of the spiral stairs she industriously made notes corrections and scheduling rearrangements for her boss seiko nicholas said she jumped up slammed her folders shut and bowed deeply then pulled her gleaming hair back from her cheek her beauty seeming so fragile because of her translucent skin actually appeared to have deepened during the time she had worked as his assistant linnearsan she said i have received faxes of the litigation our new york lawyers have prepared against hyrotechinc i think you should review them before you leave have you looked at them nicholas asked as they mounted the stairs toward his offices yes sir i have questions on clauses a and c seiko i dont know how long im going to be away he said as they reached the landing youve got to get used to relying on your own good judgement just remember i trust you he smiled at her as he led the way to his office now tell me your concerns on how the lawsuit is worded she answered him in clear concise phrases and he saw immediately that she had a facility for cutting through the mindnumbing legalese i agree he told her when she had finished let me see how you would solve the problems in a revised draft before i leave the office this afternoon if i agree with you well run it by the legal department in new york before she left he added and tell nangisan that i need to see him as soon as possible here i am in a sleazy motel off highway margarite goldoni thought what am i doing here i must have lost my mind no not your mind she reminded herself your freedom they were ten miles from marine on st croix minnesota this small town was where witsec in their infinite wisdom had chosen to transport dominic goldoni they had given him new identity documents a house two cars a consultancy job that fit in with his background as a construction engineer the whole nine yards robert had insisted she bring francine with them which had quite naturally terrified her but she could see his point holding her and francine hostage would keep tony quiet of course dominics first reaction was to kill tony slowly he had said to her ill kill the sonuvabitch so slowly his eyeballs will pop out with pain a very venetian response but then she had said we both need tony dom and he had gone quiet ruminating she was quite certain on hatred and ambition and when she had suggested they meet alone he had agreed under the circumstances it made sense and he knew it all the way out to minnesota she had begged robert to let francine go robert had merely turned to her smiling into her face as if he were her lover instead of her captor if it had been just the two of them they could have taken a plane she supposed but there was francine to think of so he had her drive them in her bmw besides she came to see that any other means of transportation would have left a more distinct trail in the car robert could see a tail and take evasive measures on the other hand he had had her write out a message to her husband in it she had written that if her captor even suspected that tony had posted surveillance he would kill francine she thought that was a directive tony the sicilian could take to heart to be truthful she didnt really mind the driving the endless miles of the interstates lulled her into a false sense of security here on the american roads they seemed unbound by time lost in a wilderness of strip malls convenience stores and used car lots and it seemed to her that she almost forgot that they had a destination could push it into the furthest reaches of her mind as if it only existed in some nightmare realm that had lost the immediacy of reality besides there was a relief vivid as hunger pangs at being away from tony then they entered minnesota and the future became inescapable she wept bitter tears in the mean motel by the side of the highway the inconstant hum of the passing cars took the place of the drone of insects it no longer mattered whether she was in the city or the country because she existed in a twilight world a fly trapped in amber consumed by what was about to take place francine who was drugged throughout the entire trip lay on the cot provided by the motel owner robert sat on his side of the bed reading an issue of forbes magazine just as if he was her husband tony he appeared unmoved by her tears but as she dragged herself beneath the sheets he had put away the magazine and said tomorrow well see your brother and it will all be over margarite shivering so much that she drew the covers up to her chin said what will happen for a long time robert did not answer she could feel him his heat hear his slow tidal breathing smell his peculiar though not unpleasant scent but she could not look at him to give him such reality she knew would be too much for her to bear go to sleep his voice was soft almost gentle so that in the end she felt compelled to turn her head look at him his face was handsome in the light endemic to motels at night a pallid violetblue from the neons and bug zappers that seeped through the flyblown curtains like ash in another all too imaginable reality he might have been her lover tenderly turning to her as she extinguished the lights she closed her eyes trying in vain to imagine such a reality as if by that mental effort she might be able to conjure it up and escape the terrible trap that had been laid for her on that last night of their journey to the nexus point that would forever alter her she thought again about the vicissitudes of escape of course dom had insisted that francine come to see him but now margarite saw what robert had known all along that escape with a drugged girl was impossible he knew what she was thinking margarite was left with this one unalterable fact in order to escape she would have to kill him she did not know whether she had it in her not whether she had the courage to put a bullet into his brain or a knife into his heart but whether she was smart enough to get the opportunity to do it he carried with him an oldfashioned straight razor she had caught a glimpse of him their first night on the road shaving his arms while she was tied to the bed twisting on one side so that part of the mirror over the sink in the bathroom brought her his reflection he had very little hair on his body but apparently he was happier with none the bathroom was the only place he allowed her to be alone but she could not lock the door could not even close it all the way and squatting on the seat she was always aware of his breathing his bulk just out of her sight also she worried about francine who was sleeping in the grip of the liquid he would force down her throat each morning he had a bag of phials and small canisters tucked away in the kit bag in which resided like a deathshead her savior the razor every night he would spend an hour or so grinding what looked to her to be roots and herbs and unidentifiable dried things in a stone mortar adding at times liquids from his phials what was he doing these alchemical constructs which by degrees perfumed the dose air of their mean motel rooms seemed the most menacing part of him she was certain she could feel an almost primitive heat emanating from them a kind of power which frightened her she was not by nature a superstitious person but his almost cabalistic absorption in these ceremonies in the dark unnerved her it was as if he possessed a power to make real the stuff of nightmare she could imagine him extending himself into a dark corner wrenching out a shadow and turning it inside out making it real lights out he had said to her stretching toward the bedside lamp wait she had whispered i have to use the bathroom her face taut with fear she had crossed the room shut the bathroom door just enough to block him out as she lifted her nightgown she could hear him getting out of bed padding after her to stand breathing shallowly behind the door hearing him without seeing him was in some ways worse because her imagination working overtime conjured up his presence ghostly and evil as if he had the power to drift through solid objects to reach her she peed noisily wiped herself then flushed the toilet under that meager cover she twisted toward the sink turned on the tap with her left hand with her right she picked out the straight razor from his open kit bag she experienced an instant of panic then because she had not thought it through where was she going to secrete the thing so that he would not see it she could only imagine one place and she quickly bent her knees and spread her legs inserting it into her warmth it was not easy but the pain served as a tangible confirmation of her will to do this terrible thing with a trembling hand she turned off the tap went out to where he waited for her in the semidark finished she nodded at him too terrified to speak in bed she pulled the covers over her turned away from him he extinguished the light she felt him she imagined that she would always feel him that curious sense of menace and arousal which confused and appalled her she put her hand on the thatch of hair between her thighs moving her forefinger over the end of the razor she forced herself not to shudder she closed her eyes trying to still the hammering of her heart but surely it was only her imagination that warned her this might betray her all the same she started when she felt the press of his hand on her shoulder youre vibrating she had given a little moan he knew what she was thinking what do you mean i can see the energy boiling off you like smoke she turned around in the dark to face him you can see what i can see auras he said theres a way ive been trained okay so you can see im frightened what did you expect im all alone here with my little girl had her voice cracked she bit her lip determined to keep better control over herself but she could feel the rivulets of sweat under her arms in the small of her back at the idea that he had the ability to see inside her to know her very thoughts he said were all alone in the end with our sins she shuddered i was never alone ever since i can remember ive been in the company of men my father my uncle then boyfriends lovers a husband what must it be like to be alone the freedom it must ive always been alone he said thoughtfully even in the most crowded city street i am isolated dont you have any family friends who can i really count on he said but myself for the first time she thought she could see behind the dangerous shell of him and she thought hes been damaged what family i had is dead dangerous margarite turned toward him clearly fascinated dangerous he continued to stare at the ceiling striped by pale phosphorescent light family he said after a time family is dangerous no no youre wrong family is the only solace in times of tragedy not if the tragedy destroys what family you had he said all the love you missed damaged we rise at dawn go to sleep he said she watched him afraid now to turn away how in christ do you expect me to sleep what would it be like to see mother and father sister destroyed in front of ones eyes she asked herself the very idea was impossible to imagine if she were an actress perhaps weeping bitter tears she contrived to well up out of her the bodies strewn in front of her blood that would never coagulate or turn brown smeared over them weeping until the director yelled cut and the cameras stopped rolling only then but in real life no never come here he said in a voice that floated over her like a buzzard crossing a ravine it took her a moment to realize that he was holding his arms out to her she wanted to laugh to spit in his face but she also felt the razor warm inside her and there was something else a mysterious emotion elusive as mist which locked her lips together in retrospect it still surprised her that she crawled into his embrace as meekly as a child stunned her that in the grip of that embrace she felt more protected than she had ever felt before what was happening to her she had no answer had he somehow managed to enchant her with one of his magic potions she thought back to when she had eaten or taken something to drink had he secreted something at those times terrified she could not say how like his signature these bruises are with his fingertips on her purple flesh she could not speak her mind was blank save for the warmth she felt flowing from him entering her where she hurt the most his head bent and his mouth opened against those bruises and she felt his tongue a pressure and then nothing as if even the memories that had lingered in those painful places had been exorcized she shivered when she felt his lips on her neck at the tender place where her carotid artery softly pulsed he did something then with his tongue that sent ripples of desire through her she felt her nipples stiffen and she grew damp between her thighs it was then that she reached down the razor thus lubricated came out without the difficulty she had had in sliding it in it lay in the palm of her hand gravid with its promise of death warm as a living thing margarite closed her slender fingers around it and her lips opened to expel a soft groan she used her forefinger to swing open the blade and now she was ready his tongue slipped into the hollow between her breasts a place that had always been a spot of intense arousal for her he knows she thought the blade moved as if of its own volition a beast hungry to taste blood to slice through flesh and sinew kill him now said a voice in her mind its what you want it will get you out of the trap she squeezed her eyes shut and grunting with the effort swung her arm across the space between them the edge of the blade struck him dead on but instead of cutting him the steel slid harmlessly along the skin of his lower belly she could see him grinning his teeth large and white in the dimness as he held up her hand with one of his clasped the opened razor blade with his other one margarite gasped as he opened his fingers they were uncut touch it he said the blade is unsharpened the one i use is locked away his grin broadened i could feel you watching me your eyes following the track of the blade as it scraped away my hair i know greed margarite and i could feel your greed you wanted my razor and i gave it to you no she said faintly dropping it on the sheets between them you gave me nothing the acrid taste of bile was in her mouth she thought she might be sick on the contrary he said taking her in his arms again i have given you what is most important a taste of your revenge his tongue touched her skin again i wonder margarite was it as sweet as you had imagined it to be she had refused to answer him instead swallowing heavily to try to rid her mouth of the awful taste and again she thought he knows answer me his voice so sudden so harsh that she started and said yes i suspected as much he said with a curious satisfaction which caught her you would have killed me you have it in you she could smell his breath a scent of cloves hear his heartbeat i dont have to listen to this and what else have i given you margarite do i need to tell you now you know you have the strength of purpose to do anything he touched her nipples setting them on fire now you see that i know you better than you know yourself lying there quiescent the impotent razor digging into one buttock she tried to summon up her revulsion of him and shockingly could not she was dizzy with a longing she could not name with a desire she could not acknowledge slowly as if her body weighed a thousand pounds she turned over away from him into the darkness outside the window cars passed whirring like insects home once it was all the comfort he required nicholass house was located on the outskirts of tokyo it had been a strictly japanese structure inside and out when he had first bought it from the estate of his late aunt itami but gradually justine had transformed the inside ordering tiles wall coverings fixtures and furniture from the states italy and france until he no longer recognized the place with which he had originally fallen in love the camphorwood beam exterior and the surrounding landscape had so far been spared her hand but lately she had been making noises about wanting to turn the expanse of painstakingly manicured rare miniature parviflora and cryptomeria into a traditional english perennial garden denying her what she really wanted to return to her home in america nicholas had been loath to deny her these smaller concessions which would surely make her feel more at home here not only had these transformations failed to assuage her essential unease but he realized now as he spun around the dangerous hairpin turn near the house they had made him uncomfortable in the one place he had once felt most at ease even the construction going on two lots further down the road hadnt dampened his love for the place but he took the last halfmile at a slower than normal speed it was a good thing he did because just before the driveway to the house he came upon one of the gigantic earthmovers being used to excavate the new houses foundation and he was obliged to pull into a neighbors driveway so that the monstrous vehicle could safely pass justine was waiting for him he saw her as he went up the roughhewn stone path from the gravel parking area her hazel eyes were the green they turned when she was upset or under stress and the red motes danced in her left eye seiko called she said even before he had a chance to kiss her hello were you too busy to phone me yourself she turned on her heel went inside where he followed her into the kitchen the truth was i was too upset he said i had to work out to calm myself down he went past her began the preparations for brewing green tea god youve become just like all your japanese friends when only talk will do you go ahead and brew your foultasting green tea im happy to talk to you he said as he measured out the finely cut leaf took up the reed whisk why did you ask seiko to call me i didnt he said she saw it as her duty well she was wrong the water was boiling in the ceramic pot he took it up poured it carefully into the cup why cant you understand here efficiency is the most prized dammit justines outflung hand slapped the cup across the counter it skidded into the wall smashed to pieces im tired of hearing about whats important to the japanese she ignored the reddening mark on her wrist where the boiling water had scalded her what about whats important to this american why is it always a matter of my having to adapt to their way of doing things youre in their country and you but i dont want to be here tears were coursing down her cheeks i cant stand it any more being the outsider feeling no emotion from them but this subtle hostility its freezing my bones nick i cant memorize one more minuscule custom ritual protocol formality or courtesy im fed up with being shoved out of the way on the streets pushed aside when im trying to use a public washroom elbowed on a subway platform how a people who are so insufferably polite in their own homes can be so rude in public is beyond me ive told you justine if a space doesnt belong to any individual like a public space the japanese feel theres no need for politeness justine was trembling and weeping all at once these people are nuts nick she turned on him if im going to be left alone with these madmen at least i should have heard it from you im sorry she said nothing justine seiko was only doing her job then shes too efficient by half how can you be angry with her for being efficient he looked at her carefully and was struck by how strange this house had become it was like a suit you had liked in the store but didnt in the clear light of day this isnt about seiko calling you is it she turned away her palms flat against the counter her arms like rigid poles her long dark hair was disheveled her body almost painfully thin no she said in a strangled voice but it is about seiko he saw the extreme tension in the hunch of her shoulders the way she stood spreadlegged she had unconsciously assumed the stance of a street fighter spoiling for a confrontation nicholas was about to say something then thought better of it intuiting that she would use anything he said now as further provocation justine turned her face dark with anger that had been pentup too long are you having an affair with seiko what are you talking about tell me the truth dammit anything will be better than this hell of suspicion he took a step toward her justine seiko is my assistant period is that thewhole truth youd better search your soul before you answer why would you doubt me her stricken face hung before him and his heart broke justine youve spent so much time with her it was necessary her shoulders shook taking her to saigon she knows vietnam far better than either nangi or i i couldnt have completed my business in saigon without her he went to her took her in his arms oh christ nick im sorry i dont know at his touch all the tension went out of her and a heat flowed through her to him his lips came down over hers and her mouth was already open her tongue hungrily entwined with his her heat suffused him warming a body whose bones it seemed had indeed grown cold in the bitterness of her accusations it had been unfair of her to suspect him he knew even as he was uncomfortably aware that it was unfair of him to continue to imprison her here in a land she despised and could never understand he opened her shirt held her breasts in his hands as the nipples grew taut and hot her mouth would not relinquish its hold on him and he thrust his hands down further unfastening the western belt dragging her jeans off her thighs he was so hard he pushed up against her urgently but she shoved him back with surprising strength slipping to her knees before him she undressed him with sure knowledge justine her hand encircled the base of him while her hot mouth slipped over the tip he tried to pull her up and away but she resisted him he did not want this now to see her submissive so terrified of losing him that she would do anything to keep him hers he wanted only to lose himself inside her to block out all else in their intimate twining to remove her doubt about him and their life together but in the end her busy tongue and lips obliterated his resolve and he dug his fingers into her thick hair feeling her head move back and forth at last he found the strength to drag her away from him he picked her up as if she were a child and her thighs came around him he could taste the sex in her mouth as it came down over his he found her open and waiting and with a deep groan she impaled herself on him to the hilt she was so wild that he had no choice but to cede control of their movements to her it was all he could do to keep up with her he felt her belly ripple as her nipples whipped back and forth across his chest he felt the tremoring of the muscles on the insides of her thighs and the vibrations of her hard breathless grunts into his mouth there was no rhythm just a clawing animalistic response of pleasure and surely of pain as she bit him deep enough to draw blood with that her ecstatic spasms began in her groin spiralling outward until she shook and trembled as if in the grip of a terrible illness she cried out and tears flew from the corners of her tightly closed eyes the dense cloud of her wet hair engulfed him as he felt her working her sex against him in stages as she rose higher and higher in a series of orgasms that brought him over the edge he felt her fingers on his scrotum clutching urgently while she whispered incoherently into his ear and he collapsed to the floor with her still clasped tightly in his arms she was weeping uncontrollably and he kissed her lips her cheeks eyes forehead and temples justine justine as soon as i get back from venice i promise well go to new york for a long time she said nothing her face buried in his shoulder her mouth half open as she tasted his sweat and blood when at length she looked up into his face he was sick to recognize the despair there please dont go nick i justine i have no choice im begging you just stay with me a few days take time off from work from everything well go away into the countryside to nara the ryokan you like so much that sounds wonderful but this trip is not of my making i cant just tell me whats so important in venice and i swear ill try to understand an old friend of my father needs my help who is he im not sure you mean you dont know him justine i gave my word to my father just before he died i have a duty she shook her head tears rolling down her cheeks again ah now we come to it your duty dont you have a duty to me please try to understand god knows ive tried but this japanese concept of giri of a debt of duty i most certainly do not understand and dyou know what i realize now i dont want to try any more she rose unsteadily stared down at him first it was your business then your friendship with nangi then your trips to saigon with seiko now this a duty to a father whos been dead for years to help someone you ve never even met christ youre as crazy as all the rest of them justine he reached out for her but she had already spun away from him was fleeing down the hall in a moment he heard a door slam but he made no move to go after her what would be the point sadly he got up slowly dressed himself with wooden fingers he went silently out the back door through the whispering cryptomeria the sky was misted gray a soup thickened by swirling clouds that hung low like the robes of ghostly daimyo from ages past he made his way through the garden and before he knew it found himself ascending the slope filled with a copse of carefully planted ginkgo ancient of ancients their white trunks like sentinels the vestiges of their copper bilobed leaves trembling like the fingers of an oracle he had no conscious idea of where he was headed until he topped the rise and below him saw the lake the water was invisible beneath the curling layer of nacreous mist father nicholas thought he crouched on the boggy bank of the lake looking into the mist as if it were an alchemists mirror that could break the barrier of time in that mirror he saw the colonel and himself younger and innocent as the elder linneargave him the present of isshogai the daikatana the long samurai sword that many years later nicholas had hurled into this lake he could feel isshogai now just as he could see it as it struck the water so many years ago plunging vertically to the bottom and now as past and present began to collide it seemed so close to him that he could reach out and touch it he had thought he was quits with it then that he had no more need of its power to inflict death but like his own past with his father like his present with justine there was an essential element unknown as yet unwritten that remained unresolved the colonel whom nicholas loved and revered had nevertheless had a secret life wholly apart from nicholas and cheong nicholas had discovered years after the colonels death that he had murdered a dangerous political radical named satsugai he was the husband of nicholass aunt itami and though she despised him still she was his wife the colonels action had had the profoundest effect on nicholass life when satsugais son saigo had sought to murder nicholas in revenge the phone call from mikio okami had stirred waters that for a long time had remained unruffled the colonels secret life what had he been up to with mikio okami why had he made friends with a yakuza oyabun nicholas had no answers to these questions he only knew that in seeking them he was being drawn once again toward his father and toward the unknown past at last he rose went as silently as he had come returning through forest and glade past dreaming gardens along stone paths laid centuries ago to the kitchen of his house for the longest time he stood looking out the window at the cryptomeria and the cutleaf maples whose boughs were dancing in the wind he had only moments before felt against his flesh at last he turned to the counter reached for a cup measuring out the macha the finely cut green tea leaf he took up the reed whisk waiting for the water to boil harley gaunt was in the middle of a crisis of brobdingnagian proportions bad enough that tomkinsato industries was losing accounts pressured no doubt by retrocessive democrats espousing pernicious isolationist economics with the feverish zeal of bornagain christians but now the corporate headquarters here in manhattan was literally under siege by consumers incensed by what placards on the street below misidentified as consorting with the enemy all chickens eventually come home to roost gaunt thought as he stared gloomily out his office window at the gathering demonstration as he watched like a hawk in its eyrie he saw a cnn remote tv truck pull up within minutes the local tv stations were represented then the networks as usual dead last christ he thought i need nicholas over here weve ridden the economic rollercoaster of our merger with sato international all the way up to the top of the loop and from where im sitting the ride down is going to be scary as hell his intercom buzzed and he answered curtly suzie is that mr linnear on the line im afraid not mr gaunt his secretarys voice spoke out of thin air but your ten oclock appointment is here what ten oclock appointment you remember he called late yesterday i told you i put it on your calendar just before i left for the day i dont but gaunt was already turning from the stomachchurning scene out his window his eye catching the hastily scribbled notation on the calendar section of his computer terminal who the hell is edward minton hes from washington suzie said as if that solved the riddle he flew in first thing this morning on the shuttle to see you gaunts stomach knotted he didnt like the sound of that those democrats on the hill were positively incendiary on the subject of the japanese according to them an economic war was brewing and all americans required the benevolent protection of the democratic party in order to avoid the economic humiliations plotted for us in some moldy subbasement of the imperial palace in tokyo tojo lives might well be their battle cry though he had begun to notice springing up like noxious mushrooms in a humid climate posters of the imperial rising sun of japan encircled with a red line another red line running diagonally through it these were to him nothing more than a symbol of the moral bankruptcy of his own country an advertisers dream where even the most complex issues could be reduced to simplistic decais gaunt closed his eyes for a moment he was a massive man with as much fat as muscle a threeletter man in college athletics who typical of his kind assumed that heavy physical exercise once accomplished need not be continued to maintain form he had been a wide receiver of no little renown and on the mound of a baseball diamond had once possessed a slider that justifiably intimidated the opposition only being hit in the shoulder by a wicked line drive had kept him out of professional sports lucky for him no doubt since even if his bank account would have swollen his mind would have atrophied the fact was that gaunt was possessed of an intelligence rare in his chosen field of administration he could summon up that astonishing leap of insight usually the purview of programming geniuses and maverick entrepreneurs this was how he had come to the attention of nicholas linnear and why nicholas had promoted him to managing director north america of tomkinsato industries now that intuition told him that his ten oclock was poison he put his fingers to his forehead closed his eyes for a moment as if with force of will alone he could cause edward minton to disappear mr gaunt yes suzie its ten fifteen gaunt sighed in that case send mr minton in if gaunts body had lost the hard athletes edge it had possessed in college his face had not it was still firmjawed and there was no wattle under his chin as astonished he had noted in many of his classmates at their last reunion his hair still thick was flecked with gray but this matched the sprays of that color in his brown eyes what lines appeared in his face were like those etched by a fine sculptor they seemed to belong there to moreover have always beenthere part of his craggy strength his canny insight edward minton was on the other hand a whole differ ent story tall and thin he had that stoopshouldered mien of those made selfconscious at an early age of their ungainly height he had skin the color of wax paper by which hue gaunts worst fears were realized he was governmentissue and right now that was as ill an omen as a crow in a cornfield minton wore a threepiece suit shiny at the elbows rumpled at crotch and sleeves of an indeterminate color and material no doubt it was fireretardant he wore steelrimmed spectacles above a straight nose thin lips behind them were the clear blue eyes of the raptor gaunt was unsurprised to see a gold phi beta kappa chain strung from the watch pocket of his vest politicians were like dogs gaunt observed silently they liked best to lie down with their own breed mr minton he said now wrapping a smile around his lips wont you sit down what can i do for you minton who had brought with him his own gust of illscented air settled himself in a leather and chromium chair on the other side of gaunts old scarred mahogany desk quite a crowd youve collected downstairs he said with the brittle tone of a scolding mother these things have a way of blowing over gaunt countered by tomorrow afternoon the war in yugoslavia will be back on the front page perhaps not this time minton said as he spoke he fondled his phi beta kappa in that conspicuous way certain men will a magnificent woman whose services they have bought for the evening these are hard times in america and the populace is aroused his lenses flashed with light as he turned his head slightly by the practiced way he did it gaunt could tell he was well schooled in the tactics of intimidation i believe that we are seeing a locomotive of incalculable energy stoking up steam fondle fondle phi beta kappa gaunt was willing to bet this bastard knew he had never even finished college when it gets under way mr gaunt i pity the person or company that stands astride its tracks gaunt cleared his throat but said nothing he felt a bit like marie antoinette it was always like this he thought when you waited for the guillotine to fall we on capitol hill have taken the pulse of the growing unrest in america and were determined to respond with alacrity and force to what the people want what you want more like it gaunt said under his breath what minton leaned forward suddenly alert as a terrier scenting its prey what did you say i merely cleared my throat a certain rigidity had come into mintons spine what the people of the united states want is for japan inc to get out of their face and that mr gaunt is precisely what the congress of the united states proposes to give them he slapped a folded sheet of paper onto the desk i am a prosecutor in the us attorney generals office on assignment to the senate i am here to inform you that you hariey gaunt as managing director of tomkinsato industries and one nicholas linnear chairman and chief operating officer of tomkinsato industries are hereby subpoenaed by the senate of the united states of america i am also to inform you that you are the subject of an investigation of the senate strategic economic oversight committee by order of senator ranee bane you are hereby ordered to appear before the committee one week from this thursday promptly at ten oclock in the morning senator ranee bane gaunt repeated to himself somehow after that name had been uttered he had ceased to listen to the remainder of mintons governmentese spiel bane was a democrat from texas who had his sights trained firmly on the white house where it seemed whether democrat or republican sat in the hot seat the mountain of debt incurred for decades wasnt getting any smaller ranee bane was an opportunist he had come out of the heartland of americas southwest from a state perhaps battered by economic woes but still fabled as the birthplace of americas movers and shakers from cowboys to texas rangers to gungho senators which was surely what ranee bane was the presidents fiercest foe purporting to be the staunchest ally of america and americans first foremost and only as he would say but in the end bane was a telegenic good old boy who understood modernday power politics and who knew how to best utilize its acolytes advertising and the media his state among others in the south and the rust belt had become staunchly protectionist losing jobs to the japanese was no fun and bane ever the canny psychologist had picked up on this economic fear and had fanned it into a bonfire of paranoia the most alarming thing was he wasnt alone banes uncommon brain trust drew from such divergent american loci as hollywood detroit and new york not surprisingly the men bane chose to present him to the public all melded into a synergistic whole gaunt was certain this was because they had one thing in common they lived and died in the marketplace they knew how to sell whether it be on the silver screen on the roads of america or on wall street and madison avenue and sell him they did until he became what he was today polities great shining hope for resurgence after years of declining interest and then outright animosity on the part of the american populace flash of a magnetic face seen almost daily on tv and in the papers curling reddish hair wide forehead quick eyes ready smile hearty handshake a rawboned rangy man not unlike a youngish lbj but without the blubbery lips a man associated not only with oil but with cattle as well the farmers and oilmen combined into a formidable specialinterest base that drew not only from a traditional democratic sector but poached on republican territory as well and a new brand of mccarthyism this time safeguarding the country against the infiltration of the japanese was raising its head this time in the guise of liberalism and a return to good oldfashioned american values what the hell is the strategic economic oversight committee anyway gaunt asked although he suspected he already knew the committee is the brainchild of senator bane minton said toadylike his blatantly righteous admiration for bane was nauseating it has been convened to review all companies whose business with the japanese consists of more than fifty per cent of their gross annual earnings or who have entered into partnerships of any kind with japaneseowned corporations why it was perhaps an unnecessary question except that gaunt wanted this paranoia spelled out for him from beginning to end certain information has come into senator banes possession that some of these transactions may involve transgressions of national security national security gaunt almost laughed in mintons face youve got to be kidding but he could see by the attorneys expression that neither he nor his newly anointed champion ranee bane were kidding what information at this time im not at liberty to say minton rose abruptly as if he were concerned that a prolonged stay here would expose him to some form of insidious contamination you have been served mr gaunt minton continued to fondle his phi beta kappa flaunt and taunt to the end the committee expects to see you at the appointed time what about nicholas linnear hes currently out of the country a formal request for his appearance has been duly filed with your tokyo office minton showed the yellowed teeth of a hound we got you well get him with a curt nod edward minton was gone taking with him the faintly rank smell an unappetizing confluence of egg mcmuffins and weekold socks but leaving behind a residue like rime the ramifications of inexorable power wallowing in the wake of this rather godlike visitation gaunt had not the slightest interest in laughing in anyones face rather he was experiencing the queasy sensation of being caught in the jaws of a gargantuan machine that had no other interest than to chew him up and spit him out or an even worse nightmare engulfing and devouring him so that months from now he might become the first of the american disappeared a direct translation from argentine spanish a new world fascist fad spreading like an unwitting virus northward along the continental drift seiko met nicholas at narita he saw her walking serenely through the chattering throngs which filled the airport terminal she smiled bowing as she came up she handed him a slim briefcase he had been standing at the air france first class checkin desk and he moved them away from the line i brought some documents for you to look at on the flight over she said included in there is a coded fax from vincent tinh saigon again nicholas thought tinh satos director in vietnam had big plans for the company there but he sometimes had a tendency to get ahead of himself and the physical resources allotted him it was he who had been urging nicholas to allocate more capital to their startup operations there thank you seikosan she recognized the sorrow in his eyes but true to her nature she made no overt comment on it instead she said did you remember your passport hai yes there is some time before your flight she said nicholas knew a cue when he heard one why dont we go into that shop and have some tea seiko nodded her head and they made their way across the crowded concourse to stand at a curving counter while green tea was served them in paper cups the smell of fish was very strong and looking down into his tea nicholas was reminded of justines disgust for the national drink which she said tasted of fish this trip seiko began in a halting fashion it is very important to you yes to honor your father in such a fashion is very japanese thank you usually serene even in a crisis seiko seemed filled with a curious energy seikosan what is it i had she paused to lick her lips i had a premonition it was do you remember i knew everything about vincent tinh that was partly a premonition as well we met him and he was everything i told you hed be and more given the cost figures beginning to come out of saigon her small hand clasped the paper cup so tightly the green tea slopped over the side i was right then and i this trip will be very dangerous i beg you to be careful she was speaking very quickly now the words tumbling one over the other as if she knew she must spill out her secret knowledge before she had a chance to bite it back i may never see you again i have this feeling that even if i do everything will be changed i will not be the same and certainly you will be different so different that no one will recognize you despite his western impulse to laugh at her melodramatic words nicholas felt an unpleasant chill race down his spine as he recalled his own sense of foreboding earlier when the call summoning him to mikio okamis side had come in even if what you say is true i must go there is an old debt which my father incurred that i must pay seiko took a quick gulp of her tea almost choked on it nicholas placed his hand on the center of her back massaging the spasmed muscles as she coughed she turned to stare at him her face reddened not only by the paroxysm but by something else it was not proper for him to be touching her in public even in such an innocent manner pardon me he said as he hastily took his hand away her head swung back to her contemplation of her tea nicholas became aware of the intense anxiety radiating from her seikosan what is it her hands were clasped tightly together on the countertop as if she were terrified she could no longer keep them under control i am an evil selfish woman seikosan let me finish please she took a breath ever since nangisan assigned me to work for you i have known that i have a special feeling toward you nicholass mind was now caught in a minefield that was part electrifying present part recent past in which he heard over and over again justines accusations she looked at him finally with a directness he could not dismiss i fell in love with you against my will i knew you were married knew that i could never have you but none of that mattered in affairs of the heart i am afraid logic and common sense have no place there was a silence between them now that the appalling truth was out seiko slumped over as if exhausted i never would have told you never never never but then this premonition if it were true that i would never see you again i knew i could not keep this secret inside me i am not strong enough you see she bit her lip i apologize though any apology i make is inadequate i am weak and selfindulgent my love should have remained my own private anguish she put her head down you see how kindness is repaid but i am helpless i love you nicholas nothing she had said before could have prepared him for the effect of her use of tfiis first name he felt as if he had abruptly walked off solid land into a patch of quicksand from which he could not recover my god he thought justine must have known must have seen this awful secret in seikos face no wonder she had confronted him part of him wanted to rush home to justines arms to tell her that he loved her that he would never leave her again but here he sat rooted to the spot in a neonlit tea shop in a crowded concourse of narita airport with a beautiful young woman who said she loved him and for the first time he acknowledged what he had unconsciously known from the moment he heard mikio okamis name invoked that he was on a collision course with a future from which he would not emerge unscathed you will be different so different that no one will recognize you she had told him and he shivered now because he began to suspect the truth of those words even while he had no idea what they could mean please dont say anything seiko murmured it doesnt matter if you dont love me as i love you what good would it do anyway you are married and in love with your wife i have been betrayed by my heart and now i do not expect you to keep me on as your assistant if you suppose ill send you away like a disobedient child youre wrong nicholas said he hardly knew how to respond to everything she said but he did know that he did not want to lose the best assistant who had ever worked for him whatever youre feeling toward me is irrelevant you are so quick to learn so good at everything ive given you to do that i expect youll outgrow your job within a year at that point well have to talk about a promotion and a raise he shook his head whether or not you can recognize it seiko youre on a fast track at sato international youre far too valuable to me to risk losing you now you work for me and thats the way its going to be period seiko gave a little bow i thank you again for your unending kindness linnearsan i cannot imagine what my life would be like without you she glanced at her watch slipped off her stool it is time for you to go through immigration control your plane will be boarding in five minutes she walked him as far as she could she looked quite composed even calm now that the emotional storm had passed do you have a contact number for me while you are in venice nicholas opened the thick buffcolored folder that had been waiting for him at the first class air france checkin counter im staying at a hotel called il palazzo di maschere veneziane he showed her both the phone and fax numbers printed on the hotels reservation confirmation slip seiko jotted them down in the tiny leather notebook that nicholas had given her as a present her first day on the job i think thats it then he said as they reached the end of the line waiting to go through immigration and security he watched her as she stood apart looking very beautiful and very alone she seemed so full of pain his heart went out to her he was about to say something but she put her forefinger to her lips no goodbyes seiko said we will see each other again on the far side of the barriers nicholas took the few minutes as his plane began boarding to call justine he let the phone ring nine times but there was no answer he wished now that he had his last hours with her to do all over again it was only now that the reality of the physical leaving swept over him he longed to talk with her at least to tell her how sorry he was but as he walked toward the departure gate he consoled himself by thinking apologies were better delivered in person there would be plenty of time for that when he returned tanzan nangi was dictating letters to umi his assistant when seiko walked in he broke off looked up at her for a moment silent then he said what is your news it is not good she said she opened a file handed over several typewritten sheets we have just received a formal request from the united states senate linnearsan is required to appear before the strategic economic oversight committee to answer questions regarding the merging of tomkin industries with sato international good lord this has the smell of an american witchhunt nangi said he scanned the documents ive read the stories on this senator bane the international news has been filled with him lately i saw him interviewed on cnn and there was a feature about him in last weeks edition of time he pointed did this request come in the mail no sir seiko said obviously uncomfortable it was delivered by someone from the american embassy they told me it arrived this morning via diplomatic pouch nangi carefully folded the sheets handed them back to seiko well if we dont know where nicholas is we cant very well serve him with these papers seiko draft a reply to the committee outlining the bare bones of the current situation you know the drill linnearsans urgent business somewhere in europe currently out of touch with the office et cetera yes sir but after she left he did not immediately go back to his dictating his mind was on senator bane and his committee he had been dreading something like this as banes status and prestige escalated exponentially someone was going to become the touchstone for the senators righteous anger and tomkinsato was a logical choice the fact was that nicholas was vulnerable he had been an outsider brought in to run the company by decree of his fatherinlaws will after tomkins untimely death nangi supposed that it might not be too difficult for bane to make a case for nicholas a neophyte in the ranks of corporate businessmen relying rather too heavily on the japanese side of the merger hell nangi thought he could make the same accusation and make it stick look where nicholas had chosen to live for the past eight years tokyo not new york now nangi was overcome with guilt he began to secondguess himself for talking nicholas out of returning to the states to lobby on the conglomerates behalf the fact was nangi had been selfish not only in the area of business where nicholass presence caused the most astonishing results both in research and restructuring but also because he was nangis best friend what have i done nangi asked himself as he sat silent in his office by keeping nicholas at my side i may have condemned him and us to oblivion two marco island venice tokyo marine on st croix lew croaker squinted through the glare of the tropical sun and uttered a hearty curse under his breath the coast guard cutter had just appeared through the heat haze heading straight for him he was aboard his sleek boat captain sumo which he hired out for exorbitant fees for the best sport fishing on floridas west coast a mile and a half out of marco island croaker was not currently chartered in fact he had left port not only to try and outrun recent memories but for some peace and quiet the last thing he needed he reflected sourly as he cut the engines and came about was another semiofficial visit from the cg croaker was an exdetective from the nypd he had retired down here with alix logan a former model who much to his surprise and delight had fallen in love with him now she was gone back to the glittery high life she missed more than she loved him she was in new york or was it paris he couldnt keep track any more and even though she called him regularly he had no illusions that her fidelity to him would last the lure of her previous life and all the perks that went with it was far too strong how had he ever thought that she would be content with him a wideshouldered man of fortyfive with the slightly pushedin weatherbeaten face of a cowboy he couldnt call himself handsome and though his hair was still dark and thick it wasnt styled and slicked back like that of her once and future model buddies you remind me of robert mitchum alix had told him early in their relationship so much character so much history in your face the evening she had left he sat behind the wheel of the vintage flamingoandwhite thunderbird he had completely and lovingly restored and watched her plane cleave the last of the long languorous sunset despair washed over him and his first thought was to call his friend nicholas linnear with whom he had shared so much danger but it was not croakers way to cry into his beer even with a close friend like nicholas brought up in the vicious hells kitchen area of manhattans west side croaker had seen his policeman father gunned down in an alley seen his mothers spirit broken he had learned how to be tough the hard way and for him there was no going back the coast guard cutter had throttled down and he threw his engines into neutral then cut them entirely he let go the electronic windlass and heard the anchor hit the water as he made preparations to be boarded he considered what streak of altruism had made him accept the cgs offer to help them from time to time in controlling the diug trade that was endemic to floridas seemingly endless miles of coastline perhaps he was not as truly quit with police work as he had convinced himself he would be when he had moved down here the cutter was now fully powered down bobbing in the swell croaker made fast the lines thrown up to him by the small boat launched from the cutter he peered down at the three men as they began to climb up the vertical ladder he had let down he had expected to see his friend lt mark mcdonald who had become his liaison with the cg instead he counted two young ensigns with service revolvers on their hips these seriouslooking sailors were flanking a man croaker had never seen before he was tall and as thin as a whippet with dark brows and ruddy cheeks as he came on board croaker was struck by the intensity of his clear blue eyes he had a distinctly boyish look even though croaker judged him to be somewhere in the vicinity of fifty he was carrying a briefcase made of what looked to be a kind of dull gray polycarbonate the two ensigns were very formal they saluted croaker then stood at military ease on their side of the ladder entry mr croaker the man said extending his hand good to meet you my names will lillehammer his eyes crinkled but his mouth refused to smile kind of you to let us board those blue eyes were like an xray machine measuring everything im on special assignment for the president of the united states he did not say with whom and croaker did not think it was the coast guard even though lillehammer was wearing a cg lieutenants uniform he had a faint but discernible british accent is there somewhere we can speak in private croaker looked around besides the cutter close to there was a fishing boat a brace of sailboats tacking into the wind and a sleek cigarette booming its way back to shore all were quite a distance away he spread his arms now lillehammer smiled and it wasnt a pleasant sight it brought into view a spiderweb of pale scars at the corners of his mouth youd be astounded at the advances in electronic surveillance since you left the force he said so hes been briefed on my history croaker thought as he led lillehammer into the cabin he broke out iced beers and they sat on a vinylcovered bench lillehammer lifted his bottle said cheers and took a grateful swallow then he drew the briefcase up onto the bench unlocked it and opened it inside croaker saw an array of what might have been the guts of a computer except there was no keyboard lillehammer inserted an oddlooking key turned it left then right croaker made a face getting a slight headache are you lillehammer said he extended a hand here swallow this croaker took the tiny white pill gulped it down with a swig of beer in a moment his head cleared what the hell was that he asked electronic surveillance has become so sophisticated so quickly weve been forced to bring into the field countermeasures not always one hundred per cent refined he indicated the workings of the briefcase this baby will do the job but its still a bit hard on the brain something to do with the pitch of the vibrations it sends out he looked down at it rather fondly seems ive gotten used to the bastard doesnt say much for my ears i suppose he finished his beer smacked his lips regards from lieutenant mcdonald by the way im certain hes sorry i pitched him out of his own wicket another beer only ever have one during the day lillehammer said thanks just the same just how british are you croaker said opening another bottle for himself lillehammer laughed very actually but where i come from ive gotten so used to american idioms i sometimes find myself worrying that the english pan of me has gotten snowed under out of the office im afraid i have an alarming tendency to become a flaming brit its what comes from being afflicted with an english mother and an american father and just where is your office i dont have one you dont lillehammer lifted a forefinger if you have an office eventually everyone knows what it is you do it took the cia decades to work that one out croaker saw those xray eyes fixed on his left hand he uncurled the titanium and polycarbonate fingers i imagine youre curious about this everyone is lillehammer nodded deferentially if you wouldnt mind ive long ago gotten over being sensitive about it he laid open the artificial hand which a team of biomechanics and surgeons in tokyo had grafted to what had been the stump of his left wrist it looked more than anything like a work of art four fingerlike appendages and an opposable thumb articulated where human joints or knuckles would be they had underpinnings of titanium and boron were sheathed in mattblack polycarbonate and were affixed to a stainlesssteel and blued titanium hand palm back and wrist i dont fully understand how it works croaker said but the main servos are somehow connected to my own nerves the hand is also powered by a pair of special lithium batteries lillehammer bent over examining the hand like an archeologist poring over an historic find he said do you mind telling me what happened croaker suspected that he already knew but said i was in a pitched battle with one very smart bastard he was a champion sumo and very strong he was also an expert in kendo do you know what that is japanese swordsmanship lillehammer nodded ive been lucky enough to examine a number of katana close up then you know just how sharp those swordblades can be in the best of them the very edge of the blade is so finely ground it virtually disappears the sumo severed my hand with one of those and how well does this work lillehammer said tapping one of the long articulated fingers croaker made a fist very slowly then released the fingers back again revealing the iridescent blue titanium palm this is the second model new and improved the prototype was amazing enough but this he rose went over to pick up one of the empty beer bottles he held it in his right hand pressed the tip of one articulated finger against the glass there was a strange sound like the tearing of thin fabric the razorsharp up traced its way down the bottle across the bottom up the opposite side a moment later the bottle fell open in two equal halves remarkable combination of strength and delicacy lillehammer observed croaker came back sat down he pointed to the briefcase lillehammer had brought aboard whats that made of dunno really some spaceage plastic tougher and lighter than steel but i can tell you its bloody well indestructible couldnt get a bullet to dent it in the lab couldnt blow a hole in it with plastique either croaker held up his hand for lillehammers inspection carefully retracted the long fingers until they were only the equivalent of one knuckle in length then he leaned over took one corner of the top of the case between his left thumb and attenuated forefinger in a pincer motion he pressed inward foamp his fingers clicked together through the small hole they had pierced in the material lillehammer sat staring at what croaker had done to his previously indestructible briefcase i think ill have that second beer now thank you very much he said softly lillehammer sat nursing his beer for the longest time croaker was aware of the sun moving across the cabins cowling the light changing as the wind shifted storm coming he thought scenting the phosphorus in the air but we still have time for what he waited patiently for lillehammer to tell him why he had come the chop had picked up and the boat was bobbing quite a bit on its tether croaker felt distinctly unwell and he got up abruptly went out of the cabin he bent over the rail on the opposite side of the boat where the young ensigns still stood watch and vomited over the side sorry about that lillehammer said when he returned im afraid those pills havent quite been perfected yet either do me a favor and next time keep that shit to yourself croaker said and rinsed his mouth out with beer id rather deal with the slight headache i quite understand my apologies de nada croaker said lillehammer put down his beer came close to him and said quietly does the name dominic goldoni mean anything to you sure mob boss sang his brains out so that the feds took out two of his leading rivals lock stock and barrel for that they didnt fry him they put him into witsec from which sanctuary so i have heard hes been running his entire east coast machine through his brotherinlaw the respected attorney anthony decamillo also known as tony d among his friends i also hear that goldonis remaining chief rival the clam man you mean caesare leonforte thats right bad clams they call him anyway i understand that the clam man is thinking of taking fate by the throat making the move hes been itching to make on goldonis territory lillehammer nodded commendable you have details not known to the general public however the connection between goldoni and anthony decamillo a wellrenowned legit lawyer cannot in any way be proved i know witsec has tried he squinted at croaker the effect of which was to further intensify the focus of his extraordinary eyes i see you have kept up your contacts some of them croaker said others i can no longer afford lillehammer made that awful smile again i fancy your humor mr croaker dry and distinct like a fine wine but not half as complex croaker said giving in to the mans nuttiness lillehammers smile broadened and now croaker could see the tiny crosshatch lines of the stitching on the pale scars it had been a hurried job perhaps in a red zone somewhere far away from the hightech civilization that had provided croaker with his remarkable prosthesis but the fact that the scars were on both sides of lillehammers mouth ruled out an accident or a wound taken in the pursuit of a clandestine enemy rather they seemed the deliberate hallmark of the torturer there was a sadism implicit in what the incisions had tried to do as well as explicit in the scars themselves i wouldnt talk so they tried to make my silence permanent lillehammer said as if reading croakers mind of course that wasnt true he had merely seen the direction of croakers scrutiny i suppose they could have slit my throat and been done with it but that was not their way i had frustrated them and they wanted me to live with what they would do to me they tried to sever the muscles that worked my lips as it happened they failed i count myself fortunate croaker was about to ask him who they were when he realized it really didnt matter and perhaps in his day he had encountered as many of them as had lillehammer it appeared as if he and this brit might have a great deal in common lillehammer fingered his upper lip pity i cant grow a mustache whatever they did to me killed the hair follicles here he shrugged well he rubbed his hands together briskly wed better get down to it the winds swung round and is picking up as it is well have a bumpy ride home he peered through one of the cabin windows where the brace of sailboats had turned and were running for the shelter of marco island no other boats seemed to be around back to dominic goldoni your intelligence is spot on as far as it goes fact is yesterday goldoni inexplicably and overtly broke his covenant with the federal government of the united states what did he do he got himself killed is what he did lillehammer said dominic goldoni dead croaker mused almost to himself seems impossible not only got himself killed lillehammer continued but did so in a manner that has got the best people at witsec totally freaked out can you tell me why well now that depends lillehammer said on whether you agree to work with me on this croaker thought a moment why the hell would you want me youre obviously a fed very high up in the bureaucratic organization youve got zillions of candidates to choose from who are younger trained in the latest techniques he swept his right hand toward the antisurveillance case i mean i had no idea that kind of hardware existed lillehammer shook his head dont give me the old warhorse routine it wont hold with me i found your name in our computers you worked with nicholas linnear some years ago when he was recruited by c gordon minck who was then head of red station our soviet affairs bureau you and linnear ferreted out a very nasty mole in mincks henhouse he frowned the truth is i cant trust anyone back home not until ive discovered how someone got to dominic goldoni a man supposedly tucked away from all harm frankly i need help lillehammer said goldoni had strict orders not to call anyone from his house where the line could be tapped at the other end and never to meet with someone without his witsec handlers knowledge so how did this happen witsecs record of protecting its inductees who obeyed the rules was until this incident absolute so somebody got to him some way lillehammer looked away for a long moment then his head came back and his piercing blue eyes fixed on croakers face the way i see it someone inside someone he trusted betrayed him im telling you his security was one hundred per cent as long as he didnt break the witsec rules croaker turned the problem around in his mind a while before he said its clear you need help but i doubt its from me im a maverick i never was much good at memorizing the rule book i go my own way lillehammer looked him square in the face just answer this question are you intrigued enough to be my field man or would you rather continue your quiet existence chauffeuring beerguzzling businessmen around this pond croaker laughed you do have a way with words mr lillehammer call me will croaker looked down at the extended right hand before taking it in his and squeezing it why do i feel like ishmael about to sign on the pequod lillehammer let out a heartfelt bellylaugh and this time his grotesque scars disappeared in the folds of his tanned face im going to enjoy our association lew may i call you lew it will be for the last time because our operation names have been set for all nonsecure communication which under the circumstances means everything ishmael meet ahab were going to make one crackerjack team but when the coast guard cutter had taken the mysterious ahab away croaker remained at sea waiting for the sun to go down and wondering what the hell he was doing getting involved with the feds again he had a weeks charter beginning tomorrow morning with maracay the venezuelan magnate whom croaker entertained three or four times a year maracay had made his enormous fortune from the land dragging iron and diamonds from it in profusion he was a gregarious man of immense appetites an excellent fisherman a big spender and a generous tipper not to mention the harem of eager young women he brought with him that he was more than willing to share croaker felt the sun on his back as he bent over the side of captain sumo he spotted some flotsam riding at the waterline and fetching a boathook pulled it away from the hull maybe the boat needed a good scraping right he told himself think about everything but alix maybe lillehammers offer had been the catalyst but he felt a sick hollow sensation inside him as keenly as if he had not eaten in days the truth was he missed alix and he resented her leaving him here marooned on a diet of seawater and booze while she jetted off to her glamorous former life in the glittering capitals of the western world what other choice had he had but now he could see her face burnished by the flamboyant florida sunset as they stood just outside the miami international airport terminal neither of them had wanted to say goodbye what exactly do you think you re doing here she had said softly you dont even like this life any more he had vehemently denied it but she was right of course thinking now about maracay and his floating whorehouse croaker understood what she had been trying to tell him he had come here because he had seen one too many corpses had ventured down one too many mean streets he had smelled the stink of corruption power inhumanity all around him and he had been sick unto death so he had dropped out migrated south only to find another kind of death he loved alix but what could he do marry her and take her away from the life she loved or marry her and endure the long separations her work would demand of them neither was a tolerable solution so he had let her go and had remained here among the sea grape and the decaying palms he turned the boathook watched the flotsam disentangle itself purl away a dark stain upon the sunlit water if i stay here a day longer he thought feel as useless as that piece of flotsam he put the boathook away climbed into the cabin and pulled up anchor then he throttled up and turning about headed back to marco island his blood had begun to sing it felt good to have a purpose again to be caught up in mystery and intrigue to have a murder to solve to hell with babysitting the rich and spoiled he thought time to get back into life beneath the bloated red sun of a late autumn afternoon venice lay domed and crowned in a shimmering pool of green and gold nicholas had never been to venice before and he was unsure what to expect it was a rotting city sinking like atlantis into the lagoons that surrounded it like the sheltering arms of the ancient earth mother the putrefaction of centuries clung to the stuccoed walls of its palazzi perfumed the air and within the dense dank maze of the city one lost all sense of direction these dark and disturbing reflections nicholas had heard from people who had come seen and departed unmoved and vowing in the unrelenting crowds and the stifling heat of summer never to return how unfortunate these people were this was his first thought instinctive and unbidden as he rode a spotless motoscafo across the lagoon toward a city that seemed to rest not on bedrock and silt but on nothing less ephemeral than dreams he rode up top with the captain and he was obliged to draw closed his padded whiskeycolored suede jacket against the stiff chilly breeze as the launch plied its way at high speed across the gunmetal water the city appeared to create itself out of seawater and cloud rising from a low nacreous mist which swam in amorphous schools across the water above the vast bowl of the sky a breathtaking blue so lucid it seemed infinite reflected at its lowest reaches the splendid golden domes and umber towers that seemed to have been magically preserved from the time of the arabian nights the vibration of the motoscafos powerful engine changed deepening to a liquid gurgle as the craft hit the outer limits of the inner lagoon and taking a long sweeping curve along the high wooden poles that served as channel markers as they had for centuries commenced a slow almost ritualistic final approach through the belly of the city into the grand canal now they swung round the point of the san georgio maggiore and dead ahead he was greeted by the sight of the basilica santa maria della salute pale and magnificent over which the oblate sun ruddy as dried blood was slowly settling like a great winged steed whose day of racing was done nicholas felt the small hairs at the back of his neck stir and he was electrified by an image of himself striding across a cobblestone piazzetta he was dressed in high black leather boots long black cloak and a kind of mask which covered his face from his nose to his hairline on his head he wore a stiff felt tricornered hat far above him flags he could not recognize cracked and fluttered and he knew without understanding that it was a time of war he had the distinct sensation that he was coming home he blinked as if having been blinded by the huge autumn sun the motoscafo had turned again and he was now face to face with the piazzetta di san marco with the doges palace on the right to his left rose the statues of the magisterial venetian winged lion and of saint theodore the patron saint of venice his sensation of deja vu was so strong that for a moment he staggered and he grabbed the cowling of the mahogany and brass hatch cover in order to keep himself from stumbling down the companlonway this was the piazzetta in his vision and though he knew that it had been of a time long gone still the unmistakable scent of war was in the air il palazzo di maschere veneziane was approximately midway between the punta della dogana where the basilica santa maria della salute rose in burnished splendor and the campo della carita where sat the galleria dellaccademia at the far end of the fairytale confection of its wooden bridge once the hotel had been an ornate summer palazzo for the ruling doge its spot overlooking the grand canal was impeccable on the rio di san maurizio a canale itself of course but as nicholas was to learn in venice only the grand canal bore that designation also the grand structures commonly called palazzi were in fact case during the age of the serene republic only the ducal residence could technically be called a palazzo the hotel had its own private dock and its greenandgolduniformed porters were on hand to greet him take his bags and lead him past the tables of the hotels openair restaurant being set for dinner inside the public rooms were sumptuously decorated in the florid style of old venice with arching beamed ceilings sconced walls covered with opulent moire silks and lush color everywhere the wholly venetian shades of blue green yellow and burnt orange and always rococo gilt edging on furniture picture frames massive clocks murano candelabra and chandeliers weeping pearshaped tears of blown glass nicholas was checked in with great formality almost as if he were an old guest returning for a special occasion an enormous mask hung above the burnished burlwood counter it was painted a glossy white with a protruding nose and a wide aggressive upper lip nicholas curious asked the concierge the nature of the mask ah signore venice is a city of masks or at least it once was in centuries past the name of this hotel ii palazzo di maschere veneziane means the palace of the venetian mask the particular doge who built this palazzo and summered here was a rather mischievous fellow prone to donning his bauta to go among the common folk and perpetrate well all manner of er indelicate activity the concierge stroked his upper lip in this disguise i believe the doge fathered any number of illegitimate children and consummated many a nefarious political arrangement he pointed upward to the oversized mask this is the bauta the mask known as the great leveler because it was used by many a powerful doge judge or prince to conceal his identity as the common man he roamed the calli and rii of the city in perfect secrecy and no one ever knew who he really was no one signore the concierge assured him venezia keeps its secrets nicholass secondfloor room was huge the porter put down his bags and crossing the persian carpet flung open the twelvefoot wooden shutters to let in the sounds smells and most significant of all the light from the grand canal bathed in the aqueous illumination of this city marooned for all time in the geographical twilight between the shore and the sea the ornately furnished room appeared just as it might have three hundred years ago when the doges ruled and the songs of the east perfumed their campi and gardens with enchantment left alone nicholas went into the marbled bathroom to shower away the dry grit of travel he shaved before a gilt mirror watching the subtle transformation of his face as the stubble came off and he was reminded again of seikos words you will be different so different that no one will retognize you he splashed cold water on his face and with a towel in his hands returned to the room he stood at the open window watching night stretch its long fingers across the grand canal to his left the santa maria della salute was powderwhite in the tungsten lights and below and to his right across the water further down four gondolas painted blue green black and red bobbed at a deserted imbarcadero their high arching prows sixpronged to represent the citys sestieri its districts seemed to nicholas in that velvet light to be musical instruments that gave off melody and harmonies as beautiful as they were ancient wiping his face dry he turned away from the scene to find a large cardboard box on the kingsized bed he went to it certain that it hadnt been there when the porter had shown him in he called down to the front desk was assured that no package for him had been delivered to the hotel he opened the box and peering into it stood as still as a statue he felt again the small hairs stirring at the base of his neck and a thin line of sweat snaked its way along his spine reaching into the box he drew out the long black cloak of his vision beneath it was a mask handmade of papiermache like the bauta over the concierges desk downstairs it was painted a glossy white had a prominent nose and even more aggressive upper lip line which defined its lower edge so that there was something vaguely apelike about its overall appearance it was the mask that secured the identity of the highborn at the bottom of the box was a seagreen envelope bordered in gilt he opened this slid out a single sheet of stiff paper on it was beautifully written one sentence in large backsloping script your presence is requested cloaked antd masked at thirty minutes past ten oclock pm at campiello di san belisario nicholas looked at his watch it was fifteen minutes to seven not yet time for dinner he dropped his bizarre costume dressed and opened up the briefcase seiko had handed him at the airport he had deliberately ignored it during his flight he had not been in any mood then to look at work he settled himself into an overstuffed chair and with the hydrous light from outside mixing with the rooms lamplight began to read the latest coded report from vinnie tinh tinh had been born and raised in vietnam though he had emigrated to australia for his college and postgraduate years he was an expert in international business law and had even spent a year in the trading pits of wall street researching his thesis nicholas had spent a good deal of time with tinh both in tokyo and saigon and had found him to be bright and clever two assets not often found in the same person there was also a devious streak to him though nicholas had come to understand that this somewhat dubious talent was necessary in order to be successful in southeast asia he was nevertheless convinced that tinh bore watching in fact this was one of his reasons for scheduling the now postponed trip to saigon nicholas skimmed over the summary of sato internationals projected grosses and nets for the coming quarter the rising success rate of the ongoing training program for potential employees and the continuing problems in getting enough petroleum products at a reasonable cost the japanese were buying almost ninety per cent of vietnams crude oil so it seemed ludicrous that it should be so difficult to obtain petroleum products within the country he scrutinized tinhs assessment of the political regime and the current business climate most importantly he read tinhs updates on his political and business contacts among the wealth of fascinating information one bit of unfocused data stood out according to tinh there was a spate of recent rumors none of which he could confirm of the establishment of a kind of shadow government wholly independent from the vietnamese government what this shadow network meant or what it proposed to do tinh could not say only that it was said that its power and influence was growing every day tinh proposed finding out more about it before any of their competition could possibly exploit it he made a mental note to fax tinh not to waste his time it was preposterous he thought saigon was filled to overflowing with rumors of this sort anyway who would support such a regime how could it come into being and how could it possibly be maintained if it was becoming more and more powerful who was funding it these were questions that would have troubled nicholas had he believed in tinhs smoke if vietnam were to abruptly destabilize again the hundreds of millions of dollars that sato international had invested in the country would be in dire jeopardy in any event it appeared as if tinh had been out on the edge of the jungle too long and was in urgent need of direction from civilization making notes in the margins of the report nicholas resolved to get to saigon as soon as he was able by the time he went down to the hotel restaurant for dinner he was hungry he sat inside the deep blue room staring out the windows at the vaporetti putputting past their running lights winking and darting like fantastic fireflies gondolas glided by carrying japanese and german tourists festooned with cameras and colored souvenirs from murano he dined on spaghetti con vongole a magnificent pasta dish with tiny delicate clams whose briny essence exploded in his mouth like caviar and seppia in teca squid steamed in its own ink he let the captain suggest the wine a prosecca but was loath to drink more than a glass and a half he declined the dessert tray settling for a double espresso instead by the time he signed the check it was almost ten and remembering the address on the note he asked the concierge for directions to his rendezvous he was given a small folding map of the city on which the concierge circled with a pen the location of the hotel and traced several alternative routes to the campiello di san belisario the best way is of course to walk the concierge said in the best venetian tradition it is not the quickest way but certainly the most beautiful have you the time fora twentyminute stroll nicholas said he thought he did an answer that pleased the concierge bene each hour of the day or night brings its own particular eminence to la serenissima signore he said with a wide smile upstairs in his room nicholas tried calling justine again but there was no answer where could she be it was two in the morning in tokyo he cradled the receiver pulled on a thick sweater then feeling vaguely foolish wrapped the long dark cloak across his shoulders the mask he took up in his hands and tucking it beneath one arm went out the door the unique intonation of the city swept over him a kind of language composed of small sounds really a peculiar combination of noise and echoes thrown back by the narrow streets and the houses built up against the rii the sounds of footsteps for instance took on otherworldly tones the vigorous slapslap of leather striking stone and paving hovered in the cool night air like ghosts he would pass a latenight bar and hear a quick burst of laughter a snatch of conversation that would follow him down an alley or across one of the innumerable tiny bridges and always there arose like a dream the faint susurrus of the water lapping against the wooden pilings of a traghetto where invariably a gondola was moored or against the mosscovered stone foundations of the houses themselves once he turned a corner and came upon a no filled with gondolas an old man in a black suit who stood at the rear of one of the fleet had commenced a song his pure tenor voice ringing off the stones facades as his gondola passed beneath the bridge where nicholas stood entranced he passed a small palazzo within which was a postagestampsized corte where bougainvillea bloomed in long opulent crescents and a fig tree rose gnarled and twisted the last of its lush foliage bronzed by the street and no lights he could see a wroughtiron bench patinaed with age and could imagine casanova on one knee seducing the young woman who sat upon it staring up at the night sky nicholas trained to sink in to feel the crosscurrents of places and of people was beginning to find his way toward the metaphysical enigma of venice as he made his way to his rendezvous with mikio okami this then was the secret of venice its unique locus in the world situated neither on land nor on the sea had imbued it not only with otherworldly sounds and light but with the ability to immunize itself against the ravages of time no cars buses trains or subways had insinuated themselves into this magical place people traveled within its breast now as they had done for centuries buildings were restored in the traditional venetian style using the same techniques craftsmen had employed for centuries nicholas walked down calli callesse over ponti of stone black metal and wood along fondamenta that fronted rii that had remained constant for hundreds of years if he had been alive in the s his views would have been fundamentally the same and as he walked venice took him up in its arms enfolded him lovingly bound him to it as it had done to so many travelers in their time he lost himself not so much in its maze of streets rii bridges and quays but in its sorcerous heart feeling time slip away like an old withered skin experiencing the bracing and ultimately exhilarating gift that the city brings to those willing to accept it a renewal to the boneweary a reaffirmation of life to the sick at heart and so his frustration and anxiety over his relationship with justine dissipated he saw his displaced anger at her for losing two of their children for what it was he forgot about his last vertiginous encounter with seiko miraculously he even found himself calmer about his imminent meeting with mikio okami this enchanted mood stayed with him as he entered the campiello di san belisario it was a small square cobbled and clean but with no adornments whatsoever no trees fountains benches or the like just as in most venetian campiellos the earthcolored buildings stood on three sides and on the fourth rose the imposing white facade of a church this one nicholas saw as he approached it bore the same name as that of the small square he had never heard of saint belisario but it seemed the italians and especially the venetians venerated a plethora of otherwise unknown holy men and women the campiello was deserted he strained his ears and heard the echoes of footfalls fading pigeons rattled briefly in the eaves of a building settling themselves for the night and far away he heard the drone of a motoscafo plying the water of some unseen but not unheard rio mist crept along the cobbles hanging at the foundations of buildings like a mendicant nicholas waited the venetian night unlike all others settling upon him like a second cloak all at once he remembered the bauta and taking it from beneath his arm where he had rather selfconsciously kept it during his walk he slipped it over his head so that it settled upon his face the sensation was at once singular and oddly familiar and he recalled his vision as he had passed the piazzetta di san marco earlier that evening again he was aware of an acute sense of deja vu who was i he wondered to have catted this home bauta he swung round to see a figure in priestly attire holding open a small door to one side of the chiesa san belisarios main bronzedoored entrance bauta the priest called in an odd throaty voice you are late for mass he gestured urgently come come nicholas mounted the worn stone stairs past the cloaked and hooded priest into the dank interior of the church he heard the sharp clang of the door as the priest shut it behind him the atmosphere of the interior was infused with a plethora of scents incense candle wax mildew stone and marble dust and age the priest scurried past nicholas this way he said under his breath follow me the church was dimly lit only flickering flames from a profusion of thick paleyellow candles intermittently illuminated vaulted ceilings frescoed walls magnificent tiled floors in the intricate byzantine style goldencrusted religious icons the interior was a treasure trove of historical relics and religious art a ceiling of blackened wooden beams gave way to an elegant high ogival arcade encrusted with mosaic scenes from the bible but there was an almost eastern undertone too which permeated the dense atmosphere with the pungency of star anise somewhere nicholas heard the murmur of voices the call and response of the solemn liturgical rite improbable as it seemed mass was being performed this late at night this is a very old church the priest whispered as they hurried down stone passageways the odd parchmentdry voice carried no intimation of age or even of gender it was rather a voice wholly of intent stripped of any ornamentation or color some say it is the oldest religious structure in venice certainly there is evidence in the foundation and elsewhere that it was once a greek temple the voices of the mass were fading only echoes of echoes now but before the greeks who knows the scythians yes and perhaps the cycladeans giants who roamed the earth at the time of the phoenicians and before them gods now long forgotten by even the oldest living venetians nicholas was surprised this did not sound like the philosophy dispensed by any priest he had ever encountered or read about he was about to ask the man about his peculiar theories when they stopped at the arched entrance to a small but impressive space the schola cantorum the priest whispered as if this explained everything a moment later he had scurried away into the bending and twisting shadows dancing at the edge of the candlelight that uncertain illumination made elemental cave paintings along the curving stone walls nicholas walked into the room which was all of stone he went over ran his hands over the roughhewn surface he was certain that this stone predated that of the exterior of the church or even of that part of the interior lavished with the labors of byzantine craftsmen could this be part of the original greek temple the age of this spot he looked upward saw that the ceiling was groined in a pair of unusual arches set at right angles to one another this is where the sacred choir sang a melodious voice said so many centuries ago nicholas turned to see a tall woman in a black mask that shone like a dark sun she was dressed in the cloak of a priest or perhaps a monk in any case an ecclesiastical habit that hid her clothing as well as her body the schola cantorum she said this room was constructed to maximize the beauty of the human voice it was in those days long ago the center of the nave the very heart of the church and now it is relegated to the back nicholas said tucked far away from the everyday liturgies of the modern church but no less awesome for that she said then a smile broke over her generous mouth her deepset eyes flashed and it seemed as if the entire interior ancient and esoteric was held in their depths forgive me my name is celeste and you know mine nicholas said that is if you can be certain of who i am behind the bauta celeste laughed the sound picked up by the extraordinary acoustics of the ceiling thrown back at them in segments like a gregorian chant yes i know who you are where is but he stopped at celestes signal a long delicate forefinger pressed against her lips please do not mention his name even here in the sanctity of the schola cantomm she came toward him the rustling of her ecclesiastical cloak amplified until it sounded like the murmur of a field of insects on a hot summers night as she crossed a patch of candlelight he saw that she wore a silk turban on her head it was the color of the venetian sky in the moment after sunset and was draped with crescents of white and black pearls pale green stones hung from its perimeter and an intricately worked gold medallion was affixed to the front from which a long black ostrich feather rose so you know of the mask i chose for you to wear the bauta yes a little i am wearing the domino she said softly actually the name is taken from the latin benedicamus domino bless the lord a priestly banality you were the priest who led me here nicholas said with sudden insight i was celeste said i needed to be certain that you were not followed here who would follow me celeste did not answer him directly instead she said do you know what tonight is the end of october the beginning of november with the time change i can no longer remember if we have moved from one to the other it is all hallows eve celeste whispered the one night other than during carnival when masks once again become the norm it was important we meet this night the masks protect us as they once did our ancestors yours perhaps nicholas said i dont think any of mine came from venice celestes lips produced a peculiar smile welcome to serenissima she said in her husky whisper the serene republic where have i seen that smile before nicholas asked himself isnt it time we were leaving he said my summons here seemed quite urgent it was celeste said and the reasons for the urgency are ever more apparent but even so caution has dictated our itinerary for the evening she slid her arm through his and he caught a whiff of a scent both musky and spicy wholly unfamiliar to him trust you wont find my company entirely disagreeable she took him out of the church through a back entrance that let them out beneath the arch of a stone bridge it was very dark the somber water lapping gently against stone green and crusty with algae and barnacles only the reflection of lights came to them where nicholas stood in a semicrouch while celeste locked the ancient wood and iron door behind them this is a wondrous spot celeste said turning to him in the year the byzantine emperor justinian sent his armies across the sea to italy to retake what had once been part of his empire before theodoric wrested it from byzantiums control at the head of this host was the brilliant general belisarius nicholas could just make out the ghost of a smile curling her lips it seems ironic now that this ancient church should be dedicated to someone named saint belisario surely youre not saying that the two are the same nicholas said its impossible that a byzantine army general could become a christian saint this is venezia celeste told him if you read its history you know that here nothing is impossible she took his hand led him out from beneath the bridge on a small private traghetto a deep green and gold gondola awaited them like a steed celeste bade nicholas climb in and when he was settled came aboard she cast off then took up the long pole began to steer them out into the rio hooded and cloaked she seemed an illustration out of some historical account of venice venice was created as a kind of shangrila a haven from the waves of barbarians goths huns and the like who periodically ravaged italy celeste said however as homer reminds us venice was not founded by those folk indigenous to western europe but rather by the peoples of the far eastern mediterranean whether these were the remnants of those who fell at the sack of troy as homer apparently believed or whether they were of an even more ancient seagoing people the phoenicians the fact remains that venice was established because of its natural defenses of malarial salt marshes quicksand banks and treacherous shoals whose contours were constantly recreated by the tides her voice drifted over the rio like the wispy fog that lay in strands across the water nicholas absorbed this fascinating history as he took in the passage of houses with ornate wroughtiron balconies tiny romantic gardens with surprising bursts of color and deep curving oriental arches and windows that forever spoke of the manner in which the citys ancestors had chosen to remember their own origins whatever the case celeste went on the founders of serenissima were intellectuals on the run from war rape pestilence from annihilation itself and here they plied their chimerical arts and their labyrinthine forms of intrigue here the golden politics practiced by the greeks became collusive then quickly gave way to bitter internecine vendettas which is where the masks came in nicholas said yes celeste poled them into a traghetto waited patiently while a latenight motoscafo purred its way past them the masks were pure illusion for purpose what purposes well in politics they were used by those who came before the state inquisitors to confess confidences in the personal lives of those ancient venetians they allowed anyone and everyone from highborn prince to lowly fishmonger the freedom to pursue their amorous hearts desire celeste leaned on her pole these are historical perspectives but what was the reality considering human nature the masks fostered corruption at every level of venetian society the launch had disappeared into the lowlying mist and she pushed them away from the tiny landing these masks the bauta the domino the gagna the primo zanni the plague doctor are not figures from the commedia dellarte as is often thought they are characters of a wholly venetian construct and they all have their origins in political paradigm rather than in the commedias theatrical stereotypes they passed a gondola with purple velvet seats and goldpainted handrails a man wrapped in a mohair blanket slept with his head in the lap of his daughter a darkhaired girl of no more than ten who smiled at them as her hand stroked the crown of his head when they were alone again on the rio celeste continued the masks became the symbol of all things venetian the profound mysteries hidden behind the fabulous fairytale facades clustered in profusion throughout the city think of venice as a magnificent shellfish that contains within its shell a prize of inestimable worth have you lived here all your life sometimes it seems so celeste said somewhat enigmatically in any event i was born here which is all that matters they had turned onto the grand canal and ahead of them on the right nicholas could see the imposing structure of the accademia celeste steered the gondola to the right gliding silently over the glittering water there were only the tiniest sounds lappings and creakings and even the soft puffs of her breath as she rhythmically worked the pole into the thick muck of the rio bottom out of all of this arose a kind of melody ethereal and enthralling played on an instrument of the imagination at length they glided into a rather ornate traghetto where two other gondolas were tied up nicholas felt a start of recognition go through him these were the gondolas he had seen from his hotel window tonight he had made a longcircuit to end up almost back where he had started from the gondola bumped gently against the ancient wooden poles these were striped gold and green nicholas jumped out of the gondola caught the ropes as celeste threw them tied up the slender boat the palazzo they entered was painted in the venetian style seagreen and an earthy ocheryellow oriental filigree edged the doublecurved arches toward which they strode past the forbidding seagates nicholas found himself in a courtyard garden much as the one he had glimpsed on his walk to the campiello bougainvillea and climbing roses perfumed the air even this late in the year and a massive pear tree overhung the stucco walls in almost every direction inside nicholas saw a gleaming teak and stainlesssteel motoscafo set on a low scaffold of raw twobyfours typical of such palazzi the floor was a worn and cracked checkerboard of red cattraran marble and white istrian stone used because water intensified their colors they went up a wide set of stone stairs onto what europeans called the first floor the piano nobile the downstairs was deliberately unreconstructed celeste explained because high tides often caused flooding and the nolevel floors were useful now only as garages for private motor launches upstairs the rooms were sumptuous sensual the ceilings were composed of indonesian teak stained dark by centuries of smoke the walls were painted the original venetian ultramarine highly costly because the pigment was composed of ground lapis lazuli or inlaid with byzantine mosaics of dusty colors and swirling patterns the floors were covered with worn persian carpets of fine wool and silk and statuary of carved porphyry and veined oriental marble plundered perhaps from ancient constantinople were placed in prominent positions oversized pillows in jeweltoned raw silk were strewn in areas where normally chairs and sofas would have been placed at the far end of the livingroom was a short flight of marble steps up to a sitting area filled with more sumptuous pillows against a wall filled with doublearched windows overlooking the rio fairy lights winked and bobbed through the glass entering the room along with the amorphous reflections from the sheened water everything down to the silver matchbox on the marble table the flowers in the gemlike murano glass bowls seemed to have its precise place and relation to everything else as if the person who inhabited this domain had a highly developed mathematical mind as they entered nicholas made out a dim figure sitting on the window ledge up in the sitting area mikio okami celeste whispered before she slipped from his side disappearing behind an incised teak door celeste wait so you have come nicholas turned at the sound of the voice for all his age mikio okami still had the power of command taking off his mask nicholas crossed the room went up the marble stairs before him stood mikio okami colonel denis linnears old and valued friend and compatriot or had he merely been such out of expediency in the aftermath of the war the occupation created its own turbulence those had been extraordinary times and now and again extraordinary measures were required to deal with them nicholas found himself staring into the face of one of those extraordinary measures you look so much like your father okami a bald bulletheaded man had the round jovial face of a benevolent dictator he had eyes too close together a rather severe nose and a mouth always on the verge of a smile his ears were tiny close to his head and there was a dark mole on one side of his chin he was of medium height but seemed somehow shrunken within the savile row suit he wore he was old yes but in the way of the oriental his skin had yellowed like the patina on parchment and seemed to have grown thin so translucent that the blue veins in his temples showed clearly in a strange way it is like meeting him again he extended a hand in a western greeting and nicholas shook it it is good of you to come linnearsan he said in japanese i imagine my summons came as something of a shock to you i trust it has not proved overly intrusive not at all nicholas said i was in need of a vacation in any case okamis lips held that strange demismile he ducked his head once his only passing reference to traditional japanese custom and have you enjoyed cloaking yourself as the magistrates and princelings of old venezia used to do i had no trouble imagining myself as casanova okami gave him a cool appraising look then said abruptly may i offer you a drink to warm you sambucca napoleon brandy or perhaps an espresso an espresso would be perfect excellent i believe ill join you okami went to a sideboard where bottles of liquors and aperitifs surrounded a gleaming stainlesssteel espresso machine he seemed to take great pleasure in making the coffee himself his small bony hands worked deftly at their tasks and though he must have been over eighty nicholas could detect no unsteadiness in those fingers okami brought over two tiny cups complete with a small twist of lemon rind floating in the dark depths they sat on the cushions while diamondshaped sprays of reflected light from the canal played over their faces i do so enjoy my espresso okami said after he had taken a first sip then abruptly he laughed i suppose you were expecting green tea and tatami mats as a matter of fact i make it a habit never to expect anything nicholas said it makes for clear thought and pure reaction instinct eh okami nodded it may be that everything ive heard about you is true nicholas said nothing sat crosslegged sipping the excellent italian coffee that this yakuza had learned to make from outside came the chug of a delivery boat perhaps even putting in perishables for the larder of his own hotels kitchens somewhere close across the rio i imagine youre wondering what i am doing in venice nicholas studied the old but still powerful face its an odd story certainly okami finished his espresso put the cup aside first you must understand something of the changing nature of the world i have inhabited for all of my life for many years the yakuza were interested only in what went on within the borders of japan i was one of the first to understand the myopic aspect of this policy he cocked his head to one side the simple fact is in matters of business were not so different from anyone else there came a time when it became increasingly difficult to make money in japan he lifted a hand let it fall to his thigh well thats not strictly speaking true what i mean is that there came a time when it became difficult for us to make enough money in japan that was when i called a meeting of the oyabun and said to them a phrase which your father had taught me and i in turn taught to them it was simply this the world is our oyster okami sat back clapping his hands over his small round belly of course they did not understand me not immediately anyway i had to provide a demonstration and for that i had to leave the country since that time perhaps twenty years ago i have been back only rarely too much here overseas required my direct attention to make certain everything was done correctly the first time he nodded his head again while its true that we have a kind of and here he used a japanese word that had no literal translation but might best be described as the phrase tacit understanding with the police the politicians and the bureaucracy the other kobun of japan it is never as cordial as we would like it to be the truth is these modernday samurai cannot forget our humble beginnings since the yakuza traditionally came from the lower classes these highbred ministers can do nothing but look down upon us they may fear us yes they may even now and again do our bidding because we in turn make ourselves of use to them but in their hearts i have no doubt that they despise us and if the opportunity arose where they could be fully protected they would do everything in their power to see us annihilated that demismile again so i set up my base here in venice nicholas recalled celestes brief but vivid history lesson on the origins of venice and saw now that this was no idle chatter on her part it was the historically correct thing to do okami went on and from a business point of view this city has its unique uses not that much has changed since the time of the medicis although we are nominally in italy venice is still its own citystate and it is wise to remember that when you are here you are in venice not italy or for that matter europe he shifted restlessly on the pillows but now i am beginning to wonder whether i havent made a political blunder something has happened nicholas said yes okamis eyes went abruptly opaque and he rose with their empty cups in his hands to pour more espresso he did not return immediately but rather stood contemplatively by the sideboard staring out at the lights of venice all at once as if making a difficult and agonizing decision he came back handing nicholas his cup he stood looking down at nicholas the simple fact is that within the next two weeks someone will try to murder me a mournful horn hooted and a brief shout sounded as a boat pulled into a nearby traghetto okami broke his brief stasis went quickly to the window looked out the expression on his face betrayed his nervousness someone wants me to retire but i have no intention of doing that okamisan nicholas said you must be able to mobilize every man in your clan to protect you okami turned away from the window and looked at nicholas with some surprise as if he had just appeared out of thin air oh more than that he said absently far more than just one clans worth but this man who is coming he came back to where nicholas was sitting squatting very close to him even his beloved espresso was ignored now nicholas recognized the strain of anxiety on his face this is not the real issue for me he said one of my oyabun has turned against me knowing this i can afford to trust no one i trust celeste of course and telling you all this putting myself in your hands i am trusting you but no one else for the first time he had raised his voice no one he repeated more softly i am calling upon you upon the debt your father owed me okami said t need your skills and your arts to protect me sothat i may finish what i have started and to discover the traitor among my most trusted oyabun nicholas sat very still absorbing what mikio okami was telling him it washed over him like a tide chilling him at last when he had regained control of his breathing he said you have made reference twice to your oyabun yes okami raised his eyebrows didnt you know this is how the debt came into being i am what your father helped me become and from my position of power i accomplished many many difficult things for him the demismile you see linnearsan here is the truth behind the myth i am kaisho oyabun of all yakuza oyabun justine sat in a room at the tokyo hilton the most american of the major megahotels in the city with the heavy curtains closed against the blaze of the tokyo night she could be anywhere in the states new york or chicago even if she were to imagine it londons hyde park or the serengetis veldt could be just outside her doubleglazed windows she sat hunched over her clasped hands tight between her knees staring at the walltowall carpet she seemed incapable of movement of even thinking in any coherent manner her mind was a sea of emotion a cauldron too long on a burner that was now overflowing inundating her like the sorcerers apprentice in massive overload she felt gripped by a kind of desperation such as she had not felt inmany years in fact after she had met nicholas she had felt certain that she would never feel this way again then he had been her savior her protector from the kind of debilitating desperation that had threatened to disintegrate her now much to her horror nicholas himself seemed to be the cause of this feeling she felt as if she were imprisoned marooned on the shore of an alien land with no hope of reprieve nicholas had done this to her with his inexplicable love of japan and its arcane concepts of giri and honor and its meaningless rituals that served only to distance people even family members from each other this last thought perhaps more than any other had begun to haunt her from the moment she had become pregnant for the first time she had visions nightmares really of nicholas wanting their child sent off to a zen buddhist monastery or a martial arts dojo there to be immersed in the alien precepts of eastern religion and philosophy away from her this thought perhaps farfetched and even a bit paranoid haunted her with a tenacity that was inescapable its horror wore away her resolve to be a mother eroded her selfesteem poisoned the one thing in all the world she had believed to be unassailable her love for nicholas she became in the end frightened of him as strong and invincible as he had once been as her protector now he had become by some alchemical process unknown to her a being possessed of a monstrous power his tanjian origins terrified her and the deeper he delved into the dark mysteries of tautau the less tangible his humanity seemed to her and now that she had dared touch her anger and her fear had seen it dragged into the light she recognized that from the moment her daughter had died she had become a different person she was forever restless in sleep as well as during the day as if she were fated to continue searching for that one special connection her daughter in her brief life had brought to her she knew she might never find it again true but she was utterly certain that she had no hope of finding it here in japan with nicholas she sobbed now alone in her anonymous hotel room which for all its american blandness was calming after the interior of her own house which seemed to resonate with a black magic that threatened to suffocate all who were not initiated into its secrets when was it that she had realized she had nowhere to go had it been when nicholas had left despite her entreaties or when they had had sex that last time and she had felt inexplicably abased or had it been far earlier when she had lost the second baby and secretly had thanked god how she had suffered for that thought am wicked and selfish part of her admonished even while another part felt a profound relief how to describe the panic that had overwhelmed her when she had gotten pregnant for the second time just the thought of bringing another life into the world of having once again that special connection and then having nicholas intervene with his tautau and his martial obsessions made her stomach cramp with dread am dying inside she mourned soon there will be nothing left to salvage she had hit the breaking point minutes after nicholass car had pulled out of the driveway and with a kind of violence that precluded thought she had packed a weekend suitcase and had driven into the city that had been an ordeal in itself driving on the wrong side of the road in a rightwheel car something she had never been able to get used to on roads without signs in english she had to rely entirely on memory which in her heightened emotional state had been somewhat less than trustworthy she had made it at last into the labyrinth of tokyo and by instinct alone had headed directly for the hilton it was where her american friends stayed during their infrequent visits her house being too far out of the city to be convenient she had been sitting in the same position for hours changing it only to make a single phone call forty minutes ago that to tanzan nangi nicholass friend and hers every so often she shivered as if she were suffering with a disease which in point of fact she was it was called despair nangi had been unavailable but his secretary umi recognizing justines voice even before she introduced herself had promised to give her boss the message that justine was waiting for him in her room at the hilton putting down the receiver she had no idea what she would say to him when he arrived really she had no idea why she had phoned him except that some core of selfpreservation deep inside her recognized that she had become a mote in a black void spinning out of control that she desperately needed a reference point from which to return to the process of logical decisionmaking a soft knock on the door dispersed her inertia just enough for her to rise move across the room on leaden feet and open the door she had been ready to greet nangi but her heart froze in her chest standing in the hall outside her door was a handsome american with long dark hair light eyes and a smiling mouth he was less tanned than she remembered him in maui but somehow more fit admirably filling out his darkblue suit he gave her a quick grin as he strode across thethreshold to her room then took her in his arms and gave her a long kiss god its great to see you again rick millar said his arms still encircling her justine the taste of him still in her mouth remembered how he had followed her all the way from new york to maui after he had promoted her to vicepresident of his advertising firm millar soames robberts she had walked out on him when she had discovered that he had fired her friend in order to make room for her in maui she had almost had an affair with him almost now seeing him while in this terribly vulnerable state her throat locked up and her heart ached she was so close to weeping she could feel the tears burning beneath her eyelids and she thought oh christ it wont take much more to rip me into pieces rtck what are you doing here when she found her voice it was high and breathless i was with mr nangi when his secretary phoned about your call he was going to come here but i persuaded him that seeing a friendly face from home would be the best tonic for you his face creased in genuine concern hed been telling me a bit about your problems adjusting to the lifestyle here hes very worried about you but at a loss as to how to help justine shook her head still confused but how is it youre here in japan he would not let her go looking deep into her painracked eyes and she felt herself trembling beneath his touch i could lie to you justine and tell you that im out here making far east contacts or that im on vacation but im not the truth is i came here to find you and somehow i admit i dont yet know how to convince you to come back to new york and rejoin the firm on a permanent basis justine thought she would faint how many times as a little girl had she dreamed her dreams and wondered what would happen if they came true you cant be serious justine listen to me were about to expand after going through a bad patch during the recession business has never been better the problem is im doing everything myself try as i may i havent been able to replace you would you believe ive gone through four vps since you left i cant put in any more seventytwohour weeks he squeezed her i need you im not making it a secret if you come back you can do so on your own terms i mean it im prepared to give you a piece of the business a quarter of it if thats what it takes he squeezed her again his obvious enthusiasm running like a fever from his veins to hers just say yes justine closed her eyes she knew what she would say before she heard the word on her lips and a curious sensation of warmth washed over her of some hard carapace breaking open shattering irrevocably yes what in the name of god dyou make of that croaker looked up at the waxyskinned corpse hanging by its heels from the ceiling fixture in the kitchen outside the window filthy gray clouds streaked with purple pressed down on the inchoate clutter of a rumbling interstate a landscape so familiar it was frightening though the blistered vista was cloned virtually everywhere throughout america this particular portion was just outside marine on st croix minnesota croaker stared at the blood which still filled the stainlesssteel sink turning it brilliant carmine in the center rich maroon where it had begun to cake at the sides it was preferable to looking at the corpse although no matter what he did he could feel the psychic weight of it like a painful prickling beneath his skin as a former detectivelieutenant in the nypd lew croaker had seen many a grisly sight strewn about the garbageladen streets of new york but nothing like this every bone in the late dons limbs had been broken that kind of torture was not new to croaker but the rest was with the precision of a surgeon his heart had been cut out of the cavity of his chest neatly cleanly and lay nestled like a shiny nascent being on the dons navel croaker moved closer now and he saw a peculiar thing the heart he said has been stitched to goldonis navel his gaze moved lower and all the digits seem to have been broken in order to turn them degrees around most curious isnt it smacks of some kind of ritual christ what i wouldnt give to have nick here croaker thought arcane rituals were his metier he thought about calling him then rejected the idea at one time he wouldnt have had a second thought but these days nick had a huge corporation to run a wife and still trying for a family his priorities had changed he had no time any more for jetting across the pacific to solve bizarre mysteries croaker felt a deep pang of regret he had never been one to long for the good old days primarily because theyd never been all that good but now he found himself wishing that time could be folded back upon itself and in a blink of an eye hed find himself and nick as they had once been a team on the run heading full tilt into dangerous waters he blinked just to be sure but the only live person in the room with him remained will lillehammer lillehammers extreme thinness seemed cadaverous in this grisly setting he apparently flew around the country perhaps the world for all croaker knew in a us air force plane the vehicle had been waiting for them fueled and spotless in an authorized personnel only section of the naples airport the military flight crew deferred to lillehammer in a way they normally would not with a lowly civilian a shadow moved across croakers field of vision and he noted it he marveled at lillehammers power it was clear that neither the fbi nor the state troopers who monitored this stretch of the interstate nor the local hound dogs from marine on st croix had been in here yet the place was cordoned off by enough cops to handle a smallscale riot it took a great deal of influence to keep this kind of murder scene pristine he reflected during the flight here croaker had read the fed sheet on the goldonis it was unusual and oddly incomplete dominic was born in to a woman named faith mattaccino who seventeen years later would become the second mrs goldoni nothing apparently was known about dominics father or even if she had been married to him according to government files there was little known about faith goldoni herself save that she was an american of italian ancestry born in a year after she married enrico goldoni she convinced him to adopt her son dominic he had two daughters from his first wife one of whom margarite lived in new york and was married to the attorney tony d decamillo faith died in in a boating accident off the lido the beachfront resort of venice as for enrico goldoni by the time of his marriage to faith he was already firmly entrenched in the nether world of the mafia how a venetian came to power in the essentially sicilian criminal organization was not known except that it seemed clear that through enricos company which manufactured and traded in fine silks and handmade brocades other less savory articles were easily transshipped worldwide on december of last year the authorities pulled enricos corpse out of the grand canal where it had been hooked around a wooden pole like a sack of debris who had killed him or why remained unanswered the goldonis were apparently a family of death and secrets but nothing in the file could have prepared croaker for dominics eerie and disturbing end lillehammer came round from behind the corpse his mouth quivering do you ever get used to the stink croaker smiled took a pair of baffled plugs out of his nostrils replaced them almost immediately i wonder what happened to the head perhaps he buried it why would he do that lillehammer shrugged why would he do any of this the persons deranged you think so what other conclusion could one make i dont know but my experience is theres a wide range of possibilities they moved out of the kitchen down the hall through a dirtsmudged window croaker could see the clouds lowering he felt the pressure drop but some of his discomfiture surely came from the defilement in the kitchen inch by mental inch he turned his mind away from the images firing behind his eyes he thought they had been lucky to land before the storm hit this the house witsec bought for dominic lord no lillehammer said this is where he was brought to die he flipped open a black alligatorskin notebook this places for sale been so for eight months now no one has been in here since the bank took it over except dominic and his murderer he flipped on a miniflashlight playing it over all surfaces the white walls and ceiling glared back at them as if with evil intent whats this croaker had stopped the circle of light hovered on one spot on the wall darker than the surrounding area the two men peered at it it looks like yeah croaker finished for lillehammer sweat and he had smelled it then his fear and lillehammers as well he supposed like an animal whose fetid breath spoke of spilled blood and kills without number that psychic pressure again like an ache in his soul more insistent now even though they were further from the kitchen from the site of the defilement something happened here he said something evil evil lillehammer looked at him quizzically what dyou mean man what could be worse than whafs hanging back there in the kitchen i dont know yet croaker played the beam of light over the entire area the stain ovoid and almost perfectly symmetrical stood out like a stele in the southeast asian jungle marking the passage of an ancient enigmatic people he played the light along the baseboard of the wall then down along the floor almost directly at his feet was another stain this one smaller but thick viscid that almost certainly is semen lillehammer said from over his shoulder perhaps the murderer raped goldoni before he strung him up and decapitated him no croaker said as you pointed out there was some kind of ritual performed on goldoni like a sacrifice he glanced up at lillehammer no violation of the sacrificial victim would be permitted how the hell do you know that for certain i dont he said its just a feeling yes ive been in the jungle lillehammer said where feeling is everything brush of a ghosts breath can save your skin or lead you astray ullehammer smiled his ghastly smile the tiny crosshatched scars standing out white and livid in the intense beam of the flashlight i want this bastard you see need to run him down actually need maybe you picked the right name for yourself ahab lillehammer gave a harsh metallic laugh and his rather large teeth clacked together like the jaws of a crocodile sure he said employing one of his few americanisms til tell you all about it sometime thatll be the day croaker thought he watched as lillehammer knelt opened his small black case drew on a pair of surgical rubber gloves went about preserving the semen til have it tested probably a dead end but with the level of dna mapping available these days maybe well get lucky such as finding he has some odd genetic disease that will help us track him down lillehammer was a total enigma and that croaker thought now was why he was drawn to him the simple fact was croaker loved mysteries his fathers murder had led him to become a cop but his own innate curiosity about the far side of human existence had caused him to become a homicide detective still lillehammer continued as he packed up his gear we have no idea what happened here not quite croaker said the murderer was involved in a sexual act most likely just after he killed goldoni its clear that goldoni was killed in the kitchen exsanguinated there all right perhaps he got off on the killing so much he masturbated to ejaculation that would be consistent with a good many homicidal psychotics theyre normally impotent but the intense rage that causes them to kill the very act of bringing death releases their sexual restraint pressure on his psyche a shadow on his soul possibly he said but in this case i dont think so look at what we found in the kitchen there was no sense of rage at work there only a meticulous precision and the sacrificial aspect only magicians shamans perform these complex rituals power after power i dont see impotence in this particular psychic equation lillehammer seemed willing to accept that he took another look around them if he didnt have sex with goldoni and he wasnt masturbating were left with only one other possibility right croaker said there was someone else they went further into the house the smell of old paint turpentine wet and rot saturated the clotted atmosphere the hall ended in an oldfashioned bathroom with tiny blackandwhite tiles cracked and smudged beyond the pale of any cleanser a clawfooted bathtub a square sink with some of the porcelain chipped off no towels on the iron bars the rustle of scuttling insects it was as sad and desolate a spot as croaker could remember seeing lillehammers mouth twitched again do you smell something croaker took the plugs out of his nostrils christ he said lunging for the door on the opposite side of the room it was locked he raised his left hand to the height of the lock a thin metallic nail was extruded from the tip of the index finger croaker inserted it into the lock lillehammer looked on in obvious fascination as croaker turned the nail back and forth feeling for the grooves a moment later there was an audible click well done lillehammer said croaker turned the knob and opened the door outward bloody hell what lillehammer took out a handkerchief pressed it over his nose and mouth this stench is worse than the one in the kitchen i think weve found our other person croaker said as they entered the room on the bed was a young woman or to be more truthful what had once been a young woman she was spread out in a star the arms legs and head making up the five points her torso had been incised cut all the way through as finely and precisely as if it had been done by a surgeon croaker circling the bed counted the number of incisions there were seven tucked neatly into the seventh cut was a white birds feather stained with blood lillehammer following him said softly lord she was a pretty thing once croaker said another ritual look at that carved into the center of her forehead was a vertical crescent dark with dried blood lower down where the navel had once been was a dark hole across which something was woven it had once been white but was now stained dark with blood croaker said is that some kind of bird feather stitched between the flesh and organ it looks that way as soon as were finished here im going to have it cheeked out with an ornithologist his gaze seemed rooted to the bloody feather id better get the forensic team in here as quickly as possible ive always been a big believer in oldfashioned police work croaker said but in this case i doubt itll do any good what we need is a sorcerer our murderer isnt about to leave fingerprints he left his semen lillehammer reminded him yes he did croaker said thoughtfully still examining the bloody crescent it was a signpost and look where it led us he turned to regard lillehammer but theres another question that needs to be answered what in hell happened to dominic goldonis head mikio okami said you see linnearsan i came to venice many years ago for a specific purpose here i have been working to channel the old criminal yakuza money into new legitimate businesses which will ensure the yakuzas existence into the twentyfirst century as you must know the yakuza were officially outlawed in april of one can no longer assume the status quo will remain in effect myths are crumbling even ones so powerful as those surrounding the yakuza about a year ago everything changed for me friends foes alliances i have maintained for decades this change was forced upon me by a growing disaffection within my own inner council the result has been legion one of my old partners was murdered and now i have a very powerful enemy he is a member of a group that calls itself the godaishu five continents nicholas said unconsciously translating from the japanese okami nodded the godaishus philosophy is diametrically opposed to mine these oyabun feel terribly threatened by my plan to bring them within the scope of the law these men revel in their lawlessness because it is the only thing that gives them community status and influence without it they feel they would be reduced to little people and their fear of losing the status and privilege their old life affords them is allconsuming theyre poweraddicts unable to face a world stripped of the adrenalin rush their money force and clandestine life provides what is the value of life without the razors edge ive heard them ask this question time and again it is vital even essential for yakuza interests to expand and by that i do not mean multiply from vice to vice yes we are in the process of gaining a foothold in vices historically the purview of americas mafia these people are old and sick the new blood is of a generation so removed from omerta and the other matters of honor that there is no more fabric for them to build upon one don rolls over on another at the slightest pressure from federal agents he put a hand up as if in some arcane form of benediction so that in an odd sense nicholas was reminded of the liturgies he had overheard at the church of san belisario now it is time for the moral fiber of the yakuza to take hold the soil is ripe and ready for our strength of purpose but this is not the mafias purpose no i am speaking now of legitimate businesses we partially control or wish to control buying into such conglomerates is not easy we have the american sec to contend with as well as numerous banking regulatory agencies we must be so circumspect in our purchases that no suspicion whatsoever is focused in our direction why would you tell me all this okamisan nicholas asked you must know that i am no friend to the yakuza i deplore how they prey upon the weaknesses of decent folk you have spoken frankly okami said so will i you know nothing of what we do or what we hope to accomplish you would condemn us out of hand as would our enemies nicholas gave okami a wintry smile on the contrary he said i know at least something of the private bves of the oyabun but not mine when nicholas did not reply okami was forced to respond have you no hope that we could be involved in a beneficial enterprise beneficial to yourselves yes this was not how your father saw matters nicholas put down his cup my father lived in different times for him a war was still on he was involved in reinventing modernday japanyou neednt elaborate okami said softly i was there with him then he gave nicholas a direct look these harsh words pain me the two of us neednt be at war perhaps we are at war simply through ignorance nicholas said i have no knowledge of the origins of my fathers debt to you that is a secret we swore would remain between the two of us nicholas said nothing the silence was as much as telling okami that they had reached a personal stalemate would you forswear your own oath to your father okami said suddenly sharply would you have me forswear my oath to him your relationship with my father has its own life nicholas said now you must deal with me you and i must struggle toward our own understanding only from that can we expect a connection to evolve okami seemed surprised you are speaking of an alliance nicholas nodded perhaps yes but whatever our contact may eventually become you cannot expect to use me blindly as a huntsman draws his arrow but your father okamisan please try to understand i am not only my fathers son okami rose and turning his back on nicholas went to the windows there to stare out across the rio his hands smacked one against the other as he pondered the problem there wasnt much to think about nicholas had given him what amounted to an ultimatum tell me how the debt came into being or i will not honor it it was now nicholas knew strictly a matter of face your father was an extraordinary man okami said without preamble he was extraordinary in many ways some of which even you are not aware of in a sense your father was like an artist what he saw was never strictly speaking reality but rather what lay beyond the reality simply put your father saw the potential in every situation and he knew how to exploit the situation in order to turn that potential into a very real future nicholas noticed that okamis back had straightened the years seeming to slip away from him as he remembered his shared past with colonel denis linnear i met your father in a very odd way because it was not through business the truth was my sister was crazy about him and it was she who brought us together she insisted i meet him an iteki i thought i hated him on sight i thought that was before i got to know him okami took a deep breath as if steeling himself you are no doubt aware that macarthurs scap command often liaised with certain members of the yakuza we were of use to them in combating the communist incursions into japan bent on subverting the new democratic order imposed by the americans at first i and others like me felt as if we were caught between scylla and charybdis trapped between two alien political systems both of which would pervert the basic fabric of japanese life but of course of the two communism was by far the more feared and hated so we found ourselves siding with the americans what else could we do it was a question that we asked ourselves continually in those days and one which your father and i debated endlessly but the communists were not the only threat they were the overt enemy and therefore easy for the scap command to identify however your father had ferreted out a far more subversive group hiding deep below the surface of both our societies and it was these people he recruited me to help him destroy okami turned round at last sat on one of the pillows he crossed one leg over the other threw an arm across the windowsill you must understand those were lawless days linnearsan the black market was flourishing and any enterprising person could make a fortune in a matter of months if he had the contacts and the merchandise to sell it was even easy if for example you were an officer in the american military police then you had the virtual run of the country you were the law your father had discovered a nexus of the black market in tokyo it was being run by a certain mp captain named jonathan leonard who was as ruthless as he was unscrupulous he was also so well protected that your father could never pin anything on him despite all his best efforts meanwhile captain leonard was supplying the city with everything it didnt need then guns ammo weapons of every description and drugs lots of drugs where was he getting this contraband from where was he storing it who was he using as a distribution network much to my surprise and rage i found certain yakuza kobun involved on the street level these were the disenchanted the disloyal soldiers who had been passed over for promotion or more disturbingly had been too impatient to work their way up the hierarchy but who lay behind them captain leonard why not he was the one with the connections your father had done some further digging and had discovered that leonard had legally changed his name just before he had enlisted in the army the name he had been born with was john leonforte okamis head nodded thats right linnear san he was the kid brother to alphonse leonforte the mafia don who terrorized the states during the war years and afterward alphonse singlehandedly consolidated the east coast mafias hold over the seaport of new york as well as the construction and interstate trucking businesses two areas whose growth in america would outstrip almost all others in the fifties didnt i read in that biography published several years ago that al leonfortes kid brother died while he was in the army thats right okami said i killed him nicholas studied okami for some time then he got up went to the sideboard and poured himself a brandy he took it all down in one swallow allowed the burn to reach his stomach before turning back to face okami are you saying you murdered johnny leonforte on orders from my father okami took the last of his espresso in his mouth and swallowed it heres something you didnt read in that biography alphonse leonfortes last official act before he retired was to order the murder of james hoffa and do you know why they never found his body ill tell you the senior senator from new york at that time was a good friend of leonfortes i forget his name but it doesnt matter you can look it up in the biography if you wish in any event this senator had a house a summer house i believe it was on shelter island do you know that place linnearsan very well nicholas said with a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach okami nodded i have not been there but one day i would like to go it is supposed to be very beautiful very secluded it is all that and more okami inclined his head again as i have said the senator had a house there where he went to relax leonforte loved that place although he was never allowed near it during daylight hours too dangerous for the senator perhaps but there was a pair of fine japanese maples on the property magnificent specimens even back then leonforte was passionate about those trees especially when their leaves turned scarlet in the autumn perhaps the senator had left the maples in a state of benign neglect and leonforte felt them in need of some extraordinary compost or again he might have been playing a kind of ironic prank on his friend at this late date whos to say but that was where leonforte directed his men to bury hoffa beneath the roots of the senators maples i am told the trees are there still more magnificent than ever nicholas rubbed his forehead and this is the guy whose kid brother you murdered not murdered okami said no not really we got into a fight he and ii suppose i am guilty of engineering that fight yes i remember he was strong and tough and he certainly had the instinct for survival but i was in those days a very fine martial artist and those kinds of fights he shrugged it is difficult to pull your punches i think you know what i mean nicholas looked at his own hands knowing very well what okami meant they had been responsible for a number of deaths he looked back up at okami he wanted the old man to tell him outright if his father had ordered him to murder johnny leonforte but he didnt think now that okami would he thought for a moment said and did captain leonards death make a difference did the black market in contraband then dry up okami did not answer right away for a while he said at last which was as much of an admission as he was willing to put forth but then to your fathers surprise it began again and this time neither of us were successful in tracking down its source nicholas stirred werent you surprised as well okami gave the kind of smile a professor exhibits at a prize pupils canny question believe it or not i knew a great deal more about the american mafia than your father ever did i had studied them had even made a trip to sicily he waved a hand but that is another story i knew that if one leonforte was involved others were too you mean alphonse okami shook his head there were originally four brothers one died in a boating accident at college well one is never certain that the word accident exists in the world of these people especially when it pertains to the man alphonse was grooming to succeed him in any case paul leonforte died young so that left the black sheep of the family francis he migrated to san francisco and stayed there over the strenuous objections of alphonse but frank was always his own man not for him the shadow of his big brother he knew no matter how much personal power he amassed he would always be taking orders as long as he stayed anywhere on the east coast he had no desire to lock horns with alphonse so he left to stake out his own empire on the west coast which he did with admirable success he had three children a daughter and two sons one son michael died a highly decorated veteran in vietnam the other one caesare built on franks successes and is now the don of the western half of the united states he is the east coast capo dominic goldonis chief rival okami grunted it was half a laugh caesare is called bad clams you think its a joke but its not the way he made his bones in the organization is he was sent to assassinate a rival of his father the man was eating dinner at a local restaurant pasta with fresh clams the story is told that when caesare had blown this mans brains all over his threepiece suit he stood over him with the gun still smoking in his hand and said look what bad clams can do to you okami gave a short barking laugh then quickly sobered but i digress thinking about it it seemed logical that frank would have been johns ultimate source but in order to confirm this theory either your father or i would have had to travel to san francisco where at the time neither of us had any connections besides the communistinstigated dock strikes in tokyo soon took our attention elsewhere nicholas poured himself another brandy then came and sat next to okami they both looked out at the dark water with its reflections of the palazzi across the grand canal so the mystery was never solved nicholas said at last no but today i find myself in a position significantly closer to its solution okami said thoughtfully what do you mean okami turned his head to look at nicholas just this while i have been trying to legitimize the yakuza someone unknown to me has been consolidating a link with the mafia which i now suspect was forged during the days when johnny leonforte served as the japanese point man okamis eyes glittered as they caught the nighttime reflections off the water linnearsan it is my belief that this same someone one brilliant mind is behind the recent transformation of the mafia all the old dons with their sense of honor and family are being sold down the river leaving behind the venal jackals the buttondown beancounters who would sell their souls for another billion dollars profit and it appears as if theyve sold their soul to this one man who is forging the international conglomerate from hell the godaishu such a conglomerate a sharing of underground contacts and resources throughout the east and the west a kind of criminal keiretsu with arms that can encompass the globe could conceivably gain more power over the world economy than the governments of the united states and germany do now have you any idea how much havoc such an entity could wreak legitimate business worldwide would literally be feeding it allowing it to grow even more powerful but surely there are governmental agencies the cia for example that can deal with such a menace ordinarily that might be so okami said but recently i have been making enquiries along a specific line it appears that the mystery of what happened with leonforte in postwar japan runs far deeper than your father or i had imagined i believe that the alliances leonforte made had at the very least semiofficial links appalling as it may seem leonforte must have been operating under the aegis of certain individuals within the two governments japan and america the godaishu is the end result it is far more influential than you can possibly envision its tentacles reaching all the way to the most powerful elements within washington and tokyo you mentioned needing time to initiate your own plans yes over the last year i have been trying to gather forces strong enough to stymie the godaishu it has been a formidable task one that has exhausted me taxing the limits of even the kaishos influence now i am in the final phase and i know it will be all or nothing either i will survive to destroy the godaishu or they will become a force unstoppable by anyone or anything you must buy me the time i need to bring the plan to conclusion there is no one else who has the expertise no one else i can turn to okami lit a cigarette but he quickly stubbed it out unable to enjoy its taste frankly linnearsan my desperation to stop the godaishu has led me to make questionable liaisons with individuals whom i cannot openly control or fully trust i cannot say yet whether my actions will result in a brilliant coup or complete folly he moved so that the lights from the palazzi across the canal played across his face transfiguring it into the aspect of a titian painting one thing i do know my actions have put me into deadly danger already i have word that one of my partners dominic goldoni the only one i could trust has been murdered and now i am convinced that my intimate knowledge of the godaishu and my attempts to move against it have marked me for death three new york tokyo washington margarite goldoni with her daughter sleeping in her arms had returned home to find that her husband had gathered an entire fleet of buttonmen to go after robert tony was of the old school very macho which was why dominic had appointed him custodian of the family business in fact she had been dreading her return and all her fears were borne out when tony ripped open the door he did not ask her where she had been taken how far her culpability went in her brothers death or even how she had made her way home he asked her only one question were you touched not even did he touch you because tony would not personify what in his mind had already occurred to her because in a very real sense her answer did not matter to him he had already decided her fate seeing in his mind what she had become the madonna he had always wanted her to be was now soiled forever she told him no she told him that francie had been drugged which was the truth and that she had been blindfolded which was of course not but how could she admit to anyone especially to him what she had been coerced into doing committing the act was one kind of hell admitting to it afterward a wholly different kind she would not tolerate he heard none of what she said he wasnt interested he didnt even want to come near her standing apart his eyes cold disapproving as if she had caught leprosy on her strange journey despite the fact that she was obviously despairing and emotionally exhausted tony had forced her into having it out with him about going to war with robert he wanted his revenge for christs sake tony we dont even know his real name she had exploded tony had that cunning look he got when he was about to ram a contract down an adversarys throat but we have you margarite now that the kid is safe with us you can give the artist i brought in a detailed description of him his face is all we need hes a goddamned asian do you think we wont be able to find him she took a deep breath said slowly and distinctly tony i want you to listen to me he said hed be watching us that if we did anything he would take francie tony waved his hands in dismissal words just words he was trying to scare you thats all think about it margarite how the fuck is he going to monitor what we do even the feds arent too good at that and look at all the manpower they have at their disposal he shook his head almost in pity youre a woman he knows he can intimidate you men like him do it all the time let me handle things well get the bastard before hes had a chance to shit she put the heel of her hand to her temple as if by that gesture she could slow her pulse diminish the rising tide of panic how like a child she felt so impotent exactly as she had with her father in despair she said you dont know him hell take her he can do it she fought to keep her voice calm but it cracked and the tears came francies back safe with us jesus just leave it alone now leave it alone you must be fucking nuts fagetaboutit this sonuvabitch comes into my house attacks me humiliates me and leaves me to clean up the bodies he slaughters all over my house this is sacred ground margarite not even that sonuvabitch bad clams leonforte would dare violate my house his face was full of blood mary immaculate margarite he murdered your brother she was silent before his power his righteous rage so like her fathers tony began to order his buttonmen around then he got on the phone made some calls he pounded into her bathroom where she was taking a shower get packed he said you and francine are taking a trip margarite stared at him shes already missed enough school i dont want her do as i say she obeyed tony finished his preparations then came into the bedroom where she was dressing nobody knows where youre going except a few of my most trusted people here and the man im on the phone with its his house and hes family so you dont have to worry about him he had a man carry the bags she had packed downstairs he took the sleeping francine in his arms following them downstairs he had tried to pry ryan her favorite teddy bear out of her arms but it would not come ragtag and chewed it was the sole remaining vestige of her childhood ihe one even as a teenager she would not part with outside margarite climbed into the lincoln and he handed francine in to her they were surrounded by family bodyguards both in the car and in cars in front and back of the lincoln ill see you when this is over tony said slamming the flat of his hand down on the roof of the lincoln it was only after they had left the compound that margarite realized that he had not kissed her had not in fact touched her at all since she had returned home francine lay still clutching ryan her head on her mothers lap and margarite stroked her childs hair as she had when she was a baby with the croup as they sped through the night she could not help thinking of what tony must be planning and her anxiety grew she tried to calm herself she told herself that without her help he would not get his portrait of robert but deep in the night that seemed scant comfort they reached the stone house in new hampshire an hour before dawn the men in the lead car entered the house first turning on lights searching the place thoroughly only then did they signal to the lincolns driver margarite had taken francine into the bedroom herself tucking her under the covers propping ryan against the wall within easy reach should her daughter turn over looking for him in her sleep then she retired to the bedroom designated for her if she slept she was not aware of it instead she relived her waking death her childs blank stupor her hegira down the open roads through which she had wound she saw herself as if through a lookingglass already maimed beyond understanding barely conscious driven by the sole directive an imperative from that primitive part of her that was still wholly functional to keep her daughter safe from the evil that stalked her in this malignant state her dreamimagining took the place of sleep she awoke near noon her eyes gluey feeling as if she had just fallen asleep the adrenalin of anxiety rushed through her like a sickening wave and she hurtled into the bathroom made it to the toilet barely in time bent double her mouth and eyes full of fluid later she looked in on francine who was still asleep then showered and dressed in the kitchen she dawdled over a silent breakfast made by one of the bodyguards a large man with raccoon eyes and a kind smile she spent the time moving her eggs from one side of the plate to the other and assessing the extent of her loathing for her husband francine emerged at last rumpled and blearyeyed and margarite had to explain to her where they were and why they were there of course francie said dully tony she wanted to go home she missed her friends margarite did her best to console her daughter but it was a losing proposition she could find no way to get through to her at least she got her to eat some breakfast the strange drugs robert had ground up and administered to her to make her sleep appeared to have had no lasting effects an hour later one of the bodyguards came into the house and spoke to the big man who had made them breakfast what is it margarite asked anxiety turning to panic maybe nothing the big man said but the smile was gone from his face theyve found a package outside its addressed to francine francie looked alarmed jumping up margarite gave a little cry i want to see it the big man shook his head thats not a good idea mrs decamillo for the time being i think youd better go to my room with your daughter sal will stay with you from the small bedroom she heard the big man on the phone with tony he was there inside two hours she heard the thwoptthwopthwop of a helicopters rotors increasing in pitch and volume as it neared she was allowed out of the room but she left francie behind with sal the box sat on the entryway sideboard tony said nothing to her directed one of his men to open it inside was a gaily wrapped package tied with a pink bow this too the man opened and they all peered inside margarite gave a piercing cry nestled within on a cloud of pink crepe paper was ryan francies teddy bear she rushed into the bedroom where francie had slept stared at the bed with its ruffled covers the empty space against the wall where she had put ryan late last night mother of god she put her knuckles to her mouth as tony came in behind her tony he was in the house he was right beside her her voice cracked and she had to stop gather herself before continuing i put it on her bed myself when we got here last night she turned stared wideeyed at tony do you see now what ive been telling you its a warning what good was it bringing us here what good were the guards i told you all the buttonmen in the world arent going to save us now we cant hide from him if we say a word francines gone calm down he said automatically but she could see that he was pale beneath his sunlamp tan please listen to me tony i cant bear the thought of francie being harmed more than she already has god knows what she remembers from this nightmare she wont talk to me about it im pleading with you for our daughters life let this go was it purely desperation that gave her words such conviction that even tony was moved and what else have i given you margarite now you know you have the strength of purpose to do anything all right he said at length i take your point but i want you and the kid in the chopper now were getting the hell out of here heres what it boils down to justine thought as she felt rick millars muscular thigh press against the side of her leg under the restaurant table he wants me not a part of me but all of me and then came the thought unbidden its been a long time since i felt that from a man tears burned her eyes and she had to turn her head away quickly wipe her face with the back of her hand she could not let him know just how vulnerable she was what defenses were left to her were shaky at best and she knew with a shudder of recognition that when not if but when he put his hand on her she would not be able to resist him not tonight not here he had too much she needed feeling him so dose to her she could imagine what it must be like to have been wandering delirious in the desert for weeks on end then finally and unexpectedly stumble upon an oasis she was so close to that clear cold water who would blame her for drinking her fill there seems to be no distance at all between us tonight rick said as he poured more wine for them have you been treated so badly since i last saw you was i always so untouchable he leaned over her covered her lips with his she tasted him felt the quick brush of his tongue and she felt her body melt against him youre right he said breathlessly i wont ask you again when youre ready to tell me to get it all out ill be here to listen i wonder justine said breaking away from his heat did you come here to seduce me rick laughed my god nothing could have been further from my mind you the ice maiden is that what they called me at the office to my knowledge only the guys who lusted after you i think that included all of them well all the straight ones anyway now it was justines turn to laugh but she was flattered all the same she put her head down i feel as if ive been on another planet no kidding rick said as far as i can see tokyo is another planet he put his hand over hers squeezed its time you came home when he returned her to the hilton she found that she did not want him to leave that was not much of a surprise all through dinner she had found her appetite for food suppressed by another desire just as basic and by her tone of voice the look in her eyes the compliance of her body she knew that she was seducing him it was a good feeling after years of being out of control of being in a very real way subject to the whims of her alien environment and to the frightening vagaries of nicholass tanjian heritage she felt positively liberated at being able to exert her own personality at last she recognized how much of herself had been held hostage had been subsumed within her fear of what her husband was becoming now she could see dearly that she wanted no part of his powers and his magic these arcane things only made her uneasy lying sleepless beside him at night anxiety flooding her with adrenalin stay with me tonight justine whispered in ricks ear when the door to her room closed behind them i want you to be sure this is right rick said as he held her im sure justine said to herself need to have a normal life to be productive in my work to come home at night make love with my husband see friends on the weekends take vacations twice a year she tilted her head up captured his mouth with her lips her lips flowered open and she moaned a little as she felt his tongue twine with hers she felt his hands on her body as he unbuttoned her blouse slipped it off her shoulders unbuttoned her skirt pushed it down over her hips she fell into his arms as if she had passed out her intense desire pushing them on he scooped her up carried her over to the bed there was only one lamp on and through eyes slitted with lust justine watched his body appear as she disrobed him she remembered parts of him from their time in maui then she had seen him in a bathing suit that left little to the imagination all the same she found her heart beating faster than she thought possible as she slipped off his underpants naked he stood at the side of the bed looking down at her justine thought he had a beautiful body slimhipped flatbellied certainly he did not have the unique musculature that nicholas possessed but she reminded herself this was an ordinary man and he was all that she desired now come here darling she held her arms up to him rick knelt on the bed kissing her tenderly while he unhooked her bra rolled her bikini pants down her legs justine was weeping when she felt his body on top of hers it had been a very long time since she had made love with anyone other than nicholas and the unfamiliarity of his weight form and smell excited her so that she bit into his shoulder as she jerked her hips up into his groin she could hardly breathe and the hammering of her heart was all she heard amid the vertiginous swirl of her desire she opened her legs felt his hardness brush against her gasped as she pulled his head down to her breasts her eyes fluttered closed as he laved her nipples and she corkscrewed her hips to let him know how desperate she was for him he understood immediately arching up over her so that she could guide him into her with her hand her fingers stroked his velvet flesh for a moment then because she could not help herself her palm came down over his head and she squeezed she heard him groan his body shudder and she lifted her legs fitting him to her she was very wet and he slid halfway into her in one stroke ohhl justine cried canting her hips upward she was already in a frenzy and when with his next stroke his tip touched the core of her she lost complete control shouting out as her orgasm burst over her she sucked on his flesh wanting that taste of him to permeate her entirely oh god oh god she chanted with each thrust of him inside her part of her knew that this was almost wholly her her passion venting itself needing this expression this outlet her thighs were trembling and she felt another orgasm building she lifted her head up whimpering in his ear and she felt his hips give a ragged lurch inward and then he was spasming into her justine felt her orgasm flowering out it was different this time less violent but more intense coming from deep inside her and when it was over she lay beside him one leg thrown over him in abandon and for the first time in long months she slept the sleep of a child deep and dreamless ghosts there was something about washington harley gaunt thought that was like no other city in america its wheelspoke design its wide treeshaded boulevards its parks the pillared stolidity of its major structures all reminded him of paris or london of europe the old world rather than the new world also the place fairly hummed with power gaunt could feel it as if the city were wired with overhead trolley lines and that power like the wide treeshaded boulevards all led in one direction to pennsylvania avenue the white house sat in the center of washington like a spider in the center of its web this city was full of ghosts gaunt knew the capitol well had many friends here as the son of the former democratic senator from maryland he had been born within sight of the ellipse he had been raised with the crackle of power in his ears had burned out on it quickly more so than his father who had hung on here past his time dying in office gaunt knew well that the power that fueled this city could be as malignant as nuclear radiation the gamesmanship of dealmaking had to it always the stench of powermongering either you were in in washington or you were nothing this elite clique ran the country the worlds only remaining superpower and that was justification enough to lie cheat extort break every commandment in the pursuit of the amassing of power this power was like a virus seeping into the players bloodstreams affecting their personalities the whys and wherefores of decisionmaking gaunt had seen this virus so many times he could now recognize it like a fever lurking in the back of the eyes he had had enough experience with it he was convinced that his father had died of the fever not old age or overwork his father an essentially good man honest in the way most successful politicians learn never to be had gradually changed he had not been immune to the fever as gaunt had been certain he of course would be gaunts mother and sister had mourned gaunts father at his funeral but gaunt had mourned for him long before every time he came back to washington gaunt felt the ghosts whispering in the humid wind off the potomac hanging in the cherry trees near the reflecting pool grinning from the heights of capitol hill in a sense his father had never left this place the power kept him here even after death the lobbyist gaunt had chosen to run political interference for tomkin industries down here had been secretary of state in a former administration he was a middleoftheroad conservative highly regarded he held the green fire of potomac power in his closed fist unlike most he had won his battle with the virus terrence mcnaughton had offices on g street hard by the old executive office a building that by its almost victorian architecture looked haunted at night and no doubt was not by conventional ghosts out of a horror novel but by the drudges of the current administration who lived a nearspook existence executing eyes only directives whose consequences never made the papers the imposing federal fagade of the stone building in which mcnaughton plied his trade was like so many others in the capitol bespeaking old money influence and the presence of that green potomac fire mcnaughton was a tall texan with leathery skin burnished a pleasing bronze color pale blue eyes with sprays of squint lines at their outside edges and thick silver hair his long almost mournful face was redeemed by his roman nose and a genuine smile he had perfected during the many campaigns of his youth he was like an old glove at once rumpled and comfortingly familiar he came out of his office the moment gaunt was announced extending his hand for a firm dry shake he wore a dark suit white shirt and a string tie with a handmade bolo of worked silver and turquoise come on in he said in his rich baritone its good to see you again harley he closed the door behind them with a kick of his tooled cowboy boot though i wish to hell it were under kinder circumstances gaunt chose an upholstered chair sat down just what are the circumstances mcnaughton grunted opted to sit on the tatty sofa opposite gaunts chair rather than retreat behind his kidneyshaped desk so oldfashioned it was in vogue again the circumstances he said folding his long body into the semblance of a sitting position can be summed up in three words senator ranee bane bane wants me he wants nicholas linnear but he cant find him mcnaughton said dyou know where he is if hes not in tokyo i have no idea gaunt said i hope thats so mcnaughton steepled his long fingers looked up at the ceiling ive known ranee for ages we grew up in adjoining towns my brother dated his sister for over a year ive been following his career for a long time worrying this man has an obsessive personality and his current obsession is getting the japanese out of large american businesses for him tomkins merger with sato international has become a lightning rod a symbol if you will of all that he sees wrong with international takeovers mcnaughton stretched out his legs thus relaxed and comfortable he eased the tension in his guest because linnears company is involved in a number of sensitive advanced computer projects the senators anxiety level has reached the boiling point he wants linnear brought up on charges he wants the merger terminated forthwith what kind of charges could he possibly hit nick with gaunt asked alarmed nick has done nothing illegal sure that statement can hold water can you swear that you know everything that goes on at tomkinsato no but i i know nick he wouldnt not good enough son ive heard rumors something to the effect that tomkinsato has been using the technology they got from hyrotechinc to make their own form of the classified hive computer and are now selling it overseas to the highest bidder hive is the property of the us government improper use of it would be a treasonable offense gaunt looked bleakly at the older man cmon this is bullshit terry davis munch doesnt think so hes the pentagon investigator attached to ranees committee pure raving paranoia depends on what munch and his ferrets have uncovered theres nothing sinister to uncover eye of the beholder mcnaughton said its how they go about making what theyve found sound sinister hey this is america terry people dont get railroaded like this i mean not on this scale in the glare of the national spotlight mcnaughton leveled a jaundiced look at him thats a mighty dubious statement son especially coming from you he said but even if it passed scrutiny we havent had a mind like ranee banes in the drivers seat since oh well i suppose mccarthy will do as the most odious example gaunts anxiety level was escalating dangerously so what are you saying he said bottom line mcnaughton sat forward punched a button on an ivory plastic console marcy well have that coffee now he sat for a moment silent tapping his fingertips together in an unknown rhythm in a moment the door opened and his longlegged assistant brought in coffee and danish on an exquisite chased silver service much obliged marcy mcnaughton said as she set it on the coffee table she asked if there was anything else and when he said no she left he stared fondly at the coffee service memento of bygone days he said thatcher gave it to me after i he gave a sly smile but no even now i cant talk about that he made himself busy pouring the coffee he added cream and one teaspoon of demerara sugar to gaunts he never forgot anything he took his own black danish he asked as he handed gaunt his cup those prune ones are particularly good gaunt shook his head at this moment he doubted if he could hold anything in his stomach he sipped his coffee watched mcnaughton select a pastry bite into it with perfect white teeth it was only after the danish had been eaten and he had poured himself a second cup of coffee that mcnaughton answered the question bottom line we got a terminal problem see its gone beyond a question of image thats my meat and i could turn something like that around on a dime but this is no go believe me ive tried ranees got his hooks into tomkin and hes not about to let go until hes shaken it apart weve got to stop him mcnaughton stared at gaunt and said youre a scion of this city son think about what youve just said but mcnaughton was shaking his head no buts on this one harley ive got power so have my friends but bane is beyond us christ hes beyond even the presidents control hes a man who scares this town shitless because hes got the kind of groundroots evangelical support that even the most entrenched politician isnt going to fool with right now hes a juggernaut under full steam and them thats in his way better step aside less they want to get crushed in the silence that prevailed gaunt could hear marcy or someone like her working her wordprocessor a phone rang was answered a door slammed at last gaunt could procrastinate no longer terry because this is so important he said i want you to spell it out for me chapter and verse mcnaughton nodded drew his legs up under him so that his boot heels scraped across the floor okay heres the way it is son you that is to say tomkin industries pay me a fair bit of change to do my best lobbying on your behalf and that i assure you ive done but now the advice im going to dispense is personal we go back a long way you and i i came to your college graduation when your father couldnt up on the hill fighting for a bill he had sponsored i have only fond memories of him and i think ive been a good friend to you he leaned forward as i see it you have only two options one is to go before the committee and answer all of banes blistering questions with the foreknowledge that you are going to go down with the ship because make no mistake as sure as were sitting here now tomkinsato is doomed gaunts throat was dry and he took theast of his cold coffee almost choked on some dregs whats the other option but he already knew the other option is in my opinion the one you should take mcnaughton said in measured tones his eyes were feverbright and it seemed as if his mouth had lost its ability to smile bail out resign get clear of harms way let the juggernaut have its day let it destroy what it will tomkin industries and nicholas linnear margarite goldonis eyes flew open and her heart pounded painfully in her breast her clawed fingers filled with fistfuls of satin sheet there it was again she thought wildly that awful sensation of falling she lay in her bed beside her softly snoring husband her knuckles white with gripping panting a little as she stared blindly up at the ceiling always it came as she emerged from sleep slipping from her unconscious like some bitch in heat that curious sensation of falling not down a flight of stairs or off the edge of a swimming pool but into a kind of nothingness a void filled only with her own terror and then she would come fully awake as now filmed with a cold sweat filled with the certain knowledge that something precious had been irrevocably taken from her at first the nightmares had been flickerflashes of her unreal journey across america in search of her brothers death heated insensate emotions coloring the images like spraypaint madly spattered across a series of rooms then she would dream of dominic or more accurately his elaborate funeral flowers everywhere limousines parked fender to bumper feds videotaping everyone who crossed the street to the cemetery and everywhere as she stood beside the gleaming mahogany and cherrywood coffin open mouths keening silently turned in her direction until she could no longer bear the noise and she was forced to look down into the open grave where dominic lay mutilated and headless beginning to rise broken skeletal fingers scrabbling at the loamy dirt on his way up to where she stood rooted to the spot with a terror that threatened to fill her lungs her throat her open mouth and waking from these nightmares covered in sweat and shivering she would tell herself yes of course she felt a profound sense of loss she had lost her brother had been a party to that loss but eventually in the clear light of day at a meeting at the office or later with evening shadows spreading into the kitchen as she fed francie dinner would come the knowledge from deep down in her unconscious that this loss transcended grief and guilt it was something far more personal margarite lay tense and white listening to the rasp of her own respiration turning over this sense of loss as if it were a threedimensional object it put her in mind of the summer she was eleven her father and stepmother had taken her to see her grandmother her fathers mother who as it turned out was dying the old lady was as crooked as a venetian walking stick bent as if she carried each year of her life on her shoulders her hair was white and pulled back tightly in a neat bun and forever afterward margarite was to remember her plain black dress which she wore in the hot sun without so much as a drop of sweat appearing on her brow she had trouble hearing and she had few of her teeth remaining some time before she had had her larynx removed and her voice emanated from a small box more of a vibration than true speech so that margarite had to bend close to understand her her grandmother had fed the family and afterward she gave margarites hand a secret squeeze she had led her granddaughter into her bedroom which was filled with sepiatoned photos of herself as a child her parents her confirmation and her wedding in venice margarite saw photos of her father and his sister who had died of cholera when she was a child margarites grandmother narrated each photo then went to the top drawer of her old walnut dresser she took out something which she pressed into margarites fist just before they left murmuring in her ear as she kissed her this is for you it belonged to the forebear of my greatgrandmother she had it with her when she arrived in venice centuries ago she was a refugee and this was all that was left of her family who had died in a great war that lasted twenty years on the way home she had opened her sweaty hand to see revealed there a carving in amber of the most beautiful woman she had ever seen she had never told anyone of that gift and when months later she stood at her grandmothers graveside she clutched the carving in her hand to ward off the sensation that something irretrievable had been taken away from her now as she lay panting in her own bed she was swept anew by a similar feeling the death of her brother had been a blow to her but her own part in it extorted though it may have been continued to torment her she had been forced by the man she knew only as robert to effectively choose between her daughter and her brother it was a hellish decision one in which she had known she could not emerge unscarred but what choice did she have save to bring him to dominic goldoni francine had to be safeguarded at all costs and oddly she had believed robert when he had promised her that if she played her part well he would not harm her daughter he had been true to his word disappearing as if from the face of the earth after he had left her and francie in the sleazy motel room off highway just outside marine on st croix minnesota again she asked herself now if he had somehow enchanted her with a mounting sense of horror she recalled all too clearly her desire could feel now though he must be very far away the weight of him his heat like an intensely erotic charge the scent of him rising no i cannot think the unthinkable involuntarily she put her hands on her sex felt the wetness there and knew what sin lay like a stone in her soul with an effort she wrenched her mind away trying to concentrate solely on dominic but what was it about robert what had he taken from her and what had he given her in return dominic the one man in her life who had believed in her who had seen beyond her femaleness to the mind that she possessed had used her in secret and seclusion like a nun behind the ivied walls of her cloister these men are all like children she thought playing at being pope do they know theyre living in the real world beside her tony decamillo slept heavily little grunting snores escaping from him in spurts she felt as detached from him as if he were in london she had never known how much she despised him until dominic had hit upon his complex and audacious plan to use tony as his successor the idea of being a family capo had immediately gone to tonys head was it so surprising he had an aptitude for influence the hollywood mentality a legacy from his show business clients power was the only commodity worth a damn in the film business and tony had had plenty of experience amassing it for himself when dominic had opened the door to a whole new world tony had been only too delighted to step in except that he had no concept of what that world actually entailed only she and dominic knew dominic had told him that she would be the conduit between the two tonys involvement with dominic even social had to be kept to a minimum because of the nature of tonys law practice then dom was murdered margarite remembered the moment when she was forced to tell tony how it was going to be from now on that his power and influence were only an illusion it was all too possible she realized in retrospect to have predicted how he would react that sicilian thing came to the fore his rage had been towering and he had struck her so often that she ceased to feel his blows save as a form of numbing pressure that pinned her to the wall of their bedroom she bit her lip how much of that had francie heard did it matter all or half it would have the same effect on the girl an effect margarite seemed incapable of reversing why did dominic make me his sole confidant she asked herself her intense pride in their special and secretive relationship all too often warred with the crushing responsibility that was his legacy she felt a brief moment of despair an emotion with which the old margarite was all too familiar then robert rose in her mind like the breath of the sea lying now in her bed listening to the night and to the film playing in her mind margarite knew that she had crossed some kind of rubicon somehow everything was different when she had returned home now she heard roberts voice whispering in her mind and what else have i given you margarite now you know you have the strength of purpose to do anything like it or not he is the source of these profound changes margarite thought know he took something from me and i hate him for that but oh god what is this thing he has left me in return suddenly as if he were a genie uncorked from a bottle her mind was filled with him and through the water of her unconscious she saw the stone her sin lying at the bottom of her soul it was as if he was there lying beside her and she trembled with some unknown emotion she knew now that he had given her the strength to continue with tony along the path of their new future because there was more and she turned her mind away from the knowledge for as long as she could but in the end it came flooding back but for this moment at least the new emerging margarite possessed the strength to shoulder the full weight of her brothers legacy because of robert with a soft moan she surrendered to the thought that she wanted to see him again four vietnam summer truth to tell do duc never knew his father he surmised from what he picked up around the house that his father had been japanese but he never got this confirmed from his mother or anyone else she would never speak of his birth or the germination of it at all as if by this willful ignorance she could pretend it had never occurred he imagined that the man who was his father was japanese because all the other alternatives were worse the house was the compound in saigon where do ducs mother worked it was owned by a onearmed frenchman it was contained by palegreen stucco walls this rambling horseshoeshaped villa of sloping tiled roofs and lush inner courtyards around the villa were kaleidoscopic gardens full of bougainvillea vines and rustling tamarind trees which do duc sweated endless hours to keep pruned to the frenchmans exacting specifications encysted within it was a cutstone patio floating an asymmetrical pool the shape of which reminded do duc of a water buffalos head there was something about the pool that do duc loved in the short hours he had for sleep he would creep off his pallet slip naked into the clear water and push himself to the bottom there he would cling sealed in this soundless world his head cocked back staring upward at nothing thinking about nothing and whatever had filled him preventing sleep drained away into the nothingness here in the frenchmans compound the thrumming diesel clangor of saigon and especially the war itself could be kept at the distance of memory only the reflections of jets momentary as dreams rippling in the cool cerulean water of the pool articulated the harsh reality outside the stucco walls do ducs earliest memories of the frenchman were wholly spurious a gentle man religious in his own way because he sang the nunc dimittis simeons prayer every evening and taught it to do duc much as a father would teach a nursery rhyme to his child lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word to induce do duc to sing along with him the words were unfamiliar and difficult for him to pronounce the frenchman fed him sweets a recipe of his own concoction that was dark and rich tasting of honey cinnamon and cloves but that was long ago when do duc was five the age at which the frenchman deemed him old enough to be put to work when he was very young do duc was certain that the frenchman was printing up money in his basement so much of it was there constantly changing hands later he came to understand that the frenchman was in the business of weapons and dope if not directly sanctioned by uncle sugar the local cynical nickname for the us government then at least tolerated by this enigmatic godlike entity which overstrode life in wartime saigon like a titan from the clouds often half drunk on medoc he would order do duc to inventory his war materiel once a supplier disgruntled at the frenchmans resolve to keep his costs low had left a live grenade wired to the inside of one of the crates of kfifties he sold him in those days the frenchman dogmatic on matters of security had done all the inventorying himself that was how he had lost his arm now he ordered natives to do that work do duc discovered that he was the third young vietnamese to hold this job later still when he acting as houseboyslave at one of the frenchmans astonishingly extravagant parties was told by a pair of giddy swedes how his mother had been used at these parties years ago before time had etched her face and bent her frame he experienced the auras for the first time stoned on a combination of champagne and the peculiar opiumlaced marijuana the frenchman favored they related to do duc with the kind of raucous vivacity that could not be faked certain events that had taken place twelve years before his mother who was serving them their particular brand of poison stood stoically through the recital her eyes focused on nothing as opaque as the clouds in the night sky that blotted out the horned moon do duc could not make up his mind whether they were waxing callously nostaigic or being deliberately sadistichow could they not know who he was that this was his mother they were giggling over but then caucasians had this disturbing propensity for seeing asians as just another part of the exotic landscape along with the nipa palms rice paddies and mangrove swamps as to the auras this strange incandescence he saw emanating from people seemed to signify like stigmata upon the flesh the depth of the change he himself was undergoing it was as if he were able to peel back the layers of rational behavior civilization had impressed upon people divining in their auras their purely primitive essence the auras became for him a kind of trigger and eventually he came to believe that the release of his profound rage was akin to a state of grace in that moment following the onset of the auras the purity of purpose that moved him to action was of the utmost relief after the knots of conflicting emotions he carried upon his back like the bones of the dead this was how do duc viewed the frenchman he was someone who had given his mother life after the man she had loved had been killed by the military for daring to speak his mind for the good of his people whatever schooled intelligence she had possessed whatever stature she had once had had perished with the man she had loved but this fall from grace was fatal unlike most of her brethren she had an inkling of what might have been now she could only stare dulleyed like a cat at nothing while she leaned her heavy head against the side of the refrigerator life even for her now meant a few piasters a pallet on which to sleep and even from time to time the benevolence of the frenchmans protection for he was an exceedingly powerful man even in the corrupt and treacherous waters of saigon at the same time the frenchman treated her with the kind of contempt normally reserved for a diseaseridden cur he did not see how he demeaned her stripped her of all dignity was pleased in fact by his benevolence his one significant act in keeping this vietnamese woman from becoming a whore grubbing in some filthy back alley until she died of consumption or addiction instead she became a whore in his house and renowned she was for services to all nations whose representatives came and went beneath the frenchmans roof life do duc often thought what life she was expected to be on call for the gluttony in all things of the frenchmans many guests he was particularly proud of his reputation for hospitality his bit he said laughing for offsetting the constant bad press given his fellow countrymen back home and yet without the frenchman as guardian angel his mother would have had nothing would have been used up by the street died old before her time and what of do duc there would have been none he owed his very existence humiliating and shameful beyond words to this man owed him in fact for everything that had any meaning for him and yet the frenchmans aura as it happened was different from that of the others it was a sharp blue almost metallic and much later upon reflection on many such incidents do duc was to understand that this color signified the mans close proximity to death gangrape do duc said as he took the bread knife to the frenchmans sundried flesh the party like a sun that had waxed too bright had burned itself out all the guests were gone or insensate in drugged slumber they told me everyone grouped around counting how many men could penetrate her before she passed out the knife flashing like a cormorant in the sun as it rose and fell in a terrible rhythm this is what you have done to my mother blood on the frenchmans hands first startling as a spilled bottle of his best wine this is my birth a humiliating party anecdote then in a great spurt do ducs own hands were hot and sticky do you understand my mothers shame she cannot even bring herself to speak of my birth his thin cotton shirt was wet and heavy with blood no you cannot what can you know of shame the frenchmans eyes were wide and staring muddy with an incomprehension as to what was happening his life leaking out through the proliferating wounds as do duc stabbed him again and again each time she looks at me she remembers all over again what she is what you have made her become the frenchmans mouth gaped wide she knows how mean and bitter life is because this was your gift to her he put his bloody hand out it opened and closed on nothing spastic as a machinegun on rock n roll to her you are the word more than god or buddha because these are indifferent entities but you are here flesh and blood the man who made the world the frenchman had slipped to his knees and now swayed this way and that in a rhythm dictated by do ducs attack finding his voice was difficult through the blood bubbling in his throat i did nothing that you i saved her incredulous still at the end not even dissembling but frighteningly still righteous and this innocence served only to enrage do duc all the more although later when the auras died it would haunt him confusing him in a labyrinth of complex adult emotions for which he was wholly unprepared because the frenchman was entirely sincere you saved her for this misery and degradation she would never touch you never even think ill of you in her heart because that is her way but not me i am different different different lord now lettest thou thy servant depart doc due slit his throat unable or unwilling to allow this last obscenity the word peace in the nunc dimittis to be uttered here in the peaceful isolation of a luxe fantasy that contemptuously denied the poverty and suffering at large in every quarter the frenchmans last words were curdled in blood and bile slurred by the inexpressible runes of death but distinct enough to be forged into do ducs soul there are no evil thoughts the frenchman vomited only evil deeds this last exhortation must have taken everything he had left because his eyes rolled up and he collapsed one leg jerking fitfully in galvanic response then his sphincter gave way leaving a final epitaph do duc found particularly fitting do duc fled saigon fearing for his life he knew how powerful the frenchman was and he understood that he was obliged to bury himself in order to remain among the living what he wanted most then was to fight to climb into the cockpit of one of those jets he had for years seen only in reflection or at a far distance he hated the communists as much as he hated the french and the americans more even because the communists were his own people and they should know better than to turn on their own what madness gripped them to try to commit genocide to expunge their own unique history was as yet beyond him to comprehend all he knew for certain was that they were like a pack of rabid beasts who were best exterminated with all due dispatch however joining the arvn the south vietnamese army at just this point might prove dangerous as those looking for him might understandably search through the dossiers of recent recruits instead he went into the mountains and changed his life forever at that time the mountains were no place for a twelveyearold boy there the ragtag hilltribe montagnards were forming there the viet cong were massing there blood was being spilled every minute of the day and night but to do duc it still felt less dangerous than the life he had led in the frenchmans walled compound in saigon but there were others in the mountains urged on by the communists and the war who had crept southward from their home in the highlands of north vietnam these were the nungs a wild almost aboriginal people of chinese descent who possessed their own primitive outlook on the world their own ancient ways of preserving what was theirs even the fierce vc were afraid of the nungs keeping their distance shunning the areas where nung tribesmen were sighted in the mountains do duc heard wild rumors and exaggerations about the nungs that they were disposed toward magic that they wrapped themselves in the cured skins of their enemies while crouched before fires eating their roasted flesh far from frightening him these tales merely aroused do ducs curiosity he was intrigued by any people who could terrify the communists in the frenchmans compound he had learned the only lesson worth remembering in asia that it wasnt money one sought in life it was power the nungs had power while do duc had none so he set out to find them the way he figured it ail he had to jose was his life which at this moment was just about worthless what he had to gain he felt was limitless it was the best decision he ever made and the worst the olddo duc whomever he may have been wasdissolved among the nungs and a new do duc was born resurrection would have been too simple a term but after the assimilation process he would often go off by himself climbing higher into the cliffs to look out into the deepening sapphire twilight and quite without knowing it sing to himself the nunc dimittis even after the old nung ao had examined him told him that he had once been addicted to opium do duc set aside a time each twilight to sing the prayer even after he worked out what must have been in the sweet the frenchman had fed him besides the honey cinnamon and cloves even as he wondered at the cynical method the frenchman had used to impart loyalty to his compound lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word the words still only dimly understood were of such comfort to him that he could not bear to forget them of course he had biological parents he had known his mother if only superficially but she had never wanted to know him because in his face she could see reflected all that her life would now never become the hymn of the nunc dimittis provided the only safety the only true warmth he had ever known impossible to expunge that from his psyche even after the training the nungs gave him began they liked that he was an outlaw the nungs the first night after he had come upon them just over a high ridgetop they laughed at his tale clapped him on the back and spit in the dust to show their pleasure at what he had done all except ao the eldest man and most respected of the tribe he crouched still and indrawn his odd ginger colored eyes all but closed as if do ducs words were rays of light that might blind him watching him as he spoke do duc caught the impression that ao was aware of his heartache the rage the bitterness the revulsion as well as buried below like a fish in the depths of a muddy lake the tenderness he felt for the man he had murdered after the others broke up going their own way in the cool mountain night he opened his eyes studied do duc alone by the fire a branch crackled a sudden crack appearing as it settled deeper into the flames people say strange things about the nungs do duc said suddenly shivering he put his hands on his bent knees almost a defensive gesture they say you roast the flesh of your enemies and eat it i prefer to eat my meat raw ao said he waited what seemed a long time to break into raucous laughter when his face had settled into its former pattern of lines and depressions he said you are safe with us younger brother this was how ao the stoic opened his psychic arms to do duc gathering him into the dark he was an unusually big man with a commanding presence he knew all the mysteries and he knew the ways of the caucasian as well for example he knew how to break down an american m machinegun clean it and put it back together again all in the dark he knew the grades of plastique how to use a white phosphorus mortar and a cs gas grenade he was conversant with the principles of aviation one night he took do duc down the mountain into the greenandblackstriped jungle it was so wet and dense it was like gliding underwater do duc noticed that ao though old made no sound at all he seemed to be following some kind of trail but try as he might do duc could discern nothing not even an occasional notch in a tree trunk that might be construed as a path they continued this way wending their way through the night utter darkness engulfed them so that do duc traveling singlefile behind ao was obliged to put his hand on the old mans shoulder so as not to become lost all around him were the night chitterings and cries of the jungle the rank smells of moss and decomposing vegetation were as strong as freshly brewed black tea from the iron mountains of china great whirring insects brushed do ducs cheeks and arms and once he heard the muffled growl of a great predator the level ground changed sloping steadily downward and at last his eyes could begin to see the wash of pale moonlight drifting down through the jungles canopy as it began to thin ao stopped and crouching down wordlessly pointed straight ahead at first do duc could see nothing then the wind changed direction and he heard like temple bells the deep musical tones of slowly flowing water the sounds directed him and he began to make out the bank on which they crouched and just beyond a mountain stream he heard a sudden splash and saw a great bulk sliding slowly into the water ao made a peculiar noise in the back of his throat which made the hair at the back of do ducs neck stir the bulk lifted its head and do duc saw the furred head of a black leopard he had heard stories about such beasts rare as they were but no one he knew had ever seen one they were said to possess magical powers that turned the orange stripes of their pelt black as if singed by the force inside them ao made the sound again and do duc shivered slowly the black leopard turned came toward them do duc felt a rippling of his muscles a firing of his nerves over which he had no control his headseemed to have developed a tremor so that the beast as it approached went in and out of focus he was so frightened he could feel a chill come over him as his blood drained from his extremities pooling sickeningly in the pit of his stomach the black leopard emerged from the water it was now dose enough to be able to swat do duc down with one blow of its massive forepaw its body was perhaps eleven feet long and its thick tail flicking this way and that added another three feet do duc could smell it heavy musky an odor of power and of death his mouth was so dry his tongue clove to the roof and would not move the beast stared at them unmoving breathing in deep purring sighs ao pressedone hand flat against do ducs shoulder indicating that he should not move then suddenly terrifyingly he was gone back into the jungle the black leopards bulk was like a planet its great chest billowed out and deflated its huge golden eyes regarded do duc with a peculiar kind of intelligence but for all this it appeared slightly myopic an american army colonel who was a frequent visitor at the frenchmans villa had told do duc that leopards could not see or hear well that they relied most heavily on scent the beast blinked and do duc started despite his best efforts the black leopard growled low in its throat and its head lowered do duc felt as if his bowels had turned to water he had to urinate in the worst way ao returned holding his left arm straight out in front of him as he crouched down do duc saw the curl of a venomous krait wrapped around his forearm ao had its triangular head pinched between thumb and forefinger he swung his arm out toward the black leopard an offering of some kind and do duc saw the beasts nostrils flare as it caught the scent of the viper when it moved its head it did so with appalling speed do duc doubted whether even ao could have gotten out of the way at such close quarters the great jaws gaped wide engulfing both krait and aos arm a moment later ao pulled his arm out the krait was no longer wrapped around it the small sounds of the black leopard eating was all that could be heard for a time then the beast gave a little snuffle and ao made that eerie sound in the back of his throat he put his hands on do ducs shoulders thrusting him forward down the embankment toward the great beast those baleful eyes regarded do duc with that same myopic intelligence as he came near it urine trickled down do ducs leg and the black leopard snuffled again more interested now in the smell of him he could feel the heat of the beast emanating from it in waves the animal musk surged upward into his nostrils so that he felt abruptly dizzy behind the black leopard moonlight veined the water turning it into lapis lazuli on which do duc imagined it would be possible to walk he turned his attention back to the beast and blinked rapidly in outright astonishment the black leopard no longer crouched before him instead he saw a slender woman with an exquisite face thick black hair so long it ran in rivulets like the moonlit river behind her she was in all aspects human in appearance except that her long fingers were the gnarled roots of a tree and when she shifted her body do duc could see that from the waist down she was a skeleton no skin no flesh at all bones only glowing palely in the fitful moonlight who what are you do duc could not help himself he had to ask the question dont you recognize me the exquisite woman said she regarded him from out of golden eyes i am your mother do ducs heart was pounding so hard in his chest he felt as if it had been he not the beast who had swallowed the krait impossible he scoffed in a voice thick with terror my mother is much older than you no the exquisite woman said i am dead what the frenchmans friends killed me because i would not tell them where you had fled but you did not know do duc exclaimed you could not and yet in my heart i knew she said there was only one place left for you to go you who should never have been born whose life had been a terrible mistake in order to live you must die and be reborn your first life was a misunderstanding now you have a chance at a second he knew who she was now and that she appeared to him as she had once been young and exquisite and now he could understand how they could all desire her if only for one night those travelers in the night who congregated like magpies beneath the frenchmans roof mother he said an unaccustomed wetness in his eyes he had never once before this shed a tear for her or for anyone do not call me that i was never such to you she said sadly i was wicked never finding the compassion inside myself to love you you were pariah to me the frenchman no doubt loved you more than i her head lowered and her dark hair cascaded over her silvery face it is good i am dead i prayed to buddha daily to let me feel the love i should have for you but my prayers were never answered my heart was already shriveled a dead lump beneath my breast mother this was not of your doing her head snapped up the cascade of hair falling from her face her eyes blazed pale fire and the grimace she made contained within it the heart of the black leopard baring its yellow teeth for the kill no of course this is true she whispered fiercely i am asia spreading my legs compliantly to be raped by the french the russians the chinese the americans they have used us so carelessly enslaved us to opium turned us into water buffaloes to do their labor and finally we are as mad as a rabid dog turning on itself chewing its own leg off in its insanity she drew up her skeletonlike fingers clawing the air and i am mad too so insane that i lacked the capacity to love that which i should have cherished you are my blood do duc and i looked on you as they look on us she shook her head no do not waste your time mourning for me i have my karma and i embrace it now i am a part of the destruction of asia it may be horrible but it is at least something but i have killed you he cried because of mei the exquisite face shone i would not tell them where you went i kept your secret do duc didnt you think i knew what the consequences would be yes yes i did it willingly and it felt good to defy them at last oh she gave a sigh this was the only meaningful act in my life at the end i found that my heart was still beating beating for you the golden eyes caught him in their web now is your time my son make the most of it a cloud must have ridden across the sky because the moonlight faded the darkness shifted and blinking do duc found himself facetoface with the black leopard dizzy again with its musk his eyes closed for a moment and when he opened them again the beast had clambered down into the water was swimming swiftly downstream away from them he lowered his head and wept uncontrollably never before this had he been touched by love and now here it was so painful that he resolved never to allow it to touch him again the hand on his shoulder was firm and steadying yes younger brother ao whispered in his ear harden your heart until it is like unto a stone in your breast for your path is as treacherous as it is arduous do duc crouched on the steaming bank of the mountain stream felt these words rather than heard them and they filled that nothingness inside of him the emptiness that back where he had once lived he had exulted to feel at the cool silent bottom of the frenchmans pool when at length he raised his head it was that peculiar hour just before the first dawnlight when the world is devoid of color etched with the grays of mist and nights last strands of shadow we have been here all night time is unimportant now ao said forget time what happened do duc turned to face the old man the black leopard the krait the ghost of my mother was it all a dream aos lips curled into a sardonic smile it is ngohmeihyuht the crescent moon he said now listen to me and i will tell you about the paau dance in the old days when the civilization of the nung was at its height certain of our citystates revered the leopard the nung called the animal paau and believed that it was a deity but there were those who coveted the power of the gods and so set about capturing the paau this they did with rare courage and cool cunning trapping it in a camouflaged pit of their own devising ao had a way of speaking that was almost hypnotic as if by his voice alone he could conjure magic out of the very atmosphere first they broke the beasts legs so that it could not flee even their evil had its limits and they would not dare cage it and risk the wrath of the gods but in breaking its bones they were assured that its soul would remain intact inside it and would eventually become a part of them in the unbroken bones of man and animal alike reside the remnants of the soul from which a new life may be reconstituted by the proper rituals and prayers next they fed it the living flesh of their enemies to make it strong and increase its divine power after nine days they slit the breast of the leopard prying apart its ribcage in order to remove its still beating heart they ate this organ and naked wrapped themselves in the open eviscerated body of the paau as if they could absorb its blood it was said the ghastly cloak trembled as it clung to their bare shoulders this was the paau dance the predawn mist steamed from the bank obscuring the stream even its sound disappeared into the opalescent atmosphere so that they could have been anywhere hanging suspended in time they became united in this grotesque ritual these men and their power whether real or imagined grew their enemies were invariably found naked with their digits broken and turned backwards so that they could no longer hold onto their own power and their feet could not function to make their escape aos ginger eyes seemed to take on a peculiar cast and most important of all their hearts had been ripped from their chests and sewn to their navels so that their souls could not emerge at the moment of death his head swung away for a moment and it appeared to do duc as if he stared through the walls of mist to another place another time the paau dance he said the gateway to power and more power this is what i will teach you because it is why you have come to me from the lowlands he lifted a hand now you must take a creature to represent you to be your spirit familiar choose do duc said the first thing that came into his mind i want the white magpie the white magpie ao turned his head in do ducs direction and do duc could feel the heat in his eyes are you certain do duc nodded oddly he was certain for the first time in his life aos expression was grave you have spoken let it be so your familiar shall be the white magpie aos words seemed to penetrate do ducs flesh like a flurry of darts making him twitch with momentary pain aos eyes were like black stones at the bottom of the river smooth and unknowable he hesitated but a moment it is donel you will become ngohmeihyuht and by ngohmeihyuht alone can you be tracked down what does this mean do duc whispered a sardonic smile curled aos lips you will become another person does this frighten you no good for yours will be a thirsty soul soon very soon food and drink will no longer be of interest to you what will sustain me that will depend ao said gravely on what remains after you become ngohmeihyuht but i will be mortal ao did not answer him at once at length he said if you are delivered a mortal wound then yes you may die in that sense you will be mortal but you will be ngohmeihyuht and your body will possess remarkable recuperative and regenerative capabilities i will be close to immortality aos eyes were hooded in the end that will be for you to determine now he was aware that ao was studying him with keen attention the old man held one hand out between them palm up a bird called shrilly its voice echoing through the jungle against the walls of mist with an eerie tone ao was waiting for do duc to slide his hand over his when do duc did he felt aos grip all through his body and when ao spoke it was already as if through a different kind of veil or mist are you ready to continue your journey from one world to another do duc opened his mouth to speak but ao was nodding as if already aware of the response forming in his mind five venice tokyo new york nicholas was awakened by the deep rumble of boats on the grand canal he opened his eyes into darkness he looked at his watch it was not yet dawn but as he padded across the room he could already see a thin strand of notquitedarkness making its way between the wooden shutters he threw them open to find a pale light of a color he could neither describe nor name staining the marble facades of the palazzi along the no in the water was the reflection of a sea bird all too soon gone from sight it left cool and distinct the sight of the santa maria della salute he went into the bathroomrelieved himself splashed cold water on his face dressed and went out of his room he had no idea where he was going he only knew that he must walk the streets breathe the air feel the city on his skin like clothofgold he pulled the collar of his jacket up around his cheeks as the first bite of the wind off the rio struck him then he went out of the small square down a ruga a street with shops no one was around at this early hour and most shops were still dosed his nose led him toward a small bakery where he purchased a cup of coffee and a delicious hard roll which he munched on delightedly as he crossed over a small bridge that led to the piazza san marco he paused for a moment as he liked to do at the apex of the bridges arc looking down the rio at the play of light off the silken water commercial boats lay tied up bobbing slightly patiently awaiting their owners upon whose doorsteps they floated he passed over two more bridges without seeing a soul then went beneath the arch that led to the piazza ahead of him rose the doges palace and to his left the belltower which still struck the hours as it had for decades the vast space bordered on either side by arcaded shops and gates with their outdoor setups seemed so private at this hour it was as if he had entered the drawingroom of the gods he walked out onto the cobbles and soon enough he heard the cooing of the wellfed pigeons that flocked to the floods of tourists who would begin to appear some hours before lunchtime all at once nicholas heard a voice raised in song he listened transfixed as he heard nessun dorma prince calaf s beautiful aria from giacomo puccinis turandot no man shall sleep the tenor sang and coming toward him nicholas saw a streetsweeper pulling his wheeled garbage can behind him his thickbristled brush pushed rhythmically ahead of him his head was thrown back as he sang and nicholas hearing this aria in the sublime amphitheater of the doges of venice felt that no matter what troubles he had left behind him in tokyo no matter what dangers he was about to face on this morning at this hour it was good to be alive he saluted the de jure opera singer as he passed him and the burly man smiled without missing a beat moving on his passionate voice resounding through the piazza nicholas turned the corner walking through the piazzetta toward the wharf and the grand canal the first colors of dawn had risen from the bosom of the ocean to stain the sky and the buildings along the water the same hue so that there seemed no distinction at all between sea and land the quay actually the riva degli schiavoni was beginning to fill with schoolchildren climbing onto vaporetti bound for morning classes their highpitched voices rang across the piazzette as they ran to buy their tickets and climb on board there they laughed and shoved each other filling the narrow outside decks of the boats while bleary eyed workers inside the cabins buried their heads in local papers there were few people about the tourists were probably only now rolling out of bed to order their croissants and cappuccinos he strolled toward the traghetti where the vaporetti pulled in and departed to his right was the statue of saint theodore to his left the famous winged lion it seemed altogether fitting to him that the doges of venice should have chosen a mythical animal to represent their city popping the last of the roll into his mouth and finishing off his coffee he reflected that the longer he was here the more he understood how venice was a true modernday citystate the people here might be italians by nationality but there it ended many areas within a country had their own argot such as the venetians did but none thought differently as the venetians did their way of life was unique unto themselves and nicholas found himself responding to that iconoclasm on the deepest level as he came closer to the statue of the winged lion he saw a young woman in a short furcollared jacket sitting on its base the first wave of schoolchildren had been swept off along the grand canal and for the time being at least the broad arc of the riva was deserted the woman was quite striking she had one of those longnosed widemouthed mediterranean faces that was just as much phoenician as it was roman thick red hair drawn back off her face her skin the color of a north african desert as he drew abreast of her nicholas saw that her deepset eyes were the color of aquamarines her cameo face far from being perfect or even symmetrical nevertheless possessed a kind of breathless ardor as if it were the result of an enchantment she sat with her knees drawn up her elbows on them she was holding a chocolatefilled pastry which she was eating with evident delight she looked up as nicholass shadow fell briefly across her the sunlight firing the translucent blue of her eyes her smile told him who she was there were tiny smudges of chocolate at the corners of her mouth would you mind moving ive been enjoying this view she spoke in english but there was the hint of an accent that led him to believe it was not her primary language nicholas sat down beside her ive been waiting for you she said not for too long i hope nicholas said its a pleasant surprise to see you without your mask she bit into her pastry her smile broadening as she chewed all hallows eve is past she said in the daylight we can all be ourselves once again even mikio okami she gave him a sharp glance okamisan is under unbelievable pressure this life would surely have killed lesser men by now nicholas said nothing he rubbed his hands together to rid them of the earlymorning chill you will help him what was he doing in partnership with dominic goldoni americas most powerful mafia don trying to save himself celeste said then she added do you know anything about goldoni other than that he was mafia what more is there to know she gave him a sad smile for one thing goldoni was halfvenetian that made him unique among the capi of the siciliandominated mafia for another he had a vision that went beyond anything the mafia ever dreamed of he saw that the days of sam giancana and the others like him were numbered and he did his planning for a new era his contacts in america were crucial for okamisan to implement his plan to stifle the godaishu her clear eyes regarded him does this mean you wont help okamisan nicholas was aware of the concern in her voice tell me he said do you know the identity of okamis nemesis who has forged the link between the yakuza and the mafia no celeste said i wish i did what could his power be his hold on all these other powerful men celeste was silent so long that nicholas felt compelled to change the subject what is okamisan to you employer fatherfigure lover all three perhaps celeste laughed how full of pride okamisan would be if he heard you say that do you know he is over ninety i didnt um hmm well hes been here in venice a long time now and even before he moved here hes had ah ties to some of the important venetian families i take it yours would be one of those my father gave his life for okamisan she wiped her hands on a piece of paper i imagine that sounds odd to you and perhaps a little bizarre not at all nicholas said im halfeastern i understand the meaning of debt yes of course she turned her head away stared out at the sdn rising over the lagoon to their right across the grand canal the santa maria della salute glowed in the shellpink light and above them the wings of the venetian lion seemed afire my people or some of them at least came from carthage she said after a time they were seafarers but also philosophers and it has been said great scientists their home was burned their city razed so they set out on the only friend they had left the sea and at last they found themselves here in venice her head swung round and she looked him full in the face these are stories my grandfather used to tell he swore they were true just as he swore he knew where the boat they came in was buried beneath the palazzo you were in last night that was your house it is okamisans now celeste said without a trace of melancholy or bitterness i live elsewhere now away from the grand canal where it is more secluded and the rest of your family okamisan bought my mother her own apartment one she could take care of on her own as for my sister she no longer lives in venice she turned her head a little and the sunlight struck the bridge of her nose so that he could imagine her at the bow of an ancient ship setting sail irom carthage across the mediterranean heading for this sheltered place that would become venezia i suppose in light of venetian history my familys fate is not so atypical here we have learned to be adaptable to the times to fate and most importantly to politics my fathers business was fabrics fortuny velvets laces silks and the like my grandfather invented a specific process for creating a certain kind of moire brocade that is still ours alone okamisans people came from osaka and were once also in the dry goods business he and my father understood each other right away both were honorable both were pragmatic my fathers family was very eastern and he could see why okamisan would want to buy his company in the end they worked out a partnership so the partnership was strictly legitimate a perfect cover for okami being here in venice i am concerned only with what okamisan has done for my family he could tell that she did not care for his tone of voice softly she said please answer my question will you help him hethought back to last night when okami had told him that his life was in danger here are the problems he had said to okami there is the question of identity we dont know who will be sent to kill you there is the question of time we must assume that we have very little of it under these extreme conditions our options are severely limited it will do no good to send you to ground because you need to continue to work and you cannot do that in hiding it will do no good to guard you day and night because whoever is sent will have the advantage of setting the time if not the place and i will be at a disadvantage in these desperate circumstances i cannot afford any disadvantage i am already at a disadvantage because i have no idea who im up against okami had looked at him bleakly what you re saying then is that we are checkmated not at all what i am saying is that extreme circumstances require extreme measures he had suddenly felt cold as if a wind had swept through the palazzo in order to help you i am going to have to become a magnet magnet yes call it a human shield what i want to do is redirect the assassins attention from you to me i will do what i can nicholas said now yes i know celeste nodded okamisan and i discussed it at length last night after you left but i wanted to hear it from you to be certain she looked out to sea for a moment i need to tell you about the three men of the kaishos inner council because one of them has ordered okamisans death the man okami says is behind the rise of the godaishu as an international criminal organization celeste nodded the inner council consists of the oyabun who command japans three major yakuza families tetsuo akinaga akira chosa tomoo kozo she showed him photos of each of them all of these men must be considered guilty until you can prove them innocent i urge you not to trust any of them one has betrayed okamisan and all he has worked for he stared at the photos committing them to memory then he looked at her okamisan is not your lover but he is very special to you before you said the pressure he was under would kill a lesser man thats right and yet he is ninety she rose abruptly lets walk im cold she tucked her hand in her jacket pocket as they headed off down the ma pigeons rose and fell in concert like the wing of a gigantic avian and hawkers offering free rides to the island of murano for an obligatory tour through the glassblowing factories raised their voices over the heavy thrum of the boats pigeons crying for food swept low overhead their wjngbeats strong on the cool air now i will tell you what not even the men of the inner council know a secret about the kaisho he possesses koryoku koryoku the word burned itself across his mind mikio okami has the illuminating power its what has allowed him to survive all these years celeste said it answers many questions doesnt it over ninety and with the strength and will of a fiftyyearold nicholass heartbeat throttled up and he had to slow his breathing but his mind was racing forward koryoku the nexus the doorway into shuken if okami did indeed possess the illuminating power he would be able to tell nicholas whether it was possible for him to attain koryoku his dream of finding the lost secret of his ancient race the combining of akshara and kshira light and dark the two sundered hemispheres of tautau might at last be within reach if he could keep okami safe ive startled you at last celeste said tm afraid you have she turned her head gave him a quick sharp look he doesnt want you to do it to put yourself in the line of fire its too late for that but what do you mean i agree with him keep walking but pick up your pace a bit nicholas said he guided her away from the riva into a side street the hour was late enough for more stores to be open and there was what might be described as a crush of people hurrying to work somehow this struck nicholas as somewhat odd and a bit amusing it was difficult to believe that anyone actually worked in this city of marvels but of course beneath the treasures venice was still a city although hardly a mundane one neither okami nor i have a choice now he said were both committed to this path you must accept what happens karma this is your fate he heard the cynical edge to her voice listen celeste if you dont believe in karma it doesnt exist like giri she liked the surprised look that sprang to his face yes i know about obligation a debt that can never adequately be repaid seeing a small bakery he pulled her in where they stood in front of glass cases staring at the breads and small cakes fresh from the oven are you hungry we just ate id like to know if were alone in this part of the city celeste watched him as he glanced in the mirror along the wall behind the clerk a middleaged woman with rosy cheeks and a cheery word for all her regular morning customers what have you seen maybe nothing nicholas said as the woman came over he pointed at a huge flat loaf of bread filled with black olives and fresh rosemary he indicated the size of the slices she should sell him but his eyes were constantly flicking upward to the mirror maybe something has it begun was that fear or excitement firing her face he dug in his pocket for some lire took the white paper bag and his change from the woman and headed for the door til leave you here wait five minutes then head back to the riva no she said im going with you youre not involved in this oh but i am remember giri i owe okamisan besides whoever is coming for him must already know about me ill no doubt be safer with you nicholas had no ready counter for that argument he did not think she was the type to hide out at her mothers house until this blew over he decided to say nothing but he knew he would need to alter his plans slightly now that he would not be alone back on the street they headed away from the grand canal the narrow streets were periodically filled with people then almost deserted as these clumps of humanity dispersed at a crosscorner or a bridge all the while nicholas used the plate glass of store and restaurant windows to scan the street immediately behind them what do you see celeste asked right now its not what i see that bothers me nicholas told her its what i feel someone definitely has us under surveillance they went over a bridge then turned left into another street so it has begun she said what do we do now we let whoever it is continue to follow us why because he said the longer they have to shadow us the better our chances are of spotting them and thats what i really want to do he gave her hand a squeeze are you up for looking your enemy in the face she gave him a small smile under the circumstances id like nothing better got a break lillehammer made his way haltingly down the aisle of the air force jet holding several fax sheets in his fist his face was alight with excitement its about the mutilated girl croaker said setting aside his cup of coffee and capping it so it wouldnt spill right lillehammer waved the faxes she had a bridge unusual dental work something about two adult teeth never coming in so she had a bridge put in when her milk teeth fell out some tooth fairy huh lillehammer grinned the spiderweb of pale scars waxing in his flesh outside the thick ovals of perspex dark cloudbanks shredded and reformed whirling upward at points in grand horsetails they had needed a bit of oxygen getting up above the storm blanketing central minnesota the plane was still shuddering in the aftermath of the major turbulence on the eastern edge of the front but pulling away from it now the work was so distinctive the computers dug out her name in no time flat virginia morris what computer croaker asked himself had such a vast databank and was so well coordinated it could orthodontid a victim in less than twelve hours none that he had used even the ones hed had limited access to on occasion at the fbi but maybe that was just because it had been a long time since hed needed access croaker was watching the storm streaming by below them while the frame of the jet vibrated slightly she the one with whom dominic violated the witsec rules looks that way shes from queens his old stomping grounds i spoke to the federal marshals handling his case and they had no record of her as authorized personnel he shook his head i reamed them out though dominic was always something with the women he couldnt keep it in his pants for long so he imported his mistress all the way to minnesota under witsecs nose howd he manage that lillehammer shrugged he commanded thousands it could have been any of them croaker looked away from the cloudstrewn sky i doubt it i know these guys they dont make a habit of getting their buttonmen involved in their personal affairs who knows what enemies could get wind of that kind of vulnerable spot you have an idea who helped him just considering your theory about an inside job what about it lillehammer cocked his head who else but someone inside could have given the murderer dominics whereabouts croaker shook his head i know you think someone inside the governments rotten but my instinct says theres another possibility and i want to follow it see goldoni was murdered at that house how did he get there was he snatched i doubt it he was too well watched besides if it was an inside job and they knew where he was theyd have just gone there but what if he deliberately slipped his handlers to go to a rendezvous it would be relatively easy tell his wife he was going to the store for more toilet tissue or a tbone steak then take a detour at the last minute its certainly possible lillehammer seemed intrigued but why would he do that it might be to meet someone croaker said who he trusted absolutely he looked at his watch if we divert the flight plan from washington to kennedy in new york what would our eta be let me check with the pilot lillehammer said reaching for the intercom when justine awoke in the queensized bed at the tokyo hilton the first thing she did was reach over for the man who had fallen asleep beside her finding only bedsheets her heart skipped a beat and for a moment she was suffused with a dull leaden ache familiar as hunger then she picked her head off the pillow and heard him in the bathroom urinating there was a kind of comfort in that purely male sound the hard splash against porcelain rick he appeared in the doorway to the bathroom naked and grinning finally up good i hope youre hungry im about to order breakfast justine sat up and stretched she was aware of his eyes on her greedy and lustful do you know what that does for my id she laughed your id seems to be preceding you into the bedroom she opened her arms to him as he took a leap landed against her he arched over her she looked up into his face what about breakfast i dont know about you but im a lot less hungry than i was before you woke up later after they had showered and dressed they went down to the restaurant he ordered bacon and eggs a side of potatoes a large orange juice coffee and toast justine could not help but laugh he was so american delighted and famished she said she would have the same the juice and coffee came almost immediately he took his coffee black while she was adding cream and sugar to hers he said if you havent changed your mind when can you come back to new york justine looked across the table took his hand in hers i havent changed my mind when do you want me now he said pressing the back of her hand against his lips ive waited too long to wait any longer justine smiled at him caught up in his open enthusiasm all right but ill need a day to pack why is there anything here you really need or want to take with you the food came giving her some time to contemplate what he had said rick asked for strawberry jam justine munched her bacon watching him spread his toast with butter and the jam at last she said thinking about it i guess there isnt anything here i cant live without he looked up i know what you mean starting over completely over she finished the slice of bacon i think id like that very much great he wiped his lips ill make the reservations right now she watched him walk away ask the maitre d for a house phone she could not stop studying his face she imagined herself in new york married to him back at her old job she felt a vitality rush through her a feeling that lor so long she had despaired of ever having again she was eager to return to work to reestablish herself to mount an assault that would regain her her old life her selfrespect that would give her an identity at that moment a waiter brought over a cordless phone mrs linnear he said call for you for an instant justine sat frozen terrified that somehow nicholas had found where she was staying through nangi perhaps a ball of ice sat in her stomach preventing her from breathing mrs linnear she nodded gave the waiter the semblance of a smile took the proffered phone hello justine its nangi good morning she said with some relief are you feeling better did your visit with millarsan go well yes very well justine said she was very conscious of how close tanzan nangi and nicholas were but nangi was not tanjian he had no special power to read her emotions especially through the telephone it was so good to see an old friend from the states i can well imagine nangi said tokyo is the hub of japan but i often find myself homesick for the town where i was born the feeling is natural thank you nangisan she said for your concern perhaps we can see each other soon his voice sounded melancholy i do not know how long nicholas will be away have you spoken to him the moment she said it she knew it was a mistake havent you called him nangi asked i asked itosan to leave his number with the concierge at the hotel had she received a message from nicholass hateful assistant justine could not remember she thought desperately which lie should she tell yes i got it i tried him several times with no luck its not surprising i expect he said i have been unable to reach him either well just have to keep trying yes we will call me any time justinesan i will nangisan thank you again she broke the connection with a profound sense of relief she really did not like lying to him but what other choice did she have when she put down the phone she saw that it was moist with her sweat rick returned a grin lighting up his face all set he said as he sat down opposite her we leave tonight that will give you just enough time to take me around the city like the tourist i am no justine said im sick to death of tokyo well take a ride into the country where its beautiful i have to return the car to the house anyway they ate in silence for some time and justine thought that she had not enjoyed a meal so much in a very long while over more coffee and another order of toast which rick slathered with more strawberry jam they spoke of their new life together where do you think youd rather live rick asked her manhattan or somewhere outside like long island justine considered this from what ive heard of manhattan these days id say definitely not there her eyes clouded for a moment but not the island either too many memories of the house she and nicholas had shared in west bay bridge what about connecticut good idea rick said sipping his coffee one of the firms veeps lives in darien and its beautiful up there he grinned we wont have to pay new york city taxes which will be a relief you dont mind giving up the apartment she recalled rick had a coop on fifth avenue he shook his head not a bit the truth is my exwife has been making my life miserable recently because she wants it he wiped his mouth god knows why she wants to live in manhattan these days youre better off wearing a fortyfive on your hip he shrugged anyway this will simplify my life considerably i can sell her the apartment and shell owe me big youre sure you dont mind giving it up rick laughed are you kidding i cant wait well go househunting the first weekend were home that sounded so good to justine she began to cry househunting in darien america home oh my god it was almost too good to be true rick took her hands in his leaned across the table kissed her tenderly on each eyelid tasting the saltiness of her tears no more pain darling he whispered i promise you his lips closed over hers and he felt her inarticulate cry echo through him tony margarite goldoni said as she entered their bedroom this sicilian thing is morte anthony decamillo newly anointed godfather for the goldoni family lay naked save for a small white nylon bikini beneath a sizzling sunlamp white plastic goggles over his eye sockets along with the bizarre shade of his flesh beneath the lamp made him seem to margarite like one of those cheap saints made of molded plastic which many new yorkers stuck on their dashboards a timer rang and he stirred as the uv light switched off he sat up removed the white plastic goggles he stared at her voluptuous figure clad in the clingy nightgown and began to get hard margarite its amazing you look better now than you did ten years ago have i told you that lately up until now youve had no reason to margarite said coming toward him she was massaging some of her own moisturizing cream into the skin of her hands tony grunted abruptly abandoning his attempt at a spurious reconciliation you know my brother told me id regret marrying a girl who wasnt sicilian your brothers an idiot margarite said flatly he sat forward quickly hey were talking family here watch your fucking mouth im sorry tony she sat on the bed next to him and wondered if he would flinch away she felt split off disassociated from herself part of her wanted desperately to undo the damage that had been done by her abduction to make herself clean again in her husbands eyes and all the while another less familiar part of her savored the loathing for him she had tasted when he had sent her and francie away to new hampshire we both know youre in trouble she said the leonfortes are going to come east and try to take away what was once dominics sole province if im in trouble its because of your fucking brother he said angrily he never had a formal consigliere he never confided in any of his lieutenants he never allowed anyone to get close to him he kept his own counsel the secrets he used as leverage to influence all his highpowered contacts in washington are history now tonys hands flew through the air describing complex arabesques mary mother how many times did i beg him to give those secrets to me for safekeeping if im to succeed you ive got to know everything id say you cant tie my hands like this he shook his head sad and angry at the same time i swear i loved him like a brother margarite but he was a damned stubborn man your brother he left me with ugatz and now im twisting in a fucking wind that stinks to high heaven of bad clams and his whole west coast machine you have me margarite said that madman brother of yours giving you all his secrets a fucking woman he threw his hands into the air its enough that ive had to sit through meetings with doms contacts knowing you were the one whod report to him whod make the decisions that came out of my mouth now i gotta live with the fact that dom gave you everything he got up began to dress throwing on a white shirt charcoal trousers he shook his head i dont mind telling you i got to hand it to the fucker that sonuvabitch caesare leonforte finally got his wish hes wanted dominic dead so bad hed probably incorporated it into his sunday prayers but im not gonna let him get away with it i know he hired that bastard who you think has us under his thumb im gonna you and i both know youre no match for caesare i think its time you gave up trying to hypnotize yourself into believing youre really the head of the family tony watched her for some time as he slid his belt through the waist loops im gonna tell you something babe i know youve had a shock especially since doms widow and kids have been spirited out of the country so the feds can keep them under lock and key i know its been tough them hanging onto the corpse and all and us making like doms body was actually in that goddamned coffin we buried yesterday she wondered if he was going to bring up the subject of robert actually had a bet with herself that after what had happened he wouldnt she won but for christs sake ever since you came back from that magical mystery tour to nowhere youve changed of course ive changed no he shook his head stepping into tasselled italian loafers you dont get it do you youre a different person altogether the margarite goldoni i married doesnt seem to exist any more your imaginations working overtime margarite said but she wondered as she heard another voice in her head and what else have i given you margarite now you know you have the strength of purpose to do anything she shivered but as much with anticipation now as dread you think so before this your own business has always been enough for you business is business tony ive proved ive got a good head for business he snorted well ill say this for you you were never a girl to keep a bun stuck in her oven tears sprang to her eyes bastard to bring up what i couldnt help i had three miscarriages trying to give you the son you wanted so badly the last one almost killed me tony shook his head maybe it was physical he said and maybe it was psychological too you never wanted to be tied down by kids look at our daughter having her never slowed you down did you ever think of staying home with her when she was little did you ever think of coming home at a decent hour to be with her thats different he shouted i worked my balls off to afford an estate of substance for you and her so i wouldnt be in your brothers debt and where do i end up living on his fucking estate with a daughter who doesnt even know how to say hello to me properly i see so its okay for you to absent yourself from the family because youre the man we wouldnt be having this conversation he screamed if i had a wife who knew what her priorities were regarding her child if she knew how to be a mother oh christ im so tired of you and your bullying he gave her a rude sicilian sign so leave she put her head down sobbing now i just might youre fucking full of shit margarites face went white and her head came up dont you talk to me like that you dont talk to any of your men friends that way thats because none of them are fucking women she tried to slap him and he caught her wrist slammed her back against the wall the pain came it was an all too familiar feeling he stood over her menacing im going to make sure that whatevers going on comes to an end he slipped his belt out from around his waist its been too long since i last gave you a lesson but the next moment he was staring down the barrel of a snubnosedcaliber pistol you goddamned sicilians only understand one thing she said struggling to her feet margarite and dont make the mistake of thinking i dont know how to use this what new emotion had she felt then rage no she had felt that before bottled up like a demon clamped tight against her soul what then she felt beneath the rage and the terror a kind of iron core she never believed she had a will coalescing from out of the nightmare maelstrom that had become her life she reached out and grasped it with the desperation of a swimmer exhausted past all limits a voice she only vaguely recognized said for so long ive been what is it ive been afraid of you afraid i say the word now and can hardly believe it you hit me and i took it silently bit my lip and said not a word not even to my brother because i was afraid tony was backing up as she advanced on him now come on babe chill out youve been under a tremendous strain with your brothers death and this man breaking into and not a kind word to me when i came home our baby in my arms no sympathy i saw the hatred tony you thought no no you knew he had raped me in your mind i had been soiled just by being with him you had that look on your face oh christ it crystallized everything inside me id refused to acknowledge it made me feel like a piece of babe he stopped as she brought the gun up she stayed far enough away from him so that he couldnt overpower her by sheer brute strength there was a strange light in her eyes which frightened him margarite youve made your point why dont you put that thing away before someone gets hurt no tony no more babe no more screaming at me no more beatings all of that is finished its a new world order because i have the power to kill you now i can pull this trigger just give me one more reason as if i dont have enough already thats how ive changed ive been given this power no its been restored to me my selfrespect you took it away tony and god help me i let you tony licked his lips his eyes flicking from the gun barrel to her face hey come on now i dont think youve really got a grip on whats happened to us over the past few days i know youre upset about the kid and the shock of doms you bastard i know whats really happened here to dominic to francie and to mel but youd never understand i understand how weve all been violated my own home my family her eyes blazed and she hit the side of her head i get it now this isnt about francie or my brother or me this is about you you macho prick you cant stand what he did to you and now she knew it was her brothers voice coming out of her mouth as part of her marveled at this seeming miracle another part was remembering the time she had seen dominic put a loaded gun to the head of rich cooper her business partner margarite wanted to expand serenissima her cosmetics company overseas but rich thought it was too risky dominic had spent all afternoon using every argument he could think of to persuade rich to change his mind to no avail afterward with the signed contract in his breast pocket dominic had said to her you see margarite there is a correct persuasion for every sort of man now looking at her husbands respect for the weapon she held firmly in her hand she knew she had found the correct persuasion for him what we need nicholas said is a mirror a mirror celeste asked as they broke out again along the riva yes a place we can disappear into where we can look back at our pursuers celeste smiled at him as she took his hand i think i know just the place she took him over the ponte delta pagha the straw bridge where in ages gone by boats filled with straw were unloaded and past the bridge of sighs where prisoners of the doge were led to prison and often worse fates they ducked down going through a sottoportego an archway leading into an underpass and very shortly they came out upon a campo fronted by a stone church rather unprepossessing by venetian standards and a secondary building this is the convent of san zaccaria celeste said leading him out of the campo via the only other egress it has an interesting history since the sisters have historically embroidered the ceremonial hat of the doge they made a sharp right at a tiny square hurrying down a narrow street that bent like the back of an old woman around to the right since the ninth century the reigning doge made a short pilgrimage here at easter to vespers at the church they broke abruptly out onto a wide fondamenta to their right were houses and shops to their left a wroughtiron railing beyond which was a rio crossed by two small stone bridges this was the reason the campo and the convent were so well fortified celeste said as they went down the fondamenta you cant find another entrance to the church or the convent from the campo perhaps halfway down the fondamenta they came to an old doorway in a stucco building the sign above read scuola elementare armando diaz after looking down the entire length of the fondamenta celeste drew him through this open portal they went through a stinking sottoportego emerging on the other side into a grassy courtyard faced on three sides by fairly modern brownbrick buildings the sounds of children could be heard behind the facades celeste led him through a courtyard dotted with enormous zelkova trees and brightly painted swings tricycles and other paraphernalia of small children beyond this innocuous facade was a remarkable surprise the rear of the san zaccaria celeste took him into the basement of the oldest of the brownbrick buildings it smelled of ashes and urine at the far end of a large boiler room was a wooden door scarred and ancient celeste pushed it open and nicholas could immediately smell rio water he could hear the squeal of rats see the ruby eyes in the dark the sound of their soles echoed off stone walls which nicholas was sure were very old they seemed to be in a network of tunnels this theory celeste confirmed the doges of venice were a paranoid lot she said they were made so by circumstance im afraid so they had these tunnels installed as a measure of security for their entrances and exits from san zaccaria centuries later the school was built on the bedrock just above under the direction of the san zaccaria nuns who did not want part of their tradition destroyed the dark air was alive and moving with stone dust and history ahead of him nicholas could see the bright wash of celestes hair as if it were a lamp leading him down the corridor of time the tunnel ended at a small wooden door bound by old studded iron bands she gave a soft knock in a curious rhythm and almost immediately the door swung inward she slipped quickly inside pulled nicholas in after her the door swung shut a torch flared and nicholas saw a small woman in a nuns habit celeste spoke to her rapidly and softly in venetian dialect so that even if he had been within earshot nicholas would not have understood the conversation at length the nun signaled with the torch silently bid them follow her up a winding flight of stone stairs worn to shallow arcs in the centers of the treads where are we celeste turned to him you wanted a mirror ive given you one she nodded over here she led him to a shuttered window made of leaded stained glass she set the torch in a wall sconce pointed through the colored glass of the window look the campo where we just were nicholas looked out and down and indeed he could make out the front of the convent the power of paranoia the imperative of venetian politics it was all like quicksand celeste said some of the predecessors of those doges i spoke of never returned to their palazzo having been assassinated on their way from vespers at just this spot youre looking at the venetians when aroused could be astonishingly bloodthirsty like everything else in venice nicholas thought the darkness mingled with the light as he continued to peer down into the campo he saw a man appear he was dressed as any modernday venetian might be except that he wore an oldfashioned widebrimmed hat which threw deep shadow across his face from his elevated position nicholas could not make out his features is this our pursuer celeste asked nicholas watched as the man moved carefully across the campo his hands moved expertly over the doorways and windows he passed checking on whether they were locked or open so naturally did he do this that anyone casually watching would think nothing of his movements thats our man nicholas said come on they went back down the stairs emerging into the gloom of the groundfloor anteroom nicholas moved to the door put his hand on the wroughtiron lock now it was time to pursue the pursuer together they left their mirror traversing the tunnel the schoolyard heading back down the fondamenta away from the convent up ahead he could see the shadow of the man as he cautiously emerged from the campo moved through the maze of streets he was very good nicholas observed methodical and careful not to overlook any possibility more than once he used existing glass surfaces to check the route behind him the first time he did this nicholas was almost caught off guard but he managed to flatten them against a recessed doorway just in time it became easier as he began to get a sense of the mans mo but at a certain point it would get very difficult indeed when the tick found that he had permanently lost his quarry he would cease to be deliberate and would get himself back to his base as quickly as possible in order to give whoever was running him the bad news at that point nicholas knew they would have to be very quick as well as a little bit lucky in order to stay with him without being detected the tick took them back into the piazza san marco itself filled now with tour groups and children running with their hands full of breadcrumbs simultaneously attracting and scattering the platoons of pigeons which clattered and cooed across the square the man passed beneath an arch just to the right of the torre delloroiogio the clocktower at the northern edge and plunged into the narrow crowded streets of the mercerie this shopping district where once only the fantastic venetian fabrics and dress goods were sold twisted and turned all the way from the piazza san marco to the rialto now it contained shops and restaurants of every description the light was dim here after the sunsplashed openness of the piazza and possessed a mysterious quality as if filtered by the gauzy veils of time even the shops of ultramodern designers such as gianfranco ferre and franco zancan had about them a timeless quality the tick stopped at an antiques shop stood just outside its open doorway chatting with the woman owner nicholas grabbed celeste drawing her quickly into the recesses of the shop of a clothes designer the venetian roberta di camerino there he directed celeste to a display of fine woolen dresses in the venetian colors of sea aquamarine and sky indigo while he glanced through a corner window at the antiques shop across the street hes stopped to make certain he isnt being followed nicholas whispered to her this man is very clever a chicly clothed saleswoman was doing her best to get celeste to try on one of the dresses do you recognize him celeste asked i havent gotten a good look at his face nicholas said as celeste politely waved the saleswoman away were always behind him and hes keeping well to the shadows it would be helpful to see his face nicholas said thoughtfully he extended his psyche feeling the soft beat against kokoro the center the heart of the universe a sudden gust of wind seemed to beat up against the tick lifting the bottom of his jacket it took his hat swirled it off his head making it tumble crown first into the street and there was the face bronze skin oriental features but a mixture not a pure japanese face the hard lines softened perhaps by a bit of khmer or burmese or tibetan blood the lips firm a mole on his lip at the corner of his mouth a memorable face nonetheless at least as far as nicholas was concerned without hesitation the tick bent to retrieve his hat snatching it out of the gutter he was extended for a moment and nicholas saw the curvature of muscle and sinew in shoulder and arm the absolute lack of fat along waist and pelvis no tension in the face none at all and then he had straightened up the hat securely back on his head come on the tick was on the move again weaving them through the fabric of the city they followed him down a street saw him disappear round a sharp turn to the left when they reached it they found themselves in a tiny courtyard of stone and twining bougainvillea at the far end of which was the entrance to a restaurant they went into what appeared to be the plushly appointed dining car of a train a gleaming mahogany bar took up the lefthand side of the room while three intimate banquettes were arrayed on their right this place has another entrance celeste said urgently they hurried down the passageway through the small velvetcovered anteroom to the restaurant then through double doors onto another street there nicholas said pointing to their right they broke into a sprint bolting down the narrow street christ i think hes headed toward the rialto celeste said after a time thats bad news for us theres always such a crush of people around the bridge well stand a good chance of losing him some moments later as she had predicted they broke out onto the quay surrounding the famous covered bridge until the nineteenth century the only one over the grand canal from its inception the ponte di rialto had been filled with merchants shops and with its confluence of foreign goods and tongues more resembled an arab souk than it did a western bridge they caught sight of the tick and nicholas ran down toward the rio celeste right behind him they wove their way along the fondamenta just in time to see him step onto the imbarcadero as a number vaporetto bound in the direction of the arsenal nosed alongside the dock nicholas and celeste raced down the quay as he boarded the vaporetto along with a host of other people and they pushed their way onto the imbarcadero sprinting the last several feet onto the boat just as it was about to depart nicholas kept them close to the side of the boat so that they would not have much space to cover should he get off quickly the vaporetto passed the fondaco dei tedeschi an enormous palace of rooms now the central post office which was originally used by the tedeschi family as their warehouse and a kind of hotel for visiting members of other merchant families they were headed toward the volta dei canal the great curve where the grand canal begins to bend back upon itself there the four palazzi mocenigo sit commanding the grand canal as befitted a family that gave venice seven doges celeste spoke to him of these bits of venetian history as they pretended to be tourist and guide enjoying a planned itinerary the tick swung off just as the vaporetto nosed into the sant angelo station and nicholas and celeste broke through the crowd headed down the imbarcadero after him they passed along the facade of yet another palazzo this one more traditional than many others celeste had pointed out the tick hurried around the palazzo cornerspinelli down a narrow alley then into another street there a second palazzo sat smaller and older and he pulled open a side door disappeared inside they waited a moment the seconds edged by and nicholas could feel celestes nervousness as she stood close beside him in the shadows the facade of the palazzo was brick over which traditional venetian stucco of powdered brick and marble sand in a foundation of lime paste produced the rich rubiate hue so typical of the city at length he signed to her and they edged up to the door he put his ear to it listened for a moment but heard nothing what was waiting for them on the other side nicholas took a deep breath pulled the door open they went inside found themselves in a small courtyard filled with roses and a gnarled weeping willow its thick green trunk looking like a marble column in one corner a lion of istrian stone watched them with implacable objectivity nicholas heard a soft sound from over their heads looking up he saw an open loggia not much different from the one in the doges palace an outside staircase of worn stone and red verona marble surmounted a series of stilted arches inlaid with complex byzantine reliefs the staircase led up to the piano nobile which seemed suspended between sky and earth by rows of slender byzantine pillars at the top of the staircase they emerged onto the loggia the floor was composed of tiles of yellow burnt orange and pale green set in patterns that echoed its byzantine predecessors the inner wall was stucco painted the color of buttered sweet potatoes opposite the delicate darkgreen verde antica stone columns were carved into spiral confections they looked about they seemed alone celeste stood very close to him and he could feel a slight tremor go through her they had come up onto a section of the loggia that had no doors or windows a curious feature in a palazzo that in the venetobyzantine style should have been more open they headed down the length of the loggia beyond the copse of helical columns on their left the trees of the courtyard stirred in a faint breeze heavier now the sky was clouding up a pearlescent light suffused the loggia devoid of shadow or the kind of orientation sunlight provided they continued round a corner they could see the wedge of a rio through a gap in the low buildings the water had turned dark a depthless gray that seemed to suck the light out of the afternoon the roar of a motoscafo lifted and died leaving them in silence then they came upon the door a heavy oaken affair with brass hardware weathered to a seagreen patina it was the lone aperture in the stucco wall and this continued lack of windows became all the more curious he reached for the doorknob but she held him back wait she whispered urgently in his ear i dont want to go in there we have to nicholas said fiercely we have to find out whos been following us she clung to him trembling slightly there must be another way im frightened of what might be inside take my hand she slipped her hand into his as he turned the knob and opened the door they slipped inside as silently as smoke closed the door behind them they were in utter darkness there was the faint smell of ashes and a heavy bitter scent which was not readily identifiable to celeste they took several steps away from the door and it was as if they had traveled miles all sense of being in a room of being inside vanished there was a rushing as of a wind sweeping across a prairie cold and desolate and they experienced a quick wrenching paroxysm of vertigo they heard or perhaps more accurately felt imprinted on the membranes of their eardrums a rising series of vibrations becoming louder or perhaps only more distinct soon this evolved into a discernible rhythm which after a short time seemed to alter to its own cadence the very pulse of blood through their arteries celeste stifled a shriek ahead of them appeared as if through a viscous mist an arching bridge that seemed composed entirely of bones they gleamed palely with here and there a hint of red as if only recently they had been picked clean of flesh the bridge seemed to connect the darkness as if it were a central point the only substantial structure in an otherwise amorphous and terrifying void celeste her fist jammed hard against clenched teeth turned to try to find her way back to the door but nicholas pulled her back close to him i know this place he said under his breath or at least i recognize it my head hurts celeste said tin having trouble breathing as if were underwater nicholas stood very still concentrating celeste felt a ripple in her mind and the sensation of relief one experiences when poking ones head outside the door at the end of a long bitter winter slowly her head began to clear she was about to ask him what had happened when he pulled her forward toward the near end of the bridge it was in itself a frightening artifact for the bones were certainly human now that they were only a step away from it they saw that it was an exceedingly narrow affair certainly were they to attempt to cross it they would have to do so singlefile and then very carefully indeed for its railings were composed of ribs arching inward whose ends had been honed to razor sharpness it seemed to be raining at least the sound of rain could be heard traveling toward them from some direction passing across the plane of their hearing then falling swiftly beyond their ken but they felt nothing where are we celeste asked him is this an hallucination or are we dreaming neither nicholas said then this she shook her head i refuse to believe this skeleton bridge exists its real enough nicholas said gripping her hand but that doesnt mean it couldnt disappear at any moment do you remember that smell as we came in here its the burning flesh of a kind of mushroom the agaricus muscarius like peyote then this is an hallucination no nicholas said the use of hallucinogens is a corruption they arent ingested by the true mystic whose trance is pure manifesting itself solely from his own highly trained will he dragged her behind him as he stepped onto the bridge this mushroom is used in certain rituals it concentrates the ethereal power of the necromancer allowing him to make real things that exist but are rarely seen the floor of the bridge was only nine bones in width and the gauntlet of wickedly honed rib ends was scarifying he could sense her fear as if it were a living presence a third figure hanging behind them like a dangerous shadow ready to impale them upon one of the points of the ribs it was this fear that could prove deadly to them he knew he needed to distract her to make her forget her terror celeste he said softly i meant it when i said i know where we are this is the kanfa bridge the centerpoint of the universe the place where heaven and earth meet where life and death collide as he spoke he continued to move forward drawing her carefully after him on the kanfa time ceases to exist or at least to behave as you believe it does it does not tick off in seconds and minutes it does not move in one direction only another step and she gasped behind him as she swayed slightly her cheek almost brushing against one of the razorsharp points nicholas paused and gripped her hand more tightly here time flows in all directions at once often overlapping itself pooling and eddying repeating like echoes the past present and future until they cease to be discrete entities until they are merged into the ocean of time he urged them on but at a slower pace feeling her turning her head leaning over between the ribs he said dont look down the kanfa is built to the height of a hundred men below it lies the place that christians have named hell though the priests of tautau know it by another far more ancient name celeste looked straight ahead at the back of his head is this bridge some form of tautau magic nicholas found it interesting and curious that she should know about tautau and that he was tanjian he said only in the most peripheral way he paused for a moment the kanfa bridge is a creation of the oldest of the psychonecromancers they were known as messulethe and they are so ancient no one can say for certain where they came from but perhaps it doesnt matter because certainly they were nomads braving the vast wastes of the gobi desert the steppes of what would eventually become siberia the high mountains of tibet and bhutan the bones beneath their feet rattled and hummed treacherous with curved surfaces made slick by the absence of flesh or sinew they were bronzeskinned people with the heavy epicanthic folds and straight black hair of certain tribes who are now strung out through northern china cambodia laos burma and polynesia but they all have one thing in common a mark upon them a blue vertical crescent like the waxing moon tattooed on the inside of their left wrist it was very narrow on the kanfa and the rattling of the bones their passage set up was disturbing triggering perhaps an ancient racememory in the primitive brain of the death of the soul it is said that their name translated again and again into other languages finally became methuselah and so the messulethe personified into a single ancient wise man were woven into the fabric of the bible they were approaching the apex of the kanfa bridge and the way grew more difficult as the pitch of the arc increased centuries later the persian mystic zarathustra came across records of the kanfa and incorporated it into his teachings in his version the righteous who believed in him would cross the bridge and be lifted up to heaven by a guardian spirit what about the unbelievers celeste asked according to zarathustra crossing the kanfa was an ordeal something like an initiation into his faith it symbolized the cosmic struggle for the soul of man i think you can guess the rest the impious were refused crossing they were met at centerspan by a demon out of hell who cast them over the side celeste started as she gave a little cry ahead of them the way was blocked by a figure it was masked a cruel face of bulging eyes high brow ridges and a hideously grinning mouth there was about the whole a vaguely insectile aspect which played upon the deepest antipathies common to all humans and behind him nicholas could feel celeste cringing away tugging on the bond of their clasped hands he struggled to keep that bond whole knowing instinctively that if it was broken their chances of stepping off the other side of the kanfa would be virtually nil with the psychic extension of tautau he had known what was almost certainly awaiting them even before he stepped through the loggia doorway far from being daunted he was intrigued and puzzled while he had read about the basics of the kanfa he had not been aware that it could actually be manifested by tautau or any other form of magic currently known the messulethe had been subjects of intense study by the priests of tautau but the fact remained that even their knowledge of this ancient sect of numinous mages was at best incomplete and often contradictory he found it interesting that the kanfa should manifest itself here in venice interesting but not incomprehensible hadnt celeste mentioned the scythians at their first meeting in the church of san belisario the scythians too had practiced the ancient sorcery of the messulethe even before the time of zarathustra according to celeste they were one of the refugee peoples who founded venice nicholas faced the masked demon i know what you want he said you wont get it you dont know anything laughter deep and booming emanated from the ridged hole in the mask representing a mouth of some sort the sound rumbled through the black space creating a frisson against their skin nicholas began to project outward with his mind then abruptly stopped instinct warned him and now he began to suspect the reason for the resurrection of the kanfa bridge he tucked away the powers of akshara he had learned at the knee of kansatsu his tautau sensei and his implacable enemy the man he had been born to destroy how he wished he possessed shuken the full range of tautau akshara and kshira inside him for he suspected he would be far better prepared for the mortal dangers to come he let go of celestes hand and in a semicrouch rushed headlong at the masked demon he feinted to his right with a vicious atemi aikidos main percussive blow whirled himself on the fulcrum of his left foot moving as he did so from his semicrouch to his full height the demon figure dodged the blow he feinted again with another atemi swung his right leg inside the demons stance as the demon moved to counter his blow he shifted his weight slammed the side of his right foot into the inside of the demons ankle immediately he jammed his elbow into the demons right kidney moving past him now and swinging round and behind as the demon turned to face him he drove the heel of his hand forward missed caught the demon an atemi on his lowest and most unprotected rib the demon let go an explosive breath and nicholas felt as if he were moving underwater his lungs labored to breathe air suddenly thicker than silt there was a buzzing filling his ear canals boring into his mind he knew what this was the tautau adept was summoning his psychic power by exciting the membrane of kokoro at the heart of the cosmos this was the rhythm they had heard when first entering this place the magic that had conjured up the kanfa bridge now his intuition was borne out this was no demon drawn out of zoroastrian hell but a tanjian the tautau adept whom celeste believed had been sent to murder okami and somehow he had access to the lore of the messulethe he felt the rhythm of tautau beating its incessant hypnogogic rhythm upon his consciousness but he refused to project his own power instead he kept up his physical assault on the demon while methodically shutting down the pathways for the adepts tautau to work on him but something more than tautau was at work here and nicholas felt it beginning to insinuate itself between the beats at kokoro and like a vine or briar that uses a host plant to bring it into sunlight he knew that the ancient magic of the messulethe was now just blossoming like an evil flow dense with putrefaction celeste saw these two locked together muscles bulging the sweat running down them in a titanic struggle she broke out of the strange paralysis that had gripped her and rushed to help nicholas as she neared them she felt a cold wind stirring not against her bare flesh but inside her mind and she recoiled and then she understood that this conflict encompassed not only the physical but the mental as well a gale arose gyring and shrieking through the skeletal bridge so that celeste stumbled back and was thrown to her knees a furious burst of cold green light blinded her and she screamed believing her bones bleached her soul seared beyond recognition then even that sound ceased as she fell insensate to the floor roiling with involute energy a dome of diffuse sunlight hovered over tokyo like the immense turbine of a ufo shadows pale prone to disappear at a moments notice followed justine and rick millar as they left the thronged heart of the city behind them but perhaps shadows were not the only thing following them while rick continued a monologue about how the working relationship among the senior partners of the advertising agency would change once she was brought on board justine was watching her rearview mirror where a nondescript white toyota was hanging three cars back she was not yet worried though she seemed to recall the same toyota right behind her at one of the large tokyo intersections this car could just as well be one of a thousand others that were no doubt on the citys streets right now still she couldnt help feeling a sense of foreboding about this particular white toyota was she becoming paranoid it was not guilt that fueled her paranoia but the past well why shouldn t i be nervous she asked herself as she checked her rearview mirror again for the white toyota with the dangerous people nick deals with i should have a bodyguard with me all the time in fact nicholas had broached this very topic a number of times of course she had refused she had had no desire to have her every move scrutinized by anyone especially a stranger this did not stop her from time to time looking over her shoulder when she went into tokyo hence her heightened awareness of the white toyota she kept on the highway heading more or less in the direction of her house where she would eventually leave the car she had arranged for a limousine to pick them up there for the ride out to the airport she checked her mirror again straining to catch a glimpse of the driver but the diffuse sunlight spun off the toyotas windshield making any kind of identification impossible honey whats the matter rick said as her expression of concentration changed to one of concern probably nothing she said changing to the far right lane and accelerating a moment later she watched the white toyota pull out from behind a black bmw and accelerate behind her i dont want to alarm you she said but someone might be following us what rick swiveled round to peer out the rear window who see that white toyota i think he picked us up when we were still in the city proper rick gave the toyota another look then turned round again straightening his jacket but thats nuts why would anyone want to follow us i dont know she said maybe it has something to do with what nicholas is doing in venice everything bad happens because of what he is rick grunted i think youre imagining things but just to put your mind at ease lets give your theory a try he pointed get off at the next exit lets see if the toyota follows us justine nodded but as the signs for the exit passed them she made no attempt to change lanes what are you doing rick said at the speed were going if we dont get over now we wont make the jesus justine accelerated abruptly sliding just in front of the grill of a truck almost clipping its fender with the tail of her car as she switched lanes the trucks airhorn sounded angrily the exit was coming up very fast and there was a nissan sedan cruising sedately in the left lane she jammed on her brakes slid almost sideways across the one clear space in the exit lane and burning rubber behind her as she pumped the brakes hard hurtled onto the exit ramp at twice the advised speed she almost hit the outer verge corrected then slowed for the long arc off the highway when they were on the local street she said well did you see whether the toyota tried to follow us are you kidding rick said with a small laugh i was too busy trying to keep my bladder under control he turned round now justine had just made a right turn and he could see the road was clear behind them nothing he said giving her a kiss on the cheek as he settled back in the seat see i told you but sweet jesus you could have made the same point by taking the exit at a decent speed oh god no what is it he saw her staring into her rearview mirror and shifting saw the familiar silhouette of the white toyota come into view same car justine nodded grimly now what do you think of my theory lets see if we can get him off our back justine nodded again were near the house i know this area better than any other in japan if we can reach the road to our house without him too close i can lose him there she took the next left with a sharp squeal of tires accelerated dangerously through an intersection then made another left he could see that she was looping round attempting to make the turns fast enough to switch positions with the toyota and come up behind him then veer off so that he would have no chance to follow he was dizzy after the sixth turn there was also no sign of the pursuing car and rick was of a mind that her guilt at having cheated on her husband had begun to rub off on him coming up on the road i want she said any sign of him no rick said but he was concerned for another reason she was obviously an excellent driver but she was having to concentrate on a lot of things at once finding the right road remembering to drive on the left watching for the white toyota and she must be thinking of nicholas slow down he said the toyotas not following us if it ever was no justine said im on the road now i want to make certain he wont find us this road was narrow and winding great yoshino cryptomeria trees and massive evergreen hedges lined it so that there were no margins he felt as if he were inside a gigantic maze no wonder justine felt safe here it was almost like finding eden after the concrete and steel megalopolis of tokyo the turns were almost switchbacks so sharp were they that many of the homeowners had installed circular fisheye mirrors on tree trunks so motorists could see the oncoming traffic round the acute bends they flashed along the road the sharp turns back and forth making him a bit queasy for the love of god justine slow down she continued to consult her rearview mirror her face showed that she still felt they were being pursued by the wrath of god just a little more until im sure were safe they sped into a turn sharper than most there was no mirror here and rick experienced a moment akin to what he had experienced the first time hed parachuted nothing below him but air the ground coming up and he hurtling downward to meet it he heard the deep diesel roar of the giant earthmover before his brain registered what his eyes saw justine was looking into her mirror for any trace of their pursuer and shouting a warning rick grabbed the steering wheel the huge machine was bearing down on them as justine screaming hit the brakes the machines airhorn exploded into the quiet afternoon sounding as mournful as a funeral dirge rick threw himself across justines seat yanked hard on the wheel but at that point there were less than two feet remaining between the vehicles what is thought locked in an endless moment like this justines mind was blank she saw only a small wedge of cerulean sky shining with a curious light behind the looming bulk of the crimson earthmover in that luminescence she could see reflected the entire breadth of her existence as if it were a single exhalation from the mouth of god the two feet were covered in a split second the massive front end of the earthmover struck her car almost headon the front crumpled like cardboard and the cracked engine split dashboard and shattered windshield plowed like a furious juggernaut into the passenger cabin what was left of the car now halved in length was lifted like a matador gored on the curve of a charging bulls horn and thrown into the air upside down it struck a pair of very old cryptomeria instantly felling them it hung in the air for a moment while gasoline from the ruptured tank spewed out as if it were blood from an artery the appalled driver of the earthmover smelled the rank odor of raw gasoline and jumped from his cab running as fast as he could even with that the percussive wave of the explosion blew him off his feet fetched up against the bole of a tree whose trunk had been sheared off either in the initial accident or the ensuing explosion he looked dizzily up to see an oily fireball consume the car the blue sky and finally his consciousness nights vietnam autumn science fiction thats what they called the us army special forces in vietnam and that nickname seemed just about right these boys did all the nasty jobs that no one ever wanted to talk about that were certainly never logged in on intsum the weekly intelligence summaries on limited distribution at pentagon east the military assistance command vietnam hq at tan son nhut uwo the army called them unconventional warfare ops even so do duc was a kind of anomaly within science fiction he was officially an e a sergeantmajor in the rvaf the republic of vietnam armed forces where he had served in the rd ranger command where he gained his expertise in zippos search and destroy missions that was how he had come to the attention of science fiction he had enlisted in the rvaf at the age of sixteen having lied about his age and his mixed heritage it was easier to be vietnamese only so he had hidden away his surname made up another and no one bothered to check south vietnam was in a fight for its life men not paperwork were paramount sergeantmajor was the highest rank an enlisted man could attain he was officer material no doubt about it but he resisted with all his heart his superiors suggestions in that direction something of his nature had been forged in this mad crucible of war here life was essentially a cutanddried affair men were sent out to kill one another and women well they were around to bed in between missions in such a hellish atmosphere it was not surprising that human beings should lose their value life was reduced to a commodity to be bought and sold to be possessed or to be terminated hearts quickly became so callused that the wretchedness of existence could no longer be perceived in vietnam the jungle had a way of taking everything away from you inch by inch the hive of horrors lurking there stripped away the veneer of civilization exposing like a raw nerve all the dark things of humanity quickly the foundation of benevolence was subverted so that in the end one doubted whether one had ever had a true sense of humanity at all no wonder do ducs favorite song became the rolling stones sympathy for the devil compassion was reduced to the remembrance of a dream it was supplanted by the sharks peculiar imperative to continue to move that meant missions the fearful plunge into the jungle the choking terror that you would make a misstep and end up without your legs or be impaled on punji sticks firehardened bamboo spikes dark with a venom that would paralyze your central nervous system the men in do ducs outfit often confessed to having nightmares of such happenstance curiously these became a spur to volunteer for missions even when you were overdue leave because what happened between missions the sharks imperative needed to be met sex was okay as far as it went and there were the drugs which provided the illusion of movement but do duc needed more much more this was how he struck up a relationship that was strange even for the strange days in which he was living it began when a corporal named rock was transferred into do ducs outfit while with a grunt platoon in the big dead one the first infantry division elements of which were the first infantry in vietnam rock had been bumped up from pfc via the courageous run he had made at a viet cong stronghold hed burned five of them before being shot in the arm then hed dropped a grenade and had run like hell that had earned him a field promotion and an impact award from a real live general but that was before do duc knew him before he had been assigned by his own request to do ducs science fiction outfit he had asked for the assignment in lieu of another impact award about the outfit they called themselves werewolves they dressed like vc ate like vc and had as little to do with the soldiers around them as they were able the werewolves were a kind of semiautonomous unit of madmen who were used on missions other outfits either couldnt or wouldnt undertake some of them do duc believed even the president wouldnt have abided had he been told of their planning and execution who requisitioned these missions do duc never did find out but the werewolves co was a dourfaced colonel named bud powell who came from the heartland of america he had been a college professor in the sixties who had grown bored with his work and his deferral so he had enlisted not that you could tell he had been a teacher from the zeal and cunning with which he employed his men to do the bloody bidding of the us army he was known affectionately among his men as bowel it was bowel who had first paired do duc with the cherry rock this is one bad dude so im given to understand bowel had said to do duc just before the official mission briefing how about this he goes around with a law that was an m antitank rocket launcher which could blow open the side of any bunker charlie coulderect sounds like my kind of guy bowel had snickered so i thought im giving you a zippo mission to see what hes really made of the two of them were sent to take out a vc vampire patrol one of those feared lethal entities that stole through the lines at night killing soldiers in their sleep this kind of behavior on the part of the enemy was intolerable according to bowel who ought to know since he was so well connected all the way up to pentagon east the psychological effects of such raids were devastating and they had to be stopped the werewolves were tapped to do just that but bowel told do duc and rock that he wanted them to do more than destroy the patrol i want you to make an example of them how you boys do that is strictly up to you are you gonna tell us whats in bounds and whats out rock asked bowel had turned away from them son i dont know what the fuck youre talking about so do duc and rock went vampirehunting does bowel really mean what he said rock asked do duc as they made their way out of camp by the light of a sliver of moon he always means what he says do duc said then again he always means what he doesnt say rock grinned you guysve got yourselves a whole other war here i think im gonna like this setup in the jungle do duc said softly i dont want to shoot these bastards get me cool rock said tm already thinking of the thousand and one things thatre better than shooting them they camped in the jungle sleeping one at a time for twohour spells until it was an hour before dawn then they tracked down the vc vampires a unit of four who were returning to base after a nightside foray they took them in their own makeshift camp where four others waited for them and not a shot was fired they strung the eight vcs up by their feet then slit them open from neck to pubis a line of steaming humanity and left them there to be found a testament to the power of human hate and the corruption of the human soul the true and lasting damage war inflicts on its participants rock proved utterly fearless if he hadnt known better do duc would have assumed that he was merely too dim to feel fear but there was nothing remotely dim about rock do duc quickly saw that rock was intuitive about learning he had an uncanny knack of sizing up a situation and making the best tactical advance into it the truth was that rock was like those big city cockroaches at home which could live for a month on the residual protein in a human fingerprint he subsisted on fear the killing which was the motivating factor for most of the werewolves was almost incidental bowel had been right in assigning him to this mission afterward of course they were obliged to save themselves from going mad or perhaps from savoring too intensely what they had done alcohol took care of that for fortyeight hours at least by that time they were horny as toads executing the release from life precipitated the need for that other release do duc had been with his girl a sinuous vietnamese who might have been as young as fourteen softly he stroked her thick nightblack hair ran his callused hands over her velvet flesh with such tenderness that she rose off the straw pallet to kiss the hollow of his throat in gratitude do duc heard a howl from the next room where rock was with his girl thinking charlie do duc had grabbed his marine combat knife and ran to his buddy what he saw in the next room turned his blood to ice rock had tied his girl with flex so tightly that her flesh bulged obscenely between the strips here and there where the metal had bitten most cruelly into her she had begun to bleed rock naked was beating her with a length of bamboo his erection stood out before him red and quivering do duc watching flashed on the abattoir they had created in the jungle he stood so still he could hear the sound of his own pumping blood over the rhythmic beat of bamboo against flesh what happened do ducs girl said in vietnamese from just behind him look at all this blood he said so it happens all the time she said she reached her hand around his thigh took hold of him ooo your weapon is so hard why are you still standing here come back its fuck time do duc with his girl leaning on him had taken one last look at rock and the bleeding girl as if they were some tableau painted on a pagan temple wall which had survived the ravages of the ages he was aware of a sensation in his mind that was akin to the ache one felt from a wound very deep but so old it had been long forgottenmany years later do duc would have cause to think again of that violent scene the scent of blood and the lost childs phrase reverberating in his mind its fuck time two days after leaving their base camp which was then approximately five hours by gunboat from ban me thuot the company was drenched in sweat mud and rice leaves there were six of them do duc rock a tattooed black giant named riggs a tightly wound explosives and ordnance specialist named donaldson so young that the dr strange master of the mystic arts comic he read over and over seemed the perfect medium for him and a pair of cidgs this was an acronym for civil irregular defense group science fictiontrained soldiers selected from various indigenous tribes who knew the local terrain these particular cidgs were anticommunist nungs who knew the target area inside out the nungs were among the men selected from the mountain hilltribes of north vietnam who often provided science fiction with troops and intelligence to fight charlie the nungs were railthin sunkeneyed creatures who looked to do duc like the wretched semihuman denizens of the island of lost souls but the only experiments being worked here were the discharge of ordnance that was sys tematically dismantling their country they did not seem familiar to him but rather stripped from their environment appeared to do duc as helpless as many of the americans how he pitied them do duc piloted a uf seminole a troop transport plane without weaponry of any kind which bowel had somehow procured it arrived specially outfitted with a slar a sidelooking airborne radar unit do duc wondered why a defenseless aircraft had been requisitioned instead of a heavily armed gunship bowel had provided some clue this is a god mission that was a werewolf joke god mission meant it does not exist i dont want any bushwhacking cowboys from aircav in on our dinner get me i sure do do duc had said bowel had squinted at him thats what i like about you do duc you know when its time to go to work for uncle sam he took out the sad remnant of a cigar that had been chewed over for months it was slimy and about to fall apart but bowel stuck it between his lips just the same okay he said besides being a god mission its a tenthou that meant it was the worst it concerns the fate of one man hes officially listed as mia either hes dead or hes been captured by charlie we dont know which bowel chomped on his disgusting stogie waiting for a comment when do duc made none he nodded went on sounds fucked ten ways from every sunday in the calendar but thats the shitstick hand weve been dealt weve been dealt worse yeah wait you get a load of whats out there youre putting down into dead space that was very bad dead space was an area where covering fire and observation by backup was impossible because of the nungs do duc assumed it was somewhere in north vietnam your objectives name is michael leonforte bowel paused as if expecting a response not getting one he continued this guys on another plane of existence hes a veteran of poison ivy the fourth infantry division hes a helluva soldier commendations up the yinyang but hes also been in the lbj ranch twice once for beating an indigenous civilian into a coma a second time for knifing a girl he swears was vc they check that one out bowels mouth twisted they wouldve liked to only the girl was already cold mick sounds interesting how come they let him out of long binh jail cause hes a vip as far as certain elements of pentagon east are concerned they put him in the field in charge of his own unit no less the group was inserted behind enemy lines youll find out where soon enough they kept strict radio contact for five days then the transmissions ceased and all attempts to raise them proved fruitless bowels eyes flicked down to the eyes only onionskin sheet he held that was approximately three months ago when he was reported mia pentagon east freaked they rolled out a shitload of special pattern activity just lor him bowel meant detailed observations of enemy activity within certain sectors they mobilized a goddamned division for christs sake just to find one michael leonforte bowel grunted handed over a blackandwhite photo do duc was looking at a charismatic young lieutenant with a long face wideset black eyes and a scowl as deep as the grand canyon even in the picture do duc could discern the power emanating from that face heavy he said yeah bowel took the photo back that about sums up young mick he should have had a co at pentagon east do duc said why didnt he lead a team in to find mick did just that bowel said dryly the team never came back out it vanished just like micks do duc mulled that over for a time you know why pentagon east has gone batshit over his disappearance he have possession of classified intelligence maybe maybe they have plans for him bowel said deadpan but then again maybe it has to do with the fact that hes the son of frank leonforte the hotshit mafia godfather do duc was silent for some time this guys on another plane of existence he was watching bowels smirk and wondering how much more he knew about mick leonforte he wasnt giving up what do we do when we locate this motherfucker if hes dead you bring back the body if hes alive you are instructed to extract him from his hostile environment and jesus sir thats the language they used to tell me son so im only passing it on i want to be precise about this quite naturally theres no paperwork associated with this god mission none whatsoever okay lets say he is alive do duc said i find him and hotel alpha that meant haul ass then what jyou bring him to me bowel said thats what maybe it was then that do duc began to smell a rat in any case he said nothing bowel had looked at him i want him alive aliveo get me do duc said he did im assigning you a complement of cidgs where youre going youll need their expertise my advice is to use these cidgs whenever practical by the way you wont be issued a prick we dont want anyone eavesdropping on unauthorized transmissions a prick was a prc the lightweight field radio that was the werewolves standard issue bowel stared at do duc like i said its a tenthou he cleared his throat thats it then and do duc for christs sake dont crash the damned seminole what we dont need is hard evidence that weve been where youre going that was classic nam doublethink and it didnt pay to dwell on the irony of it that kind of oxymoron wore thin pretty quick over here one last thing sir do duc said with his hand on the door what if the objective resists extraction for a long time bowel said nothing he stared through do duc as if he did not exist in that event bowel said slowly you are free to use your own judgement sir bowels eyes snapped into focus raked do ducs face you bring this motherfucker back to me soldier one fucking way or another they took off at night without do duc knowing where he was going save for the initial heading bowel had given him verbally at the final briefing in the air donaldson looking more tense than usual worked the slar as if he had been born to it rock was right over his shoulder do duc had given him the sealed envelope with their instructions on a kind of paper that melted in your mouth it helped when you needed to eat the stuff after memorizing the information every few minutes rock called out course corrections to do duc as if the slar itself was providing them riggs stared at the back of donaldsons head as if he expected a psychic attack from dr strange the two nungs slept the entire way there was no armament aboard the aircraft so it was clear they had been targeted for insertion in an area where there was little or no enemy air traffic or ground radar that had sounded suspiciously like cambodia where charlie had bunkered himself in and was rearming and resupplying before venturing back across the border to engage the us armed forces despite being provided with directions piecemeal do duc had a general idea where they were headed and it was no surprise to him when they set down in a green lz a landing area free from enemy observation it was the distance which threw him and now he knew why he had been given the longerrange seminole instead of a gunboat as far as he could tell they were in the middle of nowhere the map he had memorized and then eaten had given only one landmark besides the mekong a nothing village named sre sambor three klicks northwest of the landing site weve flown halfway across cambodia rock said with some astonishment what the fuck was michael leonforte doing here do duc looked at him the question to ask is what was pentagon east up to sending him in here cambodia do duc knew was an ostensibly neutral country in the war but longstanding political problems with the more powerful vietnamese caused cambodias leader lon nol to turn a blind eye to the viet cong incursions into his sovereign territory as do duc suspected they were headed straight for a hot zone and prickless they were working without a net tenthou as advertised it was the wet season and there had been a great deal of rain twelve straight days of it before they had launched the mission the wet season was not the best time to effect any kind of offensive action do duc knew and the fact that they were moving in now testified both to the significance and the urgency of what they had to accomplish the strip where he had been ordered to put down did not even have a shed attached to it god alone knew how anyone had discovered its existence do duc had no sense that there was anything remotely military about the strip which was nevertheless wellmaintained by whom he found himself wondering the strip was at the extreme edge of a vast area of terraced rice paddies to the east into which they plunged directly they had unloaded their equipment from the aircraft heading north toward the mekong river looking back from the unprotected morass of the flooded paddles do duc was not happy to see the seminole disappear into the hazy distance the physical effort to get across the rice paddies was enormous they saw no viet cong patrols indeed to do ducs amazement they saw no one at all they remained alone traveling on a flat viscid landscape that dwarfed them no matter in which direction they looked the leader of the nungs was an emaciated young man named jin on the ground in the midsection of cambodia it was jin with whom do duc consulted most often and to whom do duc deferred when there was a difference of opinion rock disagreed with this action and it became a source of friction between the two what the fuckre you doing rock had said the first time do duc asked for jins advice and followed it for christs sake keep your voice down do duc said the jungle can act like a cathedral bouncing sound for yards in every direction rock glowered evilly at the nungs but he lowered his voice maybe theyre doubtfuls if theyve sold us out charlie already knows were here calm down you forget even we didnt know where we were headed until we were in transit yeah maybe but these sorry bastards would probably as soon have you for lunch as look at you youre misinformed do duc said theyre not barbarians the hell they arent just look at them their civilizations a lot older than yours or even mine rock snorted what civilization all these shitsve been doing for centuries is killing each other and whatve your civilized countries been doing rock gave him a hard look youre a good one to talk you were brought up where in the middle of this fucking jungle right sort of a stone age kind of thing huh maybe thats why you can relate to them real well do duc had bared his teeth at rock rock grinned shit look at you youre a fuckin tribesman just like them hell you even speak their dialect he laughed so okay maybe you understand these shits better than i do do you good to figure that out ace behind them in the far distance beyond even the southern horizon the continuing flush of war could be seen if not at this distance heard manmade lightning in the form of aerial bombardment lit the underside of the clouds with the bitter rain of napalm and in the fuliginous aftermath dawn came unnaturally early in the kingdom of the damned before the real dawn arrived they had pitched camp rock did the work of three men but he had a haunted look in his eye as they took their horse pills to stave off malaria and ate their charlie rats what they called crations he said to do duc where the fuck is mr charles he patted his law rocket launcher slung at his hip like a sixgun of the gods i cant wait to blow him away patience do duc said i got a nasty feeling were going right down his throat youll get your chance yeah when its quiet enough to hear a lung collapse he spat shook his head theres a weird kind of isolation here like were dead and dont yet realize it in a way do duc thought he was right jin says were in a hot zone but i dont understand it and theres just so much hes willing to say is charlie really this far north in cambodia he shrugged well find out soon enough at dusk well begin to move ill tell you it wont come fast enough to suit me rock said spewing out a mouthful of his charlie rats christ id rather eat my enemys arm they slept the first day beneath a clump of dank foliage set on a knoll just above the water level of the paddies rock who took the first watch did not sleep well there was not a dry spot on his body and he had begun to itch in the most unfortunate places where are you mr charles they broke camp at dusk at this point a visual sense of distance had to be abandoned jin advised them not to look at the horizon but to concentrate on the immediate environment which had become so monotonous that rock found himself dozing off as he slogged on through the unending morass toward midnight they stopped to eat a light meal the sky was completely clear starlight and the watery illumination from a halfmoon fell upon them like fistfuls of diamonds rock went to relieve himself and crouching down stared into the muddy water slowly the patchwork of light and dark ceased to swirl from the movement of his approach and a pattern began to coalesce good christ would you look at this do duc and jin who were closest came over they stared down into the water skulls rock waded around in a circle crunching human skulls as he went thousands upon thousands of skulls made up the floor of this flooded paddy and here were bones femurs ulnae sacra ribs scapulae he was standing in a veritable graveyard now do duc knew that jin hadnt lied they were in a hot zone ask the nungs what the fuck happened here rock said as he danced a jig on a ribcage and a shattered pelvis the proximity to so much death was like being shot up with adrenalin you should learn to speak their language do duc told him bluntly before turning to speak to jin jins face was unreadable the north vietnamese and viet gong are massacring the cambodians in the same way they are killing my people he said in his peculiar dialect his voice was very controlled so that it took do duc a moment to discern the choler hidden there here is our history this is what will be left for our children the ones who survive this war and i ask myself whether they will be the lucky ones do duc translated for rock who for once was silent his little jig at an abrupt end then mr charles is here and he must be close rock said fingering the firing mechanism of his law they pushed on spurred now do duc was sure by the thought of the skeletons over which they were traversing though no one spoke of the sea of horror they cracked beneath their boot soles with every step they took it was almost dawn by the time they could see an ending to the paddies it had begun to pour again as it had done off and on during the last part of their trek the wind drove the warm rain into their faces cutting visibility to several hundred feet the water level had lowered considerably they trudged through the miserable rainswept landscape do duc on point could make out a dark smudge on the bank of the last paddy beyond it should be the mekong river up which they must make their way they had been heading steadily east and the river would take them almost due north straight for the border of laos laos lay like a concubine curled up against the back of vietnam arching from the southern end where they were headed in a northwesterly direction until it hit the borders of yunnan in southern china and the shan states in burma the area known as the golden triangle because of its production from the vast poppy fields covering its rugged mountain plateaus he thought about pentagon east flying into a panic when michael leonforte went mia hi this hot sector he thought about the first rescue party that had gone mia too he thought about bowels directive to extract leonforte and bring him back to bowel not to his handlers at pentagon east now do duc thought it was going to get interesting he picked up his pace nearing the dark smudge it was a makeshift pier three rotting wood boards on creaking pilings that jutted out into a wide muddy river that snaked its way into the mist this must be it do duc said and jin plodding near him nodded mutely they broke out the black rubber zodiac boat pulled a pair of ripcords it inflated very quickly and they pushed it off the end of the pier keep your hands inside the boat jin warned there are plenty of crocodiles in the water in this low light theyll look like drifting logs they spent four nights navigating the river as had been their mo they slept during the day pulling the boat up across a muddy bank beneath the deep shade of the trees while they huddled in sleep once the watch reported the passing of a khmer boat but its complement of soldiers did not see them and did not stop otherwise they appeared to be alone where charlie rock asked eager as ever to draw blood no one answered him because they didnt know they ate fish hooked from the opaque water by jin and his cidg companion more than once the nungs pointed out the ziggu ratstudded backs of crocs gliding silently through the currents and eddies do duc watched the creatures with an expression that rock could not define the river looked familiar to do duc not because he had ever been there before but because he had memorized the map that had been in the sealed envelope bowel had given him he had since eaten all the directives and attendant intelligence typed on the edible paper near dawn of the fourth night he directed them to pull into the left bank the light was a glistening pearl just lustrous enough to etch and limn but not yet bright enough to produce color were close now he said to rock as they pulled the zodiac into deep cover charlie must be here somewhere they were less than a klick from the border to laos and this was where their intelligence ended somewhere up ahead was where michael leonforte and eight other men went mi a do duc and jin went on a perimeter patrol while the rest of the unit prepared camp beneath the trees when rock was finished they still hadnt returned he pulled out his law and went looking for them it didnt take long they were on the other side of the stand of trees whats the problem rock asked them do duc pointed crispie critter he said it was like being in a car coming out of a fog at sixty miles an hour to find a semi coming straight at you they stood before the naked body of a girl whom he judged to be perhaps ten years old the corpse lay twisted back arched as if she were pinned to the rottedout bole of a tree the skin over twothirds of her body was scorched to a crisp her legs were broken the bones poking through the ripped flesh almost as if in a deliberate composition she was missing the lower half of both arms fuck rock said what the hell hit her do duc continued to stare at the girl it had begun to rain again fat drops like the sweat off buddhas brow the air was as heavy as chainmail it took an effort just to breathe it in and out she was smoked with jelly for sure riggs said as he came up behind them he shifted his m machinegun restlessly from one arm to another but as for the rest of it never seen anything like that donaldson said holding onto his ma with white knuckles kinda makes your hair stand on end fuckin charlie rock said wasnt vc did this jin said in decent english rocks eyes widened and do duc smiled you knew all along he spoke english didnt you i told you to learn his language do duc said hes learned yours sonuvab do duc waved him to silence said to jin who then if it wasnt charlie jin touched the dead girl with the end of his sovietdesigned ak as he stepped over her and do duc thought he saw his lips move in silent prayer do duc waved the others to stay behind as he went after jin he paused stood for a moment on a small knoll watching the nung squat on his haunches his machinegun between his knees do duc crouched beside him shook out a cigarette they smoked for some time in silence at last do duc buried his butt in the mud said softly what is it about the situation back there i should know for a long time jin did not answer him he continued to stare out across the glade in the triplecanopied jungle as the rain began to hammer down fullforce when i was growing up i used to play for hours in my grandmothers flower garden how the sunlight lit up its delicate colors how i loved to run between its precise rows and circular beds he took a long drag on the cigarette let out the smoke with a harsh hiss less than a year after she was killed by the viet cong my duties led me back to the area of my youth and i took a short detour the house was still intact but the garden was overgrown choked with vigorous weeds and thorny vines it was ugly now his mahoganycolored hand opened palm upward like a flower i would like to think that one day i can come back home without needing one of these he slapped the side of his ak but the longer i am a soldier the less conviction i have that this will happen every day a new atrocity springs up like a weed or a thorny vine jin i grieve with you do duc said but i must know what happened to that girl ask the gwai do duc swung his head around the gwai the word meant demon in the nung dialect the gwai are nungs just like me but not like me at all they did this despite his buddhist upbringing he was unable to keep the bitterness out of his voice ive never heard of the gwai its not what they call themselves but what others in secret have named them jin seemed very uncomfortable do duc wondered at this jin showed more emotion now over the death of this one child than he had over the thousands of khmer whose bones they had cracked as they marched like ants across the riverbed of skeletons a sect of nungs the gwai had tortured this child do duc again heard the warning bell that had gone off in his head during his final briefing with bowel laos the southern route from the golden triangle all of a sudden the rat he had caught a whiff of before seemed a whole lot closer do the nungs the gwai know where our objective is do duc asked are they keeping him for ransom that would explain some of the hysteria which had seemed to grip pentagon east at michael leonfortes mia report i dont know jin said getting up and walking back into the canopied forest daylight and the scent of fear the sense of isolation had vanished rain thundered down drowning all other sound in the maelstrom of its fury they slept as best they could which was to say not well do duc found that he could not close his eyes without seeing the image of the girl lying like a sacrificial lamb against the drum of the rotted tree he was not disturbed by her death what did one more matter there would be plenty more but by the manner in which it had been carried out he was remembering he got up went back to where she lay he hunkered down staring at her his mind turning over like an engine it was like a picture perfect in its own calculated way the composition the phrase sacrificial lamb repeated itself in his mind like the tolling of a bell had she been a sacrifice is that what had gotten under jins skin though he had carried out a score of missions when he had been no more than a heartbeat from death and had become as familiar with the grip of fear as he was with his own body he knew he had stumbled upon something utterly new he didnt know whether to be terrified or excited he stayed where he was his consciousness mesmerized by the sight his unconscious stirred perhaps by the ethereal scoria of some strange alchemy he passed the day in a semiconscious dream state in which visions memories and fantasies combined to form the constructs of a new reality an eternal war from which he wished never to return armies of his imagining rose to challenge each other to mortal combat blood spurted from grievous wounds soldiers fell were trampled underfoot by their own comrades inexorable progress across a plain composed of the slain emerald twilight emerged from the heat of the colorless day sometime while they had slept it had ceased to rain but it began again soon after they awakened they relieved themselves ate hurriedly dutifully swallowed their horse pills and broke camp within an hour they emerged from the jungle only to be drawn to a series of flickering jewels in the near distance these particular jewels were fiery laos jin said from close beside him do duc nodded said butterfly and the men spread out the butterfly was a patrol pattern revolving on multiple axes which gave the unit maximum protection as it progressed through unknown and presumably hostile territory despite their extreme vigilance they encountered no one the fires were less than a klick away and turned out to be flickering in the remnants of a substantial village they paused at the perimeter here and there the fires still burned whitehot impossible in this weather unless they were of a chemical nature the buzz of the insects was startling rolling over them like a net soon the stench of scorched flesh was overpowering napalm do duc said he knew the effects of napalm when he saw them and there was plenty to see a sea of corpses confronted them blind eye sockets cast in incongruous directions silent and accusatory clouds of insects lifted and fell in sickening waves feeding off the carrion he kicked over bodies studying them as if they yet had a tale to tell viet cong or laotian it was impossible even for the nungs to tell them apart what dyou think happened here rock asked us army cleanup do duc shrugged he knew what rock was thinking was this another incident like the one galley and his butcher brigade perpetrated at my lai jas far as i know we dont have any units inside laos face it rock said neither of us know shit about where mi is operating or what its up to he meant military intelligence and do duc found himself wondering whether the elements within pentagon east who had given michael leonforte his mission had been ml the nungs aks at the ready patrolled the tornapart streets of the village with closed faces do ducs thoughts returned to jins assertion that the gwai were operating inside cambodia could they also be active within laos each question he asked it seemed was leading him northward toward the golden triangle abruptly the rat he had been smelling ever since bowel had given him the final briefing had a distinct flavor it was the odor of money at that moment riggs gave a shout and the unit ran toward the eastern perimeter of the devastation do duc saw the concrete bunker he and rock went down into the natural hollow to take a closer look the curious thing was that though it had been only half hidden underground the bunker itself was intact the only thing spared utter destruction do duc motioned to rock who leveled his law at the bunkers locked door pulled the trigger donaldson was the first man into the hollow echo after the explosion tossing a cs grenade into the gaping hole the rocket launcher had made in the concrete they all backed away from the hiss of the riot gas then sat back on their haunches waiting for the air to clear do duc and rock ducked inside the bunker took a look around there were no personnel inside it was an armaments warehouse the curious thing was that what they saw stockpiled were kfifties submachineguns all chinese communistmanufactured considering jins warning that was significant they explored the entire bunker came up with more chicom weapons this doesnt look like charlie rock commented this ordnance is so new i can see my reflection in the oil hes never so well equipped you know about the nungs rock nodded did a patrol or two with some of em when i was with big dead one we were always on the cutting edge of the war he laughed and i do mean cutting this look like them fuck they dont have the kind of money needed for this cache you ever hear of the gwai a rogue group of nungs rock shook his head no why jin mentioned them according to him theyre very bad news rock grunted fucking nungs do duc shrugged the odor of money was becoming stronger who has the capital for this then do duc said easy soviet union or uncle sam the two men looked at each other for a long time at last rock said you think this shit has anything to do with michael leonforte maybe do duc said who knows what pentagon east has on its mind if we bought this ordnance who are we arming good question do duc said at this point i think mr leonforte is the only one wholl give us an answer if we can find him thats why were here do duc said but if hes dead i say we come back here and liberate this ordnance wed get big bucks selling it done rock said they got up to leave and rock put a hand on do ducs arm whoever owns this has got to be close maybe theyre already eyeballing us they made their way out of the bunker both had the beginnings of a headache brought on by the last of the cs gas do duc broke the unit up into teams of two ordered them out on cloverleaf recon so that they would loop back overlapping each other for backup in this obviously hostile environment do duc and rock explored the area around the bunker they found nothing of interest within ten minutes they caught sight of riggs and donaldson returning from recon across the destroyed village it was at that moment that the mortars began to fall the sky caving in turning to hot lead in a paroxysm of death the first or second round caught donaldson hurling him into the center of another black and red plume do duc who had taken cover alongside rock could not see riggs through the smoke and explosions the nungs were nowhere in sight do duc hoped they were trying to find the source of the attack the silence after such an attack is eerie because it is deafening in its own right do duc poked his head out from behind a crumbling wall saw what was left of donaldson not much more than a smear on the pockmarked ground nearby amid the rubble he could make out the enormous riggs who was propped up against another wall he was staring down at the blood covering his lower body his chest was heaving and shuddering ah shit do duc said as rock pushed up beside him to take a look around it remained quiet he still had no idea where jin and his nungs were or any sense where the incoming mortar fire had emanated from he saw riggss chest moving in panting heaves and he knew he had to get to him immediately cover me he said to rock taking a deep breath he broke cover zigzagging his way toward riggs no sniper took a shot at him and he could see no sign of enemy infantry he saw no evidence of the nungs either and this worried him what had happened to them it was unlikely they had neutralized the source of the enemy fire since do duc had heard no weapons fire had they deserted he knelt beside riggs its gonna be okay big guy he said breaking out an ampoule of morphine just take it easy he was just beginning to assess the damage when the air turned thick with the peculiar whistling of incoming fire do duc launched himself toward the relative safety of a crackedapart structure but he could already feel the oppressive weight of the shells streaking inward on their high arcs where are those goddamned nungs then the world was collapsing in on him with the shriek and wail of matter rending itself the ground rippled underneath his boot soles then came up and smashed against his stomach he lay for a time dazed and so shook up that he swore later that he had actually glimpsed the phantom armies of his previous days dream on the march the dread beat of their weaponry and armor shaking the leaves off the trees his own helmed and masked silhouette striking down the last flames of the setting sun then he blinked saw rock crouched over him shaking him shouting at him what he said what lets hotel alpha rock was shouting i found the nungs or whats left of em were it from the first team he hauled do duc to his feet steadying him goddammit buddy get your ass in gear now do duc nodded but now the shelling had started again and together they staggered into the northwestern outskirts of the village heading deeper into laos but that was all right for now because it was away from the barrage it seemed to do duc that night that he did nothing but dream he lay beneath a palm tree with the rain pattering all around curled in a fetal position exhausted and famished he was in pain from the rubble that had landed on him his skin was chafed raw and he itched in so many places he had given up scratching he took that as the best sign he was still alive he slept and dreamed the images kicking in one after another as if his mind were a vehicle that had been thrust into high gear by the adrenalinrush of the war he spoke with the ravaged girl on the bank of the rice paddy she had no eyes but her bare teeth smiled at him in a most disarming manner the darkness of her blind sockets was lit by the phosphorescence of memory like antiaircraft tracers the memories were not of course hers but do ducs played out upon the grisly stage of his childhood mangled by the terror it generated so that by the coming of dawn when he opened his gluey eyelids there remained no pleasant sanctuaries no safe harbors for him to withdraw into there was only the war and the war was where he had chosen to be as if it were a country into which he could disappear like some dissipated expatriate disgusted by life back home which in a sense was just what had happened do duc had taken the first watch but sometime during it he had fallen asleep not to wake up until dawn it was lucky that the enemy had not come upon them in the night distance was obscured by clouds it was as if they were in the cardamom mountain range thousands of feet above sea level instead of being in the low plateau country where the hell are we rock said i dont know do duc said doing some deep kneebends the movement had begun to work the stiffness out of his body in this dense fog i cant tell east from west he took out his compass but it had been smashed sometime during the mission probably during the barrage and was of no use he looked at rock who was sitting on a blasted tree stump his menacing law braced on his right hip i want to get something straight right now so we both know where we stand rock said i dont much care whether or not i get back in fact thinking about it id like it a whole helluva lot better if i didnt the truth is i like it out here away from all the bullshit of the army bureaucracy he spat you know and i know that the bush is where its at when it comes tothis war the bush is where charlie breathes and shits and the bush is where were gonna put his ass in a sling what about support do duc said you cant wage war without it fuck that rock said the kind of support were getting from pentagon east can only get us killed count on it friendly fire or wrong coordinates on a drop or shitstick intelligence about a green zone where charlie is waiting for us alpha bravo he meant an ambush were the ones wholl get it in the neck i cant argue with you there then why go back im out here in the deep bush and im thinking the longer im here the farther out i go the better i like it and dyou know why because i feel safe here i only have to rely on me and on you not a bunch of asswipes in saigon who do not know how to wage war we do and this is where we should be doing it from do duc thought about that for some time theres the mission to think of he said at last you know this mission stinks to high heaven rock said now that its just us theres no harm in talking about it openly what do you mean do duc knew but he wanted to hear rocks version i think weve been put in the middle of a sensitive mi mission that fucked up in a major way do duc nodded i agree but i still want to reach the objective michael leonforte well why not if hes still alive rock took a minute to squash an insect between his thumb and forefinger you know the odds are that this mission is no longer what it once was its occurred to me that it never was what it was supposed to be do duc said all the better rock rose grinning i say lets get the fuck on with it just before noon they stopped to rest in a depression between two long fingers of muddy ground which before the war had perhaps been farmland do duc ached all over if anything the fog had thickened so that it was impossible to see even a meter in any direction all sound was muffled but in truth there was little to hear it had seemed to do duc as if they had been moving across a landscape devoid of any other life as if they themselves had become as insubstantial as ghosts flitting across terrain already beyond their ability to touch or change sensory input dwindled until there was a minimum of sight and sound even the rank stench of the semitropical foliage seemed far away as if dampened by the heavy fog in this state somewhere between consciousness and dreaming it was easy to assess even the minutest change in their immediate environment do duc stopped were not alone in all this shit no one could see us not even with starlights or infrareds rock said nevertheless he hefted his law planting the butt firmly against his right hip ill tell you one thing if charlies here his ass is grass do duc put a hand on his arm dont be hasty it wont help us to blow mr leonforte to kingdom come if charlie or the gwai or whoever the fuck they are are holding him hostage theyll be sure to keep him well away from any incursion do duc was certain that rock was right only he wasnt so sure now that they were working under the correct premise he pointed into the mistshrouded trees this way the doleful drip of moisture enclosed them in a clammy embrace they moved very slowly as if they were underwater or on a planet where the gravity was many times that of earth breathing became laborious and they moved through the jungle with extreme difficulty i imagine its me youve come all this way to find they stood stock still watching as first one then five or six shapes appeared as if conjured out of the trees themselves do duc took a brief look at all of them could they be the gwai but quickly concentrated on the man in front the one who had spoken michael leonforte i presume the man smiled mick will do you recognize me from the photos they showed you back at pentagon east i assume thats where youre from not exactly do duc said answering both questions this michael leonforte was different than the one in the photo bowel had shown him though the more do duc studied him the more the resemblance became apparent were not official like the party pentagon east sent were werewolves mick leonforte grinned science fiction werewolves huh ive heard of you he was surrounded by the lean chinese faces of the nungs and he wore what they wore surplus camouflage fatigues hightopped paratrooper boots web belts all us world war ii stuff they were armed with chicom kfifties like the ones in the cache do duc had found in the bunker none of them wore any insignia not even leonforte but when he held up his left hand for silence do duc saw tattooed on the inside of the wrist a curious image a human face the left side skincolored with its eye open the right side blue with a vertical crescent where the eye should be it passed like a flash as his hand came down it had been small less than three inches in height but the power of it electrified do ducs mind you guysve done some pretty heavy shit in your time mick leonforte said its gonna be a damn shame to kill you do duc feeling rock shift against him said nothing he continued to study leonforte because it was essential now to figure out what had happened to him he had heard of one or two cases of marine officers in charge of cidg montagnards outcountry going native but he suspected that was too facile an answer to the enigma he had only a few disparate clues to go on but he could see by the heightened tension among the nungs that he had very little time my co sent us here to bring you back no surprise there mick leonfone said he had let his hair grow it was as black and lustrous as the hair on the chinese mountain tribesmen who were his companions his full beard was neat but it hardly fell into the guidelines set by army regs his cheeks were a bit hollow and there was something about his eyes a clarity that bordered on the feral which for sure would have disturbed the people back at military intelligence my handlers have been trying to recall me ever since they realized they sent the wrong man to do the wrong job you were dragooned into mi werent you rock said dragooned into mi and all the way through it leonforte said i came out the other side and like alice i found myself in wonderland taking orders from someone called the jabbenvocky he laughed fucking spooks theyve all got names like that jabbenvocky the mad hatter the red queen youre supposed to be a prisoner rock exclaimed what the hell forget mi it was the spooks who sent you on this mission wasnt it do duc said overriding rocks voice thats why the jabbenvocky plucked you out of lbj he thought he had you over a barrel you either did what he told you or hed kick your butt back into jail and lose the key for nights as the jabberwocky put it leonforte laughed but he was looking more shrewdly at do duc yeah that was the gist of it more or less too bad he put the gun to the head of the wrong joe i was brought up to mete out threats not buckle under them my father taught me early how to handle arrogant bastards like that he shrugged made a gesture what the fucks the difference anyway they sent you for my scalp i cant allow that the nungs leveled their kfifties at do duc and rock time to say your prayers assholes for do duc it was time to gamble everything we never had any intention of bringing you back thats a laugh leonforte took a step toward them ran a finger across do ducs forehead is this flop sweat i feel he made a hard sound in the back of his throat why else would you make the trek all the way out here to my territory there it was the confirmation he had been looking for my territory why should we bring you back do duc saidthat would be like cutting the throat of the golden goose wouldnt it the smile came off leonfortes face like the shine off chromium the ensuing silence gathered its own energy until it generated a kind of kinetic buzz that set the short hairs to stirring at the back of do ducs neck golden goose leonforte said in the exact tones in which aladdin might have uttered ali baba sure thats what youre doing leading the gwai this rogue sect of nungs leonfortes eyes opened a bit wider what do you know of the gwai except rumor and hearsay theyre a deeply religious people right now im more concerned with the golden goose do duc said i think thats an apt description for the man whos had the balls to appropriate a vc supply line into the golden triangle how much could that kind of drug trade be worth a year speaking for rock as well as myself i can tell you wed both rather have a piece of this than try to bring you back listen to you leonforte turned to the gwai can you believe him what a mouth he turned back and speaking of balls he drew an american army officers pistol and pressed its muzzle hard against do ducs temple rock made a small move and a gwai jabbed him with a kfifty in the small of his back dont even think about it leonforte said without turning his head lights out gripping the he squeezed the trigger save for the sound of the hammer coming down on an empty chamber nothing happened leonforte his face close to do ducs grinned hugely then he removed the muzzle from do ducs temple and at almost the same time kissed him energetically on each cheek the gwai putting up their weapons began to whoop welcome michael leonforte said to the land of the dead in that eternity between the instant leonfortes finger pulled the trigger and the moment the hammer hit the empty chamber a piece of do ducs past came rushing at him like a train out of control it began with the auras light refracting from the people nearest him as if their skin and flesh had dissolved transforming the remainder into lenses through which he now peered he stared transfixed as if he could see in those pulsating shards of color their very souls laid bare like a corpse on a stainlesssteel slab then came the trilling of the white magpie the birds call expanding and echoing as if it were being simultaneously amplified and heard from a very great distance the magpie big as a child sat on his shoulder preening its long iridescent feathers while its gold and red eye peered at him with intense curiosity if it spoke do duc had the impression the entire episode would explode like a bubble or a dream but it never did and he remained under the spell of the auras ao the nung elder the initiator the shaman of the tribe would often take do duc down the mountain to the wide muddy river where the nungs fished these seemed more like idyllic outings between father and son than preinitiation rites once on a day so hot the sun seemed to sting do ducs bare flesh ao trapped a crocodile and riding its ridged back while do duc had looked on agog with electric fear he had pried open those mighty jaws inserted a thick polished stick and had rendered the beast harmless ao settled do duc on the crocs back placing his palms against the armorlike crests of its spine do duc his heart in his mouth could hear the thunder of his heartbeat the rushing of his blood in his inner ears and then for no good reason he could think of ao shoved him far over so that his head was hanging just above the crocs face he had peered into the beasts reptilian eyes what was it he was supposed to see there even now recollecting the moment with utter clarity he could not say for certain yet the suspicion remained that he had been meant to seek out a kindred spirit in a beast because he could not find one among humans others might find that to be a horrible notion but not do duc it had been he alone who had watched ao plunge a knife into the crocs brain midway between those eyes that regarded do duc if not with outright curiosity then at least with interest that evening while watching the nungs feast on the roasted meat which he had helped ao strip from the bones do duc felt the onset of the aura and he remembered the white magpie crying in the trees as if offended by his hands ruddy with the reptiles blood for the first time since he had come to the nungs do duc disobeyed ao submitting willingly almost eagerly to the punishment he was certain the white magpie had meant for him it was the first time he became aware of sin not the sin the loathsome catholic missionaries preached with such peremptory zeal but a sin against the natural order if the white magpie had not spoken to do duc there was in its eye the corona of desire the halo of divinity the thomed garland of sin and even when he went to his own priesthood with the nung elders he kept a secret part of himself free pure for the holy trine the white magpie had tucked away in its heart of hearts at his initiation he had been required to hunt and kill a crocodile much as ao had done thirteen months before he was obliged to bring back its bloody meat in strips for the celebratory feast so that all of them elder and initiate could share in its strength do duc had gone alone as was dictated and he found his crocodile a monstrous beast lying like a log in the still waters of the song ba what a magnificent creature it was utterly placid yet ready as a drawn bow to snap the bones of anything that crossed its path the stillness and the power it was just this juxtaposition do duc was certain the white magpie meant for him to understand what human could teach him this and other like mysteries not even the nung priests none instead of killing the crocodile he had spoken to it as the magpie had once spoken to him through its radiant eye and he had climbed astride the crocs back gliding with it through the leechinfested water until he came upon one of the catholic missionaries who so badgered the lowland people with their talk of god and the devil and hellfire and eternal damnation these missionaries who were so disdainful of the forest so disconnected from their environment their world was rome and nothing more the priest had come down the muddy bank to cool himself in the brown water and the crocodile launching itself forward with appalling speed had caught his bare ankle had held him long enough for do duc to stop his screaming by killing him languid once more the croc had watched patiently as do duc skinned the missionary cut slabs of meat off the chest and back only when he was finished did the beast roll what was left down into the water dragging it beneath the surface what strange strength flowed into the elders that night as they feasted on the fresh meat do duc had triumphantly brought them in do ducs ears the shrill cries of the white magpie reverberated like an aria as smiling he consumed the fragrant roasted flesh with the others i could have killed you both mick leonforte said maybe i should have you wont be sorry we joined you rock said it with such conviction that leonforte stared at him for a long time at last he said you dont know the whole story after you do well see what measures have to be taken so were on probation rock said youll be stone dead unless you can accept certain precepts that may be hard for you to swallow thats certainly been the case before before do duc said you mean the party the spooks at pentagon east sent out after you see im god here leonforte said just as if he hadnt heard a word do duc had said he lifted his hands to include the gwai who squatted with them in the bush they were eating a simple midday meal of dried salted fish and cold sticky riceballs which to do duc and rock tasted like manna from heaven after the charlie rats just ask my subjects again do duc saw that it would be easy for someone from pentagon east to assign a madness tag to leonforte dww they called it dangerous when wet he had no doubt that this was how he was currently viewed by those in saigon who were aware of him that was a dangerously easy and spurious conclusion to draw maybe it was what had gotten the pentagon east party killed do duc knew that this conclusion would certainly get him and rock dead right quick if he persisted in it i liked what you said about the golden goose leonforte said now what do you know about the pipeline from the golden triangle only what ive deduced do duc said my co told me jackshit about it although im now convinced hes at least aware of it what makes you say that first hes very well connected at pentagon east do duc paused a moment i often wondered about that i mean hes not a career army man far from it he was a college professor before he got bored with life and enlisted whats he doing cozying up to the big honchos at hq he licked salt off his fingertips second my orders were to extract you from your environment and bring you back to my co not to pentagon east he grunted that also didnt sound kosher not until i met you and figured out you were on a spook run then everything started falling into place if my co had been a civilian spook say a recruiter for the company on his college campus it would all make sense his being sent incountry being assholebuddies with pentagon east his outfit being given the assignment of bringing you back wanting me to deliver you to him personally a slow smile spread over leonfortes face you know do duc i believe i made the right choice not blowing your brains out he got up brushed kernels of rice off his fatigues the gwai followed suit do duc rising with them was more acutely aware than ever of being under leonfortes control lets get going leonforte said theres something back at base i want you to see they arrived just before sunset color was lavishly splashed across the cloudswollen sky and the treetops appeared to be swords of stained glass birds flitted nervously among the branches and some distance away do duc could hear the low warning growl of a large predator a tiger perhaps leonfortes camp was both more and less than he had imagined while it was composed of houses rather than pitched tents these hootches were ramshackle and mean in a way that spoke of poverty and suffering plainly beyond western understanding the stench of refuse and offal was so strong it soon became an acrid taste in the back of their mouths almost immediately and without a sign from leonforte that do duc could see the gwai broke up only one stayed with them as leonforte led them toward one hootch that seemed more substantial than the others do duc assumed this was leonfortes own place but he was wrong and it was the last time he allowed preconceived notions to cloud his assessment of the man the hootch was in fact a jail it was occupied by one man a caucasian in black vc pajamas though he was obviously without the insignia of rank it was most obvious by his posture and mien that he was a military man this the spook rock asked leonforte nodded the mad hatter the man stared at them mutely defiantly he was tanned and fit tall and thin he seemed a bit put out by the low ceiling of his jail but that was all his piercing blue eyes studied them seemingly without prejudice but do duc did not mistake this mask for indifference he led the first party to come looking for me do duc was going to ask what happened to the rest until he realized this man was the answer he was the only one in leonfortes jail the others had never been heard from again they were dead do duc understood then the mortal line which michael leonforte had crossed and the enormity of the step he and rock would be taking should they decide to link up with this man no wonder he thought of himself as a god he had transgressed the law of man with a vengeance to do that it was imperative he know he was beyond the law what are you going to do with him rock asked in that almost gentle tone that do duc had come to identify as his killing voice i havent decided yet rock took a step toward the cage within which the mad hatter was imprisoned looking him hard in the eye he said i have an idea do duc did not object to what rock had in mind because it would cement their relationship with mick leonforte leonforte himself was impressed with the plan because it at once increased the power of his spell over the gwai and therefore the pipeline while it bound these two to him in a manner that was as close to irrevocable as the human condition could get it also appealed to him for the kind of message it would send back to the jabberwocky when they get a load of this rock had said theyll think twice about sending anyone else after us he instructed the gwai to tie the mad hatter to a rectangle of bamboo then squatting over him he had begun asking him questions this was something of a ruse rock suggested that they make the mad hatter believe that they wanted access to the spook secrets filed in his brain the fact was they wanted simply to make an example of him to alter him significantly enough so that when he was dumped onto pentagon easts doorstep the red queen would take immediate notice we could kill him rock had told them but thats so final and the message coufd be misconstrued whos to say that charlie didnt do this to him no we need to send a stronger message pack him up like a party favor and deliver him from evil so that hes got a story to tell the red queen so he can mislead them about what were up to hell be able to do it far more convincingly than we ever could do duc was impressed with rocks thinking it would drive the spooks crazy to think they were out in the boonies setting up their own business in heisted military secrets commerce was the one thing spooks understood better than anyone else it didnt matter if you were a capitalist or a marxist a fascist or an anarchist it was the prime directive of spookdom commerce transcends ideology so he and michael leonforte watched in fascination as rock went to work on the mad hatter interrogating him for hours on end using light and sound in concert in between bouts of intense pain persuasion absorbing the process which rock conducted as if it were a medical protocol do duc felt an odd sensation stirring the short hairs at the back of his neck no way had rock learned this discipline in the big dead one his former infantry outfit he felt as if a supposedly welltrained pit bull had suddenly slipped its leash and was now gnashing its teeth in thejiearby underbrush apparently leonforte had the same thought because on one of their breaks from their newest spectator sport he said to do duc he learn this shit in the werewolves never learned it in the werewolves do duc replied they were at the latrine urinating into the damp morass below them i bet your co knows how to slip between the slats of consciousness like this bowel i dont see that why would he have a small science fiction outfit and not be with the other honchos at pentagon east spookthink leonforte said buttoning his fly hed be nearer the action able to move on any mission he needed to without questions being asked also no one would suspect who he really was maybe do duc said adjusting his trousers and maybe youre seeing spooks hanging like bananas in the trees let me tell you something leonforte said as they turned back to the hootch where rock was tirelessly trying to slip between the slats of the mad hatters consciousness in the business you and your pal just bought into youd better be looking for spooks in the trees otherwise youre liable to be courtmartialed and executed before you can invent a defense they returned to the hootch the stench of fear sweat and fecal matter hung in the air like a spiders web they could see rocks back he had taken off his blouse and his heavy muscles were oiled with sweat bunched as he performed his work do duc could see that he had a small blade in his right hand and with a surgeons precision was making incisions in the mad hatters face hearing them enter rock said i want to make sure he never forgets what we wanted from him there was a peculiar sound a kind of spinechilling susurrus that resolved itself into a soft sobbing interspersed with an animals panting as he moved closer do duc got a full view of what rock was doing the mad hatters teeth were clenched and as rock worked on him they ground together as puffs of agonized sound distended his cheeks that was as much as do duc cared to see he nodded to leonforte and together they moved out of the miasma into the sticky late afternoon light lets make arrangements with the gwai to get him back to pentagon east he said your friend rocks certainly a workaholic you dont know the half of it do duc said but it seems all of us here like this work more than your average joe leonforte laughed its like my father says nothing beats the capitalist spirit for rock i think this enterprise transcends money or power its somehow spiritual like the holy grail yeah i know what you mean leonforte said wiping his forehead with his sleeve i get the impression he could work on the mad hatter another couple of days i dont think thats such a hot idea do duc said what would be left to tell you the truth leonforte replied i dont want to find out do duc watched him as he spoke to the gwai it was decided theyd take the mad hatter back incountry at first light tomorrow now lets get down to business partner he said when leonforte had dismissed the gwai i want to know exactly how you cut charlie out of his own drug pipeline leonforte threw his head back and laughed long and hard he said you still dont get it do you what the fuck dyou mean do duc was already a little pissed off being made the butt of a joke he didnt get you stepped into it bigtime do duc this pipeline from the shan states is the motheriode it isnt charlies never was its being run by unclefuckingsam the whole stinking wars being funded through this mother you mean the united states government owns and operates an opium pipeline you must be out of your mind if by the government you mean congress or the joint chiefs of staff no that would be an insane notion leonforte said no i mean a clique of highlevel officials from all branches of government the military judiciary legislative executive a subrosa organization at work for their own purposes which are power leonforte said thats all any of them care about possessing the power to manipulate events people governments economies power and the circumvention of the law the groups even got a name it calls itself lookingglass how dyou know all this i was sent out here to monitor this motheriode for lookingglass but i got one look at it and decided this was the opportunity of a lifetime so i liberated it i dont think lookingglass should have all the goodies for itself leonforte laughed again why dyou think the jabberwockys so damned anxious to bring me back this is all bullshit do duc said you with your record would be about the last person lookingglass or anyone else for that matter would trust with monitoring the biggest drug pipeline in asia leonfortes eyes sparked as he laughed ive got friends in high places he said or at least i did and ive got a brother who watches over me like a guardian angel do duc stood very still the sweat running down him in rivulets for a long moment his mind was paralyzed he felt numb with the implications he noted with interest that leonforte had said brother not father what of the famous hotshit mafia boss as bowel had referred to him frank leonforte and now youve fucked these guys in a major way why leonforte shrugged this jungle does something to you as a vietnamese you should understand because youve been close to it all your life theres power in these mountains it infects the blood like the bite of a vampire and i thought why should i be an errand boy for lookingglass when i can be monarch of this realm he laughed again besides do duc its a rush to fuck with peoples heads when you know theres nothing they can do about it do duc said if what youre telling me is the truth lookingglass wont let you get away with it theyll bring in an entire division to weed you out leonforte smirked really tell me how many regular army units would have to be rerouted how many officers would get wind of a mass movement like that and in a priorityone outcountry hot zone like laos no way he was smiling now besides i got a deal going with my brother its no sweat do duc was thinking this through he thought of how batshit pentagon east had gone at leonfortes mia sheet how they had brought out pattern activity surveillance on a massive scale to get a line on this one man and how they had chosen bowels elite werewolves to go in and bring him home and then he thought of bowels directive to extract leonforte by any means possible and he knew something had gone wrong he took a breath said i want you to know something my orders were to bring you back one way or another lookingglass leonforte said nodding they sent this other bastard after me too so what i dont think it was lookingglass do duc said see my co was very specific he told me i had to deliver you to him not to the people at pentagon east i thought it oddat the leonforte stared at him for a moment he blinked as if he could not believe his ears at last he said softly who gave you those orders my co bud powell my brother leonforte said as if invoking one of the names of god powell works for my brother inside lookingglass my fucking brother has turned against me he turned away for a moment his shoulders hunched as if against a chill wind only he could feel when he turned round again he seemed in some subtle way changed his eyes glittered and burned as if reflecting firelight and seeing this do duc listened with all his attention when leonforte said to him this changes everything including your role in this deepening shadow play book two ancient enemies the truth about a man lies first and foremost in what he hides andre malraux six venice tokyo washington when celeste awoke the demon and the kanfa bridge had vanished she took a deep shuddering breath and blinked like someone awakening from a nightmare she found herself sprawled on the cool stone floor of a vast windowless room that seemed to have been hewn out of the heart of the palazzo there was no furniture in this space but seven enormous brass candelabra ringed them the ash of hemp or perhaps the mushroom of which nicholas had spoken mingling with the muddy residue of yellowish tallow she saw nicholas his back to her crouched and silent in the center of the room where the apex of the horrid bridge had been he was naked to the waist as if his battle had stripped him of his shirt and jacket she could see the bunched muscles of his shoulders and upper back the faint expansion and contraction ol his ribs nicholas he did not answer her slowly her breathing returned to normal she became aware that the walls were hung with ancient flemish tapestries depicting hunting scenes in one the prey was a delicate silvery unicorn in another it was a horned dragon spitting bright acidic flame for a long time she stared dazed at the powerful mounts of the hunters their round eyes wild with fear and the scent of blood the tragedy of it is tanzan nangi thought that it ends here in tokyo a place that was alien to her a place she could not understand let alone like the place that finally came between her and nicholas nangi stood looking down at the closed coffin which lay in the side chapel of st theresas the single roman catholic church in shinjuku four blocks west of the wide meijidori this was nangis church the place of worship he had introduced justine to when she was at a low ebb in her life for a while at least it had seemed some form of solace for her but not lately lately it appeared she had taken up with her old friend and boss rick millar justines face composed relaxed now in death as it hadnt been for many years in life acted like a mirror reflecting facets of recent history which until the moment he had watched the police and fire units disentangling what was left of justine and millar from the charred remains of the car had eluded him how was he to know that rick millar asking to find justine again had wanted to take her back with him to america how was he to know that after spending the night with him justine would accept nangi tried to look away from her face but could not just as he tried to hate her for what she had done to his friend and could not not simply because he was a devout christian or shintoist but because he so well understood the many layers of human relationships because he also had to ask himself what nicholas had done to her to drive her into another mans promises of love and protection he stirred hearing a taped choir begin its ritual of psalms no less holy or beautiful for being prerecorded of course he knew part of the answer tautau he had sensed what nicholas had perhaps not that justine was profoundly terrified of what nicholas would become once the legacy of his mother had been revealed to him once he took the first step down the path to becoming tanjian even nangi had little knowledge of the mysteries to which nicholas had been exposed up on the hodaka that sheer face of ice and snow in the japanese alps where he had been taught by his mentor and his enemy kansatsu nangi only knew that whatever transpired there nicholas had returned a changed man he was ready now to burrow into himself to find the secret of his people no matter how dark how terrifying nangi and nicholas spoke of many things were close friends shared secrets and fears and triumphs without reservation save the tautau whose workings were forbidden to outsiders nangt could understand this even admire the bonds of discipline that veiled nicholass inner heart from even those closest to him but he was quite certain that justine could not nicholas trusted her as he did no other and so he had taken for granted that she would understand just as he had been sure she would come to love japan as he did that he had been wrong on both counts was not so much a surprise as a tragedy and here nangi thought now as his gaze caressed the form inside the coffin is the ultimate result this was her karma i should have seen it he felt tears burning his eyes but he would not lift a hand to wipe them away he wanted to feel their heat their weight their slightly acid sting as they slid down his cheeks not only for himself but for nicholas who was not here and must never know the true nature of his wifes last thirtysix hours he leaned a bit more heavily on his walking stick its carved dragons head digging into the palm of his hand did see it he thought now and i did nothing but what was there to do who would listen who ever believes their own fate what happened was meant to happen the choir swelled to a passionate crescendo the trained voices magnified by the stone chapel and the clever acoustics that brought to the sharp ears of the priests even the clandestine whispers of sinners nangi became aware that he was no longer alone in the chapel with justine he turned his leg paining him and saw seiko nicholass assistant she somehow made him think of gelda justines sister and only living relative he had tried all morning to locate her in the states to no avail she had apparently dropped out of sight seiko came silently toward him oniy when she was certain that he had recognized her pardon me for disturbing you nangisan she said bowing but you wished to hear news of linneafsan as soon as we received any nangi listened intently aware that she averted her eyes from the coffin was it merely the buddhists abhorrence of burial rather than a clean cremation or was there some other reason because he had been justines friend and sometimes confidant he knew of her suspicions that nicholas and seiko were having an affair he did his best to calm her assuring her of nicholass loyalty to her but sensing the depths of seikos anxiety here he could not help but wonder where the truth lay linnearsan is no longer in venice seiko said what he checked out hurriedly late last night what forwarding address did he leave none apparently seiko said she was worrying her lower lip with her small white teeth the hotels concierge has no idea where he went nangi watched her for a long moment and this scrutiny made her all the more nervous perhaps she would have preferred to continue this conversation out on the impersonal sunlit street but nangi only now becoming aware of how much he had missed immersed in the minutiae of business would not allow it tension he had invariably found was a fecund medium for inadvertent revelation how often did you leave messages for him he asked three times and he never answered no sir so the last time you had any communication with linnearsan was when he left the office the day of his departure for venice he caught the slight hesitation turned it over in his mind as if it were a vintage wine ripe for tasting no sir i met him at the airport just before flight time was this at his request no sir seiko shifted from one foot to another her deep brown eyes moved and in their movement was revealed the wall between herself and justine after unnearsan left for the day i received a coded fax from vincent tinh in saigon it seemed urgent enough to get it to him before he left for venice nangi noticed that seiko had begun to perspire though he felt no particular heat inside the chapel in fact it was quite cool he held out his hand and she put into it a copy of the coded fax he read it twice without comment as he always did any document that entered his purview on the surface there seemed nothing alarming obviously nicholas had agreed since he had not contacted nangi about it what do you make of this he asked abruptly this time seiko was ready for him in linnearsans absence i faxed vincent tinh to ask for clarification on this one point regarding the shadow government in saigon she said i got no reply as to that im not at all surprised nangi said though he was pleased with her initiative this was just the kind of action nicholas was training her for tinh surely wouldnt have had time to follow up on the rumors that is not what i mean seiko said licking her lips i have received no return fax at all from tinhsan the voices all sopranos now were building to another crescendo and mounting it the confluence of heavenly sound repeating ever more slowly began to die away until at last it was held in the air only by acoustics and echo nangi took his time digesting the possible ramifications of this bit of unsettling news i think he said we had better return to the office immediately and see if we can locate vincent tinh it was bright outside the sky a lusterless white without shape of cloud or brilliance of sun it was as if they were inside a glass sphere entombed within a postmodern megalopolis that lay beyond the glass and reinforced steel skyrises all around them still they were obliged to squint even for the short walk across the sidewalk to nangis chauffeurdriven bmw limo he stood there with her for a moment while the driver held the rear door open justine had confided in him her fears about an affair between nicholas and seiko nangi had done his best to reassure her but justine had seemed oblivious to rational argument and why should she be he knew from experience that love was not so ephemeral a thing as most people supposed it was solid even weighty with its own imperatives which like a layer of makeup drew transformations from out of thin air the areola of love was like the kiss of an angel invisible in itself yet discernible by the intimations of its eminence the tangled expression on seikos face was articulate even if the rest of her was not all at once he understood justines concerns could view them as something more than fictional seikos relationship with nicholas was something more than assistant to boss what it was he was powerless to say but its mere existence was evidence enough that he should be attentive and reactive he turned to seiko if there is a problem in saigon im going to need your expertise i want you to be prepared she gave him a curiously formal bow i am honored nangisan inside the car as it drove off he handed her a small filigreed sterlingsilver pillbox it was of english manufacture a fine example of western turnofthecentury silversmithing it had been a present from nicholas and it was important to him but not as important as a human being seiko held the pillbox in her open palm her eyes filled with its beauty she knew of its existence even something of its history and her hand trembled slightly to hold it seikosan nangi said i want you to take care of this for me and when her eyes met his questioning he went on for some time it has been empty i no longer need the pills it used to hold and i think you will agree it is not the same without something to fill it up the car slowed in heavy traffic a haze was building as the shortening afternoon blurred into an early winter twilight blue and gray and umber somewhere a police siren sounded cutting through even the efficient soundproofing of the bmw it seems to me that you have something of significance with which to fill this box he said into the growing silence something precious something as yet tentative that requires its own time its own place something to put away yet not to forget he knew by the expression in her eyes that she understood all the implications that he had divined her love for nicholas that he did not necessarily disapprove that she must nevertheless ensure that it did not interfere with what she must do for nicholas and for him at sato international with a great deal of reverence seiko slowly opened the pillbox stared down into it for long moments before swinging closed the lid she put the box carefully away words cannot adequately express my feelings nangisan she said quietly and both of them were so caught up in the moment that they failed to notice the white toyota that swung in behind them as they lurched through the intersection at the meijidori and which followed them all the way back to the shinjuku suiryu building sato internationals headquarters it was not going to be easy getting in to see davis munch gaunt decided after his third hour of the federal bureaucratic runaround even with all his ins and knowing the right people to go to to cut through the red tape he was having no luck munch the pentagon special investigator seconded to ranee banes strategic economic oversight committee was a busy man not only that he had apparently decided that he did not want to see gaunt that was something of a deterrent but in the end gaunt had already vowed it wasnt going to stop him from seeing munch nothing was he had taken some time after his thoroughly unpleasant meeting with terry mcnaughton to review his options as the lobbyist had outlined them he had headed down to the c o canal towpath in georgetown always his favorite spot to clear his head of the political doublespeak and figure out a plan of attack it was peaceful there reminding him of the best times he had spent in this citadel of influence the real reason he had wanted to make a life for himself in government and how that reason had gotten submerged in the daytoday power struggles endemic to washington this was shark city where even people who purported to be your friends would turn on you at the first sign of political pressure he had walked along the potomac deep in thought despite mcnaughtons dire warnings he was not yet about to abandon ship leaving a friend and he certainly considered nicholas linnear a friend to the wolves was just not his style for one thing what would his father have said for another he owed nicholas plenty for believing in him when he supposed even he had given up on himself nicholas had found him some time after a rather nasty political purge had flung him out of his cozy white house sinecure stupidly he had taken it personally against convention and sound advice as old as george washington he had tried to mount a counterattack in the process he had made several highpowered enemies who had closed the doors of state and commerce to him departments which would have otherwise remained open to take this particular political orphan in only a minor post in defense beancounting thirdworld arms sales was offered him a job too mean and humiliating even to contemplate those were the days in which as far as he was concerned washington was the only town that mattered nicholas had proven him wrong now he wouldnt take a political post here for anything only in hindsight did he realize that he had been quit here even before nicholas had convinced him to move to new york how ironic that in nicholass defense he was obliged to return he stared into the slowmoving waters of the potomac and knew he couldnt jump ship he also knew that mcnaughtons second option going down with the ship was out of the question so where did that leave him only one path to tread and he was on it now searching for davis munch he found him eventually hiding out in a vietnamese restaurant in falls church virginia after a contact at the pentagon had told him that munch had logged out to state for the afternoon gaunt had looked up an old acquaintance of his josie rand who worked for one of states myriad deputy assistants she was able to determine that munch had a meeting with the assistant secretary of east asian and pacific affairs but as far as she could determine the two were not in the building it had taken gaunt a good twenty minutes to work out his approach to the assistant secretarys office and make his preparations state was like a tiny medieval fiefdom the momentary solons jealously guarding both their power and their perquisites outsiders were invariably treated with either derision or suspicion or both the assistant secretarys junior assistant was a young man fairhaired and freshfaced who was just learning which ropes would swing him across the quicksand and which would bring him down into it he was just the man for gaunt who approached him in that manner only someone who had been inside the corridors of power could summon up he remembered to put that slightly southern drawl he had all but lost during his time in new york back into his voice brock peters presidential attache gaunt said thrusting out his hand to the junior assistant while giving him a steely eye he had patted a battered briefcase he had borrowed from josie rand papers from the potus for the assistant secretary potus an acronym for president of the united states was used only by white house staff and those closest to the president the junior assistant had jumped up with such alacrity that gaunt had had to stifle a grin the the assistant secretary is currently unavailable the young man stammered if youll log in ill take possession of the material that steely eye from gaunt froze the junior assistant in his tracks son these papers are eyes only scare up the assistant secretary for me pronto the junior assistant swallowed hard but the assistant secretarys not currently in the building ive had no call from the white house alerting me to eyes only documents gaunt sneered dont be ridiculous son the white house is not in the habit of broadcasting dissemination of eyes only material the junior assistant was all but standing at military attention now he was very frightened yes sir but i dont son youd better get this through that thick skull of yours when the potus sends out eyes only material he expects it to be read immediately do i make myself clear gaunt had within fifteen seconds he had been given the name and address of the vietnamese restaurant at which the assistant secretary was being treated to lunch by davis munch the place a vinecovered stone building that had once been some kind of mill was situated in a picturesque setting amid linden and aider trees a brook burbled merrily hidden behind the trees but the top of a wooden waterwheel was visible above a low wall of arborvitae the path from the parking area to the restaurant itself was lined with oleander and clematis inside the restaurant was unnaturally dark with a low beamed ceiling and a heavy stone floor buddhas and other vietnamese artifacts peppered the walls the vietnamese maitre d glided up and gaunt asked for munch who he imagined had made the reservation it was well after the prime lunch hour when almost all the diners were on coffee or just bullshitting while the tables were cleared lam so sorry mr munch cannot be disturbed the maitre d said portentously in a heavy accent he did not look as if he was in the least sorry hell see me gaunt said slipping the maitre d a fiftydollar bill ah of course the vietnamese said smiling he nodded toward a table in the far left corner then promptly disappeared into the kitchen gaunt stopped at the bar ordered a beer stood drinking it for a time while he watched the two men at the table the assistant secretary was easy to spot he had that polished look so coveted at state a tall man with dosecut graying hair a hawk nose and the blue eyes of the patrician his companion davis munch was short and dark with the body and mien of a prizefighter his shoulders were hunched his head stuck forward as be spoke the intensity he emitted was apparent to gaunt halfway across the room gaunt thought he would much rather have to take on the assistant secretary he waited patient as the buddha sitting crosslegged on a wall niche not far from where the two men talked once the assistant secretary reached into his attache case pulled out a sheaf of onionskin paper with the telltale blue filaments running vertically through it eyes only documents he pushed the sheaf across the table to the investigator who scanned them quickly apparently at the assistant secretarys instigation munch stopped at the fourth sheet read it more carefully in a moment the assistant secretary began to answer a battery of questions at last the lunch was over munch put the sheaf of onionskins away called for the check he paid in cash asked for a receipt the two men rose shook hands the assistant secretary went off to the mens room and munch went out to find his car gaunt followed him out the front door halfway down the path he called to him munch stopped turned to look at gaunt as he came unhurriedly down the path gaunt introduced himself his name brought a smile to munchs thin lips what brings you to washington a week before the committee sits in judgement of you gaunt gaunt could see that munch wasnt going to make it easy for him but then why should he he was in the business of rubbing peoples noses in their own shit he probably thought of it as a perk of the job talking to you would be one of the reasons he said munch grunted turned and began to hurry down the path bad timing im afraid im on my way back to a highlevel meeting at the pentagon you shouldve gone through my office that would be fruitless your assistant said you were permanently in a meeting you would have done well to listen to him the parking lot was still and quiet not a breath of air was stirring and a kind of heavy somnolence had invaded the late autumn as if time had reversed itself and summer had returned but there was no sound of insects or birds and this lack gave the whole a peculiar surreal quality but i didnt and im here now im wondering how you pulled off that particular trick but no matter he took out the keys to his governmentissue ford i have nothing to say to you except that you pulled a losing hand this time he inserted the key opened the door leaning past him gaunt slammed the door shut get out of my face munch said gaunt put himself between the investigator and the ford not until i get some answers from you ready to take me on munch said taking a stance i was golden gloves champ in the service if i have to i will gaunt replied but id rather buy you a beer munch came in low leading with a left jab and gaunt blocked it felt a numbing pain in his lower forearm he countered with a quick uppercut that snapped munchs head back and he was cheered that was before munch made a helluva feint to the right lashed a counterpunch to his ribs gaunt felt the breath whoosh out of him but he battled on landing a soft ineffectual punch on munchs shoulder while missing entirely munchs movement inside his guard the next moment he found himself flat on his back looking up at munch he had no memory of the blow that had landed him there but there was a pain in his jaw munch laughed relaxing suddenly he offered his strong callused hand pulled gaunt slowly to his feet yeah well what the hell he said im out here five minutes and im already thirsty inside at the bar he said til tell you something gaunt its been a long time since i found someone willing to stand up to me believe it or not these days the governments full of pussies gaunt rubbed the side of his jaw which was still somewhat numb not like when i was in harness here white house staff right gaunt nodded winced at the resultant pain as they poured their beers i liked it well enough until i got caught in the gears and couldnt see it for what it was i know what you mean munch said my sister was in the navy got caught up with a bunch of drunk tailhooks got slapped around groped god knows what else by a gauntlet of the navys finest he gave a harsh laugh she got caught in the gears too a real careerkiller nobody likes a whistleblower they downed long drafts were silent for some time the sounds of the waiters and busboys going about their duties hardly intruded gaunt felt a sudden pain in the side of his jaw where he supposed munchs knockout punch had landed and feeling around in there discovered he was bleeding he excused himself went to the mens room to wash out his mouth and take a look in the mirror it looked like the gum not a tooth you okay munch asked on his return just a little bleeding gaunt said gingerly touching his cheek nothing to worry about if you say so munch ordered them another round of beers i know why you came to see me i wasnt going to tell you dick but we have something in common you and i and because of that im going to tell you to turn tail and get the hell out of your company now while you can get clear he held up a hand no dont interrupt me i wont answer questions he finished off his beer sat staring straight ahead at a photo of saigon as it had been in the s heres what i can tell you wed heard persistent rumors that a version of the hive computer that your company and hyrotechinc were working on had begun to appear on the black market in taiwan bangkok singapore we were able to get our hands on one and i traced the item back to saigon where it was manufactured there i lost the trail i dont have the contacts i need there no one in this fuckedup government does one of our problems he saw gaunt still worrying the side of the jaw where he had hit him handed over a handkerchief press it against the bleeding he said then anyway weve vetted everyone at hyrotechinc its a small concern so no trouble there it was a waste of time and i knew it hyrotechinc doesnt have the capacity or capital to manufacture these computers here and especially in southeast asia where it has no presence al all that left satotomkin which opened facilities in saigon opened a year ago gaunt said hardly enough time to ramp up any computer to market let alone something as technologically advanced as a hive clone the investigator ignored him this meeting i just had with the assistant secretary for east asian and pacific affairs at state was the clincher he provided me with copies of coded faxes from the satotomkin hq in saigon to the home office in tokyo state spent six days breaking the code all the faxes concern the hive clones which satotomkin has dubbed the chi project now he turned to look at gaunt said i dont need you to confirm what i already know that the chi project is under the sole control of nicholas linnear seven venice tokyo the head sat upon an eighteenthcentury palladian armoire its dark intelligent eyes staring straight at the man who stood slightly stooped over hands in his pockets studying the object dominic goldoni leon waxman said allowing a bit of awe to creep into his voice madonna ive dreamed of seeing you like this so quiet drained of fluids embalmed like a trophy by god you are a trophy dominic if only you could see the gim the sacred crescent in the center of your foreheadl his laughter shivered off the walls of the hotel room you taught me all about the gim do duc when you defected came in from the jungles of laos where michael and rock were reaping what should have been mine when i became head of lookingglass i thought i could finally regain control of those deserters waxman was silent for a moment but his body shook dangerously with emotion but michael and rock are still out there running things in their floating city even you cant find them he bit his lower lip i had a hell of a time getting it here do duc fujiru said indicating the head he wanted to get off the subject of his failures it was ironic really i set the thing in a bed of nails one of many such crates in a shipment of construction materials waxman turned and a slow strange smile crept over his face prime zanni dominic would have appreciated the name i gave you the clever chameleonesque venetian servant yet another reflection of lookingglass it was a curious thing waxmans face like an artifact one discovers quite by accident in a longlost temple the wide round eyes were so deep set they seemed ringed with purple flesh above a shallow sloping forehead a widows peak dark as night thrust as aggressively as the jaw at the opposite end of the face i see florida was good for you all that sun and surf and american girls after what youve been through you deserved the r and r id rather have been in laos yes you did leave rather a mess behind in hollywood despite its obvious age there was nothing brittle about waxmans face nothing dried up or slack but for all the strength there it was a grotesque face lopsided with severed nerves in one cheek and under one eye the woman i married was cover i did what was necessary waxman seemed to accept the explanation you had no trouble getting to goldoni as it happens it was simple when it came to dominic goldoni nothing was ever simple waxmans eyes opened wide for a moment youd do well to remember that why hes dead and its over do duc lounged against an overwrought louis xv credenza which fairly dripped gilt the extreme luxury of this hotel suite made him uneasy dead yes waxman said but its not over yet not until i have access to the power he possessed he reached out a hand and as he did so his naked wrist slid out from the cuff of his shirt on its inner side was a tattoo of a human face the left side skincolored with its eye open the right side blue with a vertical crescent where the eye should be those fucking goldonis just dont want to give it up waxman withdrew his hand but hes the last male whos left two sisters and his daughters nothing he was moving now walking to one side of the armoire peering again at the head from that direction i like it better when hes looking right at me he said moving back do duc said nothing he understood the goddamned head still had an aura faint and growing fainter all the time but even so the thing was dead dominic was a murderer and a betrayer he deserved this fate he shrugged and his teeth clacked together a sound that unnerved most people but what does that matter now ive done what had to be done what others said was impossible but i knew him better than most yes how volatile he could be how above all he loved his sister margarite and his goddaughter better than his own children perhaps strange but then that was dominic his teeth clacked together in a kind of atonal rhythm i would have given five years of my life to see his face when our informer delivered the message that tony d was not only beating margarite but francine as well waxman grunted lucky for us he didnt have a stroke on the spot but he wanted to see his beloved sister and goddaughter and the wttsec rules be damned i knew he would i felt it here he pounded his chest where he felt it i knew he turned again to look at the head thats how i got you bastard love became your end do duc said nothing merely regarded waxman with lambent halfclosed eyes you got the information from him waxman said with that abrupt change of subject even his closest associates found disconcerting eventually i got the real name of his source do duc said and when waxman gave him a glance he added i bled him like a grape he gave me all he had then im in waxman laughed as he resumed his contemplation of the head think of it goldonis secret the source of all his hidden power he whispered the awe returning to his voice til say this for him do duc said he led us a merry chase bastard it was shot out of waxman like a mouthful of bile fucking goldonis too much was never enough for them that sonuvabitch dominic what kinds of fucking dreams did that rat bastard have that he decided to turn on us what he leaked to the feds when he was in witsec the new capi dom betrayed nothing compared to what he did behind my back the sonuvabitch he betrayed me made a deal with mikio okami and the two of them set out to cut lookingglass off at the knees waxman abruptly turned away from the head impaled do duc with his gaze but that dominic i gotta admit he was some kind of genius he fooled all of us first he makes us believe hes a part of lookingglass then when we negotiate to expand lookingglass worldwide he becomes a part of the godaishu he whirled on the head his face red with fury he struck the head a heavy blow sending it careening into the corner of the room where it lay grotesquely on its crown what the fuck happened to you dominic what were you and your partner okami planning why did you betray us memory and emotion combined to make him tremble as if he were ill then he turned away while do duc retrieved the head set it back on top of the armoire upside down with its aura it disturbed him all at once waxmans expression softened i can see from the gim he said staring into dominic goldonis dark intelligent eyes that you did your thing with him yes he chuckled must be scaring the shit out of lillehammer right about now i wouldnt doubt it do duc said watch out for him hell want to skin you alive im counting on it do duc said i know thats why i chose him to head the investigation the two of you need to meet again waxman grunted and you had fun he said i suppose it hasnt changed any no rituals never do thats part of their strength and a measure of their comfort youre wrong do duc said i dont need comfort waxman pursed his lips we alt need comfort now and again only the dead can forgo it he was right of course there had been the girl do duc would never say a word about her existence or what he had done to her that wouldnt be smart she had been a risk a risk for more power but do duc lived with risk thrived on it as others did peace and quiet because he didnt have to concentrate with her in the same way he had had to do with dominic goldoni the ritual he took part in with her was different he hadnt needed to dissect her mind and extract information she became kshira the path with goldoni he had had to placate the gods damp down the psychic engines to avoid a backlash but with her just the opposite he had feasted on her soul and it had increased his power bloods going to spill and plenty of it do duc said before i get all the way to the man who provided goldoni with his secrets hey i dont give a rats ass what you do as long as you do it quickly waxman gave him a warning look remember that even the dead arent powerless you know all about power do duc said waxman nodded then carefully as if handling an extremely deadly serpent he gripped do ducs left aim we both do waxman clasped do ducs arm tighter one roman centurion to another turned it slightly opened his fingers to reveal the wrist beneath and there it was the face split down the middle its right eye open and staring just like dominic goldonis the dark left side scarred with the gim the sacred crescent their eyes held for a long time now tell me who was dominics source waxman said at last who was feeding him the information he was using to control his contacts in government and business linnear do duc said nicholas linnear what he was doing was trying to draw me out nicholas said celeste her long red hair whipping against her cheek stood very close to him i dont understand i think you do nicholas put his arm around her it was cold here on the outer deck of the vaporetto the wind clawing its way along the snaking grand canal the shirt and jacket they had bought for him were inadequate to the temperature but he did not want to go inside because the color of the water was a curious enigmatic green the same hue precisely as the finest murano blown glass but was the chill the only reason he wanted some of her warmth he did not want to think about that just as he did not want to call his office or speak to justine what would be the point immersed as he was in the enigma of okami and the messulethe he would be of no use to either nangi or justine best to wait nangi would get all the help he needed from seiko if tinh had run into a bit of trouble and as for justine he suspected the longer he waited until their emotions cooled down the better sunlight punished by zinccolored clouds and a bitter harbinger wind fell upon the water turning it into an ancient copper mirror celeste said nothing she was staring out at the palazzi as they drifted past a police launch raced by and in its rough wake a postal boat chugged making its rounds rain began to pucker the water making of its rich reflections pointillist impressions looking at her face he had no idea of her reaction to his touch or his proximity it was as if she had lost a piece of herself during the encounter with the tautau adept and was now only partially there celeste youre so quiet what are you thinking im surprised you have to ask for an instant her eyes blazed god in heaven we were almost killed back there you may be right she shuddered heavily but her face was full of scorn a fitting mask perhaps for her own terror well look at you as calm as if wed just come back from a stroll along the lido beach whats the matter with you is this a common occurrence in your world because if it is i want nothing to do with it you must have known thered be danger in associating yourself with okamisan oh yes bullets and swordblades celeste said those kinds of danger i can deal with but this she shook her head this is something out of my ken she turned to face him as the vaporetto began to nose into a station frankly it scares the hell out of me some bastard with god alone knows what kind of powers almost kills us with with what magic she shuddered heavily turned away from him and thrust herself into the temporary security of the crowd disembarking from the boat nicholas hurried after her ahead of them was the accademia with its footman the splendid wooden bridge but now it reminded him of the kanfa of the messulethe they were near okamis palazzo and he saw this was where she was headed yes he said catching up to her tautau is a kind of magic but its as explainable as physics not to me it isnt celeste listen to me i let us walk into that trap that got to her she stopped whipping round to glare at him you did what the rain was in her face strands of deepred hair plastered to one cheek she looked very beautiful and at that moment terribly vulnerable i felt him in there in that palazzo in so confined a space he couldnt hide what he was from me he was already summoning his power that strange rhythmic pulse we heard in there remember celeste put her arms around herself as if to ward off a chill i couldnt forget even if i tried he pulled her into a doorway out of the rain the eternal morning lineup for the accademia was gone budget cutbacks dictated that the museum close just after lunchtime now just a few students in backpacks and nikes sat on the front steps waiting for the rain to let up youve got to understand i had to find out what were up against i had to test him just as he tried to test me he tried to draw me out to get a measure of my powers i wouldnt let him good for you she began to turn away but nicholas grabbed her elbow you dont understand the hell i dont she flared you let us walk into that trap you had no idea how strong this man was he could have beaten you he could have killed us both christ what kind of person are you to take such extreme risks whatever risks i took were worth what i learned nicholas said no risk is worth please listen to me he said carefully whoever is coming after mikio okami isnt your normal yakuza hitman he projected his inner mind outward forcing her to concentrate on what he was telling her youre right about one thing this man who trapped us is very dangerous he possesses the knowledge of the messulethe the most ancient race of magicians their particular form of sorcery emanated from the mind they were psychonecromancers do you understand what im saying there was a light in her eyes akin to the one seen in that moment just before a fulgent sun crosses the eastern horizon according to legend the messulethe were able to access the elemental energy of the cosmos the godstuff from which the universe was created celeste seemed to be trembling are you mad youre talking of gods nicholas nodded as close to gods as we can imagine he gripped her hard and one of these people has been sent here what for if okamisan is right its to kill him oh my god they ran all the way to okamis palazzo celeste used her key to unlock the front gate and they raced through the portico the canal was very close the water as black as ice at night the cold rain felt as hard as buckshot and the wind took the branches of the pear tree whipping them back and forth the petals of the bougainvillea and the roses were strewn across the courtyard like droplets of blood celestes fingers shook as she unlocked the front door okamisan she called as they went inside the palazzo was dark christ she said were too late they headed up the stairs to the second floor with its long leaded windows overlooking the grand canal it was chilly in the livingroom the windows were open and one of the panels was banging against the frame celeste ran to the raised section at the far end and kneeling on the cushions stuck her head out the window peered down he would have said do you see him but there was no need with a convulsive gesture she withdrew from the window closed the panel then she turned to face him hes not there she said but you knew that already didnt you she said it in an accusatory tone nicholas nodded i would have felt the messulethe if he had been here if he had murdered okamisan the atmosphere would have remained in a state of excitation for some time after he had left you say that so matteroffactly celeste it is fact she looked at him for some time and he could feel her bitterness toward him but not fully understand it she got up went down the three steps to the main area til take this floor you search downstairs theres no need nicholas watched her as she turned back to face him hes not here celeste color crept into her face and her hands clenched into white fists at her side is he alive or dead what does your magic tell you so that was it it was not only the tautau that terrified her it was him you dont understand he said i dont know well you sure as hell better find out whats happened to him she was shaking the veins standing out in her long neck he came down off the raised area to stand beside her well find out together she looked up at him with an enigmatic expression so much power she said how can i ever trust you they went into okamis bedroom first but there was nothing there to guide them the bed was made his clothes hung in the closet in his dresser they lay folded the comers neatly aligned his personal items were in their appointed places in the adjoining bathroom well at least he hasnt run off celeste said pointing to his luggage stacked on the top shelf of a deep closet but he might have been abducted nicholas said as he searched the darkest reaches of the closet didnt okamisan have bodyguards and draw more attention to himself celeste shook her head besides despite his age he was still very good at defending himself they went back out into the hallway god knows hes had enough practice hes been doing it almost all his life nicholas glanced over at her and then he had you yes he had me she admitted as she pushed open the door to his study he had to practically break my arm to get me to stay with you thats comforting i didnt want to leave him now i see why he pushed past her into the maelstrom of mikio okamis study the room was a whirlwind of papers pages ripped from books the heavy burlwood desk was overturned its drawers out and splintered its back peeled away from the frame like skin from stewed meat framed etchings had been pulled from their places on the walls the backing torn away there were holes in the plaster walls where they had once hung good god celeste breathed nicholas down on one knee behind the desk said what the hell were they looking for i dont know she knelt beside him pushing a raft of papers away from her as far as i know whatever okamisan was working on he kept entirely in his head he was too experienced and too clever ever to commit anything of substance to paper she looked at nicholas do you think he was taken nicholas was busy moving the desk over an inch whats this wedged beneath one of the desks legs was a square of thick paper folded over twice into a small package it was a blackandwhite photo it was grainy and full of grays and its subject was celeste in her domino costume the background clearly showed an area of the interior of the church of san befisario just outside the schola cantorum where nicholas had been taken to wait for her the thing was already open being picked over by the tekkies like a cadaver being examined by pathologists the analogy was apt nangi thought as he was brought the sterile coat and shoes that were a requirement for all people on the fiftieth floor the chi project masamoto goei himself was waiting for nangi he was all but wringing his hands in his despair where was it found nangi asked as he made his way to the zinctopped table where the thing was laid open all its guts exposed fiber optics silicone chips copper shielding minute diamond relays on the asian black market goei said hurrying to keep pace with nangi as he strode across the room with the help of his cane masamoto goei was one of the chi team directors a theoretical language technician one of the whizzbang tekkies who had thought up this computer without software is it the chi they had come up to the table stood staring down at the orderly tangle of the open computer well yes and no goei said he pointed there to the left you can see three neuralnet boards which are our proprietary technology but the rest of the thing i dont know what it is the only thing i can say for certain is its not ours but part of it is nangi said how did it get from here to wherever this thing was put together and who is responsible he was met with only silence even the tekkies who had been busy autopsying the thing had stopped were staring at the two men nangi motioned for goei to follow him out of the lab outside he stripped off the cleansuit said to goei what else is there the clone although thats not strictly speaking the right term was assembled somewhere in southeast asia my men spotted that right away my best guess would be hong kong tiny businesses are up and running out of business the same month no one pays attention virtually anyone could rent the space and hardware without attracting much notice shit nangi thought nicholas has dropped out of sight and his pet project has blown up in our faces he wanted to get back to his office now hehad even more of a need to speak to vincent tinh in saigon tinh would be closest to the action he should have spotted this bastard machine on the black market why hadnt he keep me informed of your progress he said tersely to goei and make that thing a priority he took the chairmans elevator back up to the executive floor has vincent tinh gotten back to us nangi asked as he strode past umis desk no sir she said pulling together several files from her desk and following nangi and seiko into his office any news of linnearsan he asked nothing she waited until he put his walking stick across his desk before she said but i have some related news oh nangi lifted a hand before you go on umi write an electronic memo to all senior directors as of today seiko ito has been promoted to director of corporate liaison in that capacity she will be an extension of my authority throughout the organization umis head lifted momentarily to look at seiko then she continued with her shorthand make sure that gets distributed immediately when umi nodded he continued now what i want you to do the phone rang and umi got it im in a meeting he said she spoke into the receiver for several seconds nangi who was talking to seiko paused umis face had gone ashen with a shaking hand she pressed the hold button and said i think you had better take this call nangisan curious nangi took the receiver from her moshimoshi he said curtly tanzan nangi speaking chief inspector hang van kiel here mr nangi i am with the saigon police i have the unhappy chore of informing you that your employee one vincent tinh has met with an unfortunate accident nangi was aware of just how tightly he was gripping the receiver there was a cold spot forming in his belly how seriously is he hurt i am sorry to report that he is dead mr nangi nangi listened to the ululating tones of interference on the line sounding far away isolated from reality tinh was dead he found that he had to remind himself of what those words meant he said a silent prayer then he gave free rein to his analytical mind may i ask what kind of accident tinh was in chief inspector it was an odd one it seems mr tinh was inspecting a warehouse out in the northern district and he we have no warehouses in the northern district nangi said indeed van kiet said and by the inflection of that one word nangi was made aware that he already knew your mr tinh was trespassing who owns the warehouse there seems to be some confusion about that were running an enquiry now nangi put his fingertips to his forehead over the spot where a headache was forming he knew these people how parochial and clannish they could be in times of crisis they closed ranks against outsiders from van kiels reply he doubted whether he would ever get an answer to that question go on he said from what we can reconstruct from onsite analysis mr tinh was up on a plank catwalk his foot plunged through a rotten spot and he lost his balance there was a silence that contained the strange electronic singing of inadequate longdistance cables yes and he fell van kiel said into a barrel of sulfuric acid did you say sulfuric acid i did sir and this barrel of acid just happened to be in the spot where he fell there were many barrels in this warehouse mr nangi what were their contents van kiet hesitated a moment and nangi thought he heard the rustle of papers being shuffled salt gasoline bicarbonate of soda potassium permanganate anger frustration and resignation could all be heard in the chief inspectors voice nangi felt his headache growing with each pulse of his heart in other words this warehouse was a drug factory he said that conclusion seems inevitable van kiet said have you any knowledge of mr tinh my employees do not deal drugs nangi said stiffly that must be a comforting thought for you so far away in tokyo van kiet said dryly the last thing nangi wanted was to get into a verbal boxing match with this police official for the moment he was nangis only connection with saigon and the growing mystery of vincent tinh how have you concluded it was an accident he asked pardon in this situation how could you have possibly ruled out murder frankly mr nangi i havent nevertheless the death will be considered an accident there were no witnesses and there are no overt signs that anyone else was in the warehouse at the time that mr tinh was there and of course because of the circumstances of the death the body itself can offer us no clues he sighed i regret to inform you that i am grievously understaffed and underfunded by any standards the crime rate here is shocking and it just keeps escalating i am afraid from where sit mr nangi it is clear that capitalism breeds contempt for the law are you telling me theres nothing you can do i must ring off now mr nangi i regret the loss of your employee if you could spare a moment more chief inspector ill put my secretary on so that arrangements can be made for the body but my dear sir the arrangements have already been taken care of by mr tinhs family mr tinh has no family nangi said who had the body picked up let me see a man claiming to be mr tinhs brother he gave as reference a company called avalon ltd in london van kiel grunted as he gave nangi the mans name now i really have overstayed this cail good day mr nangi nangi stared at the receiver now as dead as vincent tinh it looks like this was taken the night we met nicholas said of the photo of celeste in her domino did you know this was being taken no i would have bet my life we were alone i made certain you werent being followed her voice was shaky its a surveillance shot nicholas pointed look at the heavy grain and the grays thats from using a long lens and highspeed film but whats it doing here celeste asked was okamisan aware of it its possible perhaps even probable nicholas said he stood up completed a thorough search of the study then came back to where the photo lay he studied it again theres something odd here the entire room is a mess there isnt one item in here that hasnt been either ripped apart or shredded except this photo he glanced at her cant believe that it was overlooked his fingers ran down the creases and see how carefully it was folded almost like an origami sculpture then the only explanation is that it was left here deliberately exactly he folded and unfolded the photo what if it was left behind by okamisan if he was abducted hed be clever enough to manage to leave us a due as to where he was being taken if he knew celeste he knew he was a marked man im beginning to think he knew who was being sent after him i have to believe he knew where hed be taken she stared down at the photo but what is this telling us all i see is me have you gone on a trip recently for okamisan he has some business on burano every once in a while hed ask me to go there for him okay nicholas said buranos a possibility not a good one im afraid celeste said okamisan has too many friends there and its not a large island all the fishermen know one another i dont believe anyone could hide him there what else do you see in the photo well im standing in the church of san belisario right i think its worth a look it took them twenty minutes to reach the campiello di san belisario their route took them through the jewish quarter which nicholas had heard described as the poorest part of the city he found it to be rather the most austere but this was only natural compared to the gothic and the byzantine palazzi and churches elsewhere in venice the buildings and synagogues here were plain structures which could easily be construed as mean and shabby by those who had little understanding of how the jews had been forced by history to internalize all their joys the jews most sacred scripture the torah itself warned against public manifestations of wealth here stripped of the encrustations of the gothic and the byzantine one could feel the pulse of the people the weight of centuries hung unadorned like curtains of the finest linen on which were painstakingly embroidered depictions of their endless wanderings the small square ol san belisario was empty save for an old emaciated man on the opposite side from the church he glanced at them briefly smiled wearily before disappearing behind a wooden door all can say for sure is that we werent followed nicholas said as for whether okamisan is inside the church he shrugged this way celeste said leading him back down an alley toward a rio and its bridge he recalled emerging from the hidden entrance to the church from beneath this bridge this was the route they now took letting themselves into the church through the oldest of its doors the weight of the ages pressed in upon them as they moved through the gloom the air was heavy with myrrh frankincense and mold it was damp and chill this near the water and parts of the stone floor were greenish near the edges celeste led them unerringly down a short dark corridor dense with wooden beams then up a flight of stone stairs they emerged onto the main level beneath the ogival arcade quite near the schola cantorum she led him around until they reached a certain spot she took out the photo looked at it briefly then held it up for him to see this is the spot where i was standing when this was taken she whispered nicholas nodded what do you feel any sign of okamisan or the man who was following us before she asked he stood very still for a long time attuning himself to the minute vibrations of the church as if a set of slides had been slipped into a projector he could feel the age of the place the succession of peoples who had built it then rebuilt it from the ruins of previous incarnations the cycladians the phoenicians greeks romans the myriad peoples of asia minor who in time came to call themselves venetians this had been a holy place for all of them he could sense the lines of power running toward this spot like spokes radiating from the hub of a wheel they were ancient now all but forgotten by the priests who went about gods business in the modern world and yet this was no less a holy place now than it had been in centuries past the power abided scented of ripe fruit and heated embers like the breath of a slumbering leviathan he was drawn here this was nicholass thought riding unbidden on the tide of the elemental vibrations he too has felt the force and wants to be part of it blood nicholas said suddenly i see blood celeste drew a sharp breath where this way nicholas took them into the schola cantorum and through it on the other side was a set of small rooms no larger than cells hewn out of the cyclopean stone blocks the flickering light from reed torches grew dimmer as they went from room to room the first one held a cot with a straw mattress over which were drawn undyed muslin sheets and a thin wool blanket a cell indeed the second room was obviously used as a kind of storeroom piles of hymnals and musical scores for the choir lay atop crates that contained candles holy wafers and bottles of sacramental wine the third cell appeared to be empty save for thick shadows pouring down its walls and across the small square of floor the ubiquitous smell of mildew was absent replaced by the astringent odor of a strong disinfectant theres nothing here celeste said nicholas dosed his eyes nevertheless the smell of blood is stronger was that why the disinfectant was used he nodded perhaps he walked away from the center of the cell where they had been standing as he did so he seemed to vanish into the deep shadows at the back of the cell nicholas the silence seemed to stir the silken hairs at the back of her neck celeste come here his voice was watery echoey as if it came from a great distance she followed the sound saw him then at the rear wall for an instant his image flickered as if it were only a reflection then she was beside him and it was as if she had stepped through a translucent opening in the iris of an enormous eye she turned to glance behind her and was certain the far side of the cell appeared yards away nicholass arms were up the palms of his hands flat against the stone something here she heard him grunt then she gave a little start as the wall began to move or more accurately a part of the wall a moment later the two of them stepped through the hidden doorway they found themselves in a minuscule garden flowering clematis clawed its way up the stone walls which rose on all sides brocaded with purpleblue flowers darkbrown vines and small green leaves birds twittered in a ginkgo tree whitebarked as a skeleton whose upper third could be seen above the far wall the ground was damp exacerbating the stale smell of autumn but the rain had ceased ashen sunlight fell as if exhausted broken apart so that it seemed as if they were in a deep forest glade far away from all civilization an ancient wroughtiron bench stood in the center of the garden facing away from them the ground was green and spongy so that celeste knew they were walking on moss not grass close at hand a bird sang and then was still it was so silent here they could make out the faint lapping of a rio somewhere beyond the high walls look nicholas pointed as they came abreast of the bench lying on its seat was a venetian mask broken in half it was covered in blood that had already dried celeste gave a little cry said in a whisper thats the domino the mask okamisan gave me to wear when i met you how can you tell its the same one nicholas asked there must be over dominos in venice mine was not massproduced it was signed by the maker she said look there in the corner on the underside nicholas peered at the part of the mask she pointed out nicholas what is this doing here covered in blood whose blood is it okamisans i wish i knew he crouched down took out the photo of her they had found in okamis study celeste crouched down beside him here youre wearing this domino costume and now we come upon the same mask he said perhaps its the domino which holds the answer as to where okamisan has been taken he thought a moment what did you tell me about it that night lets see i said that the name came from the latin benedicamus domino meaning bless the lord i think it was a kind of joke the ancient venetians played on their putative papal masters at carnival after all whoring was one of the prime activities latin so the domino was one of the archetypal italian characters i dont think it was celeste said but i dont know enough of the maschere history to say for sure there is someone who can tell us everything there is to know about the masks of venice and my domino mask in particular the man who made it eight old westbury enice lew croakers first sight of margarite goldoni decamillo was across the long expanse of lawn still summergreen perhaps this color glowing almost incandescent in the full sun of noontime was what lent the scene its intensity as unforgettable as an object that defies the law of gravity he saw the mass of dark curling hair which spoke to him of cool jazz and double espressos at some longforgotten greenwich village club then she turned at his approach up the flagstone walk and he saw the strength and tenacity in her jawline her prominent nose her eyes regarded him coolly not with the hostility or suspicion he had expected but with a genuine curiosity youre out of luck she said as he came up to where she stood in a multicolor woven wool jacket she wore black leggings and anklehigh boots her ears were adorned with earrings made of old roman coins and there was a large diamond solitaire ring on her marriage finger why is that my husbands not home he assured my office when they contacted him that he would be she shrugged tonys sicilian either he respects people or he doesnt croaker looked at her wondering what she thought of her husband she had said that one word sicilian through clenched teeth as if it were an epithet meaning he doesnt respect me youre the cop used lo be he said with a smile nypd but that was some time ago she cocked her head what did you do in the used to be detective he said homicide just your meat then what do you mean she laughed in his face come off it detective or whatever the heli you are now you want to talk to tony about my brothers murder but hes not here croaker said maybe i ought to talk to you i have nothing to say on the subject doms dead thats the end of it not to me it isnt croaker watched a wise guy walking the perimeter of the estate a powerfullooking young man who watched him from the corner of his eye im charged with finding out who killed him and bringing him in dead or alive she said staring at his biomechanical hand well now that depends he said lifting it up and flexing the articulated fingers on how he reacts when i find him she examined each finger touching them in the way an artist would an armature on an incomplete sculpture as if imagining the effect the finished design would have on the viewer these look lethal i can also do the most delicate work with them croaker said extruding a steel blade from the tip of one finger she looked into his face has it changed you what this hand why would it margarite abruptly shifted her attention and the moment was gone she watched the wise guy as he lit a cigarette hey she called to him remember to put the butt in your pocket then to croaker youre very sure youll find him the man who murdered dom til find him she looked at him for a long time the sun in her eyes so that he could not tell whether she was merely curious or there was something deeper there i think ill stay a while he said she turned began to follow a branch of the flagstone round the side of the house dont expect an invitation inside i have workmen sanding a new tongueandgroove wood floor and theres plastic sheeting and sawdust all over the place no problem she put her hands in the pockets of her jacket you mentioned your office before just who do you work for damned if i know he said then grinned at her look of consternation federal bureau he added obscurely this case has national repercussions dont bullshit me she said swinging round on him my brother had national repercussions the fbi kissed his ass for years funny i thought it was the other way around in the end hah she had stopped to look at a sheared azalea which was looking none too healthy her fineboned hands moved through the tight tangle of branches with deftness and precision and he guessed this was how she proceeded with everything she did for a fed you sure dont know much maybe but im eager to learn she straightened up peered at him oddly thats more than i can say for most of them they began to walk again they all have their own agendas ive found you mean like interagency infighting hell no she said pushing her fingers through her hair its all personal with them they see these wise guys theyre following day and night walking around in dollar suits riding in bmws living high off the hog and it sticks in their gut like a knife so they decide theyre going to take this one or that one down her face twisted into a wry smile you know its like they tell you about watching sports events theyre boring unless you pick one side and root for it make it personal thats what these feds do to beat the boredom they pick a target and make him a personal priority she glanced at him you think im making this up no i dont they had reached the back of the house in the distance beyond the covered pool croaker could see a couple of men in among the trees they were clones of the pair who had stopped him at the front of the property hardmuscled wise guys excons most likely with cynical eyes and quick reflexes made for guard duty one had a young rottweiler on a length of thick stainlesssteel chain it strained at the leash interested now in croaker who was so close to one of the people it had been trained to protect as he watched the dog croaker was thinking of the dossier on the decamillo family lillehammer had pulled up for him on the computer in the air force jet there was a scent in the air which transcended autumn the bittersweet odor of crushed leaves could not quite hide the smell of change he said on impulse thats not the same dog is it i beg your pardon you had a rottweiler named caesar but that one there is a new one what if it is what happened to caesar margarite said nothing but she was staring at the rottweiler in a curious manner caesar died she said i think he must have eaten a field mouse that was poisoned that must have been tough she rounded on him her cheeks suddenly flushed my brothers murder was tough this she lifted an arm let it fall this was just a fucking dog the rottweiler had stopped in its tracks its head swung round it had been margarites sharp tone that had caught its attention but it was croaker those malevolent yellow eyes were fixed upon she looked from the dog to croaker abruptly amused if you make a move now youre dead thanks for the warning she made a sound in the back of her throat and the rottweiler backed down its flanks were still quivering and croaker did not much care for the look in its evil eyes its okay now margarite said beginning to walk again but youll want to be more careful til remember not to startle you in the dogs presence they went on into the estate over a small knoll heading toward a wisteriacovered pergola there was an ornate stone statue of the greek god poseidon king of the sea the tines of his trident looked very sharp the wise guys and the rottweiler followed at a discreet distance like a duenna in madrid with her highborn charge i dont believe my husband wants to talk to you evidently not croaker said i dont blame him they reached the pergola sunlight slanted through the gaps in the twisted woody vines spilling over stone benches green with moss on their bases but youre braver than he is youre talking to me margarite laughed it was fate she said you caught me at home she sat on one of the benches while he leaned against the main stem of the wisteria i guess being the capo now mr decamillo feels he can run his own investigation into who iced his brotherinlaw my husbands a legitimate lawyer just ask any of his clients i dont have to croaker said half of justice and the fbi have already gone over that ground she squinted up at him making her appear more vulnerable than she actually was then what ground are you on i told you i want to get your brothers murderer why whats in it for you get your kicks rooting around in other peoples grief or are you a mafia groupie like threequarters of the feds well ill tell you the honest truth croaker said every now and again when i feel bored i like to right a wrong this is new york a murderaminute city go solve one of those youre in over your head here no croaker said softly your brothers murder was different so thats it the notoriety she seemed disgusted he was a mafia don the biggest ever in witsec i can see your point no he said you cant she was staring at him behind her he could just make out the rottweiler at the end of its taut chain for the moment its handler was out of sight behinda large beech did anyone tell you how your brother was killed silence shocked and vibrating like that after the report of a gun anyone show you the pictures of what was shut up she stood up abruptly and the rottweiler made a whining sound carefully croaker reached into his jacket extracted a manila folder i think you ought to see these no i the rottweilers forepaws struck the hard ground glancing blows as it began to rear up no but she would not take her eyes off the folder dont you think i want to see my brothers killer brought to justice he knew he had to be very careful here thats just the question i was asking myself when i first started talking to you but now i believe i know the answer she was smarter than he had been prepared for when she took the folder from him he noticed that her hand did not tremble she sat back down put the folder in her lap dosed her hands over it i said it didnt i she said almost to herself it was fate that i was here when you came croaker would have liked to have kept his eyes on the rottweiler but he concentrated on her instead as if they belonged to someone else her hands unclasped the envelope pulled out the photos she glanced up at him almost he thought as if for support then with a convulsive gesture her head went down it was the first one with the heart sewn into his navel and she gave a little cry the rottweiler growling was coming pulling its handler toward the mistress it believed was in distress it was right mrs d its all right joey she called leave us alone croaker heard the jingle of the chain as joey gave it a hard jerk the rottweiler was back to whining again there were tears upon the photo glistening in the sunlight she had gone through them all and now seemed paralyzed shuffling them slowly over and over as if to relinquish them now terrible as they were would require saying goodbye to him again why did you show me these she breathed at last theyre so beyond any logic of human behavior yes he said now you know why im here her fingers were as white and rigid as bone i only agreed to talk to you because because im a cop margarite shook her head the feds seem to believe i owe them some kind of debt for taking dom into witsec well theyre mistaken because they didnt live up to their end of the bargain they didnt protect him thats one side of it he said the other side is that dominic goldoni violated the rules of witsec and that breach got him killed you forget that no ones ever gotten to a witsecprotected person who hasnt violated his contract witsec never had my brother before toucht croaker thought you know how the modern world works my detective margarite said in a voice less brittle and more fragile no one will admit responsibility but then i never expected the feds to say to me sorry we fucked up its too potentially embarrassing for the program the inmates will get spooked try to bolt and some of them will get their brains splattered all over the place he thought that was an accurate assessment of the situation as far as it went see heres the thing what did dominic goldoni do to get himself killed he watched her now as carefully as if she were the rottweiler ready to strike he brought his mistress a woman named ginnie virginia morris out from queens to be with him where witsec stashed him margarite had her head down she was wiping her tears one by one off the photo of her dead brother ginnie was murdered too in the same spot where we discovered your brother her head jerked up so fast he could hear her vertebrae crack i came here because im trying to figure out what got dominic to break the witsec rules my theory is he wanted out of his relationship with ginnie she didnt want it to end and in the sensitive situation he was in i think he called someone probably your husband to help him with the problem the calls maybe what got him killed someone tracing it back to him to where he was stashed tony wont help you he wouldnt help a crippled cop across the street did you know ginnie what something she had said or the way she had said it had triggered the thought in the back of his mind she and her brother had been very close and this after all had been a female problem well you mustve known your brother fooled around on the side you two being close she got up abruptly and the photos slid to the ground croaker bent to retrieve them slid them into their folder as he hurried after her yeah maybe not he said when he had caught up to her that sicilian thing women and business dont mix doms sexual appetite had nothing to do with business she said curtly besides the goldonis arent sicilians which is more than i can say for my husband our family comes from venice but you and your brother are halfsicilian his mother she said not mine the rottweiler had moved so quickly it had almost pulled its handler off his feet now it stood its rear legs apart its forepaws holding a small animal a chipmunk or a vole perhaps the rottweiler began to gnaw on it with increasing vigor there was a small but distinct crack as it crushed the animals skull margarite stood regarding the scene with no particular fascination or revulsion merely curiosity it was the same expression she had had on when she had first seen him croaker said so you knew ginnie morris i didnt say that she looked around as if someone on this heavily guarded estate might be eavesdropping but the fact is i did i knew all his mistresses i was the only one he could trust to confide in then you knew where witsec put your brother no i only got ginnie ready for the move the rest dom did on his own good christ he could see why she had been crying over the photos she had helped her brother violate the witsec rules and that violation was what had gotten him killed dominic was different in many ways margarite said as far as his womanizing was concerned he was like john kennedy he couldnt help it i think theres a medical term for what they both suffered from satyriasis you mean your brother was an addict for pussy tve heard it put that way before she said watching the rottweiler devour the creature at last but then she turned to face him and her face was set in a cool expression youre here now as my guest detective i suggest in future that you treat my brothers memory with respect he had wanted to shock her yet again to elicit an uncalculated response when he had first driven up he had been ready to dismiss her as just another piece of italian windowdressing but she had proved to be much more than that and now he began to see that perhaps his basic assumption regarding these three dominic tony and margarite was totally off base he had assumed that boys being boys tony decamillo must have been dominic goldonis confidant on the face of it this typical scenario had made sense it was tony whom dom had designated his successor but the longer he talked with margarite the deeper his conviction became that the two men had never really been that close now the one question nagged at him if margarite had been his confidante regarding his mistresses what else had he confided in her ive been living alone too long i guess my manners arent what they used to be you mean on the streets of new york he couldnt help but laugh at that i take your point mrs decamillo i apologize but i wish youd call me lew detective sounds so generic he laughed again suddenly happy to be in her company she turned to him why dont i call you lew and you can call me margarite fair enough im hungry margarite said lets get something to eat she drove him in her lexus coupe a ford taurus was on their tail the entire time croaker glancing in the rearview mirror hoped the wise guys had left the rottweiler at home margarite drove quickly and efficiently she knew where all the cop cars were lying in wait along the back roads and the highways service road ready to pick off speeders ten minutes later they pulled into one of those elaborate diners with the fake gold stone facades an enormous sixpage menu and food that appeared to have been prepared at some vast central kitchen that serviced all likelooking establishments in queens and long island the owner a darkcomplexioned man who could have been from virtually any country on the mediterranean hurried up as they slid into a booth large enough to accommodate six oversized adults it was covered in turquoise vinyl good afternoon mrs d he said deferentially what can we get you today order pasta margarite said to croaker without opening the menu its the only thing made here and a bottle of valpolicella on the house the owner said beaming as he scurried away they ate pasta allolio with hot crusty italian bread margarite put a handful of crushed red pepper flakes into hers croaker had been in marco island so long he had forgotten what really good pasta tasted like margarite drank most of the wine why exactly did you agree to let me be your guest croaker asked halfway through the meal curiositymargarite replied in that very direct way of hers that was so disarming when you drove up you were just another cop sent out here to give us grief but then i talked to you and found my basic assumptions about you were all wrong i was operating on stereotypes croaker laughed thats exactly what happened to me i thought that you being tony ds wife you know he broke off suddenly oddly embarrassed the sicilians have a saying lew women are for cleaning cooking and making babies preferably sons every two years im not sicilian i fit none of those parameters yet tony the sicilian married you she dabbed oil off the corners of her mouth i was very young and he was drunk on sex he loved to fuck me and you what did you love about tony he was like a white knight strong handsome powerful he was older and he knew what he wanted and how to get it for a young girl that kind of direct force can be a potent aphrodisiac especially when every other boy you know is floundering around not knowing what he wants to be croaker poured her more wine and she smiled you cant get me drunk lew dont even try so you got married early he said ignoring her remark then what then she paused frowning took up her glass of wine studied it christ then life real life not fantasy came crashing down on me she sipped the wine all of a sudden i was no longer margarite goldoni i was mrs anthony decamillo tonys wife and then i realized that that was all he wanted me to be and it was such a shock she broke off again put the glass aside smiled at croaker but you have your own business oh yes but only by the good graces of my brother who interceded for me with tony that was a mistake because tony lost face and he has made me pay for my business every day since you mean he takes a piece of it no she said coolly he takes a piece of me the maskmakers shop was only a short block from the grand canal a smalt dingy workspace filled with flour and magic the ceiling was made up of thousands of masks hanging face down overlapping one another the colors by turns harmonizing and clashing creating a sea of emotions trapped within the confines of their wire bones papiermache flesh and enamel skin these masks so alive reminded nicholas of circe who confined the souls of her visitors in the bodies of animals so that they might form a compendium of living art his name was marin fornovo he was a smallish man of middle age with the absentminded demeanor of the artist whose inquisitive mind finds the bounds of the mundane world too restricting his hair was thinning but it was as fine as spun gold now and again as he moved back and forth behind a scarred marble counter littered with the detritus of his art bowls of flour coils of wire pots of lacquer and the instruments with which to meld contort and apply these light lanced off the round lenses of his goldrimmed glasses blanking out his eyes and making him appear as comical as a cartoon celeste bellissima fornovo pushed aside the litter leaned over his counter and kissed her on both cheeks there isnt a day that goes by when i dont think of your father and miss him i tell you venice is the worse off now that he is gone he spoke slowly and formally as if he were still part of the doges court of long ago celeste introduced nicholas and fornovo gave him a penetrating look before nodding to him with a small smile when he returned his attention to celeste he said what mischief have you gotten yourself involved in now my darling celeste laughed i could never hide anything from you neither could your father fornovo said frowning i wish he had taken my advice that day cara mia if he had i believe he would be alive today thats all in the past ah yes the past fornovo sighed deeply but in the past are hidden all our sins and our sins are what in the end lead to our undoing he clucked his tongue against the roof of his mouth you would do well to remember what your father forgot my child i do not want to see his fate become yours i will remember i promise the little man grunted as if possibly he did not believie her marin we need your help celeste said do you remember the mask you recently made for okamisan the domino fornovo said but of course a magnificent piece of work he scowled it has not come to harm we need some information on the domino itself celeste said adroitly sidestepping his question i seem to remember that it wasnt one of the original venetian characters no no of course not the domino was introduced into venice in the second half of the sixteenth century fornovo said as he began to mix a color in a shallow bowl it is actually french in origin the domino was the name the french gave to the long thick capes their monks wore and which when their noblemen and ambassadors traveled here they brought into venetian fashion the color was becoming clear now a deep cerulean which even in its dull pot appeared luminous the mask itself is a kind of joke however fornovo continued the venetians were forever irreverent when it came to their popes he lifted a thick tearshaped drop of the pigment into the light eyeing it speculatively it was a pope who declared venice a threat to the rest of the world you know with vigor he smeared the pigment onto the cheek of a naked white mask that damnable man but why should we decry him we venetians refuse to contemplate the past unless it is beribboned with ritual but this is what makes us venetians great he daubed the other cheek the ends of the eyeholes the lips and now by some alchemical process the mask had become a face morte ai tiranni that has always been our battle cry death to the tyrants of rome whether they be popes or caesars our republic was the only one to survive the fall of the roman empire that was no happenstance he set the mask carefully aside winked at nicholas here in venice we have always been free that is why the jews fled here from their persecution in less enlightened lands the ghetto was invented here just after and for many years venice became the heart of rabbinical study in europe he took up another pot began to mix a color that might eventually become a shade of scarlet the truth is we understood the jews and they us we were the same really enigmatic brilliant eminently practical the scholars of business when the rest of the civilized world was feudal we were not the jews who could not abide feudal thinking appreciated this most of all we were all of us capitalists from time out of mind yes scarlet bright startling as newly drawn blood he looked at the mask he was working on nodded as if satisfied with the magic he had wrought of course we made the jews pay for their sanctuary why not they could afford it arid they had nowhere else to go and we marked them by decreeing that they wear red hats he began to apply the scarlet sparingly almost one might say compassionately was that cruel why should anyone say so we treated them no differently than we treated our own doges we isolated the jews in their ghetto just as we incarcerated the doge in his magnificent palace in san marco his oath of office became longer each year because we kept adding to the things he was enjoined from doing he lifted a forefinger waggled it at them of course from time to time we paid a heavy price for our successes like the jews we were often despised and envied for what we were in when pope paul v accused venice of heresy didnt we reply that we were better christians than he who fought the turk in the name of christ while rome sat idly by why venice of course marin celeste broke in gently about the domino yes yes he said almost irritably again he put the mask aside to dry im coming to that did you think id forgotten he gave nicholas another sharp look we venetians have a saying when history is inadequate myth will do he smiled at his own enigmatic joke well there is a myth concerning the introduction of the domino into the carnival and it is this it was not french noblemen and ambassadors who brought this ironic irreligious character to venice but the jews fleeing the antisemitism in france he turned abruptly went through a beaded curtain into the rear of his shop a moment later he returned cradling an item in his hands as if it were as fragile as a newborn baby the dominol celeste exclaimed but thats impossible hardly cara mia because here it is fornovo gave her a crafty smile as he held it out for them to examine but this is the original the oldest mask in my own private collection i am showing it to you as i did to okami before you did okamisan know of the origins of the domino nicholas asked but of course fornovo said frowning deeply did you think i would be so remiss to sell him one of my prized dominos without making him cognizant of its history what kind of a venetian do you take me for he made a face besides this domino is special because it was made in france paris to be exact and brought here by the jews fleeing persecution carefully he turned the mask over so that they could see the underside here is the name of the maker a aloins he pointed with a thin forefinger and here just below is the stamp of the company under whose aegis m aloins toiled it is the oldest maskmaker in france which is saying something and it still exists he lifted the mask toward them so they could read its name avalon ltd in the ensuing silence the crash ofa dish slipping out of a waiters hand was stunning but margarites eyes never left croakers there was a defiance there that made him believe this was the first time she was confessing this horror he beat me and whats worse i let him do it i didnt complain didnt go to dom didnt take my daughter francine and leave instead i stayed and submitted why she smiled but the brittleness had returned and he had the impression that if he reached out and shook her now she would shatter into pieces thats the billiondollar question isnt it she dabbed at her lips again but there was no longer anything to wipe away maybe i felt i deserved it marrying against my brothers wishes dominic was against the marriage very much so why margarite shrugged maybe he knew tony better than i did but i was determined then i thought i knew it all or maybe i was hellbent to defy dom who knows any more yet dominic named tony his successor margarite watched him with her wideapart eyes im going to have to start calling you detective again he smiled at her its what i do maam detectings in my blood that made her laugh the owner came with more garlic bread but she declined and he cleared the plates away she ordered espresso for them both because he didnt think she was going to answer his previous question croaker said if i might ask whats the current state of your marriage she was thoughtful for some time her eyes were leveled at him and he could see now that they were the color of amber we coexist but i think thats the state many married couples find themselves in the noise level in the diner rose as a bunch of highschool kids slouched in ganglylegged jeansclad walkmanarmored the espresso came along with cordial glasses of sambucca compliments of the owner margarite turned and caught his attention right away she blew him a kiss which caused the widest smile croaker had ever seen she turned back to him said abruptly i think dom had a lovehate relationship with tony he could admire the legitimate practice he had built up all on his own while still recognizing all of tonys faults which are she toyed with her espresso cup hes impulsive often too aggressive he has an inflated sense of his own importance and what about your brother what were his faults the feds ive talked with think they know more about him than i do she said lucky for me i dont come with that bias those amber eyes regarded him in that very intimate way youre the first man ive met since dom who thought my opinions were worth a damn she plucked a coffee bean out of her sambucca placed it into her mouth bit down on it without wincing dom was a devil and an angel all in the same breath she said you know it never made a difference to either of us that he was my stepmothers child when my father officially adopted him that was it i had a brother it didnt matter that he was thirteen years older than i was her eyes shifted over his shoulder and her expression changed in some subtle way croaker was careful not to turn his head in the direction she was looking a moment later he was aware of another presence hi mom he turned to see a redhaired girl who was just as beautiful as margarite she was slender a longlegged colt with that impossible to duplicate ungainly grace the sole province of teenagers this must be francine he was stunned to think of her as margarites daughter how old had she been when she had given birth to this nymphet nineteen or twenty no more he thought about what margarite had told him of her marriage francie what are you doing here im with doug and richie and mary francie said pointing to a group of teens taking a booth in boisterous fashion i told you about going out alone francie made a face im not alone mom im with the guys besides richies father i know all about richies father margarite said quickly croaker glanced over at the other booth saw that another wise guy had taken up station in the diner the place was crawling with them now whos this francie was looking directly at croaker francie this is a business acquaintance of mine margarite said thinking fast lew croaker howdy maam croaker said making her giggle he extended his hand and she stared at it what happened to you francie margarite exclaimed no croaker said its all right he looked up into francies face i lost my hand in a fight a sword sliced it off surgeons in tokyo gave me this one instead like it she took it gingerly in her own she was clearly fascinated and he asked her to join them for a moment i dont think thats a good idea margarite said francie gave her a quick look before sliding in beside her was it his imagination or did margarite seem uncomfortable as her daughter sat beside her francie put her elbows on the table ordered a double baconcheese burger with extra cheese a large order of fries and a diet coke with a childs unconcern she seemed to have completely forgotten croakers hand she leaned over took a sip of her mothers sambucca oddly margarite said nothing her unease increased what kind of business are you in francie said impaling croaker with her large pale eyes does it matter francie nodded sure you make mom laugh his gaze just touched margarites for an instant before sliding away he said the truth is francie i came to talk to your mom about your uncle dominic her diet coke arrived and she abandoned the sambucca to slurp h through a straw a moment later the food arrived and she attacked it as if she had not eaten in a week would you like to tell me about him margarites agitation increased exponentially i dont think that would be i miss him francie said around an enormous mouthful of food he was good to me croaker listening to her answer kept hearing echoes of what she might be feeling and not saying miss him he was good to me not like my dad did you see a lot of him sure francie said pouring more ketchup on her fries mom would lake me when she went to see uncle dom chomp chomp he always had a freezer full of icecream neat new flavors he was testing out it was cool ill bet croaker said wondering about margarites palpable distress up until francie arrived she had been very much in control no that wasnt quite true he thought she had cracked when he had mentioned the rottweiler caesars death and then again when he had shown her the pictures of her brother so you all sat around eating icecream uh uh francie said cramming her cheeks full of fries id eat the icecream while mom and uncle dom talked in the library croaker gave margarite a quick glance but her attention was concentrated on her daughter didnt your dad ever come along uh uh francie said wiping her smeared lips with a napkin she began to edge out of the booth youll have to excuse me now then she was walking very quickly through the restaurant croaker watched margarite follow her with her eyes as she passed by her friends booth made her way to the ladies room excuse me lew while i go powder my nose margarite said her face was white she disappeared into the ladies room and something clicked in croakers mind he was up almost running through the restaurant at the door to the ladies room he paused for a moment then said what the hell and pushed it open he found margarite in a stall on her knees beside francine who was bent almost double over a toilet the teenager was vomiting in great heaves margarite became aware of him the distress on her face was acute get out of here will you she was on the verge of tears croaker went into the room letting the door close behind him she isnt sick is she he said at least not with a virus or the flu shes bulimic margarite said nothing continued to hold her childs head while she rocked a little crooning to her at length she looked at htoi again why are you still here i think i can help her leave us alone i dont believe either ol you want that now he went over to her took francie gently by the shoulders led her over to the sink ran the cold water for her behind him he heard the toilet flush several times then margarite emerged from the stall stood looking at the two of them her father doesnt know he wouldnt get it do you he held her while she put her head under the stream of water shes bulimic lew of course i get it shes in therapy is it doing any good these things take time but by her resigned tone he knew she was answering by rote margarite this is francies fight not yours she needs to want to get better otherwise she never will he pulled francie out of the water dried her hair and face with a wad of paper towels her complexion was so pale he could clearly see the blue veins at her temples he bent down turning her around to face him francie what but he never got to finish the question because her pinched face stared up at him and she cried out im going to die im going to die im going to die lillehammer exhausted from a particularly frenzied bout of accoutremental sex with doug his very secret current flame sank into a deep sleep doug was wild unpredictable which was his appeal neither man knew the other in real life business or social they came together essentially as ciphers mindless bodies intent on sating themselves in the most bizarre methods available in that respect doug was ideal a restless spirit by nature he was happiest getting something different going every time they met the more grotesque and outlandish the better as lillehammer sank into slumber even the taste of doug evaporated until all that was left was darkness and from out of the darkness emerged the dream until it surrounded him in the walls of its own peculiar universe lillehammer rarely dreamed but when he did it was usually the dream at least this is what he had come to call it not that the dream was always the same but certain fundamental aspects never changed there was the jungle first last and always the triplecanopied tropical trees dripping moisture rank fruit and deadly serpents no doubt about it it was a nightmare vision of the garden of eden and lillehammer knew that the fed shrink he had been forced to see after he came back from nam would have had a field day with the symbolism of it if he had ever told her which was of course out of the question the dream was like tripping over gravity falling upward instead of down slamming the top of your head against a cage of firehardened bamboo and that was another of the fundamental aspects an impression of being in a zoo the stench the cramped space and most of all the uncomfortable sense of being constantly observed in the dream as in memory he paced back and forth across the area of dirt floor too small for him ever to fully stretch out on hed had to sleep sitting up not that he got much sleep that was pan of it darkness the heavy lull of the insects buzz and then the bright lights would stab behind his closed eyelids and hed be jerked awake this happened over and over again in the dream as in memory until sleep became yet another freedom denied him the idea was perfectly sound deriving from the basics of interrogation strip the subject of a sense of time of place and finally of himself the end result was pliability in the same way a baker kneads dough to the right consist ency so his captors sought to break down his psyche to what extent they were successful he would never know and that was the worst horror of all not knowing at first when the dream began lillehammer was hopeful that it would answer the question that had been haunting him ever since he returned from nam had he been broken in hospital while his wounds were slowly healing hed had much time for contemplation and even more when he had returned to the states and the shrink was loosed upon him actually he had liked her madeleine had even fallen a little in love with her that was only to be expected she had explained to him one day she had showed him the only real kindness since his incarceration in the bamboo zoo somewhere in the bush of laos christ what a fuckup he had made of things but madeleine had disagreed with him and in fact had proved to him that the reverse was true they could not have broken him she said because none of the intelligence with which he had been entrusted had been compromised not a code man or network had gone down dont worry about memory madeleine had assured him in these cases memory is thoroughly unreliable which was why she had been loosed on him to pick through the rubble and unearth what he apparently could not you re fine she had told him at his last session whole and functioning able to return to what you were doing before whatever happened is in the past he wanted to believe her and he would have of course had it not been for the dream even as he saw that she had not lied that he was still trusted and now revered among his elite compatriots the dream was lodged in his memory like a stone in the dream as in memory the smell of blood and excrement was always with him the sweat of fear coating him like a malevolent second skin they came for him in the zoo and did things to him unconscionable unmention able even to madeleine whom he loved and even trusted a little bit as much as he could trust because that is what the zoo did to him if not as madeleine had assured him depriving him of his humanity then crushing his ability to trust in his fellow man in the dream as in memory he was alone abandoned by his compatriots those with whom he had sworn undying friendship the zoo was his alone to endure no one came charging over a thickly foliated ridge no one stole into the zoo in the dead of night to rescue him f he existed inside the zoo prey to endless indignities and torture the suffering of life was punctuated only by the hallucinations of his own mind at which point he was left alone the short length of time until he was returned sufficiently to the real world for the process to begin all over again his mind under extreme pressure telescoped time bent it back upon itself until it disappeared entirely he found himself again at the moment when he was being inducted into lookingglass the shadow society that was pledged to embrace him as a bloodbrother for just so long as he was of use to it but now he was peering at himself and his brethren through his own selfmade lookingglass aware at last of the shifting of reality and unreality of the unsettling truth that lay behind the comforting facade of loyalty and fealty that those behind the lookingglass had sold him lies as effectively as they sold everyone else around them this was the frightening world that lay behind this modernday lookingglass and it was not so different from the one that lewis carroll had created more than a century and a half ago much later when he was back in washington and working again he discovered that if he had not been dumped unceremoniously on their doorstep in nam they would indeed have been prodded into action they would have sent out a solitary ranger a sniper who would have had orders to put a bullet through his head in order to keep their secrets safe and sound in a way he didnt blame them in their position he supposed he might have contemplated the same thing but in another way he could not help but blame them they had lied to him his bloodbrothers and they had failed him their betrayal taught him a profound lesson in the manner in which human beings treat one another after that he discovered that he didnt like humans much any more he forgot about madeleine or more accurately his love for her that was far too painful to dwell on instead he turned himself into a kind of automaton there was a familiarity that comforted him in going through the rituals of his trade and getting it all spot on there was a satisfaction that this veil he had woven was invisible to his comrades that they had adjudged him well and whole as well as a hero he was promoted given far greater powers and leeway in initiative than hed ever had when he was in nam under the command of the jabberwocky in those days hed been known as the mad hatter a nickname he believed even more appropriate now than it had been then whatever else had been washed away from that era the sobriquet of the red queen had remained he and the red queen had toiled ceaselessly under the marshal glare of the jabberwocky even through the embarrassing mishap with michael leonforte somehow the red queen had sidestepped the fallout from that fiasco and had risen in rank so that now he inhabited the ultimate position of power which the jabberwocky had occupied for decades how had the red queen done it he had dislodged the jabberwocky a man whom lillehammer had been certain would only be taken from his position of power feet first the red queen had an asset named nishiki it was rumored nishikis intelligence was so compelling so accurate and at such a consistently high level that it became a sword with which the red queen cut a swath rising through the hierarchy mowing down unbelievers political and ideological enemies as he went as he did so lillehammer the opportunist rode his coattails these days he was the red queens eyes and ears the only man he believed whom the red queen explicitly trusted the red queen claimed that not even he knew nishikis real identity or even his nationality the intelligence was always sent to him by some form of dead drop which was changed at frequent though random intervals but if all this were true what was the red queens relationship to nishiki what was their connection what was nishikis motivation for providing this flow of highlevel intelligence did lillehammer care very much about the answers to these questions in these veiled days filled with memory and the dream he found it easier to follow his superiors orders than to seek answers to politically loaded questions he had chosen a side long ago or it had chosen him what did it matter and now morality had no part to play in his current actions he found some form of dim pleasure in succumbing to dumb rote shortcircuited he was disconnected from the consequences of his actions he flew through the nighttime skies of the world dispensing what the red queen called justice and did not imagine there might be a different reality he was hermetically sealed behind his mask peering out at the world with incurious eyes but man even a man such as lillehammer had become could not exist on the familiarity of comfort alone disconnection from the world around him did not mean that the synapses had ceased to fire he was alive after all damaged but alive it took him a good deal of time to work out what really was driving him in the new life he had made for himself and in this regard the dream served him well as a path backward into memory the dream showed him why he was still breathing why he had not slit his wrists in his philippine hospital bed or defenestrated himself from his washington office it was because the dream brought him like detritus washed up on a far shore the faces of those who had run the zoo like acid on metal these faces were forever etched upon his memory their faces lit crazily by floodlight and sunlight rode herd upon him crouched like cruel ghouls upon his shoulders driving their long bamboo nails into his flesh slouched beside him in noisome fury as he walked or ate or defecated in the dream as in memory and at last lillehammer had come to the conclusion that he had been saved from the jaws of death for one purpose to find his cagers and destroy them as they had destroyed him and to that cadence and that cadence alone did his heart beat nine paris old westbury entering paris was like emerging into clear water from the incantatory flux of a whirlpool the charism of venices byzantine brocade was broken by the effulgent flood of lights streaming into the cloudclotted sky the parisian night was a bouquet of vibrant facades broad boulevards massive fountains guarded by lions cherubs and gods glittering whitely bathedjn light fingers of light illuminated the arc de triomphe rising from the fulcrum of the place de etoile nexus of a dozen major avenues radiating like the veins on the back of a hand geysers of light spilled over the place de la concorde where louis xvi and marie antoinette danton and robespierre felt the terminal kiss of the revolutions razor the place venddme where monuments to napoleon rose and fell and rose once again arcs of light burst against the strong artery of the city which crossed from right bank to left with the grand palais and the petit palais on one end and the great gilded dome of les invalides on the other while between them lit by clusters of lamps rose the magnificent bridge across the seine named after alexander iii of russia through this urban landscape white as snow beneath a full moon nicholas and celeste were driven from charles de gaulle airport entering the city of light they felt like pilgrims who had been cast into the wilderness for transgressions unknown and unforgivable and who now were reentering western civilization they crossed the seine from right bank to left entering a world still somewhat bohemian certainly younger than that across the river filled with art galleries trendy clothing boutiques and food kiosks of all description they found lodging a block and a half from the boulevard st germain at a hotel with a white and black facade of sandblasted stone and wrought iron the rooms themselves were small postmodern neat comfortable with views of pariss justly famous rooftops aglow with an astonishing aura the pyramid of energy surrounding the eiffel tower inside their room a small neat space a vcr attached to the tv was already displaying the blackandwhite images of humphrey bogart and lauren bacall in a scene from raymond chandlers febrile the big sleep electronic shadows on the wall iridescent flickers like the blinking of an eyelid the beating of a heart sleep avalon ltd is a company with an interesting history fornovo had told them originally a house that manufactured costumes for traveling theatrical troupes it gradually metamorphosed as the renown of its maskmakers grew at one point who knows when perhaps around the time of the french revolution the maskmakers themselves wrested control of the company from their overlords who the story goes were because of their notoriety forthwith guillotined in the place vendome the name was changed to avalon et fits because the artisans had come to think of the company as their home and so it remained virtually unchanged by the passing years until perhaps five years ago when after falling on hard times it was bought by a foreign firm and the name was changed again to avalon ltd who bought the company nicholas had asked now thats the curious part fornovo had said setting the domino aside no one seems to know nicholas awoke to sunlight spilling through the window he turned over in bed found celeste sleeping beside him her clothes still on her face extraordinarily beautiful was cast half in sunlight half in the blue shadows of the dregs of night the tv was still on but the tape having finished hours since was spewing out a soundless spray of gray and white particles like a beam from some sciencefiction weapon he looked down found himself also fully clothed he could not even remember lying down exhaustion complete and blessed had overtaken them without warning he lay where he was too content for the moment to move he knew he should call his office seiko must be frantic by now but why should he let her know where he was she would only want to give him an update on the saigon situation and he had no desire to hear it besides she and nangi would be able to take care of anything that arose these excuses he knew were old and wearing thin slowly almost painfully like the progress of a degenerative disease the truth was dawning on him he was fleeing a marriage that had come apart a relationship that had run so far off course he was powerless to set it right guilt had done its best to strangle the truth to keep alive paperthin fabrications that were laughable in the pragmatic light of day but as another facet of the truth was revealed to him he knew it went deeper than that he was running away from his old life his retirement into marriage a supposed family a settled job the minutiae of responsibility settling upon his shoulders like soot he was being buried alive the profound sense of freedom he had felt the moment he had donned the bauta mask was exhilarating he did not want it to end he wanted his old life back carefully he turned his head staring into celestes sunstruck face and then there were his growing feelings about this wondrous woman if he were not married he knew he would be falling in love with her and then the truth writhing and extending itself like a scar upon flesh revealed yet another facet of itself what did his being mar ried have to do with it the concept of love precluded outside circumstance he was falling in love with her he sat up abruptly got out of bed soundlessly he padded into the bathroom stripped and stood under a scalding shower for five minutes he soaped up then turned the hot spigot off felt the chill of the needle spray puckering his skin like the first barometric drop of an incoming storm he turned his face up into the torrent as if the water could scrub his mind as well as his body clean wrapping a towel around his waist he returned to the room to discover celeste rummaging through her small suitcase christ i slept like the dead she said he went quickly by her not trusting himself to speak or even be near her at the moment bearing her clothes she disappeared into the steamy bathroom the room seemed immediately small and meanly impersonal without her presence and without thinking too much about it nicholas pushed open the door into the bathroom celeste was in the tub soaking he crossed to a small wooden stool at the foot of the tub opened the french windows then sat down celeste was wearing a mask it was composed of dark mud and minerals another luxe perk offered by the hotel her eyes were closed and her face was in repose have you come to seduce me no he said tasting the lie on his tongue her eyes opened their aquamarine color all the more startling contrasted against the mud can you feel okamisan the future is blank celeste she regarded him silently for what seemed a long time im frightened nicholas yes i know im not used to that he nodded perhaps all we need is to help one another she turned on the hotwater tap i need to wash off this mask if you stay youll get wet twenty minutes later she emerged from the bathroom her hair was still damp from the shower plaited into a thick french braid this more tempered style contrasted sharply with the lush wildness of how she had worn it in venice a city of excesses it made her seem less impetuous and also more introspective melancholy in venice a city many thought of as melancholy she had been as exuberant as sunlight on the water what would she be like here he wondered she wore black leggings a sapphireblue suede blouse a puffysleeved silk jacket embroidered with a phoenix on its back her feet were clad in sensible black flats they had had two and a half hours before their flight from venice and she had made good use of the time stuffing a softsided weekend bag with everything she thought she would need ready for espresso and petit pain she asked on the way down in the minuscule elevator it had glass sides so that they could see the curving marble staircase through whose heart they descended nicholas so close to celeste was aware of the smell of her subtle hints of frangipani and cinnamon beneath rosemary and peppermint the aromatherapeutic scents of bath gel and shampoo it seemed to him that he was drawn toward her in an almost tidal pull an ebb and flow as familiar to him as the pulse of his own blood through his veins to stop himself from pressing himself against her he thought of justine distance had put clarity to their relationship sadness and suffering long withheld had given birth to resentment and anger he recognized now that they had both been wounded by the death of their infant daughter though it must have been in vastly different ways in insisting they stay on in japan he saw that he had taken away a part of herself when his only thought was to add to it but was that the whole truth how much of an element was his own selfishness his burning desire to get to kokoro the heart of his own natural history the revelations of tautau consumed him he knew that but now he had to face the consequences of that obsession the price of truth was always high in the lobby they made their way to the small restaurant with its pale ash tables ebony chairs steel and leather banquettes just to the right of where they sat was a tiny courtyard into which spilled sunlight unfiltered by either tree branch or roof eave the pale pebbles rearing waterracked boulder and miniature hinoki cypresses conjured up japan in the deliberate methodology of the western gardener more homage to form than understanding of substance and yet its easy confluence of natural elements caused him to become instantly nostalgic for the east where the tao of emotion was swathed in layers of ritual custom and symbolism i dont feel like real food do you celeste asked not really she ordered for them her french was excellent the truth had given nicholas a sense of liberation his sadness for what had been and what might have been was slowly being supplanted by his excitement at being close to the edge again the perilous journey was what fueled him what made life worth living he was just realizing now how far from his personal center he had drifted these past years how far what instantly his attention refocused on her i was wondering how far away you were he smiled less startled now that she had explained her comment for a moment he had thought she had been reading his mind he drizzled marmalade over a broken crust of his petit pain i think id like another espresso he said he felt from her a desire to push him to open him up as she might an expensive compact in order to gaze at herself in a new mirror but was her interest in him merely curiosity it was most odd but even after their experiences together he felt in some respects as distant from her as he had the night they first met behind their venetian masks he was used to reading people getting behind their facades but with celeste he was finding that for every step he took toward intimacy he was in some manner shoved back a corresponding step he slipped two small cubes of sugar into the black depths stirred the espresso sipped it delightedly she licked bread powder off her fingertips put her elbows on the pale ashwood and leaning close to him said do you really think this avalon ltd is a clue left behind for us by okamisan he thought of her on the vaporetto in venice cold wind in her face so that she blinked back tears her thick hair streaming from her face the anger she had expressed then caught him in a vipers grip and aware that he knew nothing about her he wondered whether it had truly dissipated follow the sequence of what we found carefully folded in okamisans study and where step by step it has led us okami is a meticulous man and a supremely clever one i would say yes its a deliberate message for us what if it is a clue but it wasnt left by okamisan that possibility has occurred to me but we wont know until we arrive at avalon ltd itself she looked down at the remains of their breakfast dont you think she said that if the assassin got to him he would be dead by now only if okamis enemies want nothing more from him than his demise she seemed to be vibrating now but from fear or exhilaration he could not say you told me he never wrote anything down he said whatever he has been working on is all in his head it stands to reason his enemies would want his secrets before they have him killed are you sure its what id do in their place christ youre cold she said looking away from him at the deep lustrous green of the miniature hinokis and again he felt this peculiar attractionrepulsion from her mind which he could not fathom look celeste if we arent able to think clearly and without emotion we have very little chance of helping okami she nodded mutely her eyes dark and unreadable he felt that it was time to go on the way out he asked the concierge for the address of avalon ltd the concierge looked it up wrote it down on a slip of paper handed it over along with a folding map of the city on the back of the map was a schematic of the metro and the concierge drew the route they needed to take at the rue du bac metro station they took line north three stops to concorde they were now on the right bank they transferred to line heading east how much do you know of this alliance between the yakuza and the mafia which okamisan spoke to me about nicholas asked her i suppose if i knew as much as okamisan does she said id be a target too she swung her head to look past him at an ad for galeries lafayette the parisian department store he told you about the godaishu yes did he tell you that the godaishu was his own creation nicholas stared at her he didnt the five continents seemed a fitting name for an international conglomerate that spanned the globe celeste said it was to be legitimate in all ways the path that okamisan had seen to keep the remnants of the yakuza from being annihilated by increasing government controls and crackdowns by the power of his personality and his office he convinced the inner council of oyabun to go along with him but some were unsure others clandestinely hostile to the idea yes okami told me that they were afraid of losing the enormous influence and power their lawlessness gave them celeste nodded there was talk that the kaisho had grown old beyond his usefulness that he was increasingly bound to a world of his own imagining you mean the council believed him senile someone was promoting the tale in any event celeste said the man who now controls the direction of the godaishu she nodded clearly she did not believe that okami was senile their growing estrangement caused okamisan to rethink his own path someone was consistently undermining his orders so in desperation he shifted alliances made deals behind the godaishus back began in effect to work against their growing conviction that they needed to preserve their illegal empire now the war is in the open do you have a suspicion who has ordered okamis death it disturbs me that i dont celeste said but i have a recurring nightmare in it i discover that all the oyabun of the godaishu are in it together and even okamisan does not have the power to beat them down is that possible now that the hostilities are in the open i doubt it celeste said some of the oyabun are weaker than others and there are suballiances based on giri no i believe there is one oyabun persuading the others that okamisan must be destroyed he is the one controlling the godaishu because despite my paranoid nightmare i cant imagine all the oyabun of the inner council moving against the kaisho no matter how much they disagreed with his plans nicholas considered this it seems logical then that this oyabun is the one controlling the godaishu okamis nemesis yes then ill have to find him nicholas said and for that ill have to return to japan but not before ive made sure that okami is safe but cant you tell if okamisan is all right i mean youre psychic nicholas was beginning to understand her approach to him and suddenly he had what seemed like the answers to questions he had been asking himself lets get one thing straight im not psychic he said immediately i dont see the future or perform exorcisms i dont bust ghosts down to size but you can see things feel them celeste said you knew okami was not in his palazzo you saw the bloody domino mask before we found it what i am able to do nicholas said is to tap into certain elemental laws of nature theyre lightyears away from quantum physics or solid geometry or any of the other sciences mankind has created so it can make order out of chaos the train slowed into a station the usual exchange of passengers made talking difficult for a moment when they were on their way again he said perhaps tautau comes closest to mathematics which man created by unconsciously translating the heartbeat of the universe into a language he could understand music which is universal to all cultures is merely a matter of mathematics the rhythm in the air just before the kanfa bridge appeared celeste said thats right they got off at the st paul stop emerging onto the street they found themselves in the heart of the marais celeste was silent but nicholas could feel emanating from her a disturbing sensation akin to throwing the transmission of a car from drive to reverse and back again the marais had a fascinating history it had been shunned during the middle ages because it straddled an arm of the seine that turned its ground swampy thus its enduring name which meant marsh disease was rampant here in the thirteenth century monks devised a way to dram the water away making the area habitable a century later it was taken over for a time by charles v and it came into vogue but when during the first empire the nobility moved out for posh residences in the faubourg st germain it fell into decline and the jews took over transforming it into an area of tradespeople all this nicholas related to celeste as they walked toward the place des vosges the most famous spot in the area how do you know so much about paris she asked spent a year here setting up the french office of the advertising agency i was working for you in advertising i can hardly imagine it believe it or not he said neither can i they walked in silence for some time at length she said that was a difficult year for you wasnt it he was startled by the accuracy of her comment but then he knew people invariably emanated all manner of unintentional signals via their tone of voice their facial and body expressions no doubt she had picked up on a number of these yes he said thoughtfully but it had nothing to do with business a woman he looked at her maybe youd like to tell me about her she laughed coloring god no i have no idea you said it was a woman any female would have known but she seemed distracted now almost uncomfortable they were a little more than a block from the place des vosges and the workingclass food markets were giving way to trendy clothing and shoe shops postmodern stationeryasan boutiques and the occasional antique store all at once celeste started clutching at him its him she said hoarsely there the man who was following us in venice hes hiding down that side street the one we followed who almost trapped us on the kanfa bridge nicholas turned heading into the street she indicated he was not yet concerned because he was certain she was mistaken surely if the man were there he would have picked up the emanations of his tautautrained psyche the narrow thoroughfare contained a tangle of shovedtogether shops and shadows sunlight touched the upper floors of the buildings but left the street itself in deep shadow nicholas wound his way through the pedestrian traffic his eyes and mind searching for the messulethe he had a clear picture of the man in his mind from when his hat had blown off and he had bent to retrieve it chiseled oriental face bronze skin the lips firm a mole on his lip at the corner of his mouth he saw no one fitting that description he felt nothing there was no sign of any disturbance physical or psychic after a thorough search up and down the street proved fruitless he returned to where she stood fingertips pressed hard against her temples they were white with strain i couldnt find him he said are you all right just a slight headache she shook her head sorry i must be seeing goblins but her eyes were clouded with pain or doubt he wondered extending his mind toward hers he felt her emotions swept away from him like fog scuttling along the ground on a cold wet morning he could not tell what she was feeling he took her hand led her back toward the wide rue st antoine where sunlight and crowds beckoned gaily he could tell she was shaken and he wanted to do something that would shift her mood bring her back to where she had been before he decided to tell her about that year in paris so long ago her name was mylene he said as he propelled her along the woman i met here years ago red hair just like yours i fell in love with her and almost married her what happened she looked at him and he could see that the translucence had returned to her eyes happily he had reengaged her attention the relationship spun out of our control nicholas said neither of us understood ourselves let alone the other person as a result we were either making love at all hours in any venue imaginable and a few that werent or we were at each others throats in the end we exhausted each other emotionally and physically we had nowhere to go how did it end he could see the arch that led to the place des vosges a magnificent square of park recently remodeled surrounded by attached residential buildings of varying shades of pink and sienna colonnaded on the street level where shops and restaurants plied their trades badly he said there were tears flying fists clashing ids screams and finally a ferocious coupling you couldnt exactly call it making love wed finished with that emotion some time before we were driven by rage and i imagine a good dose of fear what would we do without one another he smiled at her though the memories so long held in check were particularly painful live of course but in those days neither of us knew how to do that very well it sounds like a film perhaps so he said we were torn from one another as if by a hurricane and you never heard from her again no they passed through the south entrance into the place des vosges and in that moment the whole of bustling paris vanished behind them in a mist the studied calm of the colonnaded park embraced them children ran along the paths laughing and near one fountain a group dressed in suits and gowns flowed together as a photographer took pictures the young couple in the center giggled just as the flash went off and everyone began to laugh ignoring for the moment the photographer calling them to attention oh look celeste said a wedding party they watched from a discreet distance as the young couple kissed chastely for the camera and then urged on by their friends and family spontaneously embraced as the photographers flash went off again and again this reminds me of my sisters wedding celeste said she seemed more relaxed as if secreted away here she could forget the disturbing mirage of the messulethe it was held outdoors i remember it rained in the morning and we were all despairing but then an hour before the ceremony was to start the clouds broke and the sun came out there was a rainbow briefly and the photographer caught them with it in the background the wedding party broke up wending their way out of the square and nicholas and celeste began to walk toward one of the colonnades i often think that golden afternoon was the high point she said sober again everyone seemed so blissfully happy but perhaps im misremembering it she shrugged the truth is i dont think she has a very successful marriage she smiled wistfully but then my sister is extremely willful and you know how italian men are women in their place and all the rest of it your sisters too smart for her own good thats what my father used to say and what did he think about you nicholas asked oh hed say youre different celeste youre clever now cleverness is a trait a man can put up with in a woman nicholas laughed but he could see that for her it wasnt funny and for the first time he got an inkling that her relationship with her father had not been perfect so in some ways your father was oldworld italian no he was venetian and thats not the same thing at all there was carthaginian blood in him cycladian who knows what else from what i could gather from him he relied on my mothers advice she was an extraordinary woman so my father loved to tell me filled with ambition for him and for herself she put her head down but not before he noticed her eyes going opaque she died in a fire there were many my fathers rivals superstitious women whom she had frightened by her inversion of what they saw as the natural order who believed that her life was taken by god or by the priests that she died like a heretic at the stake when did this happen barely a year after i was born shadows from beneath the colonnade striped their faces stitched long shadows to their feet all around them set into the colonnade were tea and antique shops bistros small businesses one of them was avalon ltd nicholas looking across the square could see its facade there was nothing remarkable about it just another storefront with scrollwork lettering on the window avalon ltd masks designed and hand made celeste was watching the door into avalon ltd he might be there she said and then after a long pause isnt there anything here a rhythm that will tell us if okamisan is alive nicholas hearing the desperate tension in her voice considered lying to her but what good would that really do instead he said think of me as a hunter sometimes when the wind is right when other conditions allow it i can smell the prey before i come in sight of it but its not all the time and im not always in control of those conditions then he might be already dead lets hope not there will be little satisfaction in bringing his murderer to justice it has occurred to me that mikio okami must know more about what has been happening to him and to us than he revealed to me or to you here and there leaves fell tumbling through the air a police car turned in through one of the entrances proceeded to make a slow patrol around the perimeter street it stopped for a moment its engine idling then moved on at last disappearing through the opposite gate a middleaged couple strolled in the woman read her guidebook while the man took some pictures of the fountains and the pigeons they didnt stay long all the while celestes gaze had not wavered from the storefront across the colonnade time to see whats inside nicholas said im afraid i have an intuition okamisan is in there dead celeste one way or another we have to find out just give me a moment okay she had that distracted expression he had seen earlier when she had had her false vision of the messulethe as she wended her way to the nearby bistro at the corner of the colonnade nicholas contemplated her enigmatic life what she had revealed to him had had a searing impact and yet quite unexpectedly he found that he knew as little about her as he had before he found that quite extraordinary he was just thinking of the odd approachavoidance emanations coming from her when he saw her emerge from the shadows at the side of the bistro and slip out a side entrance withbut looking in his direction he went after her she was headed out of the place through the north arch immediately she turned left heading up the rue des francsbourgeois the prelunchtime streets were more crowded now and celeste had picked up her pace then like a twig pulled inexorably on by a streams current she disappeared round a corner and nicholas broke into a run because now he felt the darkness the sinister pulse of the silent chorus at kokoro the chant that set up black vibrations like the desperate pulse of a fly caught in a spiders web reverberating the messulethe nicholas swung round the corner almost collided with a middleaged woman with her hands filled with netted bags heavy with groceries he excused himself and already looking past her swerved out of the way down the street he pounded feeling celeste in his mind moving closer to those malevolent reverberations following her path with his minds eye his tanjian eye using tautau now because he knew he must in order to save her but also knowing he was alerting the adept to his own presence by the extension of his power he knew he was playing a very dangerous game he had only come up against two tanjian adepts and both of them had come near to killing him this one was of course different he had tapped the numinous power of the messulethe and the profound sense of the unknown here was like a yawning abyss whose size and depth were veiled in mystery he could feel him more clearly now and that sense of the rhythm the silent beat against the membrane of kokoro at the heart of all things began to fill his mind with its hideous strength it was the primitive cadence that made things happen that brought what others thought of as magic out of the realm of the mind and into the physical world the excitation of kokoro set into motion the networks by which tautau gained its strength it was a mentally fatiguing act this excitation of the membrane of kokoro and it was only now when he was so close to the adept that nicholas understood and his blood ran cold as he at last caught sight of celeste at the far corner of the crowded street he knew what made this adept different and so very dangerous he was able to keep the rhythm of kokoro going endlessly no conjuring it up from time to time when it was needed for him that was for lesser tanjian then the horror of what he had discovered was blotted out nicholas felt the pressure in his mind as the adept increased the tempo of the cadence saw with his special sight the extension of tautau like a liquid shadow that entwined itself through all the shadows of the street unnoticed by passersby by celeste herself who was standing stock still at the street corner her head moving from side to side her eyes wildly darting in every direction he launched himself forward darting between angered pedestrians his way encumbered slowing him down when he had no time to spare he caught sight of the messulethe and to his shock did not see the face he was expecting this was a different messulethe than the one he had seen in venice his path was made more difficult now because of the sudden press of people the sidewalk was narrowed by the stained wooden planks of a construction crew repairing gas mains below the rippedup pavement as he pressed on he became aware of the tautau shadow detaching itself from his hiding place flashing with black light directly toward celeste to nicholas it represented pure malignancy and he knew he would never reach the messulethe in time he smelled the acrid stench of sulfur knew he was the only one around who would and his psyche expanded like a great beast it wrapped itself around celeste just at the moment the shadow struck her the sheer force of it staggered her thrusting her off the curb and into the street but nicholass protection held the pressure in his mind was so great now that all vision was distorted rainbow colors smeared themselves like auras around every living thing that moved in his field of vision and he experienced that disconcerting sense of sliding sideways outside the grip of time so that it seemed as if he could see himself in the struggle with the messulethe the messulethe redoubled his efforts to get to celeste to crush her mind with the force inside him nicholas staggered with the enormous effort required to protect her battered by unknown forces he felt a rushing in his ears and he was blind fully inside akshara timeslipped acutely painfully aware of its shortcomings if only he had koryoku the access to what he knew had once existed and could again shuken the whole of akshara and kshira the power of the dominion all at once the rushing in his ears became a howl and the cold sweat broke out on his goosefleshed skin because he knew that akshara was not enough to win this battle the reverberations the messulethe had set in motion at kokoro were so powerful that they were threatening to tear him apart and he knew he had to get them away now or they would both be finished already he could feel his protection cracking slipping away from celeste leaving her open and vulnerable to the messulethes assault the most appalling noise filled nicholass mind making rational thought impossible he knew he was at the limits of his power he felt weak and ineffectual against this malignant power which drove against him with the force of a piledriver in seconds he knew it would be over he would be overwhelmed and celeste stripped of his protection would be killed he did the only thing he could stripping himself from akshara he closed his tanjian eye and returning to real time opened his physical eyes he saw the messulethe concentrating his face lined and sweatbeaded with effort his protective force had been withdrawn and he knew he had only precious instants to act before celestes mind would be pulverized beneath the messulethes relentless assault he reached down hefting a chunk of concrete from the rent sidewalk and without conscious thought hurled it as he would a shuriken a steel throwingstar the messulethe must have heard the whirring of the missile as it neared him but he was timeslipped his focus narrowed to the diameter of a filament as he concentrated his psychic power awareness came too late the concrete slammed him backward throwing him off his feet nicholas raced toward celeste on her knees in the street traffic blared as a taxi bore down on her despite the driver desperately applying his brakes the harsh squeal of brakes the smell of burned rubber accompanied him as he charged through the throngs leapt between a pair of thick iron posts driven into the pavement to prevent parisian drivers from parking along the corner he left his feet because it was the only chance now the taxi terribly close he could smell its exhaust see the front tires as they left marks on the street tucking his head down he rolled in a ball increasing his momentum came up beside her after one revolution put his arms hard around her waist yanked her up and over one shoulder his head toward the far side of the street the taxi brakes screaming went through the spot where she had fallen screeched to a halt some feet beyond but by that time nicholas had regained his feet had scooped celeste into his arms and was carrying her away from the curious crowds the blaring horns the stunned cab driver and the scorching psychic afterburn like the stench of the flowers of evil francie giggled gotta go mom but could i have fifty were hitting the movies later then she began to sob still lying in croakers arms margarites face was a mask of agony francie darling oh god oh god the tears whipped off francies face i cant go on like this come on francie margarite said reaching for her im going to take you home no the girl shrank away into croakers chest im not going home ill die at home francie but she stopped looking into croakers eyes margarite could read him knew what he wanted to do knew from speaking to the psychiatrist that sometimes a stranger could be of more help than a family member particularly a parent francie im not going to do anything you dont want croaker said im going to pick you up and take you out of here were not going home she cried i dont want to go home not home croaker said somewhere where you and i can talk okay francie looked down at his biomechanical hand i want to hold that she whispered her eyes wide croaker closed his fingers into a tight fist and francie wrapped her hands around it now no one can hurt me she said almost to herself she nodded and croaker scooped her up in his arms is there a back way out of here he asked margarite she had been about to protest control stripped from her but she could see that her daughter was already calmer she nodded this way ill take care of the bill and alert the bodyguards so they dont break your arms she met them a moment later beside the lexus coupe the bodyguards had kept a discreet distance but they had not yet piled into their car margarite came hurrying up unlocked the lexus croaker took the back seat with francine where should we go she asked why dont we just stay here for the moment croaker suggested okay with you francie she nodded silent tearful snuggled against his muscular shoulder she began to sniffle now i want to ask you some questions he said softly but i want you to remember something you dont have to answer any of them margarite sat behind the wheel half turned round staring at croaker and her daughter in the rearview mirror can you tell me why you felt like you were going to die back there i still feel that way you do why she shrugged i just feel that way okay whats it feel like blackness just words failed her and she squeezed her eyes shut she was weeping again silently this time croaker did not touch her did not in any way acknowledge she was in distress francie whos your favorite actress jodie foster francie said wiping her nose okay pretend youre jodie foster croaker said youre on the set of a movie lets see terminator the girl giggled thats silly jodie foster wouldnt be in t linda hamilton would but she had stopped crying and definitely seemed more alert what if they couldnt get linda hamilton maybe theyd pick you okay yah now think of what happened back in the restaurant as a scene from the film think of the feeling as a thing as something to scare you so you can bring back what you felt back there get the picture set in your mind now describe it to me francie closed her eyes im in a car not like this one but bigger riding through the country its night and very dark im supposed to be asleep but im not im awake lying in the back seat listening to the voices staring out at the night sky her lids fluttered that sky so close and black blacker than black like being under a thick blanket in the summertime no stars no clouds stifling she gave a little gasp and her eyes flew open they were terrified its okay croaker said holding her tight youre safe here with your mother and me but he followed francies gaze saw that margarite was sitting with her head lowered her hands over her face mom francie said tentatively it was you i heard hush baby you and that man margarites fingers closed into fists and she said in a strangled voice oh my detective how i wish you had never come into our lives he said he knew more about uncle dom than you did mom the girl obviously needed to talk now to free herself from the unconscionable trauma that had been crippling her he said that you held my life in your hands and you said you dont have to keep threatening me i understand the situation then later as we were pulling into one of those motels along the highway he said right now you think of me as the devil but later months after its all over youll know the truth and when he got out of the car you began to cry margarite was crying now her shoulders hunched the sobs torn out of her in racking spasms croaker waited a moment before he asked what man hes why im going to die francie looked at him hes going to come back and kill me the man who killed caesar and then killed uncle dom ten tokyo paris venice old westbury washington nangi tried to decide at what point he had become aware of the white toyota had it been when his driver had accelerated away from the traffic light in shinjuku or even before that when they were closer to the office he tried to clear his mind tell me what you know about vincent tinh he said to seiko ive known him for years she said he used to date a friend of mine thats how we met it was at a party i think singapore well it was a long time ago but i remember he impressed me right away he was very clever and not at all the trusting sort you cant afford to be trusting in southeast asia so youve followed his career more or less seiko shook her head not really but it seemed i couldnt avoid him his name kept popping up as he brokered billiondollar deals electronic factory startups in kuala lumpur computer manufacturing in the philippines hightech importexport work in vietnam but solid deals leadingedge stuff he was the wizard middleman it seemed to me he not only knew all the right people but knew how to handle them so when linnearsan asked me to recommend someone for saigon i automatically thought of vincent did you hear of anything illegal he was involved in nangi asked illegal seiko seemed startled nangi nodded the saigon police inspector intimated that tinh might have been dealing drugs that this activity might have been the reason for his death but you said vincents death was accidental thats what the police are calling it but reading between the lines chief inspector van kiet privately felt it was murder its all so strange she acknowledged there was the matter of someone claiming to be a family member picking up the body i did as you asked got the telephone number of avalon ltd in london the person i spoke to there assured me he had never heard of the man well that was to be expected what business is avalon ltd in hightech importexport seiko said just as tinh used to be nangi mused curious but im certain its just a coincidence seiko lowered her head i take full responsibility for vincent tinh nangisan nonsense you did what you thought was right besides at this point theres no proof that tinh was irivolved in anything illegal but part of his mind was back at the office where masamoto goei and his chi team were still dissecting the neuralnet clone computer trying to discover what technology made it run besides the section of chi boards goeis men had already identified a sense of foreboding darkened nangis thoughts every time he called goei for an update and was told no substantive progress had been made except that the other boards were of american design where had this clone come from and who had spirited out technology to reproduce the chi boards the white toyota moved in the periphery of his vision still i what is it seiko saw the peculiar twist of his head were being followed nangi said seiko turned round peered through the bmws rear window which one wait he said and watch he leaned forward tapped his driver on the shoulder in a particular cadence at once the bmw swerved to the lefthand lane took the first left with a screech of brakes and protesting tire rubber a moment later a white toyota turned the corner and nangi said that one can we get away from them she asked nervously nangi folded his hands over his dragonheaded walking stick said why on earth would we want to do that seiko gave him a curious look her hand closed with some pressure over the door handle were slowing down thats right nangi opened his door even before the bmw had come to a complete halt perhaps now well begin to get some answers the white toyota screeched to a halt just in front of the bmw its rear end angled outward blocking the other cars way nangi emerged from the bmw in time to see a tall slim man unfold from behind the wheel of the white toyota he wore a dark sharkskin suit and black wraparound glasses this rather insectoid creature waited with the open door between him and nangi nangi could see his pistol bulging beneath his jacket yakuza slowly the front passengerside door of the toyota opened and a burly man appeared he had a pockmarked face and blunt mouth and eyes that quartered the environment every fifteen seconds he bowed paid his respects in formal yakuza fashion giving his name place of birth and his clan affiliation the yamauchi nangi thought he had met tomoo kozo the oyabun only once what could this man want with him the burly man rose and said please send the woman away with your driver you will be in our care today nangis driver moved and the insectoids gun was out in a flash theres no need for this nangi said i have my instructions to bring you the burly man said the method is entirely up to you nangi nodded he bent down said something to his driver then slammed his door shut seikos pale face was in the window nangisan go home nangi said nothing will happen to me how can you trust them but he was already limping toward the white toyota relying more than he had to on the dragonshead cane when he came abreast of the toyota the insectoid opened the rear door for him he got inside and the burly man joined him in the back seat then the insectoid slid behind the wheel slammed into gear and the white toyota took off nangi sat back against the cloth of the back seat his hands curled around the carved head of his cane where are you taking me he asked the burly man turned his pockmarked face toward him today is not the same as yesterday he said with a smirk your protector may no longer be among the living a gold tooth flashed mikio okami is missing celeste was screaming she came awake with a violent shudder as if forced from theta to alpha from sleep to consciousness by a clawed fist sitting straight up in the bed her forearms crossed protectively over her face she screamed nicholas who had been sitting very close to her came and pried her forearms apart imposing himself into her field of vision trying with the force of his mind to exclude the nightmare image dredged up from the swamp of her subconscious that swam with sharp teeth and razortail behind her eyes celeste he spoke with his mind to calm her and because she would not hear him over her screams but oddly this made her all the more frantic he let go of her wrists and when he was certain she was focused on him moved back off the bed in the end he stood quite still breathing slowly in and out until she was finished until her mind lagging in the aftermath of severe shock could surface on its own from the depths of the nightmare when she had stopped screaming he picked up the phone spoke quietly to the day manager to assure him that everything was all right it was mademoiselle remembering how close the taxi had come to hitting her she was fine now merci but perhaps an infusion menthe to calm mademoiselles nerves he replaced the receiver said to celeste its all right youre safe now but she was shaking her head fear a dark stain widening in her eyes no its not all right youre still here and then he understood it all and he said celeste its time you told me about yourself she turned her head to the wall you cant hide from me you see she wrapped her arms around herself for warmth for shelter celeste im not the enemy everyone is the enemy of course he could see how she would think that there was a knock at the door and opening it nicholas took the tray from the waiter put it on the desk he signed the check closed the door to the room when celeste had accepted the mint herbal tea from him he said its so simple isnt it you knew what an awful time i had spent here years ago and you knew it was because of a woman celeste said nothing instead put the edge of the cup to her lips she would not look at him but it didnt matter now but more than that you foresaw the messulethe adepts appearance in the marais it was only the street you got wrong the cup fell from her lifeless fingers and its steaming contents spilled onto the bedcovers she seemed unaware of anything but the sound of his voice he reached out with his psyche to enfold her in his protection but she flinched and cried out keep away from me her voice a dry rasp were two of a kind arent we she shuddered dear god what dreadful irony that i should call on you for help youre wrong nicholas said and something in his tone made her turn her head you and i are quite different the talentswe possess talents there were tears standing in the comers of her eyes and her body was vibrating with a series of tiny spasms you call this a talent this she shuddered again and for the first time looked down saw the mess on the bedspread in front of her her eyes flicked up at him so youll understand i did not tell you the whole truth about my mother down again at the wet stain because she could not now maintain contact as she was drawn backward in time she died when i was six we had how shall i describe it a difficult relationship she and my father were always at odds or so it seemed to me at the time at the time thats all that matters isnt it in the reverse telescope of memory i understand what an insufferable brat i was how cruel i was to her but only now not then then i only knew that she hurt my father and that in return i must hurt her there was a long silence nicholas could hear her breathing would perhaps have sensed what was going on inside her but in prudence kept his psyche well heeled inside himself at length celeste drew a deep shuddering breath and her eyes closed when her lips moved her whispered words had a ghostly quality i saw what was going to happen to her the fire her death everything i saw it in my mind like a film and i said nothing did nothing to help her her eyes opened and looking into his they had a haunted aspect they were magnified by tears i could have saved her why didnt i so this was the truth not only fear of herself but a crippling guilt as well you were too young he said and in response to her withering look added look at yourself celeste youre still too young to understand let alone control your talent that word again she squeezed her eyes shut shuddered you cant control a gift from the devil it just is whatever it is he said softly its a part of you he came and sat on the edge of the bed you were six celeste can you say with all honesty that you knew what you saw was the future that it was actually going to happen to your mother or could you have thought that it was an idle wish a wish yes i but the words caught in her throat and she began to gag so that nicholas reached out to hold her close to him and only this near her could he hear the tissuethin keening of her words forced at last from her throat but maybe not just an idle wish a passing fancy but an evil desire that with this thing this power i caused to happen she was sobbing now and nicholas rocked her holding her tight all the fear and tension sluicing from her as her heart broke open and poured forth the blackness she had been holding in check for so many years celeste listen to me he said in her ear no one not you or me or that messulethe out there no one can create the future what you saw was happening perhaps even as you saw it you were six celeste a small child think even if you had gone to your father and told him what you had seen would he have believed you why would he you must accept the fact that at six you were powerless to help your mother but i didnt want to help her her head on his shoulder a child again that feeling you must deal with he said stroking her hair but thats another matter entirely i dont want to spend the rest of my life hating her her breath was slowing as she calmed i want to love her then youve got to forgive her and forgive yourself she slept then for a while curled in a ball her face to the windows where the gauzy curtains filtered the last of the late afternoon sun as it fell into the green copper lake of the rooftops nicholas put on a light jacket of black cotton flipped out the door margarite drove very fast overtaking cars and trucks at will croaker was glad he had his seatbelt fastened she had become quite distraught and he wanted to know why she turned through the gates of her estate nodded to the two goons who were lounging around smoking and keeping their hands warm in case croaker supposed they needed to grab their guns quickly a spray of gravel was left in their wake as she kicked the lexus round the last curve to the house in the silence after she switched off the ignition croaker could hear the rottweiler barking forcefully the dog and its handler came into view it was up on its hind legs its mouth open tongue lolling wetly as soon as margarite stepped out of the car it came down on all fours snorted then returned to its panting and restless padding croaker looked at margarite over the lowslung cartop as she drew francie out beside her i want francie out of this environment right now i can see how tony and i are destroying her ive got a friend in connecticut who she can stay with tony wont like it croaker warned fuck tony she said as her daughter slipped her arms around her waist she kissed the top of francies head said quietly darling go inside and ask mikey to help you pack still the girl was reluctant to part from them go on sweetie margarite said francie stood staring at croaker at length she said will i see you again promise she gave him one last look then turned and ran up the front steps into the house the rottweiler ought to go to connecticut with her what for margarite said hes already killed one dog hell just do it again if he wants her i dont want anything to happen to her she gave him an ironic smile what an extraordinary thing to say my detective a wise guy appeared at the front door to the house you want francie to get packed mrs d thats right mikey she said do it now before mr decamillo gets home the wise guy seemed uncertain then nodded went back inside for a moment margarite was silent with indecision unknown emotions flickered in her eyes at last she said what am i going to do lew he was here he killed two ol my staff and caesar croaker felt his heart thudding heavily against his chest but that isnt all he did is it margarite no her voice had dropped to a hoarse whisper he went after francie threatened to kill her he would have i saw that much in his eyes god no wonder shes so freaked out the estate had acquired a preternatural stillness the kind beneath which a trained ear could sense the first onset of electrical energy that presaged a major storm he drugged francie hung her upside down in her room as an example for me to see she took a deep shuddering breath then we sat and waited for the phone to ring he told me dom was going to be calling and that i was to set up a meeting without his witsec handlers that was easy its what dominic wanted hed been told that tony was beating up on francie the amber eyes seemed haunted like a roomful of mirrors croaker went on when it was clear she couldnt then robert forced you to take him to your brother all the way to minnesota her head went down oh christ what he did to me she was shaking with the memory he made me an accomplice to my own brothers murder gaunt was waiting in a dingy bar on the outskirts of chinatown he was nursing a jack daniels and feeling like hurling himself into the potomac was there such a thing as death by pollution sure it happened every day death by exposure to radon plutonium radar guns microwaves even aboveground hightension wires who said living in the country was healthier than the city gaunt seated in one of the booths in the bars rear stared into the amber corn liquor and contemplated his current situation strictly no exit he knew enough about the chi project to be frightened by what davis munch the pentagon investigator had told him the chi project was supposedly still in the development stages but that could mean anything from weve got shitall to were about to roll out a production model and beat the competition six ways from sunday he also suspected that the chi technology roughly paralleled that of hyrotechincs hive computer nicholas prescient as usual had embarked on his own project when it became dear that his bid to buy hyrotech was going to be stymied from the limited knowledge disseminated within satotomkin gaunt understood that the chi computer would be several steps advanced from the hive technology at this time of the day somewhere between dinner and drunkasa skunk the bar was crowded a beery smoky smell permeated everything killing all color all sense of time and place which was just the sort of atmosphere that attracted the denizens of this kind of watering hole in his current mood gaunt felt perfectly at home here had nicholas somehow managed to steal proprietary elements from hive or was someone neatly trying to frame him with senator ranee banes strategic economic oversight committee perhaps it was the senator himself or was it merely that bane had an agenda and nicholas fit neatly into it men in business suits women in skirts and slacks lounged up front at the boomerangshaped bar half slurring comments between overloud horsey laughs leaning in that way intense and nonchalant that only seasoned drunkards can achieve gaunt watched them with a jaundiced eye trying very hard not to be reminded of his mother he knew that whichever scenario turned out to be the truth mcnaughton was right in urging him to walk away from satotomkin and his ties to nicholas of course he was already technically in the mess since the committee had served him with a subpoena but he was an old political hand and he could decipher mcnaughtons code if he walked away now mcnaughton could still save him there was still a limited amount of time for him to flex his political muscles before the committee sat at its first session at the beginning of next week after that gaunt would be strictly on his own once the committee got to him there was no string mcnaughton could pull that would be sufficient gaunt would as mcnaughton had said go down with the ship gaunt who had been diligently watching the front door did not see the figure until it slipped into his booth they make emergency exits for people like me the figure said to him timothy delacroix thats me the man sitting at right angles to him did not offer his hand but then again neither did gaunt he was a sandyhaired man in his midforties who at some time or other had gotten more than his fair dose of sun and wind as a result the skin of his nose cheeks and forehead seemed permanently flayed red and deeply lined as would flesh that had been wounded many times over without having had time to properly heal delacroixs eyes were so pale as to appear colorless and he licked his lips incessantly his face possessed a great deal of character like t e lawrences not hard but reconstructed by curious and scarifying adventures youre a friend of munchs delacroix said we know each other whatever delacroix shrugged he told you to ring me so you must be in bad fuckin shape halfway back to washington his gum had started to bleed again and gaunt had reached into his pocket for the handkerchief munch had given him to stanch the flow something had dropped out onto the floor of the car he had not been able to pull over onto the shoulder of the road until he was in the city then he had bent down retrieved a scrap of paper with a name and a phone number scribbled on it delacroixs well what do you know he had thought the investigators more sentimental than he let on okay delacroix said now as he tapped the none too clean tabletop with his forefinger and licked his peeling lips i get distress calls like yours bout seven or eight times a year more n you thought huh he winked well dont you worry assuming youve got the shekels i can do anything and i do mean anything you need transpo no one can catch believe it or not ive got a mintcondition lockheed sr hits mach while other jets are still on the runway or how about an f you heard me right an ffucking you got an east asian dignitary flying into bangkok you want blown out of the sky you need to break into some concrete and leadlined cache somewhere in africa you want to keep a local uprising in east ern europe going he spread his hands wide im your man pardon me gaunt said abruptly disoriented delacroix was waving his hands as if he expected to take off any minute okay not your scene i get it something more subtle is required here i can do that too you need a python handheld mortar a badger lasersighted infrared lockon flamethrower what what in the name of creation do you do anyway you mean munch didnt clue you in delacroix looked offended his yellow teeth playing with the skin on his lips i dont get it everyone else he sends me knows who i am theyre only too happy to pay for my services he grunted unhappily its not like people in my line grow on trees you know and your line is gaunt asked hopefully his mouth was throbbing again and he held it tight tasting his own blood christ man i have it all i have access to any weapon or machine of war imaginable within some limits of course i cant get a stealth bomber but neither i guarantee can my competition despite their claims to the contrary but i dont need gaunt stopped trying to reason it out oh great delacroix said throwing up his hands in disgust i suppose i wont even get a free dinner out of this dont worry gaunt said hastily well go wherever you want thats open this late its on me jeez i dont know delacroix said pointedly looking at his watch in a trade like mine time is money i have money gaunt said swirling some jack daniels around his wounded gum now i just have to figure out how youre going to earn it he ordered a jack daniels for delacroix and fliey finished their drinks together first things first delacroix said pragmatically when they had settled themselves into a chinese restaurant two blocks away where everyone appeared to treat him like a longlost brother just what is the nature of your problem without waiting for an answer he then turned to an expectant waiter and proceeded to spew out a long stream of what might have sounded like invective except that it was cantonese had gaunt not just seen these two men treat each other as intimates he could have mistaken this conversation for an argument were having whatevers fresh that had better suit you delacroix said as the waiter scuttled away and he turned back to gaunt it doesnt matter gaunt responded im not hungry the hands flew while youre at my table youll eat gaunt would have pointed out that he was paying for this meal but this mans enthusiasm seemed to have gotten to him somewhere between here and the bar his depression had lifted he said the problem is this i have four days to figure out if my boss is masterminding a huge computer swindle which i will admit i cannot believe those waving hands again fuck what you believe or dont believe you have this problem youre probably in a position to know dick about what hes doing gaunt hated to admit it but delacroix was right he said the other possibility is that someone probably someone high up in the us government is trying to railroad my boss by planting false info for others to find that it stripped to its bare bones yes um hum delacroix sat with his head on a pedestal made from his fists you dont need me you need some kind of wizard investigator which im not though ive got to say in all honesty there was that time in the sudan when the hands again whirring in the air but thats neither here nor there see this isnt my thing im into more of a whambamthank youmaam kind of thing know what i mean firepower yeah right i deal in nice little wars the breakup of the communist blocs meant a bonanza for people like me all these ethnic minorities chafing to flex their ethnic and religious muscle ready to bash the other guy over the head with whatevers available thats where i come in i make sure the weapons of war and destruction are on hand for instance i got this computerguided gunship im talking stateofthefuckingart persian gulf war in your face kind of thing none of that surplus nam stuff my competitions running specials on i mean man this babys loaded with weapons that can put some mean hurt on you given that gaunt said stepping in before delacroix gave him an offer he couldnt refuse im trying to figure out why munch gave me your number the food came looking wet gooey and not very appetizing smelled good though gaunt thought delacroix was busy spooning what looked like bluebacked crabs in some kind of thick white sauce onto two plates you mean he didnt say uh uh then for christs sake stop dicking around and ask him not possible gaunt said watching his plate fill up with scallops squid and sticky rice if hed been able to tell me im sure he would have no hes on the oppositions side ive got to figure it out on my own at delacroixs behest beer came a whole copper cooler full at least a dozen bottles of stuck in shaved ice delacroix popped a couple of bottles and waded into his food that boss you were talking about he in deep shit with the feds you could say that gaunt stared at his plate daunted in four days a senator ranee banes committee will convene in a session that could convict him of treason and shut down the entire american division of tomkin industries delacroix picked his head up his lips were greasy and a tip of blue crab claw was sticking out of his mouth he spit it hastily out you mean tomkin as in satotomkin yeah why delacroixs pale eyes were big and round as he goggled christ i deal with those people all the time he said thats fucking why eleven paris washington night a glaucous fog descending like the gauzy wings of an angel the threat of rain bringing with it the intensified odors of automobile exhaust and soot below him nicholas could see the horsechestnut trees sheared into the shape of the letter l at the four corners of the place des vosges he looked up into the parisian sky which was filled with garish fire from streetlights along the wide boulevards and circles the spotlights around the eiffel tower reflecting off the lowhanging clouds like smears of rouge on a tarts overmadeup face the rain when it came was a friend because it helped hide him but it was also an enemy because it made the patinaed copper tiles of the mansard roof treacherously slick in the midst of taking a cautious step he froze crouched down in low profile as below him a cop car made its slow circuit of the square at the corner bistro there was more activity now than there had been during the day young people spilling out into the colonnade and beyond onto the street some of them could see him if they looked upward he must give them no cause to do so the roof was at a fortyfivedegree angle good for keeping the inside of the building dry but extremely difficult to negotiate without a roofers secured platform directly ahead and slightly below him was the dormer window his entrance to the building that housed avalon ltd the problem was that the window was closer to the square side of the roof than he would like he calculated he would need perhaps twenty to thirty seconds to get the window open and lever himself in more if there was an alarm system during that time he would be fully exposed to those passing below in the place des vosges it would be foolhardy to assume that no one would chance to look upward during that time in fact he was going under the assumption that someone would the trick was to present a silhouette that would cause no questions to be raised nicholas was dressed all in matt black before he had left the hotel room he had confiscated celestes kohl and now he applied it to his cheeks nose forehead and the edges of his ears the backs of his hands from his pocket he drew out two objects he fitted over his palms these nekode which he had designed and made himself were a kind of lightweight ridged chainmail which covered his palms allowed him to grip slick surfaces then he stretched himself headfirst along the roof and placing his palms firmly against the roofing began to edge his way down rain pattered on the copper spitting bright bits upward into the glare of lights the brittle tang of the metal was in his nostrils he moved as he had been taught as a young boy in a motion known as kagiri nishiki where only one limb was moving at any time distance was crossed in painfully slow fashion because breathing was prolonged to meditation rhythm the entire body going slack for stretches of time in this state the prone human form already distorted by the shadows of the night and the angle of the roof appeared to dissolve the parts flowing in different directions so that it lost the aspect of a human form altogether anyone glancing up at the roof would need to stare fixedly for quite some time at the spot where nicholas lay in order to discern movement even then that movement would most likely be mistaken for pigeons huddling out of the wet weather or rain sizzling off the copper roof time ceased to have any meaning for nicholas he was in the semiconscious state that tibetan holy men attained when walking on fire or nails when the conscious mind was pulled inward sensation dulled throughout the body in this fashion he reached the corner of the dormer without incident a tendril of his mind pulled free of its centrism as his right hand explored the face of the dormer where the frame of the window met the sash of the dormer itself and he was immediately alerted wire an alarm system but now a blind man in the dark he could feel a frayed edge of the insulation and just a bit further on a break that had been ineptly mended to make it appear as if the system was still intact the two ends had come apart and now nicholas was certain that whatever connection had once been made was broken using a shuriken a thin sliver of edged steel he popped the oldfashioned semicircular lock for a long moment he lay still he heard the city sounds all around him the drift of voices from the bistro across the place the crunch of footsteps on gravel the hiss of passing cars from beyond the enclosure of the square and closer the intermittent coo of roosting pigeons he lifted the window a centimeter at a time then slithered toward it his head and shoulders were already in when his peripheral vision caught a bright flash and he froze he stayed that way allowing his pupils to adjust to the darkness he moved his eyes toward the left and picked up the flash again as if it were reflected off the curvature of his iris and then he knew his chin was three centimeters from a wirethin laser beam more sensitive and reliable than infrared if any part of him intercepted it an alarm would sound no wonder the occupants had allowed the outmoded wire alarm to deteriorate below him the sill dropped away three feet to the wooden floor he could see the dusty board gleaming in reflection from the ambient streetlight filtering through the dormer if he could get down to the floor and could drop to a prone position hed be underneath the laser wire the problem was he had no room in which to maneuver he was right up against the wire now time was as much his foe as the lack of space half in half out of the dormer he was at his most vulnerable he could not go down he could not go forward he could not stay where he was so he went up raising his torso up on his palms he brought his legs slowly through the open window by drawing up his knees against his chest he was now in what was essentially a ball and he shifted an infinitesimal amount in order to get his feet flat on the surface of the sash in the process his nose almost touched the laser wire all movement ceased his heart hammered in his chest the flow of adrenalin escalated and with it the lethal possibility of inadvertent motion he sought prana the slow cleansing inhalation and exhalation that brought oxygen all the way to the bottom of the lungs he closed his eyes concentrating on what he must do he opened his tanjian eye reimagined the room its dimensions clearer to him now than they had been with normal sight impaired by the intense gloom there was a crossbeam so he had perhaps three feet of clearance above the laser wire always before when he had tried this maneuver he had had at least that much space now he knew he would have to use up no more than two and a half feet or part of him his forehead or his feet would break the laser wire he gathered himself sinking deeper into akshara time shattered into fragments and like moonlight on water became insubstantial he could feel the pulse of kokoro as he summoned those forces of the universe locked deep inside him he could feel the pulse running through him like fire in his veins more and more slowly the pulse beat until it ceased to throb at all now he launched himself up and outward tumbling he felt his head graze the top of the ceiling a split instant but enough to minutely change his trajectory his arc was foreshortened and with his tanjian eye he could foresee the disaster of one foot breaking the laser wire he reached up the nekode secured to his palms digging into the ceilings crossbeam swung there for a moment like a mad monkey legs drawn up he heard a creak felt a trickle of sawdust his temporary perch was sagging he took a desperate chance holding on long enough for his momentum to swing him in another backward arc he dropped a bit lower as the beam rotten from past roof leaks started to give way for real then he was swinging forward and he let go tumbling out into the blackness the laser wire below flashing past his whirling vision a ruby needle and then he was past it on the other side as he fell tumbling still he hit the floorboards with a soft thump rolled over on his back his head tucked between his shoulderblades as he came up on his haunches he was in its not my mother i need to forgive its my father this was celestes thought as she awoke into darkness she had started up in bed in that curious middle state suspended between living one life and another which was real which the waking state and which the dream for a long uncomfortable moment she could not decide the life she had been living was the one before her father was killed sacrificed was it as okamisan had explained it to her what she hadnt told him what he would never understand was that no amount of explanation would be sufficient to accustom her to her fathers death she didnt want explanations she wanted him back her father had been so eastern that often okamisan said jokingly to him that he was more japanese than venetian he looked at problems from the inside out and his solutions often baffled his competitors and helped him amass a small fortune even by todays inflated standards celeste stirred in the darkness of her paris hotel room not yet willing to acknowledge the reality of her present surroundings what she wouldnt give to have her father alive and standing beside her anything even she knew okamisans life she was pledged to defend him now because this was her fathers wish but the truth was she despised okami with a vitriolic passion only a true venetian could understand how it could abide deep beneath the surface without showing its ugly face it was okami who had come into their lives so many years ago ensnaring them in a nest of vipers a world largely of his own making filled with bitter enmities ancient as oak his affinity for her stepmother a schemer in her own right had been instantaneous celeste had never trusted her stepmother had hated and feared her for one thing as a sicilian she was an outsider for another she seemed to possess a dark power an ability to weave a web of scandal and deceit that destroyed anyone who stood in her husbands way when celeste grew older she understood that okami had helped her together they had built a base of power which her father alone could not have done celestes world had revolved around her father she had grown up with her older sister sharing secrets in the dark until gradually a pattern of knowledge she could not share with her sister overtook her she recalled the first time this had happened she and her sister lying on their backs on a beach in the lido a sultry summers day when the throngs in the piazza di san marco made movement all but impossible when the walls of history all but disappeared behind phalanxes of human heads staring up at lazy clouds her sister seeing a griffin an amorous couple a stampeding horse within the billowing masses celeste had concentrated trying to see the fantastic forms her sister was describing what she saw was the drowning the air engulfed in darkness a small blackhaired head turning face upward as it bobbed in the ocean then the wave coming down with such vivid clarity that celeste had gasped as if she too could no longer suck air into her lungs then she was up and running her mind reeling her equilibrium as cockeyed as a drunkards racing along the wet shoreline stumbling over bathers who turned their sweating oiled faces to stare openmouthed at her where was she running to she had had no idea except that the faster she ran the closer she seemed to come to the event as if her pounding strides were crossing not distance but time drawing her nearer to her vision the drowning in the distance she could make out a commotion young men wading into the breakers shouting to one another leaving their feet to knife their bodies beyond the place where the waves crashed in white spume out to a dark spot in the water the drowning celeste felt like she wanted to vomit the sense of death was so palpable that for a black instant it seemed more real than life an intense sense of dislocation struck her so that she stumbled living for a moment in eternity in two places at once and being fully in neither one she fell her limbs no longer receiving the correct commands from her numbed brain nicholas celeste in the bed of the paris hotel reached out in the dark for the body she expected to find beside her she looked at the empty space and in the dislocation that followed she saw him knew precisely where he was because she too was there in that way she had come to fear and abhor and in the last crystal instant of the dislocation she became aware of the enemy not more than eight feet away across the city crouched and waiting in the darkness for him nicholas nicholas crouched in the darkness of the building that housed the offices of the mysterious firm of avalon ltd all around him the old building seemed to respire as if it were some being alive in light slumber he felt that it would be perilous to wake it he crept out of the attic room into which he had dropped from the roof he found himself on a narrow wooden landing he opened his tanjian eye and saw the steep pitch of the stairway directly in front of him he descended silent as a cat faced obliquely down so that his feet were placed almost horizontally along each tread distributing his weight more evenly and over a wider area of the tread his balance was centered so that his weight was at all times evenly distributed between both feet halfway down the stairway he stopped crouched motionless listening with his ears and his tanjian eye he could hear the rain beating against windowpanes an occasional slap as the wind took a loose shutter against the face of the building nothing more he was frightened now he could recall with a suprareal precision the power of the messulethe and he knew hewas no match for it he had been lucky the last time taking the messulethe by surprise he had no illusions about being able to do that again there was a time when nothing frightened him but that was before the advent of tautau before a tanjian had gone to work on his brain turning him shironinja blocking all his powers he was physically healed had in fact learned of his tanjian heritage because of it but there was embedded deep inside him a shadow on his soul he understood now as he had not when he was younger and more ignorant the power of the unknown his sensei the one man he had trusted with his very life had turned out to be his enemy and at the very core of him lingered a terror that what kansatsu had taught him was in some way he had yet to understand inimical to him the unknown the messulethe was the unknown and he was out there somewhere in the rain in the parisian night waiting the encounter this morning had confirmed a suspicion nicholas had harbored ever since the messulethe had led them to the palazzo where he had conjured the kanfa bridge the messulethe had another agenda perhaps he had indeed been dispatched to murder okami as celeste believed but though okami was missing there was as yet no sign that he had been killed moreover the messulethe seemed to be concentrating on them of course now that okami was in one way or another out of the way it might be natural for him to attach himself to the people pledged to guard him but the incident with the kanfa bridge may have occurred before okami had disappeared this one possibility had stuck with nicholas making him wonder the more he turned it around in his mind the less sense it made given the overall setup within which he had been operating to go back to the beginning if okami was marked for extermination by a traitorous yakuza oyabun then why on earth was the assassin going after nicholas and celeste why waste the time and expose himself to potential danger he had okami out of sight why not kill him and be done with it two chilling possibilities occurred to nicholas either the messulethes assignment had not been to murder okami or the messulethe did not have okami one possibility meant that okami had lied to him the other that he had totally misread the situation either answer would surely lead to a dire conclusion filled with apprehension he stepped onto the landing of the floor below and began a thorough exploration of the rooms there what he discovered startled him there were no workshops for maskmaking none of the paraphernalia one would normally expect in the business of supplying handmade masks in fact if hed had to guess he would have said he was inside a company specializing in investments in the halflight coming in through the windows from the place des vosges he could make out banks of phones faxes computer work stations arrayed like sentinels silent and ghostly desks lamps chairs all the accoutrements of an office except one thing files there were no filing cabinets nicholas stepped up to a computer terminal turned it on he stood there for an instant transfixed by the blinking orange characters a password code was required to get into the system that in itself was hardly out of the ordinary what was was that he was staring at a line of kanji japanese characters he turned off the computer certain now that avalon ltd was not what it purported to be he recalled fornovo telling him that the company had been sold five years ago to a foreign company no one seemed able to identify what was it now he had no idea but it was clear that it had been sold to a japanese concern nicholas froze something in his peripheral vision the hint of a movement reflected off the slightly curved fascia of the computer screen slowly as if his body had turned to smoke he sank to his knees as he did so he twisted until he was half facing the direction from which the movement had come nothing slowly he quartered the area taking in each shape identifying it if he could coming back to it when he couldnt in this methodical way he took in the environment he stayed in this uncomfortable position for a very long time waiting he saw the movement again this time nearer the center of his vision it had reflected off the dark computer screen and now he could see it for what it was a tangential spark from the headlights of a passing car he gripped the edge of the work stations desk as he raised himself and felt the difference in surface texture on the underside beneath the pad of his thumb moving beneath the desk he tilted his head upward saw the square plastic button set flush into the melamine of the desk surface he reached up pressed it it would not give then he saw beside it a lock countersunk into the melamine so that it would not protrude he extracted another shuriken inserted the sliver of steel into the lock a moment later the button gave beneath his thumb nothing seemed to happen then he rolled the chair away moved the plastic pad and found an opening in the carpet he drew out a box of a dozen inch floppy disks on the box was written a numerical sequence he turned the computer on took the first floppy inserted it into the a drive when the prompt for the password came up he typed in the numerical sequence the system rejected it he reversed the order with the same effect the computer flashed a warning that unless the correct password was entered within thirty seconds an internal alarm would sound he closed down the computer sat staring at the blank screen thinking of how to get in he translated the numerical sequence into letters of the western alphabet turned on the computer to try that the computer booted up the screen changing he had forgotten to take out the floppy from the a drive and the computer was reading it first instead of booting up from the c drive hard disk the screen prompted him for a numerical sequence and nicholas typed in the one hed found on the box of floppies he was presented with a directory of files he called up the first one had perhaps ten seconds to read what appeared on the screen dates of delivery lor shipments of chinese ftype fighter planes russian tupolevm bombers t tanks sam antiaircraft missiles american f fighters lockheed sr supersonic jets badger computerized flamethrowers python mortars deyrael handheld antitank bazookas the list seemed endless it appeared as if avalon ltd was a clearing house a middleman between suppliers identified with numerical codes and buyers in iran iraq afghanistan the balkans the new ethnic battlefields of the world where bitter warfare was just beginning in earnest and then at the end of the list he saw a short line of curious icons he pressed the help key and the icons resolved themselves into two words on order meaning not yet available he scrolled to the end of the icons pressed the enter key and saw torch what the hell was that ten seconds and then his world came crashing in the collapse was soundless a kind of psychic implosion and he thought i didnt sense him the messulethe he had not heard the beating against the membrane of kokoro had been reasonably certain that for the moment at least he was safe he staggered beneath the assault swinging around thrusting his tanjian eye this way and that in a vain attempt to discover thelocation of the messulethe as before he believed his only chance to survive the encounter was to come within physical proximity of the messulethe arms length would be preferable but close enough to throw a live terminal at him would do but as he had suspected the messulethe wasnt about to allow that to happen nicholas groaned as he went down to his hands and knees there was a black weight in his mind freezing his synapses robbing him of the ability to string two thoughts together the world was reduced to chaos and then shrinking still farther was forged into a spike of gleaming steel whose point began to pierce the lobes of his brain he was going to die without even looking his antagonist full in the face he did not know his name or who he was could not even conjure a reason for this assault but death was coming that became the only surety in the closeness of his collapsed universe nicholas he tried to center himself to gather his forces at kokoro but the path was blocked strewn with barbed wire that repelled him as he tried to beat the drumhead at the center of the universe akshara was inadequate and again the selfdoubt crept through him as insidious as a virus kansatsus training contained within its very essence the seed of nicholass destruction it would have been like kansatsu whose soul had been deformed by kshira to plan for the eventuality of defeat kansatsu had been the great deceiver the spinner of schemes within schemes and it would fit him to have devised a way to destroy nicholas from beyond the grave nicholas akshara taught that there were seven paths to kokoro all were blocked and now the crushing pressure in his brain turned him blind and deaf a great howling as of a pack of hungry wolves was making his ears bleed breath was coming hot in his lungs as if he had been thrust into a furnace red shapes moving against the black scrim of his maimed vision eerie dreamscapes distorted as they were projected through his fevered brain preternatural images from the dawn of man racememory glimpsed through a forest of pain and crushing pressure nicholas water running the belllike tones working their way through the howling the rising windstorm a filament of silence iridescent and insubstantial as an insects wing blindly he reached for it missed and the howling increased the fury of the windstorm threatening to engulf him entirely the cold hand of death laying its skeletal fingers on his breath robbing him of nicholas he heard her understood its nature spoke to her with his mind though he was dizzy and sick unto death here it was all he could muster and the filament came down a lifeline in the chaos running through the core of him wrapping itself around him brushing aside the skeletons grip lessening the din of entropy pulling him back from the abyss that had opened beneath him the abyss beneath kokoro and now he saw what his antagonists attack had blinded him to he was directly underneath kokoro this was why the seven pathways had been blocked and he reached up began the ritual tintinnabulation setting the rhythm at the center of the universe that would transmogrify thought into action he allowed his tanjian eye to sleep knowing now that the messulethes psychic storm had rendered it dangerously unreliable he opened his physical eyes and saw celeste crouched and shivering with terror but there nonetheless extending the psychic filament that had saved him and behind her the messulethe in this excruciating moment of crisis the last facet of the truth he had been withholding from himself made itself manifest he couldnt let anything happen to her he had been struck crippled by love that was when his ears caught the susurrus as if an insect were caught in a web his attention diverted for an instant his eyes picked up the bright flash desperately transferring messages to his brain and then the dagger thrown directly at his chest came hurtling out of the dark in all ways renata loti was an impressive woman she was in her midseventies tall stately evincing none of the outward infirmities which the years brought to other women her age her back was not bent there was no tremor in her hands no fragility in the way she moved a slight but noticeable limp did nothing to deter her maneuverability or her stamina shes smart and clever delacroix the arms dealer had told him which is hard to find in anyone let alone a woman shes an influencepeddler of rare distinction who specializes in the asian theater shes your man gaunt met her on the corner of constitution and th street across from the ellipse that fronted the white house there was that odd sense prevalent throughout the capital of being in a countryside park rather than in the middle of an urban bustle the broad open spaces serving as a brilliant setting for washingtons primary contrasting elements of sky and imposing stone and castiron edifices behind him rose the renaissance splendor of the oas building with its triplearched entrances massive bronze gates and curious statuary a mishmash of the americas north and south which served as a reminder of how essentially incompatible the two cultures were renata loti had the strong determined face of a woman who knew her way around the corridors of power who had a clear sense of herself and of her purpose in life if she had ever lost her credulity to the disillusionment of reality it would have been a great many years ago but she evinced none of the worldweary cynicism or the unconvincing jingoism that pervaded washingtons political circles her jutting nose high cheekbones deepset cerulean eyes and strong jawline made her a woman to be reckoned with wherever she went she wore her hair in a short fringed cap it was platinum perhaps a touch wild for a woman her age but certainly in keeping with her powerful personality she was dressed in a black slubbedsilk suit black alligator shoes and matching handbag and was wrapped in a stylish threequarterlength black suede coat she wore no jewelry save a glowing cabochon ruby ring on the finger where a wedding band would have been mr gaunt he nodded and she smiled showing just a flash of tiny white teeth its good of you to meet me at such short notice he said shaking her hand i knew your father he was a man to be proud of she gave a little laugh besides i was at a very dull play when you paged me i was already thinking about leaving this gave me a good excuse her head cocked at an angle a young girl sizing up the new boy in class you said you got my number from timothy timothy delacroix yes gaunt said as they began to walk renata indicated that they should sit on a bench just outside the oas gardens he said that you might be the only person in washington able to help me how flattering but her face grew serious ive known timothy a long time he never exaggerates gaunt filled her in concerning senator banes interest in tomkin industries and nicholas in particular he ended up by saying now delacroix tells me hes had dealings with satotomkin through our saigon director vincent tinh if thats true if weve been involved in some way with arms shipments then i suspect banes committee already has proof of it the company is a dead duck and nicholas is liable to wind up in a federal penitentiary for the rest of his life i know all about tinh renata said i thought it intriguing that hed become the saigon director of satotomkin and always wondered who set that up gaunts ears immediately pricked up what do you mean tinh is very bad news the worst in fact hes slick gets things done on time and right which is impressive in southeast asia but hes a real entrepreneur in the worst sense hell deal in anything and everything it he sees a profit in it for the company for himself renata said she considered for a moment i dont know mr linnear personally but you can imagine in my field ive heard a good deal about him from a great many people they say he possesses what the japanese samurai called bushi no nasake the tenderness of a warrior her eyes which were clear and lustrous their color unfaded by time looked out at the traffic on constitution as she gazed inward i am told he has excellent instincts do you agree mr gaunt yes absolutely renata nodded as if receiving an answer already divined i find it unlikely he would have hired tinh on his own someone very good must have sold tinh to him its interesting youd say that gaunt said excitedly ive had a suspicion all along that nicholas and the company have been set up to be guillotined by bane ranee bane is like a cancer racing through a sick body renata said hes a commanding force now despite senator branding and the oppositions best efforts to control him he has an unshakable power base which means even those who despise him are forced to defer to him so id be careful whom you talk to and what you say bane has many friends in washington at the moment not all of them out in the open gaunt nodded thanks for the warning but im an old hand here i know when to keep my mouth shut youre still in danger if you are determined to pursue the vincent tinh angle renata said timothy doesnt know half of what tinhs been into stolen arms shipments are only the top strata if tinhs past is any indication drugs banned chemical weapons hightech military secrets hes been involved in them all and made a fortune at it if thats the case gaunt said curious what was he doing taking a legit salaried job with satotomkin undoubtedly opportunity renata said the legitimacy of the business and the setup work hes doing for the company and i would guess doing it quite well would provide a perfect mask for his own business these days it pays to be a bit less flamboyant with the kind of work tinh loves best if someone set us up ive got to find out who he is gaunt said thats the only chance we have of getting out of this alive renata was silent for such a long time she started to make him nervous what are you thinking she sighed turned to look at him im aware of too many eyes lets take a walk it had begun to rain but renata buttoning her coat seemed undeterred they left the ellipse behind them crossed over constitution into west potomac park as the ground began to slope downward gaunt was aware that they were heading toward the black duolith of the vietnam memorial he could scent the tidal basin south of the reflecting pool and it brought back all sorts of memories good and bad of his previous life in this city the hissing of traffic along the wide avenue on their right gradually gave way to the night wind whispering in the last of the leaves on the trees beside him renata loti had no difficulty negotiating the incline on the contrary she clearly enjoyed the exercise and they moved at a steady pace underfoot the mulch of dead leaves provided a comforting susurrus that made him think of wet autumn days steam coming off the ground mixing with the layers of burnt orange and gold leaves to create a unique confluence of earthy odors he thought of his dead father his stature in this city knowing that he had beaten this place before it hadrisen up to beat him there was a kind of solace in that know ledge and for the first time since returning here he was grateful that fate had dictated that he return against his will renata her head down her hands jammed in her pockets seemed totally lost in thought droplets of rain glittered in her hair like diamonds at last she said it seems to me that in your case taking the most direct route may be the only way for you to find out who touted nicholas on vincent tinh she paused and he could see the breath steaming from between her halfopened lips the problem is its also the most dangerous delacroixs tip had been a good one he suddenly decided this was a special person he felt confident with her balanced in the net of her agile mind and he felt a brief twinge of envy for whoever had been her husband or lover i think theres someone in washington who will know renata said but it will be exceedingly dangerous to approach him on the matter they were at the first wing of the wall gleaming black marble engraved with the names of the fallen rain struck the memorial individual drops sliding down its slick face like tears down a cheek renata stopped stood staring at the wall for a moment at her feet a tiny american flag planted at the memorials base fluttered in the wind and rose petals torn from a bouquet lay scattered on the stone walk she swung toward him very close so that her exhalations fell upon him in tiny puffs remember i told you that there were people in washington who supported bane clandestinely this man is one of them hes high up in banes hierarchy but like a spook he publicly espouses another philosophy her eyes dark and reflective seemed hewn out of the same black rock as the memorial behind her he may be vulnerable because he is sometimes indiscreet in his sexual life i have only very recently come into a few excellent photos i have been waiting for the most judicious moment to use them against him so it seems our meeting is most fortuitous in the rainfilled night sheen and halo the one indirect the other ephemeral made her appear many years younger gaunt found her both desirable and inspiring a potent combination seeing her in this glitter he was reminded of a portrait he had once seen of lucrezia borgia caesares sister both were illegitimate children and a popular theory had it that this fact played a dominant role in their subsequent lust for power gaunt found himself for a moment swept up in the role he imagined for her this man is connected to the nerve center of ranee banes machine renata continued and if you use the information i give you he will tell you what you need to know she used a strong working womans forefinger its clearlacquered nail cut to a mans length to wipe her cheek free of rain and who knows perhaps because of this the whole of banes foul machine will begin to unravel a chance to save the company gaunt was dizzy with the possibilities just a few short hours ago he was contemplating throwing himself in despair into the potomac and now look what his oneman investigation had turned up the probability of a frame and a way to prove it tell me he said a little breathlessly whats the mans name the rain striking her face made it seem as if her pale skin was carved from marble she said william justice lillehammer twelve new york tokyo washington paris i want to confess everything margarite said but to you not to the federal government she looked up into croakers face of all the people in my life i only trust you she put her head against his shoulder my god how pathetic that sounds even to me youre the next thing to a complete stranger what have i made of my life you told me when you got married you knew exactly what you wanted oh i didl who am i now i dont even recognize myself everything ive ever wanted has been rendered meaningless they were in her lexus somewhere in the connecticut countryside after having dropped francie off with margarites friend a divorcee with her own athome consulting business and an intelligent scottie named muirfield she was a golfing enthusiast and promised to teach francie the game i want to thank you margarite said your effect on francie has been extraordinary i was worried back there that she wouldnt let you go shes a strong girl croaker said after all shes been through she still wants to live im afraid ive made quite a mess of both our lives they drove in silence for some time because it was what was on his mind he told her about his friendship with nicholas he recounted how they had met when they had both been tracking the man who had turned out to be nicholass cousin the ninja saigo how they had been reunited in japan when croaker had lost his hand as he did so his words reconstructed the electrifying past for him to live all over again but it was a mixed blessing he found that he missed nicholas with an almost physical sense of pain i envy you that kind of friendship margarite said wistfully when she saw that they were headed toward old westbury she said no i dont want to go home i cant be there now but your husband my husband doesnt count she said carefully i see now that he never did she ran her hand through her hair pulling it back from her cheek she turned on the seat to half face him lew she said im going to tell you something that i never imagined id tell anyone but then i could never have imagined this future for myself and im so frightened now that i know i have to do something tangible to try and disperse my terror otherwise i know itll consume me youre frightened that your brothers murderer will come back for you no she said with a voice quavery with emotion im afraid he wont come back for me they waited at a light hanging in the midst of stalled traffic the flow cut off until the signal changed and the surge began croaker blew air out of his mouth in order to clear his mind i think youre going to have to explain that margarite nodded that and many other things she whispered but for now drive lew drive until you run out of road all the way out to montauk point she seemed to sleep lying slumped beside him her head tilted back her hair folded softly around her her skirt hiked partway up her thighs she seemed like the girl he had dated his one summer out of hells kitchen part of a program for disadvantaged kids hed lied to get into in order to escape the citys intolerable august heat somewhere in pennsylvania out side a small town with an indian name that seemed funny to a kid his age he had come upon her in the dusty flyblown interior of a tiny general store they had drunk fivecent cokes from a redandwhite vending machine and the afternoon had seemed miraculous even then innocence was a precious commodity for a blazing youth like lew croaker who routinely cracked heads and defended himself with a scarred baseball bat on new yorks ferocious west side innocence for him had been a dream a quality too far out of his ken to recognize before he had met rebecca and of course he didnt recognize it not that summer anyway not until many more years had passed croaker woke her when they were east of amaganssett passing through the gorgeous desolation of sand beachplum stunted black pine and the occasional wild rose bush that was napeague this was the narrow neck that connected the east end of the hamptons to montauk another indian name he thought well be running out of blacktop soon he said as she stirred are you hungry yet lets wait she said staring out the window at the hypnotic rise and fall of the dunes he stopped at a ramshackle clam bar on the edge of a ragged field of beachplum to call lillehammer he wanted to bring him more or less up to date but he also wanted to know if lillehammer had gotten the lab reports back from the crime scene the assistant who answered the number lillehammer had given him told him to wait when he gave his operation name he got the impression that she was beeping lillehammer who was god knows where doing god knows what you were right when you said wed need a sorcerer lillehammer said when he finally came on the line no prints not even smudges except those of the two victims his voice sounded metallic as if some electronic gizmo was tearing his voice apart and putting it back together if this was a sciencefiction novel wed clone this sonuvabitch from his own dna grow him up in accelerated fashion and not only find out what he looks like but send him out after the original very funny after the events pf the day croaker was not in the mood for levity of any kind whats this dnamapping going to do for us forget it modern sciences not going to ride to our rescue on this one but i did get a line on that feather stuck to the girls front and its interesting its from a white magpie very rare avian according to the smithsonian expert i scared up so rare i had to go through six ornithologists before i got the id its habitat is the highlands of southeast asia no zoo or rare bird breeder in this country has one how is your end progressing croaker gave him an edited account of the inroads he was making with margarite this is great news far more than i expected keep at it she says this guy robert is oriental the white magpies from southeast asia it fits he paused for a moment the hollow sound of the secure line ticking like a bomb ishmael if the decamillo womans right and the murderer has some kind of affinity for her shes our best friend right now hold on tight and dont take shit from her husband if tony d gives you trouble ill give you whatever backup you need hes no dominic goldoni we know how to take care of gavones like him im going to need an rdv as soon as im finished with her thatll be tomorrow where do you suggest there was a brief silence while lillehammer considered the options book seats on a commercial airline and ill meet the two of you myself at washington airport advise me of the particulars okay croaker said it was and broke the connection he got back in the car cruised the rest of the way into tacky montauk village they ate outside of town at gosmans once a mediumsized restaurant overlooking the wharves where the fishing boats came in now a sprawling institution of eateries shops and walkways a community unto itself they were seated at a table near one of the oversized plateglass windows overlooking the harbor at this time of the year the vast restaurant was nearly empty but the seagulls grown bold and enormous from being fed by gosmans customers swooped and called raucously across the dark water as if it were the height of summer they sat drinking in companionable silence for some time despite his eagerness to get closer to rinding dominic goldonis murderer croaker held himself in check it wasnt easy here sitting opposite him was the single link anyone had to the man who had murdered goldoni he had an intuition bred of the jungle of new yorks streets that if she could not or would not help him the man would never be found despite his and lillehammers best efforts he knew she wanted to tell him everything she had been sitting on since she and francie had been abducted but these were terrible tragic events who knew whether she had the fortitude or the depth of trust in him required to dredge them up again into the light of day he was not at all sure if their positions were reversed whether he would be able to do it margarite drained her drink sat staring into the empty glass after he let us go she said in a slow almost emotionless tone after it was all over his what he did to dom when i brought francie back her pale eyes swung up to meet his i knew then that it wasnt over she swallowed and he could see that she was mentally sinking her toes into the ground as one physically does at the shoreline to keep from being pulled out on the tide you see something happened between him and me that i dont think he anticipated he came here to use me to get to dom and in that he succeeded but there was something else on the road one night a kind of i dont know how to put it a transference he allowed me the opportunity to kill him and i took it it was false hed switched razors and the one i used had no sharp edge but that didnt matter he told me and he was right i tried to kill him i would have and that was important for me to know that act unlocked something inside me some inner resolve i never knew i had she licked her lips and croaker called for another round of drinks when it came he said you said something about a transference she nodded yes you see it was as if he gave me this strength and in return took something from me what was it she took a sip of her drink i dont know at least i didnt now im beginning to suspect what it might be and it has me terrified she drank again almost compulsively and croaker resolved to order them food as soon as he could catch the waitresss eye margarites head was in her hands ive got to talk to someone about this to keep it bottled up any more is intolerable but who would understand not my husband or my daughter and i cant talk about any of this to my friends her head came up and her eyes searched his face for what he wondered understanding absolution that leaves you lew because i dont know what you are to me or what you will become youre as unknown as what my life has become margarite what is it youre afraid hes taken from you my ability to hate him he saw that she was terrified he would laugh in her face as almost surely her husband would have done had she confessed this to him after what he had seen of dominic goldonis body this particular fear did not seem at all funny to him on the contrary it seemed chilling its as if were bound together at the soul i cant get him out of my mind i dont mean his face or but in the dead of night i can smell him feel him close to me as if hes actually beside me croaker caught her eyes with his margarite i want you to understand something before we go any further he said this man who abducted you and francie who murdered your brother is so extremely dangerous that i think quite literally youre the only one who can help me track him down without you im nowhere ive got to know i can count on you in this if youre this conflicted about i want to help you she said a bit too quickly i need to to prove to myself that he hasnt she shook her head unable to go on croaker snagged a waitress ordered them steamers first then lobsters the local clams came almost immediately redolent of brine and seaweed in bowls so large they were daunting margarite eating the sweet flesh slowly and deliberately gained color in her face and seemed to recover a modicum of her composure what i keep thinking about is how ive changed since he let me go she was finished with the steamers and she pushed the bowl away from her licked her ringers one by one fastidious as a cat my marriage was to be frank a dismal failure tony and i dont communicate with the advantage of hindsight i dont believe we ever did as far as women are concerned tony does his communicating with his cock and his fists he communicates with other men by negotiating thats life to him when i spoke up he beat me i suppose sicilian that he is hes been pissed off at me ever since francie was bom what no son she tried to smile but it came out a lopsided grimace the waitress came to clear the plates she handed them foil packets of handiwipes margarite said she wanted a beer arid croaker ordered a pair and the waitress bustled away the thing is croaker said gently you took it the beatings i mean margarite leveled her gaze at him youre not a woman i dont expect you to understand im doing my best he said im listening she digested that for some time staring out at the darkness coming down over the water a fishing boat running lights ablaze navigated the channel outside moving from left to right across the plate glass as if it were a television screen give me your hand she said quietly no the other one he put his biomechanical hand in hers she sat looking down at the confluence of skin and manmade elements a mans world is violent she said at last a womans world well a woman wonders why violence is part of the equation at all but passivity youre still thinking like a man she smiled kindly at him passivity doesnt enter into it men make the mistake of thinking that because women cant see the sense in violence they must be passive creatures its just not true she cocked her head in one important way at least men are the passive sex given a choice they will always opt for the status quo they hate change of any kind and they fight against it constantly on the other hand what women want is stability which when you stop to think about it is a very different animal the waitress brought their lobsters along with the beers they were given plasticcoated bibs which tied behind their necks margarite picked up a nutcracker began to go to work on the bright orangered shell having said that ive come to understand that there is something else at work within me robert thats what he called himself proved that to me i was prepared to kill him coming back from that i am here with you i am at last able to say to my husband fuck you and feel its validity i can see how screwed up my life has been staying with him it was the wrong decision to want stability for me and for my daughter shes bulimic for a damned good reason shes not stupid and shes no longer a child she sees what gdes on around her she feels the vibes more acutely than any adult maybe ive damaged her more than anyone else can you see as i do that it was robert who allowed me to understand this important truth croaker was silent for some time the steamers had filled him up or the emotions of what had happened what possibly would begin to happen here and now if he handled things right had suppressed his appetite you have a decision to make margarite i think youve decided to help me find robert do you want to see him again what possibly can be gained from that hes a murderer brutal cunning perhaps demented but in any case dangerous in the extreme you survived one encounter with him who can say what will happen the second time he wont hurt me how can you be sure she used her fingertip to tap the place just over her heart i know in the same way i eat or breathe theres a connection on some level so deep it bypasses conscious thought certainly theres no logic to it nevertheless im sure the thing was he believed her looking into her clear eyes he saw a truth there that was profoundly disturbing he felt the hairs at the back of his neck stir as if this man who called himself robert could suddenly appear behind him he shifted in his chair abruptly uncomfortable thinking of the scene he and lillehammer had come upon in the house in marine on st croix croaker said perhaps you should concentrate on what robert did to dominic do you think i can forget margarite too had had enough of food and croaker signaled the waitress to clear the table margarite waited until she had gone before continuing but theres more to it than just doms death and ive been thinking about this aspect ever since i got back from minnesota she wiped her hands of brine and tiny flecks of pinkandwhite lobster flesh i told you i wanted to confess everything that wasnt a theatrical gesture i meant it she leaned forward a certain intensity in her face remember francie telling you about her visits to uncle doms how she often went with me spent time in the kitchen sampling the contents of doms icecream freezer she nodded i wonder if youve asked yourself what i was doing there so often you were brother and sister family croaker said now a genuine smile spread across margarites face christ lew thats what dom always told me when i worried we were spending so much time together hed chuckle at my anxiety and say of course bellissima were family who will wonder about the time we share not tony and certainly not the feds she paused for a moment to drink the last of her beer but croaker harbored the suspicion that she was gathering herself he was right you see lew i believe now that my brother knew he was going to die he was preparing for his death two years before it happened he knew she was giving him clues wanting to see if he could put aside logic make the leap of faith necessary to solve the riddle he did not think she was being deliberately obtuse but genuinely needed to find a man who could take her brothers place who might rely on her for what she really was not be swayed by her beauty be fooled by her gender she was so innately intelligent that she good god he was struck momentarily dumb as the thought hit him a bolt so weird so wild so inconsistent with logic that he had a strong suspicion that it must be true it was you he said it was you all along ginnie morris didnt mean anything dominic broke the witsec rules in order to stay in touch with you yes margarite said clearly delighted that he had worked it out i confess it was me dominic picked to be his successor he wanted me to work behind the mask of my husband who dom officially designated his heir apparent that was what my visits with my brother were all about i was learning his business using my own company as a front to meet his contacts and uijider his aegis transferring his influence to me but as a woman in a sacrosanct mans world wasnt that all but impossible croaker asked it was a difficult and timeconsuming project since i had to deal with doms contacts in business politics and law enforcement in an entirely different manner than he had i was always tonys wife because tony was the mask behind which i needed to hide but i was the one who dom confided in i was the one who provided tony with the information he needed to keep doms contacts in line even having worked out the gist of this bizarre arrangement croaker needed some time to digest the details i dont get it he said im a cop and youve just confessed to continuing my brothers legitimate consulting business margarite said with an ironic smile lets not get lost in legalities when theres a more important aspect to deal with which is lets return to logic she said i now believe dom was aware he was a marked man that his murder was inevitable ive come to the same conclusion if we extrapolate from that beginning we see that he began to plan for this future two years ago he picked me a woman to transfer his power to why it was perhaps the most difficult of his options a woman has never had power in his business ever why would he try for it now the answer is because no one in his business would ever suspect a woman even doms sister of having the secrets of his contacts the intelligence dirt if you will he had amassed over the years which he used as leverage her head moved closer to his over the table and her voice already low dropped to a reedy whisper there is a war going on lew a war in the corridors of power locked away from the sight of most people and it isnt just a mafia war goldoni against leonforte although i have begun to suspect that this is an element more important than even can as yet understand isnt this sounding a little melodramatic dont forget i have access to all of doms intelligence she said the rollcall of powerful people he can force to his will would take your breath away so i know the arena in which this is being played out use the source of your brothers information croaker said surely he can help us but i dont know the identity of doms contact i merely receive periodic information at a deadletter drop that is changed each time its a oneway conduit i have no way of contacting him she shook her head what i am sure of is that this is a war of a far far wider scope than just the mafia it involves the heads of the largest corporations federal law enforcement agencies governors and congressmen even perhaps the white house and right now robert is our only way in to its center the thunderclap of his hands coming together the chainmail nodes of the nekode ringing musically as they struck the daggers blade was the only sound in the shadowshrouded room celeste shrieked the point of the dagger held fast three centimeters from his heart as he clamped his palms on either side of it he slapped it down as he would an insect looked past celeste into the gloom he recognized the face he had glimpsed in venice deeply planed oriental features a mole at the corner of the firm lips then like the moon disappearing behind clouds it winked out nicholas gaining strength every second from the rhythm of akshara rushed toward the precipice of physical combat he kept his tanjian eye firmly closed understanding that this enemy had the power to use akshara against him he must trust in his earliest martial arts training trust his own hands his tegatana his mind was open as he spotted the messulethe in the shadows and lunging out grabbed his right wrist with his right hand his open mind had chosen sokumen iriminage because he needed to end this quickly the messulethes psychic attack had shaken him to the core had brought him to the very brink of death and he was unsure how long his reserves of strength would carry him he turned the messulethes wrist inside out and went for suwariwaza stiffening his fingers tilting his left hand upward slamming the heavily callused heel of it into the messulethes jaw when he heard the sharp crack as the head snapped back he swung his left arm back and down using the messulethes own momentum to sweep him off his feet the messulethes body cartwheeled as nicholas whipped him over and he caught a flash of the inside of the figures wrist the messulethe hit the floor chin first and his head snapped back shit nicholas said bending over the crumpled form what is it celeste had come up behind him nicholas showed her the inside of the mans left wrist weve got the wrong man you see theres no blue crescent tattoo he isnt the messulethe she looked up you mean someone else is here is nicholas said letting go the mans wrist or was he went back to the computer monitor he had been studying but the screen was blank he reached for the floppy drive slot but it was empty damn hes taken all the avalon files i found he showed her the cutout in the floor where the box of floppies had been hidden whats this she pulled out a piece of paper showed it to him what do you want to know where okami is or why his death is necessary which question is more important to you who okami controls or who he is now is the time for decision come alone to the parish church of the hill of the martyrs two pm tomorrow not surprisingly it was unsigned nicholas stared at the words reciting them again as if they were a prayer the scent of the snare reached him even from this distance but he had to ask himself if it mattered what was important was that whoever wrote this knew which questions to ask and if there was even a ghost of a chance that he knew the answers to those questions nicholas knew he had to be at the hill of the martyrs at the appointed time mikio okami is missing the little man said missing and presumed dead this was tomoo kozo the oyabun of the yamauchi clan he was in his sixties but looked a good deal younger he kept himself fit with a rigorous daily regimen of openhand and smallblade martial arts he had a long pinched face as if at birth some sadistic doctor had put his head in a vise the top of his head was shaved shiny with oil save for one spot at the back where his silver hair had been left to sprout out in a ponytail he wore a pair of suit trousers held up with suspenders but his shirt was open at the collar and his sleeves were rolled up enough to reveal the edges of wings and clawed feet colorful irizumi the unique tattoos of the yakuza his small black eyes not unlike those of a rat peered suspiciously at everyone and everything as if at any moment he expected to discover a new conspiracy nangi watched fascinated as he moved restlessly around the room this was as singular as its owner no doubt reflecting kozos personality the wood floor was as highly polished as that of a martial arts do jo the walls were gray ferroconcrete interspersed with steel girders halfemerged from the walls like sentinels or bodybuilders an oval shape was cut out of the center of the floor it was lined with glass filled with water waterlilies aquatic grasses and the most astounding array of rare koi the gold black copper and whitespotted fish swam serenely lit from above by a kind of crystalshaped skylight oval itself so that a muscular shaft of sunlight struck downward onto the pool there were no other windows in the room so that the corners were left in shadow dont feel an overabundance of distress at his passing kozo said as he circled the pool like a cat waiting for his moment to pounce i felt he had gained too much power i had always held that the kaisho was just another way to usurp power we oyabun have always ironed out our differences at council he peered into the depths of the pool at his prized collection he placed one finger in the water perhaps testing the temperature yes there was the occasional disagreement but war and bloodshed history has shown invokes a positive influence on mankind survival of the fittest that should be the yakuza motto neh he giggled like a child he wiped his hands they were preternaturally large nangi had the odd fleeting thought that they had come from some american lumberjack and had been grafted onto kozos wrists kozo stopped abruptly looked up at nangi as if remembering he was there the advent of the kaisho changed all that the power that had been the councils flowed to one man mikio okami that kind of concentration of power too often brings with it its own peril he put his hands behind his back nodded the management of power theres the riddle that has baffled mankind throughout the ages neh nangi stood his feet apart slightly braced his hands wrapped around the dragons head of his cane he had been offered neither a seat nor tea this was tomoo kozos way interview by intimidation kozo shrugged now perhaps okamisan received a message who knows he took his hands from behind his back rubbed them together in any event i have a message for you nangisan is it from you from me kozo appeared startled nangisan i am merely the humble messenger then you have used curious means to bring us together nangi was watching the men who had brought him here stationed in the shadows at the corners of the room he did not yet know how hostile kozo might become but the fact that okami was missing perhaps dead was a very bad sign you could have phoned me phoned you the small man giggled again a high disconcerting sound but oh no that would not have done we dont publicize our relationships do we and then of course there is my principal for whom the tightest security is of the utmost importance and who might that be nangi said do you not recognize us said a voice nangi became aware of a figure moving out of the shadows toward the ellipse of filtered light generated through the skylight in a moment a slight man with the ramrodstraight bearing of a military officer pierced the curtain of light which falling upon him from above gave him a rather frightening mien ushibasan nangi said in a hushed voice naohiro ushiba bowed slightly a man in his midforties fit and hard with a face that could only be called beautiful in other cultures he might be described as effeminate and therefore be an object of derision in japan the opposite was true there was in fact a history of japanese heroes known as bishonen young adonises who were invariably taken under the wing of an older protector as like a bishonen as he was in many ways naohiro ushiba needed no older protector though it was true that in japanese society power resided in the aggregate rather than the individual perhaps ushiba was the exception that proved the rule he was daijin chief minister of miti the ministry of international trade and industry the controlling and coordinating body for all of japans export policies for which nangi himself had worked many years ago before retiring from the bureaucracy into the business sector against kozos unconventionality ushibas almost painfully austere formality was striking indeed he was dressed in a black silk and wool suit polished black wingtips against this background his snowwhite shirt positively glowed and his tie a stylized blackandwhite spiral with a dot of red near the bottom set off everything around it his saltandpepper hair was cut dose to his temples almost straight across the top and then there was his beautiful face graceful as a girls with no sharp edge or heavy plane to mar the almost fragile whole the full lips the curving cheek the sculpted nose the heartshaped jawline the longlashed wideapart eyes al contributed to the curious sense of beauty that transcended gender there are those in miti who still speak of your many accomplishments nangisan ushiba said carefully though those occurred many years ago it was just like ushiba nangi thought to couch a rebuke inside a compliment watch out old man he was saying i know you were clever but that was a long time ago i am grateful that something i did has stood the test of time only nangi himself knew his smile was artificial we often think of contacting you ushiba said from across the expanse of the glittering koi pond for a quiet lunch somewhere out of the way he shrugged but our schedule is so impossible well he smiled in the japanese manner without showing his teeth perhaps you have forgotten what life inside was like the insult was like a blow across nangis face he kept his composure however for he knew to have this man as an enemy could be an insurmountable obstacle to his business once inside nangi said his voice neutral one never forgets his smile matched ushibas there will come a day i have no doubt when the daijin will understand better than he does now i was in your position once and i can tell you from experience that there is ignorance inside as well as out ushibas smile widened an inch and his beautiful head dipped just slightly in recognition of nangis cleverly barbed reply perhaps he is not my enemy after all nangi thought but then he saw kozo staring fixedly down into the depths of his koi pond and he was not heartened we can but agree ushiba said his smile stitched to his face if only because we must deal with such ignorance every day like a star in a film production the daijin had chosen his key light well flushed with the sunlight streaming down through the lens of the skylight he stood out in the dim atmosphere of this strange disturbing room we have much to discuss ushiba continued his lips pursed about the hive computer which is so important to us and the reasons for its being stalled about charges of the most serious nature being leveled against your company and especially linnearsan it was as if he were deliberately thrusting himself into nangis full attention and nangi was instantly suspicious he continued to listen to ushiba while keeping kozo well within the range of his peripheral vision because he believed now that the oyabuns reactions could tell him far more about what was happening here than the chief ministers words we find all of this utterly distasteful ushiba said with all the pain of a teenage girl who has been jilted by her lover disgraceful actually we had counted on linnear to obtain for sato the contract for the american hive computer and then absorb hyrotechinc a coup for japan in the area of international public relations as well as technological advance now however we must begin to formulate other plans without the inclusion of sato but linnearsan has done all that and more nangi said then why has the united states government blocked satos attempt to buy hyrotechinc why has your american representative harley gaunt been subpoenaed by the most powerful and feared congressional committee to answer charges of illegal business practices and treason why is linnear himself currently in hiding so that he will not himself be served with a subpoena ushiba moved his beautiful head from side to side these are questions of the most serious nature nangisan they cannot be made to disappear with a few clever sentences linnearsan is not in hiding nangi said knowing his words seemed as transparent as paper no ushiba skewed his head around and sunlight flooded across his face his journey out of the country is entirely unrelated to the american subpoenanangi knew that no one would believe this now ah i am heartened to learn this fact nangisan tell me where is he do you know can you present him to me today tonight tomorrow even the day after that he grunted how could you elements of the american government have been looking for him ever since your office responded to their subpoena a look of satisfaction made his face effervescent a girl with her new boyfriend crossing paths with her old beau ah yes they have been keeping us fully informed of their enquiries why not i am certain their congressional committee will want our cooperation in their investigation of satotomkin and i am fully prepared to give it to them the light put a crease in ushibas features making it seem more than ever a twodimensional paradigm an illustration in some glossy fashion magazine you see nangisan we are in the midst of an exceedingly delicate game of perception with the united states and it is one we are determined to win if to do so we are obliged to sacrifice a pawn here or there or even a rook or a bishop we will do just that at this moment satotomkin and nicholas linnear are what the americans want to tear down we will say let them and why not sato has disappointed us it has turned a potential coup into a fullfledged disaster youre ignoring what is really happening behind the scenes nangi said rather more desperately than he wanted linnearsan believes that the us government none of that concerns me the daijin said flatly this is strictly a matter of perception we must avoid at all costs any negative repercussions with the americans the chief minister struck a pose as if news cameras were trained on his face beside him kozo had found a fascinating koi to hold his attention fast public relations nangisan is a game we have come into late in the day but it is a game we mean to master in the quickest possible order whatever has to be done to make this possible will be done believe me in fact it is being done even as we speak the american senator ranee bane is receiving all the dossiers he has requested from us and we are transferring them in the most public manner ushiba raised a hand photo ops are primary to our strategy the more open and helpful we are with the senator the more wind we take out of his antijapanese sail while showing the entire world how we have changed nangi was appalled his blood ran cold at the thought of what the daijin all of japan was in the process of doing to him and to nicholas so youre throwing my company my entire life to the dogs it was a pathetic statement so impotent it filled nangi with disgust and selfloathing ushiba must have caught a whiff of that how bitter you sound nangisan but of course we will take care of you you are an exminister of miti after all you have been one of us linnear however is another story the daijin was an exemplar of icy calm the eye of the cyclone that swung out from him extending its wicked arms to smash nangi nicholas and all they held dear into shards and with a sinking heart nangi knew there wasnt a damned thing he could do about it still he knew he must try what has lmnearsan done to deserve this grossly unjust fate he has fought many times taken on great personal risk against the enemies of japan both in the united states and in russia we are aware ushiba said and there are those inside who have fought to try to save him in memory of his father and what he has done but in the end the present must overweigh the past this is our judgement nangi was filled with a sudden dread he had a presentiment that they had now come to the core the real reason ushiba had sent for him in such humiliating fashion the present what do you mean we are speaking now of the chi project the secret program the brainchild of linnearsan it is up and running nangisan without your knowledge its products have been built and assembled in satos own saigon facilities and your own man vincent tinh has quite quietly been selling them to the highest bidder for several months now nangi felt his heart lurch the daijin knew of the chi prototype i know nothing of this he said unfortunately theres more the daijin said coldly the chi technology has turned up in a new generation of computercontrolled guided missiles bound for iraq syria and afghanistan thanks to the chi technology these new weapons of war your company is selling are able to think to outmaneuver the cleverest evasive action by even the fastest target nangi opened his mouth to say something but not one word emerged this was news of the very worst kind ushibas line of reasoning was inexorable the chi project is directed by linnear that fact has been highly publicized now you can see how sacrificing linnear to bane and his committee will be of extraordinary psychological and publicrelations use to us he is when we stop to think about it the perfect scapegoat and we shall ride him all the way down until he disappears from sight digested by senator bane and his very nasty committee holding thecaliber handgun harley gaunt recalled the times his father would take him hunting crisp autumn weekends the smell of woodsmoke and burning leaves in his nostrils the rustling peacefulness of the forest in the virginia hills the golds bitter oranges ochers in the trees and underfoot a sweet odor emanating from the springy forest floor which his father once told him was decay manny mannheim a fat balding man with a twoday growth peppering his jowls and trousers so low the top of his butt stuck out said you okay with this harl ive never seen you with a gun before hate to think youd pull the trigger and blow your toe off or some part slightly more vital gaunt smiled as he looked around mannys pawnshop the place hadnt changed much from the time he had first followed his mother in here by then drink had changed her so much that she was selling things precious to her the diamond and platinum tiffany necklace gaunts father had given her on their tenth wedding anniversary the heirloom sapphire brooch left to her by her mother even once her gold wedding ring when gaunts mother had begun to drink heavily she had lost her job and humili ated she had turned to pawning her possessions rather than allow her family to know what had happened gaunt had met manny so many years ago a youngish gawky young man helping his dad out in the pawnbroker business and the two had become if not quite friends then something more than acquaintances they took pleasure in helping one another out in times of need manny had seen to it that none of the items gaunts mother had pawned were sold years later he had come to gaunt because thugs were threatening his father gaunt had spoken to a couple of his friends in the fbi and mannys father was never bothered again manny blinked myopically in the pawnshops mean light guns in excellent working order i cleaned it myself he laughed pushing his glasses back up a nose that had been broken many times the skills you acquire in my trade dont worry gaunt said as he carefully loaded the i know how to use this mannys nose twitched now dont for christs sake get into any trouble okay promise me i promise gaunt said stowing the away inside his jacket chances are ill never even fire it its just for effect really manny sniffed coming round from behind his glass counter swinging open the metal cage door and walking gaunt to the front door a flyblown oblong of cracked glass embedded with wire mesh now youre back for a little while lets have dinner sure manny gaunt said slipping out the door into the washington twilight id like that he had spent the night in a motel in bethesda going over the photos renata had given him deciding how best to present this evidence to william justice lillehammer he had spent the day considering all the prudent alternatives to what in the end he knew it must come to discarding them one by one late in the day he had gone out to make his preparations his last stop had been mannys pawnshop they call themselves lookingglass renata had told him on their nighttime walk around the vietnam memorial who they are or under what aegis they operate i cant say i doubt if even the president could tell you they have a great deal of influence very deep pockets although i havent a clue as to how theyre funded they were very active during the war in vietnam perhaps for a long time before whats their purpose gaunt had asked to reshape the world in their image renata said to slowly bring their people to power and then to keep them there to replace them when the time comes with others sympathetic to their goals theyre basically conservative protectionist xenophobic utterly righteous they believe in what they re doing even though they inhabit a world that circumvents all existing law someone once said that a mind becomes a detriment when it acquires more intelligence than its integrity can handle i think this can be applied to lookingglass they have worked for so long in their lawless labyrinths of power they can no longer distinguish right from wrong justice from injustice it took gaunt an astonishingly short time to emerge from the shabby section of washington where mannys pawnshop was located to the manicured sweep of dupont circle with its victorian mansions and black iron gates the rain of the night before had washed the streets and sidewalks making the contrast between the shabby slums and the patrician town houses even more shocking it was a curious fact of urban life that such violent and amorphous decay could coexist with upscale neighborhoods patrolled and for the most part peaceful he took new hampshire avenue to m street swinging rightlhere heading across the bridge into georgetown lillehammer lived in a large palladianstyle town house overlooking dumbarton oaks and above the us naval observatory and the vicepresidents house this short section of s street the last street before the generous expanse of parkland had therefore the aspect of a smalltown road the outskirts just before lush countryside reclaimed the landscape there were no cars here no pedestrian traffic either at this time of day with the darkness coming down and the air growing very chill indeed gaunt steered his rental car slowly by lillehammers house saw the lights on an american stationwagon illuminated in the granite driveway he pulled into a parking space near the corner and walked back the house stood back from the street it was built of white stone its colonnaded portecochere and columned facade making its four stories seem far larger and grander than they actually were it was framed by a pair of stately bradford pear trees which shot up above its rooftop drew the eye toward the entry making it more dramatic the semicircular driveway sloped steeply upward the sweet earthy scents of the emerging evening reminded gaunt of those longago hunting expeditions with his father he went up the steps knocked on a carved wooden door painted a glassy black it took a long time before the door opened but when it did he saw a tall thin man with ruddy cheeks dark eyebrows and piercing blue eyes which evaluated him with a mixture of curiosity and studied calm he was wearing deepblue wool slacks and a white buttondowncollar shirt with the sleeves rolled up his forearms yes william lillehammer lillehammer nodded what can i do for you gaunt introduced himself he noted in lillehammers bearing a rigorous military training and adjusted his speech accordingly using precise clipped phrases i hope you have a moment to spare me ive come a long way to talk to you about senator ranee bane and his committees vendetta against tomkin industries and nicholas linnear in particular lillehammers eyebrows lifted just a fraction banes motives aside how is it you think i can be of help with a congressional hearing i have no connection with the legislature oh but you must gaunt said steeling himself by closing his right hand over the butt of the tucked neatly into the waistband of his trousers youre part of lookingglass arent you in the ensuing silence gaunt thought he could hear the wind rustling the tops of the bradford pears the distant hiss of traffic along wisconsin avenue i beg your pardon lillehammer blinked as if gaunt had thrown a bright light into his face i think you understand me gaunt said his grip tightening on the handgun those clear blue eyes were like xrays searching his face as if for a weak spot yes indeed lillehammer said abruptly he smiled stepped back into the entranceway wont you come inside there was no strain evident on his face no sense of tension about the man at all as he led gaunt past the curving colonial staircase of polished maple down a carpeted hall lined with prints of comfortably masculine scenes of fox hunts and other equestrian activities renata had told him that lillehammer lived alone and gaunt could detect no hint of a female presence neither in color nor in style the furniture was on a massive scale made of leather suede metals some covered in heavy cottons of richly colored patterns reminiscent in an impressionistic manner of animal hides the study into which he was taken overlooked the small manicured conifer garden at the back of the house it was a highceilinged room with wide panels of forest green interspersed with decorative wooden mock pillars painted the color of clotted cream the ceiling was a shallow dome festooned with scrollwork in high relief lillehammer went past a pair of grand leather sofas to a mirrored wet bar drink a beer would be fine gaunt said lillehammer bent extracted an amber bottle from a halfrefrigerator below the bar he popped the cap carefully poured the beer down the side of a pilsner glass then he made himself a whiskey and soda in an enormous oldfashioned glass he came back to where gaunt stood handed him his beer then went behind his giltencrusted escritoire sat in a highbacked chair gaunt left to fend for himself glanced at the nearest chair a rather uncomfortablelooking slingback affair of welded bronze and wide interlaced leather straps the color of honey he chose to stand the room carpeted and snug was warmly lit by a series of copperhooded wall lamps in sconces giving the whole a distinctly homey oldfashioned atmosphere lillehammer put his glass down on his bonecolored blotter said in an avuncular tone of voice my dear chap you really must tell me how on earth you came by the name lookingglass gaunt debated with himself whether to pfay against lillehammers chosen defense this rather interesting technique of reversing the process of interrogation or to rudely thrust it aside and go for the jugular it was he knew more a judgement of lillehammers personality than it was of his own nerves gaunt set his own glass aside lets cut the chummy bullshit shall we he said youre part of lookingglass how i know that is irrelevant to the situation but of course its relevant lillehammer said emphatically in the course of my rather checkered career i have made my share of enemies we all do in this town sooner or later he chuckled as if bringing gaunt into his confidence and if its one of my enemies whos been feeding you stories id very much like to know who so i can set the record straight he spread his hands wide you wouldnt begrudge me a chance to refute this accusation would you gaunt saw the flash of metal in lillehammers left hand too late his right hand was bringing the out of his trousers when the first bullet from the smallcaliber pistol struck him in the forehead he felt nothing more than if a woman had slapped his face he blinkedcould not remember why his hand was around the butt of a handgun he stared into bright blue eyes incurious almost stoic a heros pose certainly reminding him of the bronze statue of the noble soldiers overlooking the vietnam memorial he knew he had seen it recently had been there with someone who it had been raining cold rain on his face now the small explosion caught his attention and his head snapped back he slipped to one knee as if the footing had become abruptly treacherous cold rain could there be ice on the ground there was a throbbing behind one eye he felt nothing more a slight headache more lightheaded really but he could no longer see that was curious his father would never have taken him hunting in the dark too dangerous dad was always lecturing him about how dangerous firearms were about how careful you had to be around them at all times even when you were positive they were unloaded especially then he would say because thats when youd get careless where am i gaunt thought in the forest at night wheres dad he tried to call out but no sound emerged from his mouth there was a loud report at close range and he was slammed over the stink of cordite in his nostrils mixing with the lovely earthy sweetness of the forest floor in autumn giving up the last of its loamy richness before the first frost of winter put everything to sleep the deer and quail the cedars and the larch the maples and the bang good god man ive got to have a chance to defend myself against charges lillehammer said as he bent over gaunts prostrate form where beer and blood mingled indiscriminately why thats the american way montmartre the hill of the martyrs its parish church st pierre de montmartre lay just north of the place du tertre once the outdoor theater for pariss most celebrated artists now it was infested by the type of hustler for whom the sight of tour buses was like honey to a bear from the outside st pierre was nothing much to look at certainly insignificant compared to its close neighbor the renowned sacre coeur inside nicholas knew it was another story it had been built upon the ruins of a beautiful seventhcentury roman temple originally a benedictine nunnery fires had caused rebuilding several times over and eventually the benedictines had moved further down the hill allowing the parish to establish operations in the church nicholas saw someone close to the shadows thrown by the church and as the figures head turned in his direction he recognized okamis face he wondered whether there was surveillance here or how much but the imperative to reach okami overrode any sense of caution he began his approach on the oblique using the cover of a cluster of germans arguing over who was going to get his portrait painted first then at the last minute when he was quite close to the facade of st pierre he broke cover racing toward okami he reached him in three long strides grabbed him okamisan okami grimaced twisted his body with unexpected strength he broke free lurched away from nicholas racing into the place du tertre where he was instantly whirled into a current of tourists and busy wouldbe painters indefatigably hawking their dubious wares a cheerful nigerian tried to sell nicholas a tenfoot balloon with i love paris printed in pink all over its sausagelike skin he ran on nicholas looked toward the position he had told celeste to take up the hill toward the butte of montmartre he saw her standing pointing in the direction okami had taken nicholas turned saw okami darting in among the crowd plunged in after him he fought through the throngs of japanese and germans broke past a line of tour buses okami disappeared around the corner onto rue cortot nicholas following after him saw him turn another corner head right onto the wider rue des saules he got there saw it was a street of steps flights and flights of them heading down off this end of the butte there was okami racing downward and nicholas took off after him the steps were divided into flights with broad landing areas on euher side squat whitestone apartment buildings rose following the steep slope of the side of the butte down to the broad rue caulaincourt with its bustling shops thick traffic and metro stop nicholas knew he had to catch okami before he disappeared into that urban forest where no footprint or spoor would remain their shoes clattered against the stone steps resounding off the facades of the buildings and a cloud of pigeons disturbed in their afternoon meal rose into the air swooping in a great black wing nicholas opened his tanjian eye and heard the silent beat begin against the membrane of kokoro setting thought into motion psychic impulse into reality he hurtled down the stairs his eyes on the fleeing figure below him while with his tanjian eye he searched the wider environment for the snare he had felt all along would be there waiting for him as it had many times since he had seen it the image of the messulethe in venice bending down to pick up his hat crossed his mind like a cloud across the sun what was wrong with the image something disturbing some thing out of place as if it were a film rather than reality he hit one of the landings took a leap down the next set of steps he was gaining on okami below them both he could see the wide rue caulaincourt the buses lurching forward the thick lines of traffic the dense swirl of pedestrians the city was down there with a labyrinth of escape routes okami swung like a monkey past a pair of lovers who broke their tender embrace to look at him if he was okami even if okami did possess koryoku he was too old to be moving with such speed and agility at that moment okami stumbled he was halfway down the flight of stairs just below nicholas he went down rolling then tumbled head over heels down the lower half of the flight nicholas putting on a burst of speed sped across the landing then leapt down the next flight he landed beside okamis prostrate form reached down to turn him over saw the edge of something along okamis jawline he explored with his finger felt the stickiness of the spiritgum then digging in saw the skin begin to wrinkle up in a wholly unnatural manner exposing the edge of an unfamiliar jawline and he knew he was looking not at human tissue but at a highly advanced form of acrylic resin made up of a siliconpoly carbonate hybrid of the kind his research and development people had designed for the chi project abruptly the present collided with the image he had been carrying around with him of the messulethe the wrongness as he bent to retrieve his hat and no blood rushed to his cheeks of course not then as now he had been wearing a mask it was the shock of this interior collision of sight and memory that slowed nicholass reaction the inert body abruptly rolled into him and he found himself staring into the mask of okamis face the lips were partly open a small o framing out the center of the space his tanjian eye opened nicholas knew what was to happen saw the ruse knew it for the snare felt its jaws snapping shut and he began to react phut but he was too late even a moment was too long a time as his muscles responded to the danger the minidart was already on its way at pointblank range it struck him in the neck and he immediately felt his throat begin to dose up he struck out but part of him was already struggling with the disorderly shutdown of his autonomic nervous system and there was little strength behind it the figure rolled again cutting nicholass feet out from under him and he began to collapse forward he tried to break his fall but somehow his limbs had ceased to respond to his brains command for the space of a heartbeat control of his mind was all that was left him as the toxin spread through his system then that too was snatched from his grasp he felt the sun like a weight upon his back its light streamed past in a dizzying array of rainbow colors then winked out as all consciousness died six monkeys tokyo spring omerta the law of silence mikio okami said if you do not understand this about the sicilians you understand nothing colonel denis linnear closed his eyes felt a bead of sweat crawl slowly down his cheek it fell with a soft plop into the steaming water in which he and okami were immersed its odd to hear a japanese speaking of ancient sicilian law okami took the time to inhale the scented steam beating up off the water he knew very well that the colonel meant a yakuza oydbun had only used the term japanese because he was not an iteki a barbarian as okami had assumed when his sister had insisted they meet she was crazy about this man foolhardy okami thought because he is western even more foolhardy because he is married most foolhardy because he is happily so my study of these particular sicilian families began some time ago okami felt his own sweat brought to the surface with the deep rhythm of the heat the logic of it is simple these people found a way to cross international borders at will we will have to do no less if we wish to survive in the new world japan and america together will construct the yakuza has always been a strictly national organization like the country within which we exist we have been unaware of the world at large omerta and kyokyaku the colonel said as if he were alone some believed the kyokyaku local heroes such as firemen who were appointed by the tokugawa shogunate to help keep order in the seventeenth century were the origins of the yakuzas mythic credo of honor among thieves nobility alive like the spark of life within the underworld as society as a whole grew more corrupt so too did the kyokyaku until they themselves were absorbed into the shadowland of gambling and prostitution no wonder the colonel thought the mafia has caught okamis fancy i speak of omerta because it is a necessity okami said because i perceive a threat to my world and it is up to me to do something about it the colonel was a tall man handsome and commanding with piercing blue eyes he stirred slightly in the hot water soft echoes from the other baths in the furo were an almost rhythmic counterpoint to their conversation there are others older than you who could take up this burden again okami was impressed by the colonel he had used the japanese word for older when what he meant was more powerful his sister was right he knew the ways of japan almost as well as a japanese in any other society that might be true okami acknowledged but the yakuza is a dosed book the elders are arthritic in their thinking they see the past as future whereas i see the future as present he lifted a hand briefly to scratch himself i believe you and i are similar in this regard linnearsan the colonel opened his eyes inclined his head slightly toward okami you are kind to say so okamisan okami smiled to himself kind when he meant wise but we are similar in another regard he said we are both men of honor in my experience this is rare among westerners it is a potential to be treasured word and deed okamisan just so so he knows okami thought with a quickening of his pulse in japan words meant next to nothing it was deeds that mattered nothing else i understand how you must have felt having kisoko insist that we meet the colonel paused for effect especially given my status in occupation hq you have douglas macarthurs ear especially given how your sister feels about me okami did his best not to laugh outright how he loved the way this man orchestrated conversations he wondered at how much pleasure he derived by being in the colonels company two months ago that thought would have profoundly disturbed him he was grateful for his ability to tolerate change in himself as well as in others you had every reason to hate me on sight the colonel said and perhaps you did lord knows i couldnt blame you okami said nothing like a chess master he was thinking of what moves the colonel was bent on making but now we have reached a certain understanding we know what it is we need from one another and because of this we have learned to respect one another give and take okamisan that is the dynamic of any successful ongoing relationship the yakuza and the united states military okami said you do not find a certain ironic dimension to this alliance a small smile played around the colonels tanned face listen okamisan i believe the human race has an infinite capacity to rationalize dreadful events unspeakable acts unholy alliances what one must sort out for oneself is the ultimate line across which one must never ever venture okami stared into those blazing blue eyes as for myself he said i am bound by a code of honor no less stringent than bushido the code of the samurai anything that does not contravene that code is permissible the colonel laughed you sound just like a sicilian at last okami permitted himself a smile so we return to the subject of john leonard also known as johnny leonforte and apparently your beloved omerta the colonel steepled his fingers this man leonforte is making a market in every sort of contraband imaginable not only us army materiel but russian weaponry prescription drugs and illicit drugs the real problem is that no one weve picked up with the stuff will talk okami nodded even yakuza kobun he has been using foot soldiers disenchanted with our alliance with the occupiers to house and distribute his contraband mysteriously they wont implicate him either but i have picked up a name leon waxman but thats all he is a name i have been unable to find anything else about him its as if hes being protected by leonforte okami shrugged and the colonel sighed closed his eyes again someone he said has to have a talk with johnny leonforte truth to tell the aspect of the situation that disturbed okami the most was the fact that street yakuza were betraying their oath bonding themselves to an iteki what strange power did johnny leonforte possess that he could command the loyalty of elements of the japanese criminal underworld this was the central question that okami kept worrying on his way to see the military police captain of course the colonel was too well known to do more than pay leonforte an official visit and both of them agreed that this would be more apt to cause problems than solve them besides the best thing about the alliance between okami and the colonel was that no one would believe it could exist confronting leonforte with another criminal type could elicit information from him hed rather die than divulge to someone in the colonels position captain jonathan leonard spent much of his off time in the small crowded apartment of a woman he was sleeping with an army nurse named faith sawhill with a narrow waist and clever eyes she had the legs of a model and knew how to show them off she had never seen line duty but instead belonged to a general with a chronic ulcer who coveted her with the avidity of a religious zealot knowing the sicilians as he did okami doubted that leonforte had included his inamorata in his business dealings but on the other hand he worked his magic out of her place so there must somewhere be an overlapping of business and pleasure all of this went through okamis mind as he stood in the open doorway to faith sawhills cluttered apartment sawhill was just kissing leonforte goodbye as she went to serve her general as she brushed past him okami smelled sandalwood she flashed him a wide whitetoothed smile and then was gone her heels clickclacking down the stairwell mikio okami hat okami bowed slightly saw in his peripheral vision that leonforte did not return the bow well he was used to such treatment by the conqueror all the personal rancor had been burned out of him in the aftermath of the war which he had hated and had fought against while such sentiment meant anything in the end he had joined in it simply because he was a patriot he loved his country even when it acted on decisions that were nearsighted and bellicose but he was no war criminal and was now doubly glad that kisoko had introduced him to the colonel because he had some debts outstanding and denis linnear was his path to settling them come in leonforte said this is vincent alba he waved an arm in the direction of a ruggedlooking individual with the dark closeset eyes of a predator shortcropped hair and large hairy hands while leonforte had on his mp uniform alba was dressed as a civilian in a wellfitting and expensive suit of silk and lightweight wool make yourself at home put up your feet whatever leonforte said he was a tall lean man handsome in that dark mediterranean way with thick black hair cut short in the military style okami could imagine it long curling over his forehead and the back of his neck like a roman senators while okami perched himself on the edge of a curved loveseat he went to a small dropleafed table set against a wall how about an anisette maybe a sambucca i got fresh coffee beans to float in it he turned round to okami you know about the italian custom with sambucca no then you gotta try it okami accepted the clear liquid with two dark beans floating on top he noticed that alba had not moved he neither asked for nor received a drink in fact leonforte treated him as if he did not exist heres looking at you leonforte said clinking his glass against okamis he took half his sambucca in one shot what dyou think good huh better than sake am i right okami did not like his first taste of the liquor but he persisted willing his palate to adjust he also willed himself to smile its excellent he said may i have some more while leonforte was refilling his glass he took a look around every available horizontal space was covered with stacks of books mostly medical texts but also he saw in other piles tomes on international law and economics as well as the dynamics of philosophy from nietzsche to kant to socrates he wondered if faith sawhill did all the reading in this dyad leonforte handed him his glass sat in an oversized chair crossing one leg over the other what can i do for you i admit i wasnt surprised when i got your call you guys are always asking for favors he winked ive looked the other way plenty of times while your goon squads fleeced the public at large long as i get my cut what do i care what you do he put his drink down on an old chest which served as a coffee table whats it this time gambling whore house or maybe you want to be enfolded within my benevolent protection so you can make a run at a rival family these days that kind of shit happens more often than i can count he laughed to tell the truth i like that best you guys with your territories killing each other off more room for me i understand your pleasure okami said its just like back home isnt that right mr leonforte leonforte hardly missed a beat if okami hadnt been watching for it he would never have seen the left eye twitch why did you call me that did you think i would come here without doing my homework theres homework and then theres homework for the first time he glanced at vincent alba who stood rather like a forbidding grandfather clock near a print of a roman battle scene i figure people who take the time to do some digging on me i got to watch out for they could be dangerous he picked up his glass again and okami was aware without having to look at him directly that alba had subtly changed his stance i respond quickly and instinctively to danger know what i mean okami i dont fuck around that way i dont have to worry about digging a bullet out of my gut youve made yourself all too clear okami said he deliberately finished off his sambucca this really is quite good glad you appreciate things italian leonforte said shortly now tell me what the fuck you want all right okami put down his glass i propose we do a deal i have a good idea of the commodities youre trading in he held up his hand please dont bother to deny it i have in my men a distribution network par excellence my people know every back alley in tokyo i know where your commodities will fetch the highest prices and where it wont be worth your time going in short we could make an excellent team leonforte produced a hard laugh you hear that vinnie he wants i should give a piece of the action to a snotnosed gook he jumped up with such force that the glasses on the trunk shook who the fuck do you think you are slanteyes to come in here drink my sambucca and then demand a piece of my action if i were back home id horsewhip you but since im in a foreign country i gotta show some restraint aint that so vinnie oh yeah he pointed to the door so get the hell out of here and count yourself a lucky buck the other man vincent alba is his bodyguard okami said no doubt about it the two of them sound like quite a pair the colonel said he dipped his pipe into a leather pouch stuffed it with tobacco his fingers curled lovingly around the roughsided bowl the pipe was a kind of talisman it had even saved his life and the lives of his unit in singapore in early because he was looking for it he had held his men from advancing into an open area where a moment later an enemy bombardment began with those epithets hes using i have no doubt hes in need of one the two men sat in the cramped back room of a latenight bar off the ginza it was a perfectly legitimate place and therefore safe for them to meet they did so however only at night and entered and exited the place through the service entrance off a grimy deserted alley the owner himself served them the colonel had saved his establishment after a notorious blackmarketeer was caught here and the mps threatened to close it down the colonel always the futurist saw in this place just what it had become a safe house for him where he could operate securely i need to do something about the inroads hes making by recruiting from the yakuza ranks okami said the fact that he almost threw me bodily out of the apartment when i offered him a deal makes me suspicious indeed the colonel said hes certainly not stupid i would say on the face of it hes already got a deal okami contemplated the colonel for a long time the sounds of glasses clinking low voices and once a bright spray of drunken laughter drifted in to them the owner entered and without a word replaced their empty beer mugs with full ones at last okami said if that is the case we both have a serious problem on our hands for you it means that leonforte is just about untouchable for me it means that my world has suddenly gone out of control leonforte has a deal with another oyabun and i should have known about it by now that i dont means there is a yakuza boss making secret deals with foreigners like you the colonels response was not a rebuke merely a reminder that ones power was never absolute even though as it grew it conveyed the illusion that it was the colonel turned his head slightly the ghost of a smile appearing and disappearing in the lamplight something has happened okamisan weve touched a nerve somewhere what do you mean i was called into willoughbys office today the colonel said major general charles willoughby was along with the colonel himself one of macarthurs most influential aides he was also head of g the intelligence section of the occupation and a constant thorn in the colonels side i got what amounted to a dressing down okami kept a keen eye on the colonel he seemed relaxed almost contemplative okami took that as an excellent sign apparently willoughbys people have got wind of the ad hoc investigation ive been doing thank god hes still got no idea of your involvement ive been exceedingly careful okami said for the past three months he and the colonel had been looking into why certain key officers in the former imperial army and navy of japan had not appeared on the rolls of the warcrimes tribunals okami himself had identified these officers to the colonel as people whose excessive zeal and power had led them to commit acts of calculated brutality that now required the most extreme punishment the colonel had submitted the names of these officers to the adjutant generals office along with documentation okami had amassed on them but to date he had received no satisfactory answer to his numerous queries clearly someone was stonewalling willoughby wondered aloud why with all i had on my plate i was taking time to go off on what he characterized as a wild goose chase do you know what that is a useless search if youre bored with your job he told me ill be more than happy to write you a letter of recommendation for any other that would fit your requirements the colonels blue eyes were frosty i marked how careful he was being at no time did he mention the subject of my investigation or any interest he himself may have had in it the colonel tapped the cold dottle out of his pipe began to fill it up again i began to wonder how id managed to step on willoughbys toes while looking for your war criminals he struck a match of course it would take someone of extraordinary muscle to pul the jackets on these officers and hustle them away from the adjutant generals office he stuck the pipe in his mouth began to draw the aromatic tobacco through it when he had it going to his satisfaction he said after the meeting i had copies of the documentary evidence you had provided sent to him by messenger i ordered the messenger to make certain that willoughby himself signed for the sealed package i now have his signature willoughby will do nothing with the information okami said then i will have my answer the colonel replied ill know hes taken these men into custody for some security reason of his own there neednt be anything sinister to it perhaps they are privy to sensitive intelligence macarthur doesnt want transcripted during an open tribunal justice must be done okamis expression was set in stone i will have my vengeance linnearsan that was an essential part of our alliance i understand completely but later that night on his way across wartorn tokyo okami had his doubts it could be that the colonel and willoughby were cut from the same cloth they were both western after all and who could trust westerners okami shook his head that was a dangerous path he knew part of him was still thinking as the other oyabun did sometimes as now okami felt positively schizophrenic he knew in his heart what had to be done this was a new world the war in the pacific had seen to that if the war had taught him anything it was that japan could no longer depend solely on itself in the coming decades it had come down on the wrong foot in the war had destroyed itself and ravaged its people because of its history of isolationism it was our lack of understanding of westerners especially the americans that defeated us he thought we underestimated their strength discounted their resilience and misunderstood their resolve we cannot afford to do that again his own resolve to see his businesses flourish in the decades to come was what had prompted him to form his alliance with the colonel and the fact was he liked the man and this attraction was strange to him for he like a vast majority of his fellow japanese in those days felt a profound disconnection from the other societies of the world outside asia strange to him the japanese to find in the colonel an understanding of shintoism zen confucianism and the legion of martial metaphysics which together made up the ethos of japan extraordinary he thought now as he stared out into the sodium glare of nighttime tokyo no he decided he trusted the colonel implicitly but he was disturbed that the colonel was willing to give willoughby the benefit of the doubt but to be fair in his position it was easier for okami to smell a conspiracy than it was for the colonel okami had already learned from bitter experience that one was the last to become aware of disorder in ones own house okami had come of age during that time seven years ago when his father had been betrayed by his own brother who had sold out to another family which coveted the lucrative okami territory in the heart of tokyos business districts okamis father had been slain by members of this rival family as he lay alone in his bed okamis mother having left that day to visit her ailing mother outside hiroshima acting on detailed information provided by okamis uncle these men had slipped into the house bypassing guards to plunge their swords into okamis fathers abdomen at the funeral okami had stood between his mother and his uncle knowing nothing but sorrow two weeks later while drinking in a latenight bar with his girlfriend he had overheard a drunken conversation among a large group of young yakuza kobun two happened to be the ones who had slain his father and they were recounting to the delight of their compatriots how they were able to slip into and out of the house unseen the next morning okami took his fathers katana secreted it beneath a long raincoat he wore he went to his uncles place of business and asked to see him after fifteen minutes or so he was ushered in his uncle imagining himself by his perfidy amassing money and prestige by the minute smiled broadly as he introduced his nephew to those yakuza toughs around him his uncle always flamboyant enjoyed having an entourage his mind was mired in his countrys feudal past when elite warriors ruled the land and commanded lesser mortals as was the custom okami bowed to these men who stood while okamis uncle sat behind his massive wood desk extending his right hand palm up when he straightened up his uncle asked him why he had come okami promptly took a step forward as he did so his unbuttoned raincoat parted and as he leapt upon his uncles desk he drew his fathers sword before any of the startled bodyguards could react he raised the katana above his head and with all his might slashed it obliquely downward neatly severing his uncles head from his neck a fountain of blood exploded upward catching two of the bodyguards as they began to react okamis uncles headless body jerked galvanically the head lay upside down on the bloody desk its eyes open wide in disbelief its quizzical expression frozen as if on a wellcrafted mask okami slammed the butt of his katana into the nose of one bodyguard then whirled his blade carving into the shoulder of another a gun fell to the floor as the man howled in pain and collapsing tried vainly to stanch the flow of blood there were two others swords were out there was no question now of using a gun the man who did so would lose so much face by dispatching okami without honor that he would no longer be considered yakuza cast summarily out of this curious tightly knit band of outsiders he would have nowhere to go he would have lost the only world that would accept him okami feinted right went left leaping off the desk he drew his legs up beneath him slashed right as he hurtled past the third bodyguard his swordblade tracked across the mans chest curling open fabric skin and muscle the man dropped his katana from nerveless hands okami felt a quick numbness as he landed and turning back toward the fourth man the searing pain came and he knew he had been wounded he clamped down on the pain blocked a second blow from the man and kicking out into his knee used the break to get inside the mans defenses he smashed the butt of his sword into the mans right ear then lunged forward felt the tip of the blade shde in and out of flesh the fourth bodyguard crumpled headfirst to the floor this is how mikio okami became oyabun of the okami clan before he left the office okami had the presence of mind to take up his uncles head by its damp hair for six weeks afterward it hung by a leather cord in the courtyard of okamis house everyone whom he summoned over that time the underbosses of his family as well as the oyabun of the other tokyo families was obliged to pass it on their way to meet with him the last oyabun okami summoned was seize yamauchi he was a bullshouldered man with a long pouty face and a righteous air about him he was forever decrying the loss of traditional values among the new recruits to the yakuza ranks but he was a usurer par excellence squeezing the old people in his territory who increasingly came to him for help as the specter of war crept over the land and conscripted their sons on whom they had been dependent the two kobun okami had overheard in the bar were from the yamauchi clan as seizo yamauchi made his way across the courtyard he stared long and hard at the shriveled crusted head of okamis uncle he shook his head disapprovingly as if he were regarding the handiwork of some anarchist filthy days he said to okami when the ritual introductions had been made i couldnt agree more okami said reaching over the hibachi to make tea for his guest he could feel the older mans tension like a pressuredrop in a descending elevator and he fought to keep his own anxiety in check he had a long way to go and there could be nasty surprises lying in wait for him neither man said another word until the cut leaves had been placed in the bottom of the cups the hot water poured over them the whisk taken up making the palegreen froth on lop okami watched as yamauchi put the cup to his lips only then did he take his tea yamauchi nodded pleased at the younger mans manners this is why i asked for this meeting okami said in his sweetest voice now that the traitor to the okami clan is taken care of i would seek an alliance with the yamauchi he poured more tea for them both these times are indeed filthy war is coming i can feel it in the same way an old man feels the onset of rain in my bones now more than ever we need to band together drop our various territorial feuds forsake revenge for survival yamauchisan he put down his cup and for another reason if i may speak freely the older man nodded more at ease now i am a young man perhaps as some no doubt have said i am as yet too unseasoned to become oyabun of such a large family as mine but i have been merely reacting to circumstance so perhaps i can be forgiven the abrupt elevation in rank however i am not unaware of my precarious situation and thinking it over i see that it would be to my benefit if i were to have a mentor someone older and wiser than i am to whom i can turn for valued advice and counsel in return for this expenditure of time and effort i am willing to share the wealth of the okami how does this idea strike you yamauchisan yamauchi made a show of mulling this offer over but okami could feel his elation as if the sun had appeared from behind a cloud at length yamauchi said what you propose has merit it shows me that despite the rashness of youth that some oyabun condemn you possess a wisdom others in your dan did not he nodded i accept your proposal excellent okami said and to seal the arrangement i ask only that you find the two perpetrators of my fathers murder and put them to death by your own hand yamauchi said nothing for a long time he did not move did not touch the remainder of his tea which was growing cold in its cup after a time he said slowly i have had enough tea please bring a bottle of napoleon brandy so that we may each in our own private way celebrate this historic union of the yamauchi and the okami families three nights later okami welcomed mitsuba yamauchi to the back room of the latenight bar that served as a yakuza safe house mitsuba was one of seizos underbosses and one of his two chief expediters he was also seizos nephew mitsuba was wary as okami would have been in his place he was a thin man with no hips and the long legs of an arachnid he had a nervous habit of stroking the side of his jaw with his thumb his face was carved into flat planes and was dominated by a thicklipped mouth he worked into an ingenuouslooking smile for friend and enemy alike after the ritual greeting mitsuba unbuttoned his jacket sat at ease across the small table from okami as he did so okami saw the butt of a arching up from the waistband of his trousers hovering in the main room of the bar were a pair of mitsubas soldiers alert as huntingdogs who had been given the scent of prey okami was alone deliberately so for thirty minutes or so the two men drank fine blackmarket scotch and spoke in polite banalities the sounds of the bar up front were muted a radio played a jaunty american pop song and some drunk sang along with it for a few bars before going unalterably offkey at length okami said what is your opinion of the proposed merger between my family and yours you have an interesting manner of expressing what is already a fact mitsuba said okami nodded sagely though a bit ruefully too believed this to be the case he said until today when this was delivered to me he rose went to the back of the room switched on a mm film projector i would ask you to watch this film in its entirety mitsubasan and then render an opinion the film had already begun to run as okami slipped back into his seat out of the comer of his eye he watched mitsubas reaction to the grainy but perfectly clear blackandwhite filmcapturing with professional skill seizo yamauchi shooting to death two members of his own clan they were of course the soldiers who had murdered okamis father the spellbinding film ran its course okami briefly left mitsuba to turn off the projector he poured more scotch for them both where mitsuba paused to clear his throat he swallowed half his whiskey before continuing where did you get this document from a source of mine in the tokko this was the notorious thought police who were so powerful they were even feared by the yakuza so the police already have this evidence against seizosan okami noted that he hadnt used the term my uncle he said nothing wanting to see in which direction his pinch in the buttock would cause mitsuba to jump this will cause chaos in the ranks mitsuba said almost to himself with seizosan gone he turned his gaze on okami may i confess something to you okamisan i have for some time been disenchanted with seizosans longrange plans in fact i bitterly opposed several decisions he made most recently his eyes held okamis and they both knew mitsuba meant the directive to murder okamis father i appreciate knowing this okami said perhaps something of the alliance between our two families can yet be salvaged then he rose indicating the interview was at an end an hour later this same scenario was replayed with katsuodo kozo a brash swaggering man seizos other chief expediter kozo had a hardedged brittle personality which had made him almost as many enemies as his cleareyed logical mind had made him admirers unlike mitsuba he had come alone he sat still and silent through the film absorbed okamis spiel without comment when okami was through he said you know these two boys who seizosan shot are the ones responsible for your fathers death they were the weapon that much is true okami said with some emphasis but it was seizosan whose hand directed that weapon kozo considered this for some time i dont believe seizosan would have taken retribution on them had it not been a stipulation of the alliance old debts must be settled okami said before new liaisons can be consummated kozo made a steeple of his fingers stared at them intently it seems that seizosan made a serious miscalculation now he stirred a little i cannot speak for mitsuba but as for myself i believe the best course for the yamauchi family is to forge its own path which runs parallel to the okami well said thought okami there is bound to be no small turmoil within the yamauchi in the coming weeks he said there are those who will disagree vigorously with your philosophy this turmoil may spread to the other families there may even be talk among the oyabun about intervening in their own selfserving way i do not believe this to be the best course for the yamauchi it no doubt would prove dangerous for whoever is seeking control he leaned over poured whiskey for them both the yamauchi family has lost its way my wish is for the yamauchi to regain the stability it once had as of now i consider it a danger not only to the okami but to all the families rest assured i will do everything in my power to see that this stability is established and maintained okami could see that kozo understood precisely what he was proposing he lifted his glass in a western toast to stability he said with the ghost of a smile a week later responding to an anonymous tip the police discovered the bodies of seizo yamauchi and his nephew mitsuba in the livingroom of mitsubas residence from the position of the bodies the angles of the entry wounds on both bodies it was clear that the two yakuza had had a disagreement which had led each to use deadly force against the other and if there were one or two minor discrepancies the police were more than willing to overlook them after all the main thing was that there were two less yakuza to worry about maybe they would all rub each other out now there was a policemans dream come true in the ensuing weeks the bodies of various yamauchi soldiers and underbosses were found until katsuodo kozo had weeded out all his enemies and had consolidated his power as okami had predicted the degree of bloodshed unnerved the other oyabun and there was some talk of moving in concert to establish order within the yamauchi true to his word okami protected the peace and kozo by keeping the other oyabun at bay until kozo had established control the outcome not only increased kozos standing in the underworld but also cemented okamis from then on he was seen increasingly as a visionary who could guide the families through difficult times this was the beginning of okamis rise to the position of kaisho the mysterious commander oyabun of all oyabun it happened that general willoughby had an adjutant who had come to the attention of okamis people this was because he had a taste for young men and the underworld into which he was obliged to slip in order to slake his particular thirst was the province of okamis family his name was jack donnough he was a youngish man quite handsome with sandy hair a high forehead and green eyes he was thinlipped and intense at work but according to okamis sources just the opposite during his nightside forays now as okami made his way across nighttime tokyo he thought he might have use for donnough he had his driver change course head into shinjuku where establishments of the water trade as the japanese so eloquently put it flourished like mushrooms beneath a tree the owner of the iron gate ushered him inside bowing so often and so deeply her head must have begun to spin she was a tiny woman in a black and orange kimono her hair was elaborately coifed in the style of the old geisha huge tortoiseshell pins held it in place her face though lined was still an elegant reminder of times when she had been both beautiful and desirable jack donnough was indeed plowing the fragrant field she told him matteroffactly as she pointed out the room upstairs in the back okami thought it interesting that americans had such a strict taboo against sexual liaisons between men in japan it had been an accepted part of life for centuries curiously donnough insisted on this one room the owner said she didnt know why but after a swift perimeter inspection of the building okami did the window of donnoughs trysting place gave out onto the corner alley which was dark and easy to get lost in in the event of a police raid or other disturbance okami went back inside the iron gate and was about to mount the stairs when he saw the army nurse he had encountered when he had gone to see johnny leonforte faith sawhill walk in he stepped quickly back into the shadows of the hallway that led to the kitchen watching her as she went straight for the stairs and up them it was interesting that she was here even more so that she apparently knew her way around okami approached the owner asked her if she knew anything about the american woman she comes in from time to time the woman said concentrating perhaps one time in every three or four that donnough does shes never here when he isnt what she does in there with the two men i have no idea she shrugged i told donnough the first time it happened that i expected more money from him he paid it without question fascinated okami went silently up the stairs after faith sawhill at the end of the corridor he paused considering his next move on impulse he put his ear to the door which was in this kind of establishment thin enough are you sure its safe sawhills voice came through the door i told you a male voice undoubtedly donnoughs said he doesnt speak english this whole thing gives me the creeps which whole thing donnough said icily sex between men or running for alba youre awfully flip for someone playing so dangerous a game sawhill said if willoughby finds out what youre doing he wont donnough said flatly the little fascist is too busy exercising his jap colonels brains he wants to turn them into spies he gave a low chuckle well i suppose work is hard to come by if youre a fullblown war criminal those men should be behind bars sawhill said i know some of the atrocities theyre responsible for so does willoughby i can assure you donnough said he has no trouble sleeping at night but thats because hes got the communists on the brain his idea is to use these jap officers as the nucleus of a new military general staff for a rearmed japan the soviets he likes to say are only spitting distance away okami could hear the sound of his blood rushing in his inner ear his heart was pounding and his mouth was dry what had he stumbled into he had been right about willoughby but what was sawhill running as donnough had put it between donnough and alba and why alba and not his boss johnny leonforte im late sawhill said let me have it her voice was abruptly louder and with a start okami realized she was nearer the door here it is donnough said the latest poop on willoughbys group of fifteen this ought to make albas day okami heard a rustling and he pulled away from the door turned and sprinted back down the corridor he was heading quickly down the stairs when he heard the door open behind him and the click of high heels in the corridor above him he was sitting on a black lacquer bench waiting for her when she came down the stairs miss sawhill he said rising and smiling at her as she reached ground level faith sawhill turned in his direction her cool darkblue eyes appraised him as if he were an interesting handbag in a shop window and you are mikio okami i remember you thats good okami said i wonder whether we could have a drink im afraid thats out of the question faith said frowning she tucked a manila folder she had been clutching under her arm im already late jonathan doesnt like to be kept waiting dont you mean vincent alba okami said for the first time faith appeared briefly startled why yes under the circumstances i think i can spare a minute or two okami took her to an akachochin down the street its red lantern swung cheerily in the darkness inside it was boisterous and so smoky they couldnt see the far end of the long narrow room unconcerned by the din okami pushed his way to the bar ordered two scotches without asking faith what she wanted then led her to an empty booth at the rear of the place you and alba have a nice little racket going okami said as soon as they were seated i beg your pardon maybe you two are sleeping together behind johnnys back faith laughed yeah and maybe the moon is made of green cheese she laughed again the guys an ape an ape youre working for faith turned her head her darkblue eyes sometimes had the uncanny ability to take on the tone of her surroundings right now they possessed the fugitive translucence of smoke she smiled youre either clairvoyant or a good eavesdropper whats he got that johnny doesnt alba hes absolutely loyal and he knows how to take orders faith picked up her glass sipped the whiskey johnnys erratic a hothead his schemes of conquest arent always in line with reality so vincent alba is his shepherd she nodded thats as good a way to put it as any okami spent the next several minutes studying this woman she was exceedingly beautiful with an oval face catlike eyes and a rich bow of a mouth which reminded okami of a particularly memorable geisha he had once known besides that however she knew how to conduct a conversation and this above all else made her intriguing who does alba work for right now youre better off not knowing faith said in such a serious tone that it gave okami pause perhaps i should be asking major donnough these questions to her credit faith didnt even blink an eye i can see the drift of this conversation she said she arched an eyebrow am i to assume vincent and i have a new partner its as easy as that she shrugged when in rome she saw his perplexed look added this is your country so you have us at a disadvantage besides if you blow the whistle on donnough were all down the tubes my decisions simple twothirds of the pot is better than none at all he considered for a moment whats alba doing with the information on willoughbys group of war criminals nothing that i know of faith said hes merely passing it back to the states and you two have no idea of its use none okami decided this was getting him nowhere and what if i put a gun to vincent albas head while i ask him these questions faith snorted and her eyes turned dark jesus you slobs are all alike arent you everythings settled by a weapon okami found himself pricked by the note of scorn in her voice he held out his hand let me see what donnough passed on to you faith gave him a curious look as if she were seeing him for the first time i can see youve given me no choice he quickly scanned the intelligence reports donnough had copied willoughby had been a busy boy lieutenantgeneral arisue former chief of military intelligence for the general staff and several of his officers had already been incorporated into gs historical section where they were providing willoughby with uptodate reports on soviet troop movements in the far east as well as evaluating other intelligence colonel takushiro hattori who had been chief of the first section of the general staffs ops division was now in charge of japanese military demobilization that was appalling on two counts a war criminal was in charge of weeding out other war criminals and should willoughbys plan for japans rearming become a reality hat tori would be in charge of remobilizing the army this is infamous okami thought it took some concentration to stop himself from shaking with rage these men whom he now saw paraded before him like a chorus line in a dance hall had been elevated to some perverted form of celebrity instead of being condemned to the seven levels of hell as they deserved you seem a bit tense mr okami faith said perhaps i should order us another round of drinks okami wrestling with his personal animosity was beginning to ponder the larger implications of this report namely of what possible use was it to vincent albas boss back in the states whoever he might be he was certainly a mafia capo why would he find it interesting that elements of the us army were employing war criminals in their own intelligence network the scotches came and okami drank his straight down he no longer cared what faith sawhill thought of him the revelations of donnoughs report had made her irrelevant she was despite her beauty and her cleverness only a woman whose role in this game he already knew she was a minor player like johnny leonforte what had donnough called her a runner he and the colonel had wondered if someone was backing leonforte and now he had his answer vincent albas mysterious capo stateside he looked up tell me miss sawhill whats your role in all this the mafias strictly a mans game and you know all about mens games dont you mr okami she smiled so sweetly when she said this he might have been her lover she looked down for a moment before continuing the truth is i have a restless soul im a good american i came out here to do my duty for my country to the best of my abilities and just happened to fall in with the wrong crowd he said skeptically i fell in love with the wrong man sadness and remorse filled her face i admit to being stupid falling for johnny for his manic energy and his crazy dreams she lifted a hand let it fall to her lap why did it happen its the aftermath of the war or maybe its this city tokyo so alien and strange and devastated got sucked into everything that smile again so disarming im as curious as a cat you see even vincent and johnny couldnt hide their work from me for long vincent when he found out was all for throwing me out but the smile broadened i wrapped my thigh around johnnys and he let me stay so i got involved like a tree caught up in a twister a powerful storm okami wondered whether to believe her then he realized that it didnt matter she didnt matter at all only the intelligence purloined from willoughby had consequence here he rose the report still in his hand ill make a copy of this youll have it back by morning faith looked distressed vincent will have a fit let him okami said hed better get used to having a new partner this report is invaluable okami said its the weapon ive needed to get my revenge the colonel was studying the papers while he and okami walked in ueno park the colonel gave no sign that he saw the brandy bottle okami carried and from which he took a swig from time to time okami had not been to bed he was drunk had been drinking ever since he had left faith sawhill his elation mounting with each step he had taken because he now saw a way to crush those he hated most it was early morning fog still curling in off the sumida river a chinablue sky was peeking out from the dregs of night like a baby robin out of its shell below the yoshino cherry trees were bursting with sprays of pink blossoms so pale they were almost white there was a scent in the air which okami always associated with his childhood in those days he had seen very little of his father but each spring his father would take okami and his brother to ueno park for cherry blossom viewing the sweet ethereal scent reminded him of holding his fathers hand it was hard and dry and comforting he had felt happy with the tall figure towering over him look at the cherry blossoms above your head he could remember his father whispering in an almost reverential tone they bloom so quickly and then at the height of their beauty fall to the ground and die this is why we love them so because all men are like these blossoms we have their beauty inside ourselves were one with them shizen nature is a word that was imported from china because here we had no word for it why did we need it arent man and nature one and the same years later when okami had been summoned to his fathers house the night he was killed he had knelt beside the bed waiting for his mothers arrival he would not allow any of his fathers men into the bedroom though he could not stop them from swarming around the house and grounds and guarding him later he would deal one by one with those who had been remiss in their duty to his father but for this moment he had bent his head and taking his fathers cold hand in his had out of season smelled that soft sweet scent of cherry blossoms at the height of their brief effulgent life now walking again in ueno okami inhaled deeply that miraculous scent redolent of metaphysics and memories he glanced over at the colonel who was going over the reports again and again mostly without comment okami said if you take this intelligence straight to macarthur the colonel looked up sharply what makes you think that he isnt already aware of willoughbys plans okami had no ready answer for that here among the cherry trees the colonel said softly we must take time to look at this picture calmly he took several deep breaths and okami was reminded all over again why he liked this westerner so much i know what these men are capable of the colonel went on in that same soothing tone i know they gave the orders to execute your brother he was a pacifist okami said in a strangled voice he was the brave one not me he spoke out for what i was feeling in my heart but never said aloud perhaps he was a bit foolish too the colonel commented those were not times to speak your mind if it went against the majority no no dont you see he was true to himself a hero the bitterness in okamis voice was like poison lacing a goblet of wine and i was the one who was decorated a joke surely because i did what i did out of fear for my own life my captain would have shot me in the back if i had not obeyed orders but i should have risked that perhaps because he was drunk he added arent you going to ask me why i should have risked being shot in the back the colonel stopped took the empty brandy bottle out of okamis hand i know why he said for glory if only we might fall like cherry blossoms in the spring so pure and radiant at the colonels recitation of a poem a kamikaze pilot had written just before flying to his death okami began to weep he was drunk and among friends so this was permissible desirable even the excruciating internal pressures of holding all emotion inside oneself required periodic exorcism general macarthur cant possibly condone what willoughby is contemplating okami said as he wiped his eyes the cool fresh air was dissipating his drunkenness despite his best efforts to keep it going rearming japan now would be a diplomatic disaster for your country and an economic one for mine if japan cant find a way to forge a new economic foundation based on peacetime commodities there will be no future at all for us i agree the colonel said and so i believe does macarthur he clasped his hands behind his back slapping one against the other rhythmically but we still have no idea where this information is being funnelled or who might now have access to it who is our enemy now okamisan i cannot see them can you and i have a growing suspicion they may be powerful and they may be legion i see no time for this contemplation in his state he spat the last word you must go to macarthur the colonel shook his head no listen to me my friend we must defuse the scenario willoughby has in mind but we must be circumspect macarthur detests any sense of rift between his people hes got his own problems with the president and the allies and hes wary of anything that could be turned into negative publicity and we must gain a sense of those arrayed against us tell me okami san would you draw your katana while you are deaf dumb and blind i would if i had to okami said dully his heart was burning with the last of the effects of the alcohol and his need to see vengeance done the colonel paused turned toward okami they were beneath an ancient cherry enclosed within its ethereal fragrant bower they might have been gods on the summit of mt fuji discussing the fate of the mortals below them youre not the suicidal type i know you better than that he said tartly he shook his head again we have alba and his stateside capo making inroads here not merely in the american black market but also among your own yakuza the mafia and the yakuza in bed together is a daunting concept this is our main problem willoughbys scheme is merely part of a larger picture one that we must bring into focus before we know which way to move i suppose this is the time for me to pay alba a visit no the colonel said i believe that would be a mistake as yet we cannot know who is our friend and who our foe they commenced walking again the sun felt warm on their shoulders and the earlymorning breeze had died the colonel had to maintain silence while they passed a pair of armed soldiers a child ran up to him his arms heaped with cherry blossoms he had scooped off the grass he threw his arms up scattering the blossoms like snow his laughter rang through the park as he scampered away the prudent course of action now is to confront johnny leonforte the colonel continued when it was safe from what youve been able to gather he seems to be the weak link in this chain if so hell be the easiest to crack it might take some kind of force the colonels face was solemn okamisan it is vital that we know what kind of a situation we are confronted with the future of your country and perhaps mine hangs in the balance okami chose the time and the place with great care he spent three days shadowing johnny leonforte so that he could get an idea of his routine in the end he decided to take him on his way to faith sawhills apartment okami had discovered that by and large leonforte kept his evenings clear because that was the time he did his most lucrative business okami watched from the shadows across the street as leonforte pulled up in his motorpool jeep pressing once the flat hilt of his wakizashi his long slightly curved knife which lay close against his belly okami headed quickly across the street johnny he called as he neared the other man leonfortes head turned so fast okami could hear the vertebrae in his neck crack leonfortes eyes narrowed you i told you okamis right hand shot out catching leonforte a powerful blow in his solar plexus just where the major nerves bundled beneath the muscles aagh leonforte sounded as if he were gagging he began to topple forward but held onto the seat back with one hand fumbled for his officers with the other okami reached out serenely and squeezed a spot on his upper arm quite near the shoulder leonfortes entire right side went numb okami dragged him from the jeep swept him into a narrow windblown alley at the side of sawhills apartment building propping him against the grimy ferroconcrete wall he slapped leonfortes sagging face a couple of times until his eyes began to clear im sorry its come to this okami said kneeing him hard in the groin now leonforte began to retch in earnest okami stepped deftly away to avoid being spattered he hauled leonforte roughly further down the alley away from his own mess i want to know whats going on go to hell okami cracked him so hard on the side of his head he heard bone splinter leonforte moaned shook his head tears were standing out in the corners of his eyes til kill you for this he hissed between bloody teeth i can see youre hungry for the chance okami said he slapped leonfortes into his hand stepped back he touched the hilt of his wakizashi here it is despite the battering leonforte was fast the muzzle of the came up in a blur leonfortes fingers squeezing the trigger but okami had already stepped within the perimeter of his defense and the honed tip of the blade was pricking the skin of leonfortes throat do it okami whispered pull the trigger leonforte looked hard at okami as if he were a man just waking up from a dream what he swallowed hard what dyou want tell me what vincent albas up to leonforte blinked vinnie what dyou mean hes a fuckin bodyguard uh uh hes here to see you dont get into trouble youre outta your fuckin mind ace but okami could see that he was thinking it through he might be hotheaded and uncontrollable but this was not a stupid man then jack donnoughs crazy too because hes who i heard it from madonna leonforte exclaimed then he began to laugh his body began to shake his eyes to water he spat blood but he appeared beyond caring he tried to catch his breath as the pain of the beating kicked in but the laughter bubbled out all the faster it built and built until it hung on the precipice of hysteria okami slammed the heel of his hand into the bridge of leonfortes nose just to stop the sound in disgust he turned away from the unconscious man went swiftly and silently out of the alley if faith sawhill was surprised to see okami you couldnt tell by her face mr okami wont you come in she said smiling as she opened the door to her apartment okami stepped across the threshold pushed the door shut behind him faith sawhill was still in her military uniform okami looked at the majors bars pinned to her epaulets found himself astonished by her rank but then everything about her astonished him would you care for a drink faith asked him as she headed for the dropleaf table i dont know about you but ive had a helluva day her strong hands were deft as they went about their work at hours the generals ulcers began bleeding and now i think an amoebas involved what a mess his insides are she handed him a scotch clinked rims sipped hers she curled up on the loveseat pushed her shoes off her feet he was aware of her sexual magnetism her deliberate use of it then he centered himself said wheres the boss wheres alba faith regarded him evenly out ill wait okami said setting aside his glass the cold of the ice was chilling him i ran into johnny downstairs he didnt look so good faith sat up straight what have you done did he detect the color of fear in her beautiful eyes i did what i had to do besides johnny was begging for a fight faith rose looked over his shoulder to the door i hope to christ you killed him because if theres an ounce of life left in him at that moment the door flew open and johnny leonforte in a spray of blood and sweat rushed into the room at the ready okami you bastard im gonna fuckin kill you okami ceased to think he allowed his body to respond to the deepseated instinct for survival in the mindnomind that was the essence of his martial training he threw himself headlong behind the loveseat where faith stood her attention for the moment on leonforte johnny shut up leonforte cried whatre you two doing together plotting against me like you did with that fuckin spy alba or just having a twobit affair dont be stupid that was the wrong thing to say either way its at my expense he spat out words and saliva together like a madman get outta the way faith or ill plug you too too late she tried to appease him johnny look at this reasonably theres nothing going on between okami and me if youll just calm down til calm down leonforte snarled as he squeezed the trigger when hell freezes over explosions one two three ripped through the back of the loveseat just as okami pulled faith down one bullet slammed into her left thigh uhh she grunted through teeth clamped together in pain and shock scrambling over her okami crawled the length of the loveseat and took a quick look from behind his makeshift cover leonforte stood spreadlegged his arms rigidly in front of him in the classic marksmans stance he squeezed off a shot that ricocheted past okamis left ear so close it hurt i know where you are fuckers and im going to blow your brains out okami had no doubt that leonforte was going to make good on his threat he had never thought about death but now he was obliged to stare it in the face he did not care for what he saw he feit the blood pounding in his veins the strong muscle of his heart contracting and expanding he had life in the palm of his hand he wanted to give nothing up and he resolved that should he emerge from this alive he would never again allow himself to be in such a position of weakness ready or not here i come okami braced himself to move for to remain behind the loveseat would mean certain death at that moment he heard the tangle of voices raised in anger the explosion of shot when it came did not penetrate the back of the loveseat he risked another peek saw to his astonishment leonforte slamming the butt of his gun into the bloody head of vincent alba he had already put two bullets into alba and was now in the process of battering him to his powerful knees breaking cover okami whipped round the end of the loveseat launched himself at an oblique angle to where leonforte stood as okami had guessed leonforte saw movement at the periphery of his vision busy in bloodheat he was slow to react and when he did he assumed okami would head straight for him and broke off two shots in that direction that was enough time for okami to change course from the oblique as he leapt toward leonforte he saw the man swing his round and he knew that he would only get one chance his wakizashi was out leveled in a horizontal plane it sliced across leonfortes face into his chest at the moment he fired for the third time okami felt the force of the percussion as the blade hit leonfortes ribs then slid between them leonforte staggered his eyes opened wide his mouth dropped open perhaps to utter a final epithet but by that time his eyes were already rolling up and his legs lost their strength he tripped over the bulllike form of his latest victim one hand slipping across albas crimson face as if it were a sheet of ice he crashed backward into the liquor table shattering bottles everywhere the cool astringency of the liquor combined with the cloying sweetness of death okami bloodied his knife in his hand stood staring down at leonforte he tried to summon up any feeling of remorse but could not after a moment he turned made his way back to where faith lay half under the overturned loveseat okami put aside his wakizashi lifted the loveseat off her how much blood she meant how much had she lost he went into the kitchen found a thin towel came back and kneeling beside her tied off the thigh just above the wound not enough he said he meant not enough to die i cant feel my leg isnt that to be expected she looked up at him i dont know its not my field she tried to laugh i went all through the war and never saw a wound some war okami commented johnny dead okami said but not before he killed alba oh christ she whispered her eyes closed and her lips moved let me think her eyes opened suddenly and they seemed as red to him as the blood sprayed all over the room she licked her lips theres a place i want you to take me she said i know where the army hospital is no not there she waited a moment but when he made no reply she added i dont know whether i can trust you but i dont believe you have a choice okami said we both need to get out of here before the cops or the mps get here he stuffed his knife into the waistband of his trousers scooped her up in his arms she was surprisingly light she directed him to the side entrance that led out onto the alley where he had confronted leonforte and it was a good thing he used it because from the shadows into which they emerged he could already see the reflections of the red and blue lights of cop cars and mp jeeps okami turned raced down to the far end of the alley emerged onto a street turned left hurrying to his car he unlocked it and bundled her in he tried to ignore her gasps of pain he got behind the wheel started the engine and they got out of there she told him to head west toward the warehouses that lined that part of the sumida river it was a dilapidated neighborhood suffering as much from neglect as from the ravages of the war far away tokyo was being rebuilt but here the old prewar structures were still intact rotting against the somnolent waters of the river with a voice made weak by pain and shock she directed him down a narrow street that deadended at the water much to his surprise okami discovered what appeared to be a private dwelling wedged between two long warehouses stop just there faith whispered indicating a spot outside the private dwelling now leave me here okami sat with the engine idling he looked out the window at the building then back at faith she was slumped in the back seat her eyes almost closed youve lost a lot of blood miss sawhill he said if i dont help you inside youre not going to make it on your own youve done the good samaritan bit she struggled to a sitting position but almost immediately fell against the door her hand fumbled with the handle okami got out opened her door lifted her gently out of the car you mustnt be seen here faith whispered her head lolled against his shoulder and he could see her rapid shallow breathing he knew he had to get her inside right now its dangerous he took her to the front door hit it several short but powerful kicks the resulting noise was like the boom of a kettle drum and he realized that the door was made of metal probably steel it opened quickly giving him the distinct impression that they had been observed drawing up he was confronted by a delicate japanese woman of no more than eighteen she bowed to him perfunctorily then said this way please in the terse terribly efficient manner of a doctor or a nurse she led him down a long corridor lined with cherrywood paneling at the end of it he was conducted into what appeared to be a brightly lit operating theater albeit on a modest scale a doctor was already scrubbed and waiting he directed okami to place faith on the table and then leave anako will show you where you can wait the surgeon said as he began his preliminary workup on faith ill join you when i can the young woman named anako ushered him into an adjacent room which had been set up as a library bookshelves lined the walls a crystal chandelier hung from the center of the vaulted eighteenfoot ceiling a jeweltoned persian carpet covered the floor the comfortable furniture a pair of facing oversized sofas two chairs with ottomans was leather between the sofas was a bronze and glass coffee table on which sat a small clock in one corner a french secretary stood with its surface entirely free of objects polished to a hard gloss okami had been in museums with more dust curious he went to the bookshelves he was startled to discover that almost all the volumes were in japanese save for an impressive section on historical warfare which was in english and french elsewhere there were histories and horticultural books in profusion but most of the library was given over to philosophical texts so obscure that even okami who by dint of his martial training was learned in that field had never read them he took one of these volumes over to a chair sat reading it for some time illumination came solely from the chandelier and several greenshaded lamps scattered around the room thick curtains were pulled tight across the high windows and when he rose to part them he discovered only blank wall behind them recalling faith sawhills warning about the danger to him here he was abruptly restless leaving the book on the chair he went to the door and opened it the hall was dim and so silent he could hear the muffled ticklock of the clock in the library behind him this end of the corridor was comprised of three rooms two of them he had already been in the surgery and the library now he crossed the hall put his ear against the third door he could hear nothing grasping the knob he turned it pushed inward he found himself in a smallish room it was altogether anonymous rather like a doctors waiting room white walls a gray lowpile carpet a pair of steel engravings of turnofthecentury clipper ships on the walls one desk three chairs nothing more he went to the chair closest to the desk because he saw draped over it faith sawhills bloodstained uniform now that he had come this far he could see there was another door which he guessed led directly into the surgery he bent over the chair stared at her uniform for some time then he carefully went through it he found nothing but a mattgray pen clipped to the inside breast pocket of her jacket and within the same pocket a short list of items to purchase it was when he was carefully replacing the list that he noticed something odd about the pen it was thicker than an ordinary writing instrument and now that he looked at it more closely he saw that it was made of a substance he could not identify he plucked it from the pocket turned it over and over as he scrutinized it he pressed the button on the top and a tip clicked out then he noticed there was a series of bumps along the spine of the oversized clip he pressed the top one heard a barely audible whine he put the pen to his ear something was going on inside it he pressed the second button and again heard the whine the third button stopped the whine and now he was beginning to get it with a mounting sense of excitement he pressed the fourth button and heard faith sawhills voice emanating from the pen which as it happened was also a miniature wire recorder report from tokyo april weve hit the motherlode of intelligence donnough has proved an exemplary source see accompanying microdot unfortunately ive run into a rather complex wrinkle a yakuza oyabun named mikio okami knows more about our operation than is healthy ive offered him a partnership which for now is the best o a bad set of options there was a slight pause then her voice began again i told him that vincent was here to monitor johnny which was the truth as far as it went he has no idea that vincent was here to monitor me as well well even johnny didnt know that but then johnny didnt really know much at all did he but thats how you wanted it because in the end johnny only cared about johnny again a slight pause okami believes vincent was running the show over here which is kind of funny but certainly helpful from our point of view i dont believe okami knows who were dealing with here which is a relief but hes smart and tenacious and i think he must have some kind of american backing of his own which is alarming i need to pump him but in such a way that he believes hes pumping me not so easy but dont worry i can handle it silence while the remainder of the wire unspooled itself those were the only entries but as far as okami was concerned they were more than enough how foolish of him to have underestimated faith sawhill she was a woman and he had seen her wholly in that light and had dismissed her out of hand he wouldnt make that same mistake again he ran the wire back to the spot he guessed it had originally been at then replaced the pen he went silently out of the room back across the hall and into the library he sat for some time the book he had selected open and unread in his lap his first instinct was to take faith sawhill down but in a moment he saw the foolhardiness of such rash action if the willoughby plan were brought to fruition they were all sunk especially japan which desperately needed breathingroom to regain its economic feet and build a base from which to haul itself from the ashes of defeat even the colonel would be helpless in such a doomsday scenario as willoughby was preparing rearming japan was about the last thing the country needed to heal its wounds and get on with its future being americas pointman against the communists in the pacific would keep japan under its thumb for decades to come that was absolutely unacceptable with a profound sense of unease okami realized that the colonels prudence was correct he now had the opportunity of a lifetime whatever faith might say to her as yet unknown employer she was going to make him a partner in the black market scheme here now he knew what she wanted from him he would be prepared he knew that he must protect the colonel from her at all costs because her employer would undoubtedly see him as an enemy and do his best to destroy the colonel that meant either trying to outwit faith or an appalling thought trying to come to some form of truce with her because okami knew her employer held the key to stopping willoughbys plan to rearm japan and reinstate its most heinous war criminals to their former positions of power not only was he in possession of the topsecret intelligence that could destroy willoughby he was also with his highpowered contacts inside washington in a unique position to overcome those in the military and the us senate who were siding with willoughby also he knew the physical nature of her reports this he sensed instinctively was his biggest edge because sooner or later he or the colonel would be able to trace those wire recordings and those microdots back from tokyo to their final destination in the united states and at last they would know the nature of their enemy at that moment the door to the library opened and the doctor strode in shes going to be fine he said though perhaps a small limp is inevitable since some nerve damage occurred then he smiled would you come with me please she would very much like to see you faith sawhitl was lying on the table as if she were dead okami staring down at her thought she looked very pale her eyes opened and he was startled to find them as dark as his youre still here so far my stay has been uneventful she licked her dry lips and without being bidden he poured her some water slipped the straw between her lips as he lifted her head up watched her drink her fill when she was through she thanked him have you seen anyone here she asked with some anxiety her voice was hoarse and still weak just the surgeon and anako of course ive been alone in the library faith nodded and her face appeared to relax her eyes held his the alliance that johnny wouldnt grant you im prepared to guarantee okami studied her for some time how did i get so lucky id rather have you as a partner than an enemy she gave him a tiny smile besides you did me a big favor getting rid of johnny vincent told me he was becoming increasingly uncontrollable she licked her lips again he had only contempt for women id be a much better partner he said only underestimate them faith tried to laugh is it real this time he asked you know you said it was at the iron gate but we both know you didnt mean it this time i do her hand sought his so what do you say deal we can be very helpful to one another i need all the help i can get out here now that vincents gone who knows when therell be a replacement and anyway until then you would benefit from vincents contacts he appeared to consider this for some time at length he said do you know the story about the six monkeys i dont believe i do he ignored her puzzled expression there was once an old man he was very wise and over the course of his long life many people sought his counsel what was most interesting was that almost everyone who came to him asked the same question how they would ask do i understand myself to this the old man gave the same reply he brought out a curious cage constructed of bamboo it was oblong and contained six windows inside the cage was a monkey choose a window he counseled them and then call the monkey observe closely his response it will be a reflection of your own inner self for a long time there was only the sound of her breathing supplemented by the methodical engines of medical science am i supposed to understand that he shrugged yes and no its a zen riddle its meant itself to be a pathway for thought and meditation faith screwed her face up thinking i think i get it she said the monkey responds differently to attitude and tone of voice im sure thats true she looked up at him which one of the six monkeys are you thats for you to discover okami said with a brief smile he clasped her hand in his it was warm and dry and unaccountably made him think of his father in the meantime my dear miss sawhill we should have green tea to properly seal this pact you wont regret your decision those dark eyes smiled up at him partner book three endless truths the autumn wind for me there are no gods there are no buddhas masaoka shiki thirteen tokyo washington naohiro ushiba daijin of miti had heard it said that some called tomoo kozo the mad oyabun there were many stories about him one was that his penis was entirely covered in irizumi the exquisitely wrought tattoos that all yakuza wore on parts of their skin irizumi was applied as it had been done for centuries with sharp bamboo dipped in colored inks the pain it was said was formidable as ushiba stared into kozos face he said from the moment you decided on your own to put a shadow on nicholas linnears wife you set us on this very dangerous course kozo took a drag of his cigarette his tiny black eyes moving over ushibas face it was a smart move linnear had disappeared into the mists at the behest of okami should we have done nothing to keep track of him what about nangi kozo shook his head the wife was his link she always has been and believe me the moment okami entered his life linnear was not about to confide in tanzan nangi how could he with linnears professed hatred of the yakuza how couid he tell nangi that he was going to become the kaishos lackey ushiba lit a cigarette kept pace with the restless kozo as he circled the koi pond you may have fooled the other oyabun of the inner council but not me i think you instigated this attack on okami merely to pit yourself against linnear for ushiba aggression was often more gratifying than introspection besides if kozo truly were mad perhaps he could be provoked into revealing his private motives for this decision to oust the kaisho im right arent i its just the kind of crazy challenge you cant resist what nonsense kozo circled the pond like a predator in a cage you know the dangers okami represented as well as i do weve rehashed them time and again theres no room any more for the kaisho the kind of power he wielded is too dangerous to be left in one mans hands simply put the kaisho has been supplanted by the godaishu our network spread all around the world will work far more efficiently and with far more checks and balances than it would have being directed by one man he blew smoke up toward the skylight all of okamis arguments against the godaishu are scattered now like cherry blossoms in the rain okami should have foreseen his demise as kaisho and planned for the eventuality of its passage into history i know i would have but without okamis intimate knowledge of the mafia the godaishu would never have come into being he not you or i is its true father kozo shrugged mores the pity for him that he turned against us karma he chose his own path no one pushed him you did your best i was once okamis most trusted ally everyone knows that but when his path changed i noticed and became suspicious and i was proved right at the end i fought him tooth and nail and why not he did not believe in what the godaishu had become he betrayed the godaishu betrayed our trust in him as the kaisho he made his own deal with dominic goldoni and now were left with picking up the pieces he and i were always the best at dealing with the americans but i must admit that he understood them better than i do kozo said that will soon change im working hard to understand the iteki you see what i mean about challenges ushiba said you just cant resist them but your determination to destroy linnear is senseless worse its downright dangerous not senseless kozo said i initiated my actions on the basis of some astonishing information linnear is nishiki the secret conduit who had been supplying intelligence to dominic goldoni and okami ridiculous ushiba said linnears strict moral code the history of japan teaches us that the espousal of righteousness is the securest refuge for corruption neh he smiled think it through ushibasan linnear has the kind of mind and the range of expertise to destroy all of us but thats only part of it isnt it ushiba said shrewdly daijin you will not draw me into a personal confession he shook his head look by going after okami now we take down two birds at once we agreed that the kaishos day was over and by deliberately letting him find out his days were numbered we forced him into a corner he had to draw on the colonels promise to him that his son would come to his aid linnear did not fail his father and now we are able to pick the time and place of our confrontation im convinced the only way to defeat linnear is for us to choose the killing ground as sun tzu has taught us that will be our advantage us you mean you ushiba stared at him a long time i was right all along you are going after nicholas linnear kozo laughed daijin im doing better than that im about to get him it has come to my attention that you are indulging in a bit of extracurricular activity the red queen stretched relieving the tension that had built up between his shoulderblades he cracked the knuckles beneath his gloved hands youre costing the government of the united states of america money it can ill afford to spend tell me why you know why lillehammer said dominic goldoni was whacked under our noses and when confronted by the red queens implacable silence he was compelled to add quite unnecessarily inside witsec for christs sake goldoni was operating isnt that how its put inside witsec what did you expect lillehammer watched the red queen pick his way through the remnants of his double bacon cheeseburger and jumbo fries why did they always have to eat at a fastfood joint i expect we wont let whoever it was get away with it it was surreal having these discussions amid the cacophony of kids working stiffs and people marking time until they could place their next bet at the otb across the street the red queen pushing aside his coated paper plate was not amused i need another coke he got up abruptly went across the red and yellow plastic restaurant he was wearing an englishmade tweed suit with a handcut doeskin vest his tie its pattern as voluptuous as it was gaudy was however strictly american when he returned an enormous paper cup of soda in his hand he said dont get coy with me i took a good long look at those photos of goldoni i know do duc did the goldoni hit and i know how badly you want to put his nuts in a meat grinder the red queen sucked a bit of cheeseburger from between his teeth but im giving you a direct order to cease and desist lillehammer sat very still he wondered if this was the moment of severing when the granite of which he had been a part for years was cracked in two ill need a very good reason he said quietly the red queens face was laden with a frown what do you think should i get a sundae here the sundaes taste like plastic just like everything else really i never thought so he shrugged and patted his stomach oh well i suppose all thats left is to leave the busboy a token of our appreciation for a clean table he took out some change and placed it on the plastic tabletop as they were getting up he said softly your personal rage wont help us now if it doesnt get in the way of ops itll get you killed i want your word forget do duc and attend to current business god knows theres enough of that lillehammer turned his head to stare at a little boy with icecream all over his face you have my word he said i will not go after do duc does that satisfy you i want you to keep an eye on davis munch bane tells me his prosecutor was seen with this man harley gaunt shortly before gaunt showed up at your house bane may be paranoid but hes not stupid the red queen patted the little boy on the head as they passed him outside he leaned toward lillehammer in an uncharacteristically avuncular gesture madness is born of the meditation on revenge he said it will do you good to remember that manny mannheim was staring at the thickly stuffed manila envelope when the buzzer sounded he turned hastily shoving the envelope onto the shelf beside the sawedoff shotgun he kept loaded and ready peering through the gap in the wire mesh he watched as a tall figure came through the front door the man wrapped in a dark wool tweed coat with its collar up did not immediately look at him instead he spent a good deal of time peering at the larger pawned objects manny had hanging on the walls or lining the dusty wooden floor glittery electric guitars a full set of classic louis vuitton luggage a green and silver mountain bike a pair of chinese celadon vases a gleaming black and cream harleydavidson softail autographed by johnny cash to someone named ferdie francis the man took his time so manny had a while to size him up the more he did so the more nervous he became actually he had become nervous the moment harley gaunt had come in a second time handing him the thick manila envelope with instructions as to what to do with it if he did not contact manny within twentyfour hours that was two days ago and manny had to assume that something had happened to his friend he did not want to think about what might have happened to gaunt but he dreamed about the possibilities when he went to sleep at night the man who had walked into mannys pawnshop was broadshouldered hamfisted intimidating as he turned this way and that examining each item before moving ever closer to where manny stood behind his wire screen manny could see the scars on his face the nose that had once been broken the clever eyes that saw every scratch and defect in whatever they were examining a light sheen of sweat broke out on mannys forehead and upper lip and he shifted uncomfortably from one foot to another an itch began just below his right shoulderblade as a droplet of sweat snaked its way down his back christ what had harley been involved in that could have gotten him killed manny wondered curiosity and terror waged a battle inside him how many times had he picked up the envelope after the twentyfour hours had passed too many to count once his curiosity getting the better of his common sense he had decided to slit it open but at the last moment either his courage failed him or he had come to his senses but today he had scrutinized with excruciating concentration every customer who walked into the pawnshop because he had started awake this morning his mind filled with a terrifying possibility what if harley had been followed to the pawnshop and somebody knew he had given the envelope to manny the man lifted his shoulders let them fall as he ran his hands over the louis vuitton luggage he gave a quick glance toward the front door then back at the cage where manny stood rooted to the spot the thick callused fingers upended the steamer trunk large enough to hold a human being if it were curled up he snapped it open lifted the lid contemplated the interior with a diligence manny found highly disturbing mannys first thought had been to burn the envelope to be rid of the evidence of gaunts visit to avoid the responsibility his friend had thrust upon him without asking his consent in the end he could not even light the match perhaps he was less of a moral coward than he had thought however seeing the man now replace the steamer trunk and move toward ihe motorcycle closer to the wire cage manny could believe that he had made a grave mistake yet how could he abandon his one true friend his relationship with gaunt inconstant though it had been was important to him they were the kind of friends who though not having seen each other for long periods of time could pick up their conversation as if the intervening years had never passed people like that were rare in life especially mannys life which had never amounted to much of anything the man in the tweed overcoat cleared his throat and manny jumped his right hand automatically sought out the butt of the sawedoff shotgun he kept within easy reach under the counter his finger eased around the trigger yes manny said not liking the high squeak in his voice nothing the man said glancing his way only how much dyou want for this twelve thousand manny said its a classic softail the man finished for him yeah i know he put his hands in the pockets of his overcoat turned to stare at manny you always stay inside that cage manny was terrified now of course the man wasnt interested in the harley he never had been he was here to take the envelope gaunt had left and to kill manny in the process did you hear what i said manny shaking mightily tried to get his tongue unstuck from the roof of his mouth ulbg was all he managed to say what ive had some uh you know trouble over the years manny stumbled so i the man took a step toward him you packing a gun back there dont come any closer manny said trying vainly to get saliva back into his mouth the man stared at the sawedoff shotgun leveled at him you gonna use that if i ask if youll take tenfive cash for the softail huh manny blinked swallowing hard i want the softail the man said taking his hands out of his pockets and spreading them wide one held a thick roll of bills you gonna sell it to me or you gonna shoot me manny felt his heart in his throat nothing seemed to be registering he was locked into an assumption that was immutable come on buddy the man said i know you said youd had trouble here but gimme a break would ya i just want to buy the damn softail manny wiped his face with a tremorous hand jesus christ he thought this isnt my kind of life im seeing bogeymen coming out of the walls any more of this cloakanddagger shit and a heart attack or a nervous breakdown is not out of the question he put the sawedoff away his muscles were spasming so heavily he had to grip the counter with both hands in order not to fall down his desire to urinate was very strong the man waved the bills over his head how about you come out here with the keys and well do this transaction onetwothree manny opened the door to the cage stepped out you got a license sure the man said reaching with his free hand behind his back that was the moment manny knew he was a dead man it was a moment one only experiences in dreams when momentous actions occur all around you while you watch helpless to intervene his thoughts were gelid with a kind of existential morbidity why did i leave the cage he wondered why did i put away the sawedoff why didnt i listen to my instincts manny watched impotent as the man pulled out his wallet put the wad of bills on the saddle of the softail extracted his license he held it out to manny for a moment manny stood frozen his heart clamored inside his chest like an outofcontrol subway train and he was having a good deal of trouble breathing smatter the man said dont you want to do the deal these days how many people come in here offering you tenfive cash for the softail woodenly manny held out his hand took the license somehow it fell through his fingers and as if in a dream he bent down retrieved it then he got the paperwork went through it like a zombie he hardly heard what the man said mac divine the drivers license read he took receipt of the tenfive without counting it himself divine had done that with great care right in front of him man my neighbors gonna shit his pants when he sees this baby in my driveway divine said with a grin hes been looking for one of these for three years after he left wheeling the softail as if it were his son manny leaned against the door panting heavily he was drenched in sweat he hurried back to his cage slipped on his coat sliding the thick envelope under it then he went outside locked the door and pulled down the gates padlocking them it was only three in the afternoon but hed had it for the day on rubbery legs he went to his bank made a night deposit of the cash in the till including the amount mr divine had given him then he set off to do what he should have done this morning follow gaunts instructions the tolling of the bell reverberated deep inside him like a raspy voice spoken in the small hours of the morning when the senses are blurred by a melancholic stupor born of a furious rush of reckless emotion now spent the tolling continued like a heartbeat or a sermon a spoken text of words indistinguishable as a flight of sparrows after sunset if he was alive he did not yet know in what state it might be his thoughts still chaotic as the molten magma of the universe seemed to exist wholly on their own without the confines of brain or corpus a pinpoint of light flickering uncertainly in the cosmic night no past no present enriched these thoughts and this lack of context made logic as evanescent as a dream there was no evidence of breath of blood pumping of an urgency for movement how could movement exist without brain or body to give thought density and substance but the tolling of the bell continued not a sound for he had no ears with which to hear but a pulse an atonal voice belonging to neither man nor machine an implication that somewhere in the vastness a context did indeed exist light a shadow upon the soul so he did exist after all he was born into a house of metal it seemed to be somewhere underground a vast conical space filled with sapphire light and the sharp echoes of industry he inhaled the scent of metal hot and amorphous cool and oiled but at least he was breathing his eyes learning to focus all over again saw being con structed at different automated stations arms legs feet and hands torsos hydraulic fingers and infrared eyes slowly before his still bleary gaze the perfect beasts were being formed it was as if he were witnessing creation somewhere between gods mind and vulcans forge or maybe it was just a robot factory by which deduction he was at least able to make an educated guess as to his current whereabouts he wasnt dead he was in tokyo how in the world had the messulethe got him here no other humans here just the precise movements of metal cylinders through shadow and light the hivelike thrummingof engines the heartbeats of disembodied souls the happy operatic singing of life being fabricated from steel titanium highdensity plastics silicon chips and fiberoptic cables he inhaled enjoying the sensation as another fragment of evidence that he was indeed alive the airconditioned triplefiltered atmosphere was cleaner than any country air could be but was nevertheless redolent of the foulness of machines it seemed to hold a static charge like clouds filled with incipient thunder and far away an effulgent flicker of lightning pawed the air like a restless animal abruptly an intense disorienting stab of vertigo replaced the light and sound barrage and the world closed into a pinpoint of undifferentiated gray his eyelids fluttered closed a sharp pain jerked him back to consciousness wake up youve slept too long as it is the voice sounded disturbingly familiar he started a shiver racing down his spine as he recognized his own face bending over him his own lips curled into a smile his own eyes crinkled in delight welcome to your new life his own voice reached his ears like an hallucination it will be a short one but i promise you it will be full of surprises nicholas passed out fourteen montauk washington tokyo croaker watched margarite as she stood in theshower and soaped up he could see nothing but a vaguely outlined silhouette yet he could not take his eyes off her here they were in a rundown montauk motel in the same room together because she had insisted that she did not want to sleep alone what was it she feared more roberts imminent return or her husbands he had checked the scene out the window as soon as she had gone into the bathroom oilstained blacktop only a few cars parked where in summer would be a sea of painted metal and chromium and across the street the odd kind of fastfood place existing only on the east end with its tacky red and yellow plastic sign chicken seafood open late hours lit up by frosty fluorescent lights and a bud lite sign its neon leaking vivid color into the darkness it was by this illumination that he had spied the wise guy burly body bland oval face coming out of the store a cardboard box filled with two coffees and some sandwiches balanced in one hand rather than two the free hand hung loosely at his side as he had been trained ready for a quick draw or anything else that might come his way croaker watched him as he got into a black ford taurus parked more or less in front of the fastfood joint the inner light came on briefly and croaker got a glimpse of a second wise guy he was quite certain that these were tony decamillos men he was unsurprised they would not have been difficult to locate especially for a man with tony ds resources after all they were using margarites lexus with a known license plate under those conditions croaker knew it was virtually impossible to keep your whereabouts secret for long croaker had turned away from his contemplation of the taurus and its hulking occupants when margarite partially opened the door to the bathroom it was already overheated in the room with no way to lower the thermostat and the steam from the shower was making the bathroom unbearable the smells of mildew and surf drifted like dust in the air the wise guys wouldnt make a move until tony d arrived and that wouldnt be until morning croaker had all that time to figure out how he was going to handle the confrontation without anyone getting hurt staring at margarites shifting outline he knew he had other matters with which to occupy himself for the time being he still found himself having to adjust to the new reality that she not tony d was heir to dominic goldonis domain and all that implied she had in her hand the power of goldonis shadow world where governors police chiefs justices congressmen would all do her bidding he saw now how goldoni had outsmarted them all the feds and his enemies he had given up vital information to witsec yes had rolled over on those around him beneath him so that they would believe he was helping them dismantle his empire but he had given the feds nothing of himself or how he ran his domain in the end he had not even retired to the soft life they had created for him in marine on st croix and as for the leonfortes his enemies their sights were set on tony d a false target if he were being truthful and he believed tonight was a time for ultimate truths he was both frightened and elated by margarites intelligence he had never met anyone like her had further never even imagined anyone like her could exist perhaps this was a failing in him he wasnt sure but certainly his being with her had the profound effect on him of a close encounter of the third kind margarite was as alien and as marvelous to his way of life as if she were an extraterrestrial she emerged from the bathroom wrapped in a towel she appeared to have no inhibitions you know my soul she had said when she had undressed in front of him why should hide my body from you then she had laughed tony insisted we turn out the lights when we made love perhaps that bastard tony d was only being practical croaker thought not caring to see the aftermath of his brutal handiwork weals and black bruises in scattered constellations over her flesh looking at her now croaker thought he could love this woman in a way he had loved neither gelda nor alix but immediately he was suspicious of the emotion it was all too easy for men to confuse love with lust at the outset of an affair to convince themselves they felt something in their heart when the stirring occurred quite a bit lower it was said that men coveted beauty in their mates and women power how many men had croaker come upon in his time in homicide who were intimidated by women with power there was an almost instinctual reflex mechanism at work he had always been interested in the fact that he had never felt it true power in a woman was so rare so precious he found it an aphrodisiac this too could explain the feeling welling up in him night and margarite why are you looking at me that way her eyes luminous in the steamy glow from the bathroom light appeared so innocent of guile or subterfuge that for a moment croaker could almost believe that their conversations of today had never occurred that she was just a battered housewife beautiful desirable lonely who needed refuge and protection everything would be so simple then all his decisions made for him without the shadow and light of a far more complex reality he cleared his throat began to walk past her toward the bathroom i need a shower he said thickly she reached out put her arms around him and he could smell the delicate scents of soap and freshly scrubbed skin its too soon she said to take a shower she lifted one shoulder and the towel unwound itself from around her body he could feel her dampness through his shirt you smell like an animal she whispered as she drew his head down her lips blossomed under his soft and passionate her tiny tongue curling against his teeth he thought he should say no thrust her away from him now at this moment the only moment it would still be possible but instead he circled her in his arms she let out a throaty moan and her legs drew up her bare ankles crossing and locking over his buttocks the bed seemed far away and suddenly superfluous her breasts flattened against him and the heat broke from her in waves their lips parted for a moment and he said tony i dont want tony margarite breathed her hands busy at his belt i want you he had the presence of mind to know he must be gentle with her no matter how passionate she became he understood the importance of that as he knew eerily that robert had been with her robert who had mutilated and murdered her brother who had given her back her own life she kicked with her heels and his trousers slid to the floor she tore at the buttons of his shirt his arms ached from holding her as the blood and strength began to pool in the area below his waist he picked her off him placed her on the floor knelt over her for a long moment he stared into her huge liquid eyes witness to her true nakedness her desire for him her need for robert her rapture at being on the threshold of her empire all wrapped up into one shifting pattern so complex and numinous that all at once hefelt himself drowning there it was too much to contemplate the transcendent become immanent and he sought to lose himself in the heavy pulse of his blood he lowered his head to her breasts light from the bathroom picked out the peaks of her leaving dark and mysterious the soft curves and sweeping dells there was a scent rising from her he inhaled it like incense as he licked her hard dark nipples as he circled her navel slid his lips down the center of the slight curve of her belly she groaned deeply gripping the sides of his head her fingers stroking and caressing him as his tongue slipped into her her legs drew up involuntarily her thighs splayed wide he could hear her ragged breathing and this more than anything fired him it was the only sound in the room rhythmic deeply erotic almost a sobbing torn from the very core of her being oh god oh god oh god a chanting in the darkness as her head whipped back and forth as her muscles tensed as she lifted her pelvis up toward his lips and tongue then jerking in erratic motions her legs locked around his back trying to draw him closer to have so much of him inside her when the spasms when they came were so intense that the entire lower half of her body arched up off the floor her sex expanded like a flower her sweat mingling with other more intimate fluids and then in the aftermath her panting ragged and muffled by one arm thrown across her face then as he knelt there he heard her slither around she knelt in front of him her heavy breasts hanging so delectably he reached out to cup them she put her hand over his biomechanical one she kissed him deeply then licked her own fluids off his face her head lowered her mouth at work on his nipples then lower and lower nibbling teasing until the incredible liquid warmth engulfed him but almost immediately he drew her away as gently as he could aware as he was of her bruises and what they represented he could not bear to see her in that position bent over him submissive he wanted other things for her and for himself he lay on his back drew her over him until he felt another kind of wetness engulf him she arched her back breasts thrust upward riding him a bit awkward at first but increasingly ecstatic in this unfamiliar position the feel of her on him as he was in her was indescribable he held her breasts staring up into her face drinking her in the light across one cheek firing the planes of her face making her appear both more and less than she did in the full flood of sunlight turning her into an embodiment of the secrets she held so vigilantly inside her the air rushed out of her and she took his hands from her breasts spread his arms wide on the floor as she pressed her torso against him as if holding him down as her hips rose and fell on him her fingers twjned with polycarbonate graphite and titanium her eyes were wide her face very close to his he licked her and she whispered with a kind of awe creeping into her voice im going to come again i cant its her eyes closed her fingers caressed his neck little noises in the back of her throat as she worked over him please she gasped please he could hold himself back no longer didnt want to any more but abandoned himself to his own pleasure his buttocks clenching all his strength gathered in one spot then released like a pentup stream rushing over descending rapids they crawled onto the bed slept in sticky exhaustion twined one around the other no beginning no ending one wan daylight the color of an old oyster shell opened their eyes my detective margarite smiled kissed him tenderly they unwrapped themselves slowly as if reluctant to shed the aura that like night and shadow had protected them from the vicissitudes and hard decisions of real life in the shower together margarite said ive been telling myself that last night was just a fling a hunger made irresistible by frustration and gratitude is that what you believe no she said washing the soap from her body but i wish i did it would make the future so much simpler she was about to step out when he took her in his arms turned her to face him his fleshandblood hand covered a large black and blue mark on her thigh she looked at the back of her hand for a moment before taking his biomechanical hand between hers pressing it against her breasts they had nothing to dress in but their old clothes the buttons of croakers shirt were scattered over the floor testament that last nights passion had not been a dream there must be somewhere in town we can buy jeans and shirts margarite said croaker watched her draw on her clothes youre never going home again are you she looked at him how could i the old margarite is dead i guess the only problem is tony doesnt know that and youll never be able to convince him that its the truth dont worry about tony margarite said as she stuck first one foot then the other into her shoes i dont think either of us has a choice right now he said a couple of his wise guys have spent the night across the street margarite clacked across the floor to peer out the window the black taurus to the left of the chicken and seafood place yeah she said theres a lincoln town car with it now she turned to him if youre ready lets go outside a chill wet breeze from the water swept across their backs stirred margarites stilldamp hair as they set off across the deserted street the front doors of the taurus opened and the two wise guys croaker had seen last night emerged he was pleased to see that their clothes were as rumpled as his and they werent half as relaxed the one who had bought the coffee and sandwiches went to the lincoln opened the rear door out popped tony decamillo he stood legs slightly spread shooting his cuffs eyeing them as they headed in his direction croaker had a weird almost suprareal sense of being in the middle of a western shootout the climax to a wild and woolly tale of hatred and revenge when they were halfway across the street the two wise guys made a move but tony d turned put his hands flat on their chests said something to them under his breath they halted contented themselves with glaring at croaker their hands hanging loosely at their sides he expected they blamed him for their long uncomfortable night on the far side of the street margarite turned to him and as he suspected her husband had done with his men said stay here let me handle this alone with tony it was not so much bravery that motivated her margarite thought as she and tony came together but an innate sense of practicality she knew that the worst thing she could have done was to have them all meet tony with his wise guys she with croaker then the situation would be defined in male terms would degenerate into a macho thing and violence would almost inevitably follow she would not allow that babe tony said his dark eyes sliding from her face to stare at croaker you spend the night with this jamoke why would it matter to you jesus h christ because youre my fuckin wife is why i not because were married the difference said it all about their relationship then look at me margarite said sharply not him his eyes flicked to her i got problems that have to be solved well solve them you walked out on me you stashed the kid francine she almost lost it then raising her voice so that croaker and the wise guys could hear our daughters name is francine yeah yeah his lips pursed til find out where you stashed her you think i wont margarite could only wonder at the changes at work inside herself the force of his familiar intimidation now only served to harden her resolve oh i have no doubt of it she said but by then ill have moved her and ill do it again and again she shook her head no matter what you think now tony youll never get her and dyou know something the harder you try the more shell hate you and then youll have lost everything there was a small silence in the interval she could hear his breathing and she wondered briefly how high his blood pressure had shot up behind her she could hear intermittent traffic start up and closer the sharp scrape as croaker shifted uneasily from one foot to another tony leaned in so his face was very close to hers he was wearing too much cologne and hadnt shaved she was glad to see evidence of the haste with which he had made the trip here when he spoke again his tone was lower more conciliatory this was the soft tony you know youre acting nuts babe i dont know what to make of it but youre making me look bad in front of the boys what with recent events and rumors of the leonfortes making a move i got to tell you morale is kinda on a slide i need you back home babe you belong at my side the only one whos acting here is you tony margarite said macho tony tender tony youve shot your load now youre finished thats all you ever had it took me all this time to face up to the fact its not nearly enough for me now its time for you to face up to reality he squinted at her not knowing what to make of this curious creature cut the bullshit he said menacingly what it boils down to is you dont need me as an enemy oh tony i dont want us to be enemies but we can never go back to the way it used to be thats the only thing i want and ill move heaven and earth to make sure it turns out that way now he sounded like a petulant child im not going to divorce you so dont worry about that margarite said at least for now theres one compelling reason not to leave you because we need each other its what dominic counted on you being the mask for me without your male facade i cant work effectively continuing doms work without me youre without doms contacts six months from now at the outside the family will abandon you and youll be a pariah the hell i will she said nothing knowing that he needed time to digest the truth find a way to make it palatable to save face ah shit he said at last the truth is ive already had trouble with certain factions of la famiglia the infantes the dellarcos im used to overcoming corporate infighting to save a clients ass this is a whole other ball game these fuckin greaseballs they both laughed the first time they had done so in a very long time yeah margarite said these fucking greaseballs can be a handful and a half when they get out of line maybe we do need each other but his dark eyes were wary you coming home now not yet she said theres still some business to be settled with him he gestured toward croaker with his chin hes part of it well shit babe i dont know i ran a check got all the skinny on him your friends pot a fed i know he told me hes an excop nypd out of homicide hes even a little famous in the annals of the city christ almighty babe i hope you know what youre doing margarite felt the double flip of her heartbeat so do i this is the kind of jamoke your brother always warned me about he reached out was about to touch her then apparently thought better of it his hands hung loosely at his sides i want you to be very careful with this man dont worry how can i help it something about you with this lawman makes my hackles rise you know what i mean like the time i just knew warner brothers was going to screw eddie mentor on that sevenfigure contract i saved eddies milplus but here he shook his head i dont know i can take care of myself yeah youve made that clear margarite wanted to say thank you but it wasnt time yet there was too much hurt he had made her bear with a certain pang she recognized that perhaps sadly for him the time might never come about the families she said the infantes have a son joey whos been sneaking around seeing kate the dellarcos youngest daughter theyre in love talk to them broker the marriage holy mother tony said the two capi will kill each other if they dont murder me first the marriage will be the best thing for everyone margarite said youll see the childrens love will heal the rift within six weeks the two families will be the best of friends she looked at him its what dom would have done she was about to turn away when he said what about the kid she looked at him for a very long time leave it alone tony francies ill shes bulimic and we you and i did it to her what weve done to each other did not happen in a vacuum our little psychodrama had the gravest consequences for francie shes suffering from radiation burns from that fallout my best guess is she needs a vacation from both of us yeah well he put his head down shit margarite nodded that about sums it up croaker watched her walk away from her husband she did not look back but tony d stared after her until a moment before she rejoined him then he turned on his heel barked a sharp command and slid back into the dark comfort of the lincoln town car engines started up croaker cleared his throat howd it go it went margarite said thats all i can say she seemed tired drained of the bravado that had put a bounce in her step on her way to meet tony lets get some breakfast he said guiding her down the street by the time we finish whites drugs and department store over there is bound to be open she nodded wordlessly croaker studying her found himself wondering what effect tony had had on her he remembered the odd moment when they had laughed together so incongruous he was dismayed to realize he was anxious to know what had allowed them that kind of intimacy again he longed to ask her but he knew he could not and her silence all through breakfast warned him that she was not going to tell him they arrived in washington on the pm shuttle as promised lillehammer met them at the airport he looked freshly scrubbed as if hed just bounced in from his health club and very dapper in a coalblack suit and crisp white shirt he had on a tie with a bullseye pattern good flight he asked his piercing blue eyes already on margarite an interesting couple of days croaker replied this is margarite goldoni decamillo charmed lillehammer said he introduced himself a terrible shame about your brother i understand margarite said a blot on your record not at all lillehammer did not miss a beat all of us in government who knew dominic came to admire him for doing what he did stepping forward naming names putting his life on the line that took real courage and as a former soldier i personally respected him it was an interesting speech even a good one croaker thought but he did not believe it had fooled margarite well thank you she said sweetly the pleasantries over lillehammer guided them through the crowded terminal out onto the pavement where a large sedan with government plates was waiting for them its engine idling from its deep throaty pitch and the unmistakable sound the doors made when they slammed home croaker knew the car had been bulletproofed i cant pretend to understand how difficult it is for you to agree to this meeting mrs decamillo lillehammer said apparently sincerely but my colleague here feels that you are our single best lead to finding the man who murdered your brother and believe me we are very anxious to do that why i beg your pardon lillehammer shifted in the seat i asked why mr lillehammer margarite looked at him candidly why is it so important that you find dominics killer can it be merely a matter of pride a kind of how shall i put it altruism toward a man you came to admire and respect even while you were crucifying him croaker expended a great deal of energy keeping the anile off his face but lillehammer had gone red jesus christ pardon me maam he said struggling to contain himself but your brother controlled all the construction produce and meat packing private sanitation gambling prostitution and god knows what else on the eastern seaboard the mayor of new york couldnt take a crap pardon my french without getting an okay from dominic goldoni so i dont really believe righteousness is the proper attitude for you to take with us at the risk of offending you your brother died for his sins we didnt have anything to do with it croaker said nothing watched margarite bite her lip before putting one hand up over her face the car came to a halt and they climbed out they were in washington but croaker had no idea where lillehammer led them into the side entrance of a monumental granite and limestone building one of so many throughout the city their sheer number had the curious effect of making these imposing grandiose structures humdrum he offered up a plasticcoated id card obtained from the uniformed guard temporary cards for each of his guests no one else accompanied them in the elevator that took them from the echoing marble lobby to an anonymous fluorescentlit room along a nondescript hallway somewhere the sound came as of beetles chewing wood computer operators clicking nails against keyboards but no one was in evidence the cubicle contained one metal table six straightbacked chairs a watercooler a stack of ruled pads a clutch of pencils and a small window that looked out on a sooty lightless airshaft marvelous margarite said looking at croaker not lillehammer its almost like being in jail she went over to the table discovered there a mass of blackandwhite prints of the murder scene dominic goldoni and his sometime mistress ginnie morris not a pretty sight is it lillehammer said but ive had to pore over these untilmy eyes hurt jesus thought croaker but he knew what lillehammer was up to he wanted margarite to get another jolt of what had been perpetrated just in case her proximity to the feds had begun to change her mind about cooperating margarite seemed not to have heard she was staring at the evidence as her hands mechanically sifted through each photo croaker saw her pick up one of ginnie morris these were photos he hadnt let her see before where that weird ladder pattern of cuts overlayed by the bloody white magpie feather was the focus of the photographers lens she stood very still for so long it began to worry lillehammer he went to the watercooler filled a paper cup set it on the table beside her perhaps it will be easier if we all sit down he said when they were seated he drew over a notepad and pencil then went on my colleague has filled me in on the gist of what occurred just before the murders but id like to hear the details directly from you he pulled out a pocket cassette recorder do you have any objection to my taping your statement margarite shook her head would you mind stating that for the record she did then began to recite her encounter with the man she knew as robert it was very cut and dried without any of the deep emotion she displayed when she had told croaker what had happened to him her voice like her actions had an eerie monotonal quality as if she were not quite there lillehammer engrossed in the bizarre events leading up to the murders apparently failed to notice anything amiss but then he did not know margarite as croaker now did when she was finished lillehammer glanced at a few notes he had jotted down asked a string of questions all of which margarite answered in the same tone of voice when lillehammer was satisfied he said im now going to ask you to do something extraordinarily difficult in all probability it will be quite dangerous as well but from what little weve been able to glean on our own and from what youve told us here im convinced as is my colleague that the only way to catch this exceedingly clever murderer is if we use you for bait wait a minute croaker said before margarite had a chance to answer i never agreed to any such insane idea uhm lillehammer appeared to give this outburst due consideration but thats not the impression i got from your telephone call he tapped the recorder at his elbow i taped the conversation shall i play it back for the lady whatever i may have implied then isnt relevant now croaker said putting an innocent in certain harms way seems to me totally unacceptable lillehammer looked at him quizzically are you telling me you never used this tactic when you were with the nypd croaker risked a quick glance in margarites direction her eyes were lowered as she stared at the mass of carnage lillehammer had left out for her to see the grisly remnants of her brother and his mistress he could well imagine the war of emotions going on inside her repulsion for what robert was capable of attraction to what he represented to her new life he did not envy her i cant say i never used another human being as bait he said at length but i always felt uneasy about it and i always did it with me and only me as sentinel i imagine i should translate for the lady lillehammer said a sentinel is the professional who backs up the bait sees she comes to no harm while the trap snaps shut on the quarry still margarite seemed oblivious to his words lillehammer looked at croaker youll admit it is a strategy that has a high percentage of success when the circumstances were dire enough croaker said grudgingly when our backs were to the wall he did not care for the position that lillehammer was putting him in lillehammer spread his hands well mortal risk croaker said hotly thats what were talking about stop it margarites voice loud and shrill left them both in astonished silence stop it the two of you she looked from one to the other youre talking about me as if i werent here as il i were a commodity to be negotiated over she stood up abruptly i need some fresh air lew i understand croaker said the two men stood your further involvement should not have been brought up no mr lillehammer has made a good point croaker was stunned youre not seriously considering may do it i told you im sure robert wont hurt me she said but if it happens itll be my decision not yours or the feds fair enough lillehammer said thats all i can ask of you he gave croaker a quick nod as he pulled open the door for them he smiled the scars at the corners of his mouth standing out like graffiti thank you for taking the time mrs decamillo in the doorway she turned smiling sweetly back at him by the way mr lillehammer you were wrong about what you said before you and the others like you had everything to do with my brothers death if it werent for racist cops there never would have been a need for dominic goldoni if it werent for cops eager to be bought dominic goldoni never would have flourished if it werent for cops looking to make a name for themselves he never would have died how and when he did when the alarm in nangis ear sounded its shrill warning he was fast asleep he opened his eyes into the dead of night he stirred fumbling for his cane he had fallen asleep on the upholstered chair in his livingroom as he stood the sheaf of papers he had been reading fanned out onto the carpet at his feet he bent down ignoring the pain in his leg facts and figures on avalon ltd were arrayed in neat columns pie graphs and fiscal summaries on the surface none of it amounted to much it had taken a great deal of legwork and favors exchanged just to get this much avalon ltd as a privately held company was not obliged to make public any of its business he shuffled the papers together and leaning on the dragons head of his cane stood up he put the papers aside went into the front hall and grabbed his tweed overcoat outside in the car he switched on the defroster watched the rime slowly disappear from his windshield he had not bothered to wake his driver the whine in his ear changed pitch and he pulled out of his driveway the pitch changed again and he picked up speed guided by the miniature receiving device in his ear not that the information he had received was in all ways useless he reflected as he made a turn into one of tokyos wide nighttime boulevards if avalon ltd did a lot of business it nevertheless generated no profit what business could long afford that kind of balance sheet unless it was a shell corporation set up essentially to funnel capital from one source to another pink and silver neon lights lapped at the sides of his car lacquered the faces of those pedestrians still about tourists mainly peering into windows filled with futuristic electronic gadgets and antique kimonos seeking to drink in as much of the bewildering metropolis as they could in as short a time as possible what use had they for sleep nangi thought for a long time as he drove given the premise that avalon ltd was not what it purported to be the most burning question was not what avalon ltd actually was but why he was being directed to it the mysterious man who had claimed to be vincent tinhs brother when he had come to collect tinhs corpse had given avalon ltd as his company why why not give a totally fictitious corporation where any enquiry would lead to a certain dead end thats certainly what nangi would have done in the mans place why hadnt he faces of teenage models and platinumhaired pop stars stories high animatedly sold soft drinks or cosmetics their presence gigantic and extortionate broke apart reality put it back together in a whole new way the pitch in his ear changed yet again and nangi turned off the boulevard into a string of streets that became increasingly narrower darker meaner garbage littered the alleyways and yellow dogs conspicuous by their overly prominent ribs stalked the intimidating shadows in search of offal someone wanted nangi to link avalon ltd to tinhs death to point him in a certain direction was it the right direction or a false lead meant to obscure the true circumstances of tinhs murder nangi his window rolled down could smell the sumida river a bouquet of salt and decay as of a neighborhood long past its prime too long buried in the earth anonymous concrete houses thrown up and torn down within a week were giving way to blankwalled warehouses somber reptiles slumbering beneath a horned moon the bizarre machinery of heavy construction crews squatted like sullen beasts in the temporary shelters provided by the ferrous bones of beams and girders too many questions without answers nangi thought and i only have one path uncertain at best into this riddle the alarm in his ear was fairly shrieking now and he slowed to a crawl long before he had dowsed his headlights using streetlights and then what ambient glow emanated from the city itself to guide him through a gap in the buildings he saw the sumida moonlight defining its puckered skin dancing on the wavelets set up by a barge like strings plucked on a koto then he was past the gap and that shimmering view was lost in darkness and the stench of putrefaction the alarm in his ear was a dull shriek and he rolled the car to a stop further down the block he saw an older cars lights go out it was parked in front of what strangely appeared to be a private dwelling wedged between two huge warehouses as he watched in silence and shadow seiko got out of the car hurried up the stairs and rapped quickly on the door it was opened almost immediately by an old woman dressed in traditional kimono her dark hair was up elaborately coifed set with long pins with a quick furtive glance around seiko passed across the threshold and the door closed behind her nangi pulled the miniature receiver out of his ear and opening the carved dragons head of his cane dropped it into the hollowedout interior the other half of it the transmitter was lodged in one of the filigreed tines etched into the silver pillbox nangi had given seiko in the car on the way back to the office from justines funeral what had made him suspicious of her it would have been unјhristian of him to doubt her motives simply because she had spent so much time in vietnam had had a torrid affair with a vietnamese equities trader just as it would have been unchristian for nangi to have succumbed to the japanese bias against the other socalled lesser asian cultures which in more bellicose days the japanese had sought to subjugate the truth was this sort of prejudice ran deep within the japanese psyche adherents and critics alike saw this bias as cultural but nangi suspected it was more an imperative of being a resourcepoor island nation whose inhabitants were terrified of relying for their continued existence on and therefore under the thumb of societies on the asian continent it pained nangi to think that he might harbor unchristian attitudes even while he understood that these errors affirmed his humanity in any event he had run a check on seikos exlover and had pulled from the deep several intriguing nuggets of information for instance the man was suspected of running a highly complex scam on the hang seng the hong kong stock exchange that made his clients tens of millions of dollars and lined his own pockets with a tidy percentage of the profits these clients on further investigation turned out to be a nexus of holding companies which nangi knew from his own contacts to be owned by the yakuza on another occasion this vietnamese had made a killing for clients in several japanese ministries on a curiously rapid and unexplained downdraft in a favored real estate stock seiko might have been perfectly innocent unaware of what her lover was up to but nangi could not help but wonder whether she was ignorant as well of what kind of man he was it was his experience that women were more astute judges of character than men ever gave them credit for being even considering that she might have been momentarily blinded by love he could not countenance for long the idea that such an obviously whipsmart person could be deaf dumb and blind and while he was perfectly willing to give seiko the benefit of the doubt especially for the benefit of nicholas he knew deep down that he had put her on a kind of probation at the end of which he might be forced to act the homing transmitter had been that act plucking his suspicion out of the theoretical amber into which he had temporarily consigned it even so he might have been obliged to shelve his distrust forever had she not overstepped her hand the work she was doing for the company was unarguably firstrate and her expertise in vietnam and saigon in particular was proving invaluable but then she had homed in on nicholas perhaps she could not help herself she was nangi had observed a highly sexed young woman but this insensitivity to justine and to nicholas himself for that matter spoke of a certain dark current in her personality also the ulterior circumstances again aroused his suspicions nicholas was her key into sato international the vietnamese expansion was strictly his idea and she knew that with the illuminating lens of hindsight nangi could appreciate just how astute a woman she was she had sensed nicholass troubles at home and she had quite willfully played upon that imprinting herself more and more strongly on his psyche and when nicholas was gone how smoothly she had segued herself into nangis life far from hating her he found himself filled with admiration far too rarely one found an extraordinary machiavellian mind like seikos the question was what to do with her now that she stood naked before him should he banish her or take her like a serpent to his breast dont lie to me lew margarite said dont tell me you havent been thinking about the possibility of using me to trap robert since i told you what happened thinking about something this risky and acting on it are two separate things he said she nodded thats right but risk is your stock in trade isnt it there was no use in denying it and he kept his mouth shut they were sitting at a table in terrazza an italian restaurant on king street in the old town section of alexandria the governmentissue car had taken them to a nearby hotel where lillehammer had arranged rooms for them the driver said he was at their disposal during their stay in washington but margarite was understandably uncomfortable with the arrangement and croaker had dismissed him margarite had wanted to eat italian food and the hotels concierge had recommended terrazza they had taken a cab to alexandria croaker sitting across the small table from her smiled now whats so funny i dont know he said tearing off a piece of crusty bread i was just thinking how much i admired the way you ended the interview with lillehammer before we can go on before i can make any kind of commitment to put my life in your hands ive got to know where your allegiance lies do you owe it to him the waiter came up perhaps to take their order and croaker glanced down at his menu but margarite waved the young man away she apparently did not want any distractions lew youd better think this through im working for him croaker said hes counting on me to break this case margarites gaze would not let him go let me tell you something the feds allowed dom to keep running the organization through tony from inside witsec that was part of the deal from the getgo her eyebrows arched do i have your attention now good these feds are more corrupt more venal than any of the municipal law enforcement people dom dealt with thats because these bastards are closer to power real power thats what this city is all about theres a pleasant thought croaker said people like lillehammer are different lew they wield enough power to make every dirty trick stick youve already seen a bit of what hes capable of but i wonder whether you understand the levels of his psychological games that jailhouse room of his i know he took us there just to give me the willies to show me who holds the power dom warned me about people who play convoluted psych games and now im warning you ive no doubt your brother was right on target croaker said it was astonishing to him how much influence a dead man still exerted on their lives he was just beginning to appreciate dominic goldoni and regret that he had never had the chance to meet him i know something about lillehammer and can surmise a bit more he said he was a pow in vietnam did you see the scars around his mouth he told me something about how he got them he was tortured who knows how long he was under pressure and what the circumstances of his escape were he shook his head it seems to me men like that have no easy road ahead something has been broken inside them perhaps its not what the enemy wants lillehammer claims he never gave them what they wanted but under that kind of pressure you emerge changed men ive known who have been in similar circumstances seem to have lost some basic ability of judgement croaker tore off more bread then his appetite gone did not know what to do with it so he twisted it into a design with his titanium and polycarbonate fingers maybe its simplistic to say that commitment becomes complicity but nevertheless it seems true the victim inadvertently falls into the trap of protecting the time his psyche was under siege until everything else becomes distorted in order to preserve the fiction he has constructed of that time in effect he and his torturers have become allies because they caused the fiction in the first place its clear hes desperate to track down robert margarite said robert got to dom through me but how did robert know that dom would call me and precisely when inside job lillehammer told me he couldnt trust his own people that because dominic was murdered he suspected a leak somewhere in the fed system croaker squeezed his eyes shut but since that first time lillehammers made no mention of the supposed leak his eyes flew open what if he knows robert margarite was already shaking her head it doesnt make sense if he knows robert of course hed go after him himself hed know roberts habits where he liked to hang out who he hung out with itd be a snap to find him not if he hadnt seen robert in a long time croaker said like not since vietnam what you told me robert looked oriental not japanese or chinese but like a mixture copper skin part polynesian almost you could be describing a vietnamese croaker nodded yes he said slowly it would make some kind of twisted sense he tapped his finger on the table who tortured lillehammer the viet cong i assume so could robert have been one of them if so being the good soldier that he is hed know the risk of going after robert himself if robert caught one glimpse of him hed bolt down a hole so deep lillehammer would never find him but robert doesnt know me from adam an excop homicide detective proven to the feds id be perfect for the job margarite seemed to be holding herself tightly in check i dont like this man lillehammer now he could feel the tension coming off her in waves this isnt just about lillehammer he said no its about something i saw up in that jailhouse room of his she shudflered you hadnt shown me any pictures of what robert did to ginnie so i had no idea i didnt see the need she nodded i understand but now that ive seen them i know theres someone here in washington we have to see someone who knows about those wounds robert inflicted on her she looked at him her eyes bleak you see lew ginnies death was part of an ancient ritual i dont know much about it but i know someone who does and i think once she tells you what she knows well be so close to robert well feel his breath on our faces davis munch pentagon special investigator on loan to senator ranee banes committee didnt look anything like gaunt had described him to manny mannheim if i dont come to collect this in twentyfour hours gaunt had told manny late in the afternoon when he had returned to mannys pawnshop before setting out for lillehammers home i want you to take this envelope to a man named davis munch hes to get them to nicholas linnear at my company in tokyo shit manny had said already frightened for his friend can do that for you harl assuming it needs to get done which i dont believe it will listen manny gaunt had said munch is dia a pentagon spook troubleshooter hell know what to do i cant take the risk of this stuff going through the mail or being opened by anyone but nicholas or failing that tanzan nangi promise me you wont do anything stupid youll take it straight to munch hell find a way an official courier to get it to tokyo if anything happens to you promise me manny manny had promised which was what he was doing here in the middle of the night on a rainswept washington street keeping his face out of the flashing red lights on top of the halfdozen squad cars blocking off an area of the street a siren sounded approaching very quickly and as manny watched from the shadows an ambulance was waved through the police roadblock came screeching to a halt beside the body so much blood manny deep in his lined mackinaw shivered good christ he thought what was harl mixed up in he had phoned davis munch at home using the number gaunt had given him left a message on the answering machine maybe he shouldnt have done that maybe someone had munchs phone bugged but who munch was with dia the pentagon spooks who would bug one of them for christs sake manny shook his head as he watched the paramedics at work even at this distance he could tell that their presence was useless munch was dead shot through the head with a highpowered rifle manny squeezed his eyes shut gaunt had cautioned manny not to leave his own number even if he spoke to munch in person in his message manny had decided to use the number of the pay phone in the bar downstairs from his apartment he had eaten dinner there then ordering beer after beer had waited for the phone to ring mention the golden gloves boxer to him gaunt had said hell know who youre talking about gaunt had been right after dinner munch had gotten back to him no names had been exchanged munch had agreed to meet manny near the fbi headquarters on th street at the site of the former lone star beef house the feds had been compelled to take over the place a topless bar no less back in the seventies after confiscating it from a particularly enterprising member of the department of transportation who had acquired it with as they say igg illgotten gains embezzled from his employers what kind of bullet could make the back of a head explode like a melon hitting the ground manny wondered as he watched the paramedics get out the body bag while a bunch of spooks in suits took photos of munch from every conceivable angle a couple of them got down on their knees in the rain to snap the closeups manny felt the contents of his stomach coming up into his throat again and he gulped sucking in damp air rain anything not to vomit he closed his eyes again but he could not blot out the sight of munchs brains spewing out behind him ten feet or more hed still been in the shadows when the impact of the bullet had slammed munch against the buildings facade still been across the street there had been a building fire between the bar and the rendezvous point and the cab had been bogged down in traffic blocked off streets and clogged detours in the end manny had hopped out early half run the last leg he had still been fifteen minutes late the spooks finished with their iconography signed for the paramedics and soon munch was cocooned inside the glistening body bag safer there manny thought than on the streets this night that fire had saved his life he turned away with the departure of munch his reason for being here had slipped away or had it beneath his mackinaw he clutched the envelope tighter against his chest hurrying home he stayed just long enough to pack an overnight bag take a wad of hundreds from beneath the floorboards of his bedroom what was he forgetting his passport he went on a frantic fifteenminute search the sweat pouring off him before he dug it up it was still in the inside pouch of the cheap vinyl flight bag the tour company had provided for his trip last year to israel he stuffed some personal items into the bag then got out of mere after what had happened to davis munch he wasnt comfortable in his apartment or truth to tell anywhere in washington spending the night at washington international airport watching his reflection in the darkened plate glass of closed trinket shops calmed his overwrought nerves but not by much margarite and croaker arrived precisely at midnight the house more like a georgianstyle mansion was perched like a magnificently plumaged crow on the crest of a hill one of many in this emeraldgreen countryside rolling down the window croaker inhaled the rich scents of horses and hay this was potomac maryland the middle of hunt country he leaned forward peeled off a fiftydollar bill handed it to the cab driver youll wait for us he said yes sir the cabby nodded no problem at all he crossed his arms over his chest and slouching in the seat was soon fast asleep croaker could see six or seven cars parked in the driveway by the side of the house jaguars rolls large bmw sedans if there were chauffeurs they had not been left to fend for themselves in the autumnal chill whose house is this he said margarite continued to stare into the cloudless night a horned moon pale as butter rode in the sky like a spectral ship or a catafalque she stirred but did not move weighed down by the morbid thoughts that invariably assailed her when she returned here margarite shhh she whispered dont speak dont move otherwise i will have to think about what comes next perhaps its inevitable like one second coming after another but for this moment let me dream of us together alone in the night croaker smelled her and the horses surprisingly he had no trouble imagining her with their musky muscular odor clinging to her thighs as she popped a booted foot out of a stirrup swung off a smooth leather saddle he thought he heard in the night small ghostly sounds the creak of leather the jingle of metal against metal the soft snort of the beast then he blinked and only the sounds of the cabbys heavy rhythmical breathing the slow tempered tick of the engine cooling came to him i used to ride here margarite whispered through dry lips when i was younger he looked at her concentrating as if in the endgame of a chess match and he wondered by what hallucinatory process he had been given an auditory glimpse of another time another world margarite leaned forward slumped against the door as if exhausted or acquiescing to the dreadful before she opened it got out following her croaker heard the crunch of her heels on the crystalcut gravel white as milk beneath the moonlight the mansion was built of pinkishbrown brick the windows were neatly bracketed by shutters the color of clotted cream and the imposing front entrance was surmounted by a stainedglass fanlight that must have been at least a century old behind them the sweeping driveway was lined by sheared cherry trees and closer to the main house itself spearlike magnolia and crescentlimbed hemlocks rose toward the slate roof the brick steps up to the entrance were set between beds of annuals now bare the black soil streaked with compost the color of straw a thin penetrating wind blew through the layers of darkgreen dwarf hinoki cypresses which ascended with them as they mounted the steps as he walked he scanned the environment he had been careful when they had left the restaurant in alexandria remembering that the concierge at their hotel had recommended it and therefore knew where they were going margarite apparently of the same mind had insisted that they walk some distance from the restaurant and then not take the first cab that cruised by the directions she gave the cab driver were exceedingly circuitous she did not want anyone to know where they were going in front of the carved wooden door margarite turned to him said i want you to understand something lew im not responsible here for anything this place is something more than private property he stared at her trying to fathom the strange transformation she had undergone from the moment she had seen the photos of ginnie morris spread out on lillehammers mean government table she touched him gently on the wrist tried to smile then used the brass knocker in a moment the door opened and a beautiful woman dressed in black wool trousers a cream silk blouse and an embroidered spanish cropwaisted black jacket stood before them the outfit which would not have looked out of place on a runway model one quarter this womans age accentuated her slim longwaisted figure margarite thank god youve come the womans smile metallic as the ticking of the cabs engine outside caused croaker to give her a harder look lines crinkled her face at the comers of eyes and mouth along her upper lip and he could see the years weighing on her not heavily as they might in many other women perhaps because of the indefatigable spark in her cerulean eyes but lurking nonetheless by this smile alone croaker knew she was a dangerous woman and now he could scent like the discharge from a pistol the fear and reluctance that marked margarites decision to return here come in darling the woman said closing the door behind them she embraced margarite kissing her on both cheeks in the european fashion its so good to see you nothings been the same it seems since dom died despite my best efforts to pull strings even with the senior senator from minnesota who owes me a raft of favors ive come up against a stone wall in trying to find out what happened to dom i think we can help each other on that score margarite said tightly darling thats the best news ive had in weeks renata said trust you to know the score dom always held you in the highest regard as she held margarite at arms length she frowned and croaker could see more lines appear like writing in invisible ink materializing under the influence of an infrared bulb but my dear youve come with a stranger where is anthony margarite turned to him and he could clearly see the struggle in her eyes pain and halfheard heartache swirled like dark colors muddying an artists best work lew croaker she said id like you to meet my stepmother renata loti renata smiled sweetly extending an astonishingly firm hand which gripped croakers strongly do come in my daughter is being uncommonly kind she said ive been known by many names in my day renata loti is the one washington knows and it serves me well but in times past i was known as faith goldoni you know that name dont you mr croaker this is dominic goldonis mother croaker thought stunned good god she did not invite them to take off their coats but turned immediately led them down a long pearwoodpaneled hallway croaker noticed her slight limp she made no mention of it and he could see by the way she moved that she did not consider it a handicap on the contrary she had adapted herself to it so that her stride appeared if not quite natural then at least uniquely hers they passed double doors behind which the sounds of a sedate party discreetly emanated the main house is alive with guests tonight she said knowing my daughter im certain we could use some privacy they entered the sweetsmelling pantry then went through a vast tile and stainlesssteel kitchen redolent of fresh sage olive oil and red wine a young chef in white apron and toque de cuisinier gave them hardly any notice as he worked on a pear tart renata took a furlined black vinyl slicker off a wooden peg draped it over her shoulders the rear door gave out onto a tiny herb garden and to the left a wood and brick loggia down which renata loti led them thick wisteria and woody grapevines protected them from the chill of the clear november night the yeasty scents of the kitchen were soon supplanted by the sharp heady reek of horses hay and manure renata reached out turned on a light opened a wide door into the stables horses snorted and stamped and croaker was reminded of the hallucinatory moment in the cab as if he had been eavesdropping on margarites memories huge dewybrown equine eyes regarded them with agitation and distrust there were several high whinnies as the horses adapted to the new scents he scanned the interior as he always did taking in details odd he said theres a gun in here renata looked at the revolver in its old scarred leather holster hung on the far wall its a colt she said i keep it in perfect condition i bought it when i put in these stables just a couple of miles from here id seen a horse with a broken leg suffering for over an hour while someone tried to find a gun some humane way of putting it out of its misery when i decided to ride horses i vowed id never let any of mine suffer that way croaker studied her for some time putting in sync the information shed just provided with the elegant physical presence of the woman frankly youve taken me completely by surprise he said after a moment oh i was under the impression i think the feds are too that faith goldoni died some time ago i saw a xerox of the death certificate myself in the file i was given on the goldonis i dont doubt it a bit renata said i did die some years ago at least faith goldoni did then renata loti was born and moved here within shouting distance of capitol hill where she could do the most good she leaned against a horse stall unraveling a piece of tack with her expert fingers hers was a body that apparently had never experi enced arthritis of course taking different identities is nothing new for me i served in the us army during world war h under the name of faith sawhill croaker was shaking his head assuming all of this is true why are you letting me in on it if even the feds i work with dont know who you are why risk telling me first youre not a fed renata lot said second i know who you are her piercing blue eyes slid from croaker to margarite third my daughter brought you here she made a curious sound in the back of her throat that made the horses ears prick up why she doesnt even do that with her husband apparently margarite had had enough of this because she pulled out a thick folded piece of paper as she handed it to renata croaker saw that it was a photo wrapping her fingers around it renata looked into her stepdaughters eyes as if already alerted to the extraordinary nature of their visit ginnie morris margarite said woodenly her body was found in the same house with doms there was a vertical crescent carved into her forehead dear god renata loti breathed no wonder you came she was no longer leaning nonchalantly against the stall but was gripping the folded photo with fingers made white with tension i suppose you know who ginnie morris is croaker said suspecting the answer but needing it confirmed i dont believe my son had any secrets from me renata said with a voice that made plain the burden of sharing another life in all ways he was an exceptional man her eyes flickered to croakers whatever opinion to the contrary you have already formed he was a man for whom the word fidelity should in all cases be capitalized as to his sexual peccadillos he couldnt help himself she gave a small crescent smile who among us can croaker watching her in the manner in which he had been trained to study potential suspects felt a peculiar chill go through him as if it might be possible that she knew that he and margarite had made love theres more margarite said softly than just the mark carved on her as renata unfolded the photo she studied the thoroughly unpleasant sight of a womans torso slit with seven evenly spaced horizontal wounds tucked into the lowest and seventh slash was the feather of the rare white magpie does something in that photo look familiar to you croaker asked renata had not taken her eyes from the photo croaker tried to read her but her expression did not change the horses shook their heads in the increasingly restless atmosphere perhaps they smelled a storm coming the soul ladder renata said at last pardon me croaker said leaning forward to hear her this is part of a ritual of a people known as the messulethe renata said psychomagicians older even than the chinese civilization some say they were cycladians roamers of the seas descendants of the titans others she shrugged and pointed to the photo you see there are seven cuts in the tore of the messulethe there is a belief that the human soul must pass through seven levels in life and in the afterlife the messulethe priest often creates this soul ladder in for instance very ill people by making seven incisions along the torso in order to help the soul to continue its journey she licked her lips the only sign she had made that she was in any way distressed in times of extreme hardship like drought when it is believed that the cosmic order is impaired an animal is often sacrificed this way so that the balance can be restored so its some kind of ritual what voodoo renatas lips curled into a sardonic smile it is ngohmeihyuht she said flatly thats a phrase in an obscure chinese dialect which means literally the crescent moon but of course that is not its meaning here it is almost synonymous with another word gim which is a kind of twoedged sword the gim is the symbol of the messulethe priest the vertical crescent dark with woad croaker listening with mounting fascination said how on earth do you know about these people renata shrugged when one lives in venice mr croaker when one exists for so long suspended between the sea and the land in a lagoon of mist and magic one feels compelled to explore the beginning of things especially when one is not by birth venetian and is reminded of that fact every day of ones life she was not looking at margarite but croaker had the feeling it was to her stepdaughter she was directing her reply one might say that i am by nature acquisitive an acquirer of knowledge her eyes had turned dark also i explored the myths of these beginnings through my late husband margarites father he was venetian through him through margarites mother and so through her flowed the blood of the cycladians or so they maintained she shrugged somehow managing to impart hidden meaning to even this most nondescript of gestures i may say that many ancient cultures claimed to have been the founders of venice even the last scholarly remnants of the trojans fleeing before the wrath of the brothers menelaus and agamemnon and their achaean armada croaker fascinated though he was kept margarite in the corner of his vision he noted as renata spoke that she turned her face more and more into shadow it was as if these two had a long history of psychological conflict pitting the force of one personality against the other was this why margarite found it so difficult to return here i dont expect you to have heard of them renata continued but in the highlands of north vietnam and southern china live hilltribes called collectively the nungs these nungs practice ngohmeihyuht the way of the messulethe they are not headhunters or cannibals per se but it is their conviction that in the unbroken bones of man and animal alike resides the essence of the soul from which transcendental enlightenment energy and wisdom may be reconstituted by the proper rituals and prayers renata had a way of speaking that could make the most fantastic tale sound credible not that croaker believed for a moment that she would be giving this particular account to many people the nung priests believe that ngohmeihyuht is the one true path to nirvana others have seen in their lore an ancient path to power that can be implemented in the modern world her head swung away for a moment and it appeared to croaker as if she stared through the walls of the stable to another place another time like this man who killed dominic and ginnie renata nodded id appreciate it if youd give me some details he said for instance what meaning does the white magpie feather have so you have done some research she shifted as if abruptly uncomfortable the stallion next to her stamped and whinnied as if scenting with its primitive brain the intimations of evil should i tell you about the feather she asked rhetorically i suppose once having begun i am obligated to finish this she turned her head in croakers direction and he could feel the heat in her eyes what is margarite thinking croaker wondered watching shadows like spiderwebs steal across her cheeks she must have known she brought me here shed known the moment she saw the seven wounds the feather of the white magpie perhaps its inevitable like one second coming after another she had whispered in the moment before they had come inside in ngohmeihyuht renata said the white magpie holds a singular status you must understand that in every culture of the world flight is one of the greatest of shamanic powers the bird is a symbol not only of flight but of the transformation of man into god croaker considered this a moment his experiences with nicholas had prepared him to believe in the fantastic he knew first hand that another rarely glimpsed and often misunderstood reality existed beyond the facade of the ordinary besides he could sense like a navigator intuiting currents a confluence in what she was saying and the highly disturbing aura at the murder scene this curious form cf double vision like that associated with a migraine occurred in him when the previously unexplainable suddenly acquired both context and meaning how does this transformation relate to ginnie morris he asked it doesnt renata said it is how shall i put it a signature a signature yes renata nodded the white magpie is significant because of the practitioner not the sacrificial victim croaker took a step forward his heart thudding heavily in his chest you mean that this feather can tell you who committed the murder precisely renata said the nung priests are known to take animal familiars upon their initiation i would think none of them these days take the white magpie she turned away worried her lip with her small white teeth if you know who murdered your son you must tell me renata passed fingers over her forehead as if brushing away wisps of hair among the nungs the white magpie is a bird of exceptional power it is a bird through which god speaks to the priests it is divine the one who uses its feathers the silence seemed to roll over them like a newly tarred road sticky with portent croaker began to say something thought better of it as he glanced at margarite she was silent eyes half closed as if against a bright light that was in danger of blinding her renata took a deep breath seemed to be gathering herself as i have said the white magpie is a bird of singular power but taking it as ones familiar is almost invariably catastrophic quite simply it invites destruction by the gods her nostrils flared briefly as if she inhaled a new scent in nung history those who sought the voice of god through it were driven mad he finished for her there it came again that curious crescent smile no the result of the transgression was not madness it is something far worse renata said she half turned so that the stallion could see her as well as scent her put her hand upon its withers stroking rhythmically what could be worse than madness croaker wondered out loud listen to me there is a logic to this renata said continuing to focus her attention on the horse as if by the motion of her hand on the animals withers she could manufacture tranquility out of foreboding and dread those who wish to be divine are slowly skinned alive layer by layer stripped of their humanity their ability to feel emotion to be affected by the world around them slowly they slip into a shadow world where though they are able to affect the world around them they are unable themselves to be touched by it in any way they are like the walking dead she looked at him somberly here we have the origins of zombies vampires and the rest of mankinds names for the undead renatas eyes were like colored jewels through which croaker imagined he could glimpse the dangerous shadow play of another world this is not an ordinary person wha committed these murders she hesitated but a moment he will not be tracked down by ordinary methods i need to do more than track him down croaker said i have to stop him that may be impbssible i cant accept that a sardonic smile curled renatas lips you have not met this person you and margarite and i we live on the flesh of animals on the grains of the earth this one is different i assure you he gains his sustenance from more ephemeral sources but he is mortal renata did not answer him at once at length she said if you put a bullet in his brain or a knife in his heart he will die in that sense yes he is mortal but he is also messulethe and if you do not kill him at once you will be in mortal peril you mean he will be able to function wounded better than i could what i mean for you to do is to remember what i have told you about the white magpie and its powers renata momentarily dropped her eyes to the photo of the soul ladder then she looked up cocked her head you dont seem skeptical croaker shook his head im not thinking of nicholas he added i have a friend who has a similar kind of control over his body now he was aware that renata was studying him with keen interest she had ceased to stroke the horse what is this mans name croaker asked he goes by many names renata said let me see in this country he has used donald true and robert ashuko robert croaker thought glancing at margarite but her head was bowed darkened by a veil of hair and shadow renata stirred his vietnamese mother named him do duc he took a japanese surname fujiru when he fled saigon after murdering his employer a french arms dealer who more or less raised him god alone knows his true surname his father was an unknown entity it may be only wishful thinking on do ducs part that he was indeed japanese croaker took some time to absorb all this may i ask how you know as much as you do about this man he was a friend of michael leonfortes in vietnam the two of them along with a man named rock got into some very nasty business over there she held up a hand please dont ask me how i have so much information on the leonfortes that is privileged information but as you have said you know who i am and you know that margarite trusts me enough to have brought me here renata nodded true enough mr croaker but on the other hand you are reporting to william justice lillehammer what of it renata brushed her hands together to get off them whatever was left by the horse she regarded him levelly i wonder how much i should trust you are you going to tell me that lillehammer has his own agenda im not privy to why should i you obviously already know i suspect as much thats not the same thing croaker said he shrugged anyway whatever lillehammers real objective im in too deep to turn around i have margarite to think of now margarite is a married woman renata said crisply you forgot the adjective happily renata did not blink i did didnt i there seemed to be a kind of curious contest of wills going on here but croaker was unable to fathom its basis what role was the older woman acting out here besides the protective mother croaker intuited he had to be careful otherwise thi invaluable interview would be prematurely terminated she needs tony d he said i wouldnt take her away from what she has to do now renata did blink and he knew he had scored an important point why dont we go outside renata said the pale moon hung in a sky clear of rain or mist the wind had picked up but they were protected within the viney shadows of the loggia beyond moonlight fell like a curtain of silver lace they stood very close together margarites destiny was sealed by my sons death renata said do duc murdered him and it was surely done on caesare leonfortes order but there is a reason caesare chose do duc he didnt merely want dominic dead he wanted what was in dominics mind now margarite turned into the moonlight and croaker could see that she had been silently weeping her agony stabbed him through the heart are you saying dominic was tortured before he was killed renata nodded slowly her gaze on margarite there can be little doubt the question is how successful was my son in holding out against do duc croaker said you know this man better than we do you whatever robert wanted to get out of dom you can be sure he got it the words seemed forced out of margarites mouth renata had gone quite white and croaker could see that she was holding on to her equilibrium with a good deal of effort at length she gathered herself sufficiently to say you met him yes croaker found it interesting that margarite did not elaborate and renata did not ask her to after a long time when only the horses stamping in the stable seemed capable of movement or even breath renata turned her head toward croaker if this is the case then we must assume the worst mr croaker you must get to tokyo as quickly as you can why whats so urgent he looked from the enigmatic face of one woman to the closed face of the other dominics source of information is in tokyo renata nodded woodenly again he thought of nicholas as he had ever since he saw the evidence of the eerie ritual of dominic goldonis murder surely nicholas would be able to help him now that he would be going to tokyo his heart leapt at the thought of seeing his friend again id better report all of this to lillehammer i think that would be most unwise renata said flatly hes unlikely to have your openmindedness and understanding true but in any case ill need a passport funds and backup without lillehammers support in a country as foreign as japan ill be dead in the water i can provide everything you need renata said so breathlessly croaker at once understood how critical this change in his status must be to her in addition i can protect you from him who do duc with what youve already given me i think i can take care of myself renata was shaking her head i was speaking of will lillehammer she produced a rolled up copy of that days washington post from beneath her jacket handed it to him computer giant exec found shot to death the headline read and just beneath the banner was a photo of harley gaunt nicholass numberone man in the states according to a highly placed government source unnamed in the story which croaker read with mounting dread gaunt nicholas and satotomkin itself were about to go under the spotlight of senator ranee banes committee also according to the story gaunt had decided to cooperate with the committee apparently its star witnesss murder had blown the lid off the entire investigation nicholas linnear had been subpoenaed from tokyo in order to answer serious but as yet undefined allegations of misconduct but had refused to comply now gaunt a man presumably with inside knowledge of all of satotomkin dealings and ready to spill it all to the committee was dead the inference made by yet more unnamed highranking government sources was clear linnear from his sinecure in evil japan was suspected of ordering gaunt silenced he looked up at her saw the moonlight glinting in her eyes what could he read there a surreptitious intimation of satisfaction an absence of grace renata took a deep breath said the night before mr gaunt was murdered he came to me i gave him certain information on a man incriminating evidence the man was will lillehammer but i for the first time she faltered a crack forming in her demeanor i never dreamed the result would be gaunts death you had this incriminating evidence and didnt use it yourself why not i felt i was helping mr gaunt he appeared ill with desperation and i seemed to be the cure there was a momentary pause during which croaker monitored her physical signs like a cardiologist observing a patient in icu tell me what was gaunt doing coming to you i was recommended to him renata said you know how it works in this town your contacts are everything and god help you if youre stupid or naive enough to confuse them with friends i told mr gaunt that lillehammer worked clandestinely for senator banes committee this seemed just the lead mr gaunt was looking for i armed him if you were arming him you should have given him a howitzer he looked at her as if she were a cobra just popped out of a wicker basket with your arsenal you should have gone after will lillehammer yourself if it was just lillehammer i was after i promise you i would have renata said but my enmity goes far deeper than that so you used gaunt to stop it margarite had come between them before renata could reply she stared at croaker i didnt bring you here to rip at each other and in a quiet voice so only he could hear we all have our private motives lew dont we her amber eyes were lambent in the skittish moonlight listen to me she breathed even detectives are not immune to emotion youd do well to listen to her renata said she is alight with the wisdom of her forebears she smiled almost shyly and croaker thought he could see her as she must have been when she was a stunning young woman of twenty she touched his arm said so softly even the trees spoke more loudly here is the last secret my son left with me the identity of the man who was his strength his source of intelligence she leaned in closer put her lips against croakers ear even margarite doesnt know i promised dominic i would never repeat what he told me in confidence but now events dictate that i speak his name in order to save his life nishiki is mikio okami the kaisho the head of all oyabun of the japanese yakuza fifteen tokyo washington when do duc slipped the siliconpolycarbonate mask over his head he felt as if flesh and blood skin and bones had been fitted over a face composed of smoke and dreams he felt in a word safe i want he said to himself to feel feeling was after all what ao the nung shaman had taken from him during the long arduous initiation ceremony in the mountains of vietnam not that the young do duc had been aware of it at the time but even if he had been would he have objected considering the glittering new world ao was offering him it did not matter this question essentially metaphysical in nature would never have occurred to that young do duc feeling was after all what he tried so assiduously to suck out of his victims most recently the late ginnie morris and margarite goldoni decamillo but even he had to admit in a fever of reckoning that margarite had been different he could not kill her could not because he did not want to for the first time do duc had understood an essential truth of nature although for the moment he understood it in this most particular of cases as it pertained only to margarite that to kill another human being was in some mysterious way to diminish the nature of ones own soul often in the days since he had let her go he had felt her dose to him her soft skin the heady perfume of the flesh beneath her arms the backs of her knees the coral folds between her thighs at first he was able to convince himself that this connection existed because of what he had taken from her in stealth without her knowing secreting it inside him as an oyster enfolds its growing pearl and like a pearl the luster of what he had extracted from her sustained his fantasy of what had happened between them as it contained the panic slippery as an eel riding just below the level of consciousness neither wild beasts nor necromancy frightened him but the growing realization of his connection with margarite certainly did for one thing he was no longer alone in the universe for another his thoughts of her were often so intense that he forgot everything else these existential aspects of reality were wholly foreign to him as absurd and terrifying as the magic he possessed was to others his hands came up making minute adjustments in the fit of the mask the adhesive a compound of his own manufacture had the effect of bonding the polymers to his skin with such perfection that he could touch the skin of the mask and feel it as his own this was as it should be what good was a mask unless it changed you he stuck his tongue out seeing it in the mirror he licked his lips or the masks lips in any case nicholas linnears tips he would get the information his masters wanted from linnear and then he could do with his captive whatever he wished what a stroke of luck to come upon a tautau adeptl the moment do duc had discovered linnears true nature he had trembled inside with the thought of breaching the unknown of taking a path even ancient ao had shunned do duc would call upon his familiar the sacred white magpie and with its help open the forbidden sixth gate he would shed his own doomed soul and don linnears sucking it right out of him leaving behind only a driedhusk with do ducs face in this way he could annihilate his own history but his thoughts of triumph were shortlived as margarites ghostly presence reasserted itself he fell to his knees ah buddha help me he whispered through lips that were not his own what should he do all of his power his magic was useless in banishing the memory of her but it was more than memory he had been struck down by an engine of unknown design his need for her transcended lust or desire this notion alone baffled and enraged him his infuriating sense of shattered apartness had been replaced by something far more horrifying a growing intuition that without her he could no longer pull breath into his lungs it was time to quit the mirror he pulled himself to his feet summoned up all his energy to banish the iridescent vapor of margarite twining itself about his soul and moved on wooden legs to the metal cage he had constructed within the robotics factory as soon as he had unlocked the door and stepped inside his mind became filled with the tendrils of nicholas linnears dreaming brain do duc switched on the halogen spotlights and directing them against nicholass face slapped him hard on one cheek then the other no wonder he was dreaming on and off do duc thought the amount of toxin he had pricked him with in paris had been enough to bring down a team of water buffalo but with the power of nicholass mind do duc had felt he had no choice in this case overmedication was far better than the opposite he placed his fingertips on nicholass forehead and cheeks checking the fit it was truly amazing what computers could do these days a series of photos extrapolated into a holographic image that threedimensional icon reduced to a complex formula of zeros and ones fed into a computer whose software metamorphosed that formula into a virtual reality replica of the real thing which was then formed into a mask extruded from the brain of the computer just as he supposed athena had emerged fullblown from the head of zeus the fit was perfect the bonding agent setting up nicely there were pores hair follicles blemishes melanin discolorations the works the feel and texture was so lifelike even a lover wouldnt be sure it wasnt skin as long as the seal was not broken you could swim in this thing take a shower or make love it made no difference nicholass eyes were fluttering open beginning to focus and do duc arranged the mirror behind him so that his captive could see his own face just as nicholass dark eyes settled on him do duc felt a disorienting bout of vertigo and he dug his fingers into his captives biceps in order to keep himself from again falling to his knees all he could smell in his nostrils was margarite as if she were a horse into whose winter coat he had buried his face consumed by a vision of her he gritted his teeth exerting the mental discipline ao had taught him and bound her intrusive image to a tree in the forest of his mind if someone had plunged a blade into his chest at this moment he would be in less pain than he was experiencing now he felt himself a creature who looks in a mirror only to discover that he has become a rotting corpse in an agony of horror he said in nicholass voice with nicholass face now that youve realized youre alive its time you see who you have become he shifted half a step to his left to reveal the reflection of nicholas in the computergenerated siliconpolycarbonate mask he felt the galvanic response go through nicholas just as if he had put a live wire to his testicles the spasm of the muscles in the grip of his hands calmed him affirmed the place he had made for himself in the universe for the moment sprayed black ink onto the magnificent face of his terror he bent his face low so it hung with the force of a god at the periphery of nicholass gaze see who youve become his whispered voice echoed like a hawks piercing cry over the treetops can you believe it yes believe it you are me and i am you he could scent like perfume the perspiration forming on nicholass skin feel his own palms slippery with it putting his ear to his victims warm ribcage he could hear the flurry of his heartbeat like a wild bird trapped against a pane of glass the sound warmed him to his bones like the first break of spring sun after a long cold winter then nicholas passed out again and do duc was alone with the robots the black ink melting like snow in sunlight off the image of margarite revealing her closer to him than he had thought possible he remembered a story his mother had told him when he was very small of a young fanner who met and fell in love with the woman of his dreams a girl of ethereal beauty an orphan from a neighboring village they were wed and lived a joyous perfect life until she contracted a winter illness and despite all the farmers frantic efforts died he buried her himself beneath a cherry tree its bare pale branches scraping a cloudswept sky so overcome with grief was the farmer that he was cer tain he would die without his love darkness came and ignoring the entreaties of his friends and family he curled up beside the newly dug grave of his wife he could not bear to leave her and he wept bitter tears through the darkest hours of the night then in that pearly hour just before dawn when the world is composed of mist and silence he heard a small stirring at the edge of the woods in a moment he saw emerging from the damp shadows a magnificent red fox the fox was so delicate so mysterious and magisterial with its coat glazed with cloud and hoarfrost that for an instant the farmer forgot his misery and ceased his weeping all at once the foxs ethereal beauty reminded him so piercingly of his dead wife that he burst into tears again the fox sat with its forepaws crossed in peculiarly human fashion and looking directly into the fanners eyes asked him why he wept the farmer brought up on stories of the magic of the foxes of this region answered him you speak of your wife as if she were love itself the fox said and so she was the farmer replied in a sigh love died with her and without love i surely cannot survive love is all around you the fox assured him but the farmer only shook his head in misery not for me then you must have your wife back the fox said so that you may learn all there is to know of love but that is impossible the farmer said the fox raised one of its forepaws as if in strange benediction sleep now the fox said dawn comes soon and with it your wife at the foxs urging the farmer put his head on his arms certain that he would not sleep but strangely the moment he closed his eyes he fell into a deep dreamless slumber he awoke with the new days sun in his eyes as it slanted through the branches of the cherry tree beneath which his wifes body was buried the farmer blinked sat up with a start his heart beating fast in his breast he was alone the fox was gone had he dreamed its appearance the fantastic dialogue hed had with it that must be it he thought as he picked himself up dusting leaves and twigs off his trousers and shirt then he felt her not beside him but in his mind his beloved wife was alive he hadnt dreamed the foxs existence it had come and worked its magic on them he felt his wifes spirit moving in his mind and he was overjoyed anticipating a kind of intimacy he could not have imagined when they were both flesh and blood how wonderful life would be with their love wrapped inside him never to be lost again but within the month the farmers family found him dead slumped over his wifes grave his bloodless fists grip ping a hunting knife he had plunged into his own belly curiously the ground over the grave was greatly disturbed by deep frenzied slashes the local police puzzled over this they agreed that it was as if the farmer had been trying to reach his wifes corpse in the last moments before he took his own life they further agreed that the farmer had been driven mad by his grief and sadly buried him beside his beloved wife before they went on to other more pressing matters in the months that followed relatives visited the graves once a week to leave small gifts and to pray but otherwise the place remained deserted except on the night of the full moon when a fox appeared from the snowy shadows ol the forest to pad about the stone markers with a grave and canny face and perhaps it was only the fox who knew the truth that the fanner had learned more about love than he had ever wanted to know loving someone was a far cry from having them steal through your thoughts and memories like a wraith in the night sharing a household was wholly unlike sharing a mind where there were no secrets no respite and never with two people sharing it any silence at all silence and the shallow sounds of robots being assembled the same ticks squeaks and hums night and day in numbing procession were do ducs only companions now why had he recalled that unspeakable story now how it had terrified him as a child each night afterward he would try but fail to sleep imagining that when he did someone he might have loved would have secreted themselves in his mind like a demon finally in desperation he would crawl into the frenchmans bed unmindful if the frenchman was sleeping alone or with a female companion the frenchman had allowed do duc to snuggle against him cradled in safety and had never said a word about it why didn t i go to my mother do duc asked himself in the amniotic glow of the robotics factory why did i go to the frenchman he stared at his own face adhering to nicholass before he could ask himself the next and final question why did i kill the one person who had offered me he turned away from his victim and grabbing blindly for the bars of the cage pressed his forehead against the metal until bright stars of pain exploded behind his eyes could he articulate the word even to himself how could he didnt the story of the farmers wife prove the ultimate danger of it didnt all the hard bloody lessons he had learned growing up prove it too love was death yes but he loved margarite there he had said it and now surely he was damned he moaned despite himself beyond him outside the cage bodies slick with oil were being formed extremities being tested and attached to sockets with ballbearing fluidity infrared eyes glared into infinity seeing beyond time and space into another reality free from pain and terror and love nicholas damn his soul to hell was unconscious wholly unaware of do ducs terror his sense of helplessness in the face of the margarite of his mind like the farmers wife her essence refused to let go despite distance or the passage of time she held on with tenacious talons inside him picking through the mire of his past peering at his sins loving him still he could not bear it he threw his head back uttered a hoarse inarticulate cry filled with pain and anguish outside the cage the steel servants were being born at intervals as regular as clockwork then he gripped nicholass shoulders tried to shake him awake when that didnt work he leaned forward bit viciously into the flesh of nicholass upper arm nicholas stirred his eyes snapped open the sapphire light arced and flickered do duc said wake up its time to die that sonuvabitch munch lillehammer said save your ire for someone who can feel it with an effort lillehammer kept himself from shivering with the air conditioning turned up full it was as cold as the arctic tundra in here lillehammer who missed the heat and humidity of southeast asia had a difficult time keeping his lips from turning blue during these interviews the red queen leaned back fn his swivel chair shot the barrel cuffs of his turnbull asser orangeandbluestriped shirt so that they extended a halfinch beyond the sleeves of his cashmere blazer i havent pulled a trigger on a long gun in quite some time tell me how did it feel you could see the little clouds of their breath for christs sake their images were reflected in so much stainless steel lillehammer could believe he was in the coldroom of a morgue it felt like heaven the red queen smiled i had a bet with myself i knew youd say that stainlesssteel desk chairs and lamps stainlesssteel wainscoting below walls lacquered a shiny icewhite a color which set lillehammers teeth on edge or maybe it was his own agenda eating at him like a cancer he no longer slept for more than an hour at a time the enormous strain of running an operation expressly forbidden by his superior was weighing on him should have waited what lillehammer leaned forward the red queen looked him full in the face if youd waited you could have put both of them down if id waited lillehammer said i wouldnt have gotten munch something was making him skittish thirty seconds more and he would have disappeared and you know guys like munch once they go to ground it takes a major effort to flush them this way i made sure he was neutralized i dont like loose ends the red queen said and weve got one now what the hell were the two people youre running doing at renata lotis at midnight last night how many tails did we have on them the red queen laughed just the one you assigned but he reported to me as well as to you he laughed again its not that i suddenly dont trust you you understand but i can fully appreciate how a creature like do duc fujiru can get under your skin if you think ive lost my professional detachment not yet the red queen said sharply you kept your head all through nam but that was before the zoo wasnt it his cold eyes glittered you need to run this man do duc to ground will but take my advice and now that youre getting close dont get overanxious i dont want to have to go down to our morgue and assign you to a zipper bag yes sir i want you to take a run over to renata lotis find out what your people were doing with her id better step carefully lotis got a lot of powerful friends on the hill true but shes no friend of ranee banes so shes had to pull in her horns a bit lately i must say though for a lady shes been a helluva dealmaker among the old hands in the senate shes brokered many a stalemate into compromise bills that have made everyone involved look sterling the red queen lifted a hand let it flutter to the stainlesssteel desk youll know what to do use a little diplomacy or whatever but watch out shes smart as the devil himself lillehammer nodded on the topic of davis munch he said with gaunt the committees star witness discovered dead and now munch iced senator bane has gone ballistic that could be very dangerous at this stage if he makes one of his patented public displays its going to be like the pit bull taking a shit all over our best carpet maybe i should you leave ranee to me the red queen said icily ive fed him everything hes ever used on anyone i brought him along bought elections for him established contacts for him manufactured influence made sure the good old boys on the hill made him one of their own before i set him loose on them like a rabid dog now they dont know whether to fawn or piss themselves when he walks into a room he shook his head ranee bane is my creation so you leave him strictly to me dust to dust eh will still bane could become a loose cannon why dont i waltz him out a window the red queen gave him a cool stare sometimes will i truly think that the only thing that makes you happy is a war zone he tapped a finger against the side of his nose dont worry ranee bane doesnt need the extreme prejudice of your silver hammer i built him out of fear prejudice and ignorance by those attributes he rose to power and by those will he fall i promise you but only when his usefulness to us is at an end he made a wry face we will terminate no pawn before its time eh he laughed at his own joke as lillehammer left the room outside the sealed electronic surveillanceproof room vesper sat in one of her many newly purchased winter suits this one was a highfashion number by armani in a winered chalkstripe worsted wool she must be hands down the bestwardrobed working woman in washington lillehammer thought well what else did she have to do with her time though she handled all the travel scheduling personal armament procurement monetary allocation and false document manufacture for lookingglass even though she knew where every field agent was at any given moment of the day or night lillehammer was willing to bet a years salary that she had no idea what was actually going on how could she the red queen was such a security fanatic he didnt even tell his asshole when it was time to take a shit lillehammer spent some time admiring vespers long sleek legs while she was at her computer terminal working his bonuses through the bureaucratic maze illuminated in pulsing green icons on her screen her rather odd name came from her father she had told him once who had been a great lan fleming fan vesper was the name of james bonds first love vespers cornflowerblue eyes regarded lillehammer coolly as her long corallacquered nails danced over the keyboard her thick pale blonde hair swept down over one peachcolored cheek after the hibernal bleakness of the red queens sanctum it was a relief to spend time in her office which was painted in the soft colors of the american west even better the temperature was sufficient to sustain mammalian life vespers forefinger pressed enter and she said oh hell with a slight frown i cant get the money out of accounts because their software is backlogged damned outdated system if wed been on line now with the hive project hardware i could have gotten your bonuses to you in no time bonus was the euphemism for wetwork overrides extra money lookingglass received for successful terminations the red queen taking the moral high ground defended this rather mercenary custom by pointing out that hazardous pay was a timehonored institution in many industries why not this one besides it made sure that every agent in lookingglass was strac ready in the best possible condition no problem ill wait by the way i think hes getting his period again lillehammer internally switching gears began to listen very closely the paranoia in that office was very thick this morning he was on the phone with someone named loti renata loti lillehammer asked wondering why the red queen hadnt mentioned this the antenna of suspicion was up uh huh thats the name vesper said id say it was far from a friendly conversation this was not the first time vesper had given him tips from the inner sanctum they invariably panned out earning him the respect of his enigmatic boss in fact it degenerated into a holy screaming fight i dont know what about but i did overhear something about the name douglas moon and the word blackmail thats when he went ballistic lillehammer thought he would pass out renata loti knew about him and doug good christ unconsciously he put his hand up to his cheek felt the quick heady surge of blood he jerked it away as if his own skin had burned it but how could she know hed been so terribly securityconscious even over dougs constant complaints that his elaborate preparations destroyed any sense of spontaneity their couplings would otherwise have had a homosexual affair wasbad enough for a spook the potential security compromises were endless but then there were the things he and doug did together who would understand or countenance such radical behavior save the perpetrators how had this happened and then he thought in a rage that fucking bastard doug got bored and has blown the whistle on me anyway vesper chattered on it seems clear to me he wants something done about her i dont know selfpreservation was warring with prudence inside him the heat from the fallout might be intolerable shes got friends in high places is that so i wonder what were his exact words after he slammed the phone down somewhere theres an accident waiting to happen to that woman lillehammer suddenly needed some air how are we doing with my bonus money he asked innocently vesper glanced briefly at her computer screen gave him a dazzling smile at last accounts has caught up with its backlog your checks are being printed up now a moment later the checks spewed out of a slot in her printer vesper smiled sweetly at him as she handed them over and lillehammer stumbled out into the hushed anonymous corridor beyond the immense and bizarre corner office complex nangi presented himself at the private dwelling wedged between the two huge warehouses this area near the sumida appeared wholly different in daylight laughing children played where by night the mangy vaguely menacing dogs had restlessly prowled and the incessant flurry and clamor of business perhaps hid or at least recolored the worst of the neighborhoods depressing shabbiness a young woman opened the door in response to his knock she was chunky quite plain in appearance with a thick mane of black hair she had frizzed in a voguish but unappealing style yes she said peering from around the thick door nangi bowed handed her a business cyd one of a dozen different ones he periodically had made up this kind of foray clandestine and incognito had become over the years an inherent part of his life he had discovered that one most often acquired valuable knowledge when hiding behind the mask of another anonymous identity it was astonishing really nangi thought as he waited for a response from the young woman what people would never consider telling to tanzan nangi chairman of a major keiretsu they would readily confide in a feed salesman a product engineer or a metalwork foreman someone to whom they could feel superior this morning he was seizo abe a representative of the istry purportedly doing a survey of area buildings over twenty years old it was an all too plausible story which gained him almost immediate admittance to the house he was let into a small oval foyer dominated by a central staircase and a crystal chandelier lustrous brown and a rich melon color predominated a striped marble console held a bowl with a spray of fresh flowers hothousegrown at this time of the year the young woman took his shoes led him down a cherrywoodpaneled hallway off it to the right a set of pocket doors were open beyond nangi could see a library with floortoceiling bookshelves a crystal chandelier a smaller version of the one in the foyer the young woman signed for him to enter a threadbare persian carpet lay on the floor like an exhausted memsahib to the left a pair of highbacked upholstered chairs were set facing a velvetcovered couch in the opposite half of the room a glass cabinet along one wall displayed a magnificent torso of early seventeenthcentury samurai armor it had been placed adjacent to a burlwood french secretary so that whoever sat in the chair behind the desk could nave an unobstructed view of it alone nangi looked around this was obviously the room of a scholar an orderly erudite mind that had worked out the role of each element in life i see by your card that you have changed professions nangi started hearing the soft female voice emanating from his left he turned i beg your pardon and not for the better i might add he bent forward his forehead creased in concentration he knew that voice but he was certain he hadnt heard it in quite some time well what are you waiting for the female voice said ive had tea prepared nangi limped toward the highbacked chairs and as he came round the side saw that the one nearest him was occupied by a petite but noblelooking woman with pale translucent skin planular cheekbones and black fiery almond eyes it was only because he knew her that he could say with any certainty that she was in her early seventies kisoko he said astonished despite himself you are the last person i imagined id find here often i have discovered the real world can be disarmingly like the one depicted in alice in wonderland there was the rustle of heavy brocaded silk as she moved her arm and the wide sleeve of her kimono slid against her porcelain skin pink white and coral cherry blossoms were strewn across the breast and upper sleeves of her kimono tossed by the indigo wind of the artists imagination kisoko retained every ounce of enchantment she had possessed ten years ago he was stung all over again by the longing he had felt upon first seeing her a decade ago how he had wished he had known her in the magnificence of her youth the heavylipped bowshaped mouth that maintained promises all on its own the smoldering guileless eyes the precision and economy of motion that rendered palpable grace and intelligence wereall as he remembered them but the ultimate attraction of this slightly asymmetrical face was its subtle hint of indulgence and deeper benediction nangi rolling over in bed with the morning light streaming through gauzy curtains had often imagined her as a catholic nun a secret fantasy of years past that was so forbidden it was unutterably delicious kisoko he said now his head filled with the scent of memory i have heard that mikio okami is missing do you know anything about this mystery those incandescent inky eyes looked up at him i have no news of my brother she said flatly for the moment if you will sit i will prepare the tea he sat on the chair on her left hand watched mesmerized as she made the green tea when they had both drunk their first cups she said i do not know whether my brother is alive or dead only that his enemies have made their move against him what will happen next i cannot say she put her cup aside placed her forefinger on the business card he had given the young woman pushed it across the polished ebony table toward him with her fingertip still on the card she said you have come under another name for a purpose that is surely false tell me nangisan what am i to make of this i did not know whose house this was kisoko you know my way my own name is too well known for me to obtain the truth in certain situations kisoko regarded him for some time nangi heard the stertorous ticking of an ormolu clock the creak of timbers above their heads but no sound from outside penetrated die librarys walls it was as if the world did not exist only in here between the two of them did life go on and what truth did you expect to find under the guise of seizo abe ever since he had recognized kisoko nangi was wondering what to make of seiko coming to the house of mikio okamis sister perhaps he had been wrong to suspect seiko perhaps her involvement with vietnamese of dubious repute was incidental to vincent tinhs treachery and subsequent murder in any case with their shared history he did not could not suspect kisoko of duplicity i came here this morning wondering about an employee of mine seiko ito he said at length i am ashamed to say i followed her here last night she is troubled and perhaps in trouble i wanted only to help her if i was able without letting her know she would not i fear react well if she did i see kisokos finger tapped seizo abes business card as if it possessed real weight and history nangi could see that she was turning over something difficult in her mind kisoko i want to reassure you that my concern for seiko is quite genuine kisoko nodded she has become an increasingly important member of my staff now there is an opportunity for her to be sent to saigon to take charge of my affairs there you can see why i must be absolutely certain i can count on her kisoko laughed but this is wonderful news nangisan and from my point of view the best thing for her she sighed such a sad creature but so talented she comes here because she believes she is helping me which she is but i am also helping her she has a good heart nangisan but i fear that often her heart has betrayed her so you have taken her under your wing a telephone rang somewhere in the house kisoko made no move to answer it in a moment it had ceased to ring oh nothing quite so formal kisoko said seiko would never tolerate that she shrugged i suppose she has become used to being alone to keeping her life shielded from others she smiled wanly in that she is not so different from the rest of us neh nangisan she shook her head the best i can do is to provide her with an arrangement she gives me investment strategies and i pyvide her with whatever emotional base she can tolerate kisoko gave him a small deprecating smile she has no family you see no one to turn to but me she shrugged the tradeoff i believe is a fair and useful one she cocked her head have i eased your mind nangi nodded the truth is nothing like i imagined frankly im relieved good i believe seiko will thrive beneath the responsibility saigon will be good for her then its done nangi said the doors to the library opened nangi turning saw a wideshouldered man sitting in a wheelchair his heavily muscled chest arms and shoulders were clad in a form fitting polo shirt he regarded nangi with soft brown eyes there was something unspoken perhaps a sadness that predisposed his long handsome face toward a brooding introspection the phone call is for you he said to kisoko in a deep wellmodulated voice kisoko said tanzan nangi meet my son ken ken studying nangis cane as if it were a written sentence to be parsed abruptly inclined his head son nangi cocked his head i never knew you had a child kisoko smiled and he imagined he could hear the ice melting in the kitchen freezer ken was not with me when we knew each other he was away at school i saw no reason to speak of him she was right of course his affair had been with her not with her family she rose with a rustle of silk brushed his hand with hers i must take this call i wont be long nangi and ken were left watching each other warily like sumo wrestlers before a match nangi dutifully kept his gaze away from kens nerveless legs tried to keep the pity he felt off his face its been a long time since your mother and saw each other i know nangi made a show of looking around this is a beautiful house mother inherited it ken said this with a clipped anger that took nangi aback she was lucky then he said do you think so nangi concerned by the distance between them limped across the carpet to where ken sat still as ice well i just meant something seemed to happen to kens face he peered at nangi curiously as if nangi had just changed color or sex watching nangi lean on his cane he said mother never told me does it hurt much nangi did not need more than thai cue sometimes at others its quite bearable ken seemed to think this over for quite some time you know i used to dream about you yes its true i always imagined i hated you yet curiously now that ive met you i seem to be unable to summon up that hatred i appreciate that nangi said i may have hurt your mother but i never stopped loving her perhaps thats so ken said you were the second man she was crazy about who hurt her maybe neither of you meant to he shrugged his muscles rippling karma neh nangisan my mother engendered certain responses in men they could no more help it than she could he closed his eyes shes still so beautiful they snapped open id like to show you something nangi nodded and they went out of the library past a set of back stairs ken opened a narrow modern door seemingly out of place in this house they went into a small elevator car and ken pushed a button marked the elevator came to rest and ken opened the door led him down a carpeted hallway wallpapered in a pattern of cabbage peonies large as human heads joined by arabesques of thorned vines the hall held the smell of steel and oil ken opened the door wheeled himself through nangi following found himself in a dojo a martial arts gym it was a windowless room the light spilling down from a skylight in the center of the high ceiling arrayed around the four walls from the tatami floor to perhaps hip height in an average man was the most astonishing collection of steelbladed weapons nangi had ever seen from the oversized daikatana the traditional weapon of the samurai to a series of normalsized swords katana wakizashi the long knives used among other things to commit seppuku ritual suicide antique iron warfans with tessel ated edges honed to razor sharpness manrikigusari spikeandchain weapons all manner of shuriken small pointed projectiles most often used by ninja ken sat at the edge of the tatami i think youll appreciate one of those its from the early s nangi knowing that the wheelchair could not be rolled over the tatami considered telling ken he wasnt interested but he suspected that ken would take that as a terrible loss of face ken twisted his torso without somehow moving his legs nangi watched with a combination of fascination and horror as ken dragged himself off the wheelchair arranged his inert legs on the tatami he began to crawl in a curious way using his powerful shoulders and arms nangi limped after him on stockinged feet ken reached the wall where a succession of katana hung in scabbards of lacquered leather handtooled with silver those deep brown eyes began a contemplation of his collection then he took one down slowly lovingly drew the blade out into the light the steel so finely honed that the very edge seemed invisible rippled as ken moved it seeming not a solid object at all but a river of light ardent with intent as if it were a zen koan its curious he said when i was whole i never thought twice about weapons it was only afterward that they came to mean something to me reverentially he replaced it in the scabbard handed the whole to nangi who examined it as closely as a museum curator ken clearly pleased by this scrutiny said somehow i knew you would appreciate the swordmasters art they were part artist part zen philosopher those antient masters his eye followed the flow of light over the blade like mist upon a frozen lake he lifted the point and the light rushed down toward the hilt the katana is the representation of the artist and the picture the higher self and the lower self love and will as distinct from habit and memory he cut the air with the blade as if slicing through a body the way to modify the past with the physical will of the present kens smile tender and beatific made him seem like a little boy rather than the man in his forties he must be he seemed content at last time seems to stand still here in this house he said as he took the katana back from nangi in a motion that was close to a formal rite but grasping the precious katana he frowned as if remembering a recent bad dream nangisan he said lifting his head you came here because of seiko ito yes i did ken nodded i am concerned about her she is a willful woman with i believe a selfdestructive bent nangi looking from the katana to kens handsome face said what makes you say that you know she holds herself responsible for her brothers death i had no idea its a terrible secret she must bear he was retarded and he lived with her she left him unattended in the bath while she made love with her boyfriend who had just returned from a threemonth trip to vietnam her brother slipped under the water and drowned nangi felt unaccountably hot as if seikos shame had somehow become his that was six years ago ken said and i dont believe shes been the same since how do you think shes changed ken shrugged so many ways for one thing she began to hang out with dangerous people how do you mean dangerous people no good lor her people who would do anything commit any crime in order to make money nangi stood very still listening to the blood sing in his veins is this true now ken nodded sadly i wonder whether i am betraying her by telling you this perhaps youre saving her nangi said can you give me any names kens darkbrown eyes gazed up into nangis face there is one man she has mentioned masamoto something masamoto goei nangi asked his heart almost coming to a full stop ken snapped his fingers yes thats the name do you know him goei was the team director for the chi project who had contacted him concerning the neuralnet cione as a theoretical language technician he should have been able to completely analyze the clone by now and yet nangi was still awaiting his final report now there seemed a good reason for goeis procrastination nangis eyes ached he felt a pounding headache coming on with considerable effort he pulled himself together tell me ken does your mother know anything about seikos associates ken gave an ironic smile you know mother she absorbs everything she wants to absorb as for the rest he shrugged it doesnt exist nangi nodded yes that described kisoko up to a point i think id better be getting back i expect shell be wondering where i got to he looked down at ken pitying him despite his resolution to keep that suspect emotion well buried thank you for the information he said til do what i can to help seiko ken nodded wordlessly he was staring at the katana laid across his thighs perhaps he had already forgotten that nangi was still there nangi left him there dreaming amid his useless weapons back in the library kisoko was waiting for him as dutifully as a wife ken respects you he rarely lets anyone see the dojo its his private space even i scarcely go there im sony about him oh she turned briefly away from him riddled with the teacups now cold hes adjusted well to his disability you of all people can appreciate his courage yes he waited some time but she seemed incapable of continuing he felt abruptly sorry for her taking in a stray like seiko wanting her to be something she obviously was not needing perhaps a child who was physically whole even one who was emotionally damaged there is always in the human heart the hope for transformation kisoko stood very close to him and whispered i have missed you my heart wishes she looked away for a moment ah but i must not humiliate myself again once was enough suffering kisoko she lifted an arm as if to ward him off but when his fingers gripped her shoulder he immediately felt her weight against him the consequence of his rejection of her she had wanted marriage something he could not give her she longed for marriage with all her heart but he could not imagine it with her or with anyone else he was one of those rare men who preferred the hardy silence and utter calm of a solitary existence his life was complicated enough he felt without permanently adding a female to the equation but it was times like this when he profoundly regretted the path he had chosen for himself if i hurt you he said then surely i hurt myself as well she was weeping slow silent tears running from the corners of her eyes why should i cry she whispered for you she shook her head almost immediately no not for you or for me eitherbut for love only love she had had a great hurt sometime in her youth that much he knew from fragments of their talks after making love intimations gleaned from her reactions to him and to certain intimate situations that it had forever left its wound deep inside her he had no doubt he had thought it immensely brave of her that she would again seek love after the first disaster despite all the years that had passed that he had shot an arrow into her most vulnerable spot was unforgivable but he was too much in love with her not to tell her the truth as soon as it became apparent to him but in seeking to minimize her hurt he had committed the sin of being cold cutting her dead at the time he believed a clean break to be the best course of action only later would he live to regret his decision when she would not speak to him in private and in public turned her face in the direction of others ah kisoko how i love you he said with her cheek against his but how quickly that love would have turned to bitterness and resentment had we wed in my life i cannot be beholden to anyone else for decisions her arm came up her fingernails caressing the nape of his neck how lonely it must be for you and drawing closer still for both of us if i had given in to you even what we once had would have been destroyed at least this way we were left with the memory she closed her eyes i wish you had told me this years ago yes was all he could think to say then she dropped her arm pushed herself away as if it were important to show him that she could stand on her own she dabbed at her face isnt it curious how blind one becomes when one cries she led him back down the cherrywood hallway in silence but the weight of the atmosphere when she was near him disturbed him still caught in an emotional eddy he wondered whether he was safe in a protected harbor or about to be swept into white water he was struck again by the marvelous silence of the house the security of its walls against the world outside he wondered if okami might be here then hoped not it might be too obvious a place for his enemies to look and nangi could not bear the thought of kisoko in danger he calmed himself she had always remained wholly apart from her brothers world and there seemed no good reason why the relationship should change now gradually he became aware of an ache inside him as if a muscle had ruptured or a tendon had snapped the pain almost but not quite physical made him long for scalding tea a bit of sticky rice on the end of chopsticks a magazine to read anything mundane to take his mind from the extraordinary reverberations this leavetaking was inciting in him my curiosity brought us together again he said when they had returned to the foyer i must believe there was a purpose in that kisoko turned her dreaming face up toward him do you still live in the same house yes i remember the garden in back do you still take great pleasure in pruning your shishigashira maple its a permanent passion im afraid her eyes caught his glittering there is one here i planted five years ago that is in desperate need of your attention im sorry hes not here where is he then pardon who did you say is calling please croaker lew croaker calling from the united states for nicholas linnear silence then that terribly formal voice made tinny by electronics and distance may i take your message for linnearsan i want i need to speak to him now dammit its important i can take a message please croaker put a splay of fingertips to his forehead he had promised himself he would not lose his temper but these damned japanese and their symbolic formality could drive you around the bend when you wanted to get something done asap i need he said slowly and distinctly to speak to someone who can help me one moment please he stared down at the copy of yesterdays washington post he had found lying in front of their door with the photo of harley gaunt staring out at him the late harley gaunt poor bastard croaker had never met the man but he could recall the fondness with which nicholas spoke of him he glanced at his watch what would it be just after three in the afternoon there yes mr croaker may i help you i sincerely hope so croaker said im a friend of nicholas linnears can you tell me where he is i need to speak with him its urgent im afraid i cant help you who is this my name is seiko ito i am linnearsans assistant and you cant get me through to him do you know who i am yes mr croaker i do there was a pause the truth is no one knows where he is at the moment were all very concerned croaker let go with a small sigh christ how about nangi can i speak with tanzan nangi im afraid nangisan is in a meeting he left strict orders not to be disturbed may i take your number so that never mind that croaker snapped he looked up saw margarite standing by the hotel window her torso striped by the blinds and the sodium streetlights the room was drenched with elongated triangles of light like moonlight on water please give nangi a message tell him that lew croaker is on his way to tokyo ill be there tomorrow at pm and i expect to meet with him as soon as i can get in from narita got me pardon croaker massaged his forehead just tell him all right yes i will give nangisan the message as soon as his meeting is but croaker had already cradled the receiver he rose went to where margarite stood he touched her and she shivered i can feel him she said in a reedy whisper just as if hes in the room with us she turned her head toward him so that the sodium light fired her eyes no no put your arms around me hold me close i dont know whether im hot or cold she put her head on his shoulder hes inside me lew and theres only one way im going to get him out a taxi went by hissing a couple came round a comer shoulders hunched went quickly out of the wind into the hotel entrance below them a cop car cruised past its red light flashing but its siren off particles of dust hanging in the air turned bloodred then vanished i have to see him again plane trees their branches bare as nails rose from grilled openings in the sidewalk a ghostly reminder of a summer long since past he was staring at them because apparently he couldnt bear what she was about to say im going to agree to lillehammers plan im going to offer myself up were going to become target and sentinel you and i he felt a tiny tremor in his arms i wish youd rethink this oh lew what good would it do whatever has happened cant be changed whatever the link is between robert and me cant be broken by any other means hell know youre coming he said faith said as much i cant imagine what will happen when he sees you again youll kill him my job is to take him in he could feel her head moving back and forth no youll kill him or hell kill you she turned round in his arms so that she faced him those are the only possibilities he stared down at her trying to see into her life is so much more complex than that not this not him he accepted her judgement just as he realized he accepted her ambivalence toward do duc in any case well be in japan tomorrow and well see silence and the hum of the hotels heater something perhaps only a gust of wind rattled the windowpane and be could feel her tense look quickly over her shoulder then sigh in relief or in disappointment he wondered tell me something she said why did you accept my stepmothers help isnt that what you wanted me to do tes but its important for me to know why you agreed just below the window flags cracked and furled ensigns of influence and command seeking something unexplainable in the night if youre looking for a rational answer im afraid i dont have one all i can tell you is that right now i dont trust anyone my sense all along was that lillehammer was lying to me or at the very least not telling me everything about this case as i told you i didnt believe for a minute he needed someone outside his official agencies to do the field work a man like that without people he could trust or call on in an emergency not likely and you believed my stepmother i believe what she told me yes i hear a but he smiled into the darkness it wouldnt surprise me to learn that she has her own agenda why go after do duc at all why not just walk away and forget him lillehammer and my stepmother he saw her eyes searching his and he knew they were not the eyes of a married woman whoever ruled her heart would be blessed there are so many reasons i couldnt begin to list them he said i accepted lillehammers offer knowing it wasnt what he made it out to be but as he anticipated i was bored running a charter boat out of marco island i was getting boozy and soft i needed to change that he could hear her breathing just like an animal in the jungle i was intrigued with lillehammer and dominics murder it wasnt merely that he had been killed but how it had been done i wanted to solve all the puzzles who killed your brother and why and who lillehammer was and why he was so desperate to get do duc then as youve told me this thing just got bigger and bigger like ripples in a lake a crown of thorny vines was in her hair for just a moment the triangles of light were moving as if alive but it was only headlights which now and again came and went with unknown intent like spies in utter darkness and then theres you even after what ive told you i could walk away from it all but you cant and i wont have that then i was right his smile widened yup once in a blue moon emotion finds its way through even detectives thick exteriors he felt her shift in his arms get more comfortable she put her arms around his neck sighed she rested her forehead against his chest im tired she said i never realized before how power could exhaust you its hidden in the definition croaker said as close as you two were i doubt that would be something dominic would have shared with you he was in power for a long time she said i dont know how he did it croaker knew what she really meant was she didnt know how she was going to do it maybe she wouldnt but maybe that was just wishful thinking id better call lillehammer and tell him youve agreed croaker said we dont want him getting suspicious at this late date he picked up the phone hell be delighted im sure he dialed a number heard the hollowness just before the operator answered he gave his code name and she put him on hold the connection cut in abruptly and he heard the faint click of the solenoids as the antisurveillance system kicked in and through the wavefronts of all the electronic junk he heard lillehammers voice were on he said into the mouthpiece shes agreed to go ahead with it excellent lillehammer said what do you need documents croaker told him were going to tokyo tokyo thats right thats where he is he gave lillehammer the particulars of their flight just get us on it he concluded til have everything you need messengered over to the hotel within three hours i assume thats where you are now uh huh fine croaker said and ahab we need to meet at the airport just before flight time roger he hung up the phone felt the sweat breaking out on him now its well and truly done he thought no turning back he turned to see margarite watching him in the semidarkness how many ways is he going to try to fuck us in the end she asked i hope im not going to give him the chance to try he walked across the room to her he was already feeling contaminated by the phone call he stood in front of her and she lifted her arm such a simple gesture pulled a lock of hair off his forehead tell me something he said after a time what is it between you and faith you dont know anything about her she said flatly so you have no right to ask that question dont you think the way we feel about each other gives me the right margarite looking up at him opened her mouth to say something closed it almost immediately behind her the street was entirely deserted wide windswept solemn with its looming squareshouldered buildings in commemoration of something the home of mythical beings all at once her shoulders began to shake and he thought she was weeping a stifled gasp told him he was wrong she was laughing god must be playing this joke on me for my sins she said still laughing married to a despicable sicilian who is regardless indispensable to me dutybound to carry on my brothers business behind my husbands male mask im nevertheless hopelessly in love with an excop working for the feds her laughter had a bitter edge sharp as a knifeblade what is to become of me what answer could he give what answer did he want life was so full of unclear choices and wrong turns that he wanted this moment to be different the choice unclouded the chance they were both taking correct but how could he be sure the answer was simple there was no way her arms went taut her hands behind his neck pulling his face down until his lips covered hers they were salty and now he knew that she had been weeping silently in the shadows as she had at faiths stables you want to know what is between me and my stepmother margarite whispered when she pulled her mouth from his all right ill tell you i suspect her of what of making what i am certain was in her eyes a simple business decision when my father was no longer able to conduct his business when he became a liability she killed him croaker feeling her heart thudding in her breast almost as if it were his held her gaze for some time killed in this context the word seemed obscene even though in his line of work he had used it so many times he thought he had become inured to its effect as in murdered yes have you any proof she smiled through her tears my detective ever and always i cant help it thats how i see the world one day id very much like you to get to know my stepmother there was a peculiar timbre to her voice and croaker knew she said this as a way of acknowledging his own statement then im sure i will when he held her like this he could not imagine ever leaving her but it was a fantasy whose end made breathing painful her thick hair brushed his cheek hold me tighter he did his nostrils filled with her scent and her breathing cars hissed by outside one two then the street was again gripped in a monumental silence sixteen tokyo washington there were mice running over railroad tracks nangi jay in the cramped darkness thinking seiko and goei betrayed at home and abroad lord jesus he and nicholas were done for the mice were running again and he returned his attention to the sounds coming through the thin wall of the capsule trying to make sense of them they reminded him of the sound he had heard as a child of mice running over the rails of the tracks outside his house these sounds in the darkness seemed as inexplicable as they had the first two times he had heard them like bursts of static from an oldfashioned radio the bleeps and squawks of machines in garbled conversation with one another he had spent hours following seiko all over tokyo before he came to the conclusion that she and goei were too clever or too practiced to meet face to face that was when he switched his surveillance to goei himself at dusk after his work was finished for the day goei had come here to the nakagin capsule tower in the neon jungle of the ginza the building was made up of modular capsule offices eight by thirteen feet so these modules could be transported by truck the buildings configuration changed continually as tenants came and went adding capsules to enlarge space or subtracting them to conserve it to take his mind off the enormity of seikos betrayal he went over for the thousandth time everything in the material the american manny mannheim had delivered to him this morning but thoughts of mannheim brought with them another wave of sorrow for the death of harley gaunt gaunt had been a firstrate administrator both canny and compassionate he had grasped what nicholas and nangi were involved in and had thrown himself wholeheartedly into the mysterious business of production and innovation for the future he would be sorely missed the revelations of gaunts material had been legion the most alarming of them had been that the us government and that meant senator ranee banes accursed committee had pulled a socalled chi clone out of the asian black market and had concluded that the machine was using hyrotechincs proprietary hive technology this along with the copies of the coded faxes from satos offices in tokyo to saigon meant they had concrete evidence which in their minds at least linked satotomkin to the theft of hive technology since hive was the hardware chosen by the american government for use in all its agencies even the topsecret ones that theft could be considered treason now it all became clear the hive technology which nicholas had quite rightly been eager to acquire was the sole property of hyrotechinc the american company with which nicholas had been negotiating a buyout no wonder the american government had put that merger on ice nicholas had been right about that as well the americans were out for sato internationals blood and they were going for the vulnerable spot satotomkin the american arm of the keiretsu except that nicholas nangi and sato international were innocent of wrongdoing it had been that bastard vincent tinh whom nangi had never trusted who had engineered all of this of course tinh could not have done it alone someone in headquarters had been in collusion with him to steal the breakthrough technology of the chis neuralnet computer and tinh had used his expertise contacts and most galling of all satos capital and facilities to get a prototype of the softwareless chi ramped up and manufactured someone high up in the chi project had helped him naturally the americans suspected nicholas he was in charge of chi and for many of them he was a traitor the moment he merged tomkin industries with sato international and then to make matters worse he had abandoned satotomkins new york office to move to tokyo now nangi had cause to mourn his myopic insistence that nicholas stay in tokyo to help educate the japanese corporate leaders on how american business and government ran and how to deal successfully with their american counterparts nicholas ever the seer had perhaps foreseen this moment in time and had wanted to return to the states to argue his case for japan inc and corporate america to work hand in hand but according to gaunt there were elements within the government who had their own agenda and they had been active for some time the man whom gaunt had gone to see who had it seemed clear murdered him was william justice lillehammer that name sounded oddly familiar to nangi where had he heard it before hadnt okami mentioned it once but in what regard he racked his brain but could not recall the context of the conversation an mm video gaunt had enclosed with the material lay warm next to nangis breast he had viewed it once already but was looking forward to studying it frame by frame the sounds were like bursts of energy given off in the blackness and in between the silence of offices abandoned for the night nangi adjusted himself so that his ear was more firmly against the electronic eavesdropper unconsciously he put one hand on his bad leg rubbed it to invite warmth and better circulation he smelled only plastic and the gummy dust of neglected machines he held his nose to keep himself from sneezing how ironic nangi thought nicholas the hero was feared in japan and reviled in america without him nangi wondered where sato international would be now certainly not on the cutting edge of computer and telecommunication technology that would make the keiretsu one of japans top three corporations in the s if it survived from what minister ushiba had threatened and from what nangi now knew from the explosive allegations and evidence sent over from harley gaunt nangi seriously doubted they would survive unless he discovered who was responsible for draining the chi technology vincent tinh the mastermind was dead at the hands no doubt of any one of his numerous unsavory enemies luckily nangi had found a firstrate private investigator and had hired him to go to saigon immediately and find out the extent of what tinh had been into and who had killed him the entire sato saigon complex was temporarily on hold while he struggled to find a replacement for tinh as he had told kisoko there was of course a logical replacement already in the company seiko but seiko had been working for tinh and was doing her best to destroy the keiretsu the electronic gibberish from behind the capsule wall was coming in organized bursts part of nangis brain had been working on the problem and now he began making rapid mathematical calculations as he kept his eye on the luminous dial of his wrist chronometer what did these organized eruptions most remind him of he racked his brain right it was like telemetry or coded faxes being sent off into the ether he put the flat of his hand against the eggshellthin wall and thought if i put my fist to it i will surely break through to the other side who was in the capsule on the other side of the wall not goei he had only stayed a few minutes then departed precisely seven minutes after he had left the building the mice began walking across the rails nangi took his ear from the listening device rolled away from the wall he rose with some difficulty and ignoring the pain in his leg limped out of the module he was careful to pop the lock on the way out so that when he closed the door behind him the office was once again sealed he went down the narrow corridor lit by a single tube of fluorescent light he adjusted the gloves on his hands as he stood outside the door to the office goei had entered he could feel the measured beat of his heart his accelerated pulse rate he took several deep breaths calming himself then he slid a thin metal tool with a hooked end into the lock in the center of the steel doorknob and began to probe for the interior ridges one by one he negotiated their contours his other hand on the knob itself felt the resistance disappear and he silently turned it as far as he could the door was open a crack and the telemetry or whatever it was became clearly audible in the dense silence of the corridor nangi slipped without a sound into the capsule closing the door behind him in order to keep the level of ambient light from changing as it turned out he neednt have worried there was no one in the office in fact it wasnt an office at all but a bare space with only a fax machine and a telephone on separate lines to show that it wasnt unrented leaning on his cane he lowered himself in front of the fax took the sheets of paper out of the hopper he turned them over in the light of the one black metal lamp they were blank then as he held them closer to the light he saw the sparkles of metallic thread pressed into a discernible pattern on the sheets code he folded the sheets put them in his pocket and stared at the fax machine in the semidarkness the mice had completed their run across the tracks transmission terminated the tolling of the bell was nowhere within the hivelike robotics factory electric blue arcs spilled across the interior cement stainless steel and delicate coppersheathed components cold fire which ripped aside the veils of unconsciousness still nicholas did not open his eyes instead he kept his breathing deep slow and regular as it would be if his brain was still deep in theta he listened to the tolling of the bell far off as if in another universe and amid the chaos that awaited him just beyond the paperthin perimeter of his closed eyelids he held on to that deep rhythmic sound as a drowning man will grasp for any piece of flotsam to keep himself from going down again into the ultimate stillness of the deep it was not a conscious decision but made at some primitive level at his core in the nothought of his training even at the edge of death there was this and only this the tolling of a nonexistent bell if he focused on anything else the pain would overwhelm him plunging him into an abyss of despair the figure with his face had slowly and agonizingly inserted what felt like long needles shining with liquid fire or black toxin into his flesh deep deep they went into the heart of his pain centers except that they werent real these long knives these steel talons they came from the mind of the messulethe invoking the dark side of the tautau kshira nicholas never before had longed so profoundly for koryoku the illuminating power the pathway to shuken the dominion where akshara and kshira were safely integrated in one mind it was clear that the dark side had destroyed the mind of the messulethe as the pain grew so did the irony for it became clear that what the messulethe wanted from nicholas he could not give him even had he lost all the will to resist there was a link between okami and the american mafia don dominic goldoni a secret conduit codenamed nishiki feeding intelligence and incriminating evidence on mend and foe alike to the two men somehow the messulethe had gotten the idea that nicholas was nishiki if he could have laughed he would have but death was all around him not the physical kind that was not what the messulethe planned but a kind of mental disintegration shock upon shock to the synapses of the brain until the whole turned to jelly the exchange of faces had been only the very first volley then the burning needles had been pushed home by the mind of the messulethe while nicholass psyche in shock without recognition of place or of self was pinned in darkness like a moth to paper unable to access akshara the defenses at kokoro the heart of the universe nicholass mind was mute paralyzed cut off from any possibility of escape this the messulethe had planned for most assiduously and successfully except for the tolling of the bell which rang in echoes down the screaming synapses of his mind a web glittering with endless pain if not for the tolling resonant and steady his mind would have been gone by now sanity was a sound he could identify and on the edge of an abyss beyond imagining desperately cling to he knew what the tolling was at last he was able to exert the energy that would connect one thought with another as if he were an infant learning all over again how to think and thinking integrate thought with action the veil of shock and paralysis was still firmly in place but beneath it he had managed for an instant to stir in the face of the psychic barrage he opened his tanjian eye saw the color of the tolling a clear translucent green like the hillsides of nara in springtime and he felt her near him celeste celeste with the untapped power of her mind this was the plan they had hit upon back in paris when nicholas had smelled the scent of the snare she had tried to talk him out of it had begged him in fact not to do this terrible thing walk into the center of the snare but what choice had he had could he have walked away from his oath to his father his obligation to okami another man perhaps whose terror so soaked his soul that he would forsake who he was to turn and run away this was impossible for nicholas he could not turn but only go forward through the fire that surely was waiting for him but i will not go unarmed he had told celeste just before they had made their way to montmartre you will be my secret weapon she had looked at him quizzically then understanding dawning on her with an expression of mounting dread no she had said you cant mean it my mind is untrained for the love of god am afraid of what is inside me and nicholas opening his tanjian eye enfolded her in his psyche at once calming her and showing her the way the path of akshara by which she could link herself psychically with him and maintain that contact but wont the messulethe feel this connection no he said am providing you with the pathway of akshara everything comes from me and that is all he will be aware of akshara and my efforts to stop him you with your untrained mind will become lost in the psychic mask of my defense the one danger which he did not bother to tell her was if for some reason she should lose the psychic link he was now establishing he did not know whether she would have the discipline to reestablish it in order to do that she would have to confront her fear of herself would have to sink into that fear go through it and coming out the other side see in her mind how to find his psyche again this then was the tolling in his mind the one link to sanity in the maelstrom of the messulethes snare celeste she was here somewhere in the mad universe of magic and robotics where faces were being stripped and reapplied like wrappingpaper over raw flesh he stirred once more exhausting himself in reassurance of the link between them the psychic thread that might pull him through this and so was unprepared for the blast of psychic energy that plastered him back into utter paralysis he sat slackjawed a fly in amber caged and figuratively beaten and bloodied beyond recognition for he had do ducs face and his inquisitor bending over him placed his thumbs over his eyelids gently at first then more firmly as the chanting excited the membrane at kokoro as the incantations made physical that which was moments before only a part of the transparent metaphysical world that enwrapped the reality that most men knew pressing hard now on nicholass eyeballs do duc opened another door in the sixsided gateway at kokoro it was a gate shut for long centuries forbidden even to those who came after the messulethe and had learned their dark and tragic secrets it was the sixth gate the only one sealed by spells and incantations which even zarathustra would not attempt to sunder but even zarathustra had not chosen as his familiar the white magpie the messenger of the gods the harbinger of their eventual doom and it was the white magpie upon whom do duc now called incanting the words that he had squeezed from aos mind after the nung shaman had foolishly refused to render them to him what were the warnings of an old man turned into a fearful woman by age compared to the power he would unlock at the white magpies calling and so the forbidden sixth gate was opened and do duc was bathed in the baleful radiance and fearful asymmetry which lay beyond it he took one step toward it and heard the cawing cry of the white magpie as clearly as if he were back in the mountain wilderness of his home among the nungs he could not make out what was before him until the white magpie clutching his shoulder with powerful talons spoke in his ear then he understood he saw the asymmetry for what it was yet another reality that stretched out beyond the metaphysical cocoon within which the physical world resided and now reaching out for it he used it plunging it like a sword from heaven into his victims mind nicholas pinned by the sudden blast of psychic energy intuited the outcome he had been wrong the switch of faces had not been merely for shock effect the messulethe had a far more terrifying motive in mind the pressure on his eyes became so intense that his pain receptors overloaded shut down and his whole face went numb and then he was pierced by an awful radiance and he knew what was about to happen it wasnt merely his face the messulethe wanted it was his very essence drawn out of him by this connection both physical and metaphysical that was entering him now and he would be gone in a puff of smoke leaving only a dead husk that would appear to anyone who found it to be the messulethe himself now as the radiance streamed in through the messulethes thumbs pressed hard against his eyes he summoned his last ounce of energy and opening his tanjian eye began to reel in the shining thread the lifeline celeste was providing the reserve of psychic energy he would need but then in horror and despair he stopped the tolling the puregreen translucent light had vanished final instructions this man robert lillehammer said you get him and bring him to me from japan croaker said what about the formalities there are no formalities when it comes to my people the place stank of stale cigarette smoke and fear just like an interrogation room but this was a small cubicle one of the airlines storage rooms at washington national airport that lillehammer had commandeered so i bring him back croaker said it again so there would be no mistake right lillehammer squinted the messenger get you everything you need ids passports currency in yen and dollars tickets and prepaid rooms at a tokyo hotel everything what about armament always the soldier croaker thought til take care of that myself he said raising his titanium and polycarbonate hand clicking the needlelike nails together lillehammer nodded thats it then i guess so croaker turned away then swung back as if drawn by an afterthought just one thing why didnt you tell me you knew who murdered dominic goldoni lillehammer ever the cool customer did not miss a beat who have you been talking to he said quietly the atmosphere in the cubicle was really quite vile maybe the ventilation wasnt working croaker

away in times past but from internal affairs an asshole precinct captain an overeager looie out to suck his way up the ladder das with a political axe to grind anyone and everyone who you worked with or for sure we looked out for our own but we also fucked our own six ways from sunday and let me tell you something you never forget all the very nasty ways of keeping that knife from being stuck in your back lillehammer held up his hands lets back away from the precipice shall we he looked away ah shit and swung his head back okay look i need you to find this bastard for me i didnt lie to you about that i do know him from nam he was one of three people who put me into a cage worked on me yeah did this he brushed his lips with his forefinger one of the bastards was a crazy shit of a guy named michael leonforte hed gone native in laos i was sent out by my unit to get him back but i was captured leonforte was commanding a group of nungs chinese hill tribesmen then he recruited two more a wacko named rock and his buddy do duc lillehammer brimming with the manic energy of memory began to pace back and forth rock worked on me while the others looked on asked me questions i wouldnt answer his eyes slid away from croakers you know the drill he shrugged his shoulders anyway there was no cavalry that day no one to save me they carved me nicely and neatly then wrapped me up and delivered me back to my people as a warning a fucking warning he blew his breath out hard that was a long time ago but i never forgot he stamped his feet as if he were cold then dominic gets whacked

signed on i may be your ishmael but do ducs your white whale croaker showed his teeth no i wouldnt you see i couldntake that chance croaker waited a moment thats all of it the whole bloody thing lillehammer said he glanced at his watch then pulled open the cubicle door now youll haye to do some running he said in order to make your flight the radiance came down like a veil from heaven it was like watching yourself being eaten alive every muscle in nicholass body was contracted with pain and fear the mask from the other side of time was settling over him in a moment it would begin to slice up his essence like meat upon a butchers bloody table frantically he searched for celeste the shining thread by which he might pull himself loose from the settling of death like radioactive rain penetrating skin flesh bone dissolving him from the inside out where was she what had happened the psychic link had been broken and his one fear had come to pass she was now unable to reestablish the link with him without the edge she provided he knew he was finished the radiance sinking deeper into him provided an asymmetrical pulsation which upset the natural rhythms of his body and with it as if written in his own secretions flaming runes of an incomprehensible language the hideous cadence grew stronger and as it did his own diminished tn a moment no thought would be left him no essence no life then the pressure came off he felt it lift from his eye sockets and immediately the radiance paled the flow of incomprehensible language blurred and in that moment his tanjian eye snapped open freed from the paralysis that had gripped it it shone straight through to kokoro beating upon the membrane summoning the energy that was thought and would now be action nicholas opened his bleary eyes saw the face that was his stretched in a grimace the body of the messulethe was arched backward his hands at his neck he was jammed back against the bars of the cage and as nicholas began to move he saw the glint of the stainlesssteel wire wound tightly around the messulethes neck digging deep into the flesh of his throat he moved off his chair like a dead man reanimated his arms and legs working in quick spastic motions his muscles jumping as he strove to reestablish brainmuscle coordination the synapses of his brain were still on fire but the rest of his body was free of pain the physical connection with the messulethe had been broken the man with his face gave out a cry his hands leaving the makeshift garrotte moving in a blur through the bars grasping hair and flesh celeste screamed celeste and in an instant he saw what had happened sensing what was about to take place he had taken the initiative and the physical act of going after the messulethe caused her untrained mind to break the psychic connection the messulethe had her head in his hands and he slammed her forehead into the steel bars of tin cage celeste staggered backward her grip on the shining garrotte easing and the messulethe pulled free he unwound the bloody thing from his neck threw it aside celeste was on the floor just outside the cage was she conscious or nicholas felt as if he were wading through water his thoughts came so slowly an agonizing jet of pain every time he tried to string one thought after another a wind was rising around him and the heat of a blazing furnace he was thrown backward head over heels smashing into the chair on which he had been sitting breaking it apart the side of his head hit the bars of the far side of the cage momentarily stunning him nothing was working and here came the man with his face then the tolling began deep inside him and the green pellucid light began to spread over him he opened his tanjian eye he connected with kokoro and began the basic litany of akshara taught to him by kansatsu his tautau sensei his implacable enemy but the heat was rising again the scent of whitehot cinders in his nostrils his hair crawling along his skin the tolling the translucent light his connection to celeste his secret weapon withering beneath the assault of the messulethe akshara everything kansatsu had taught him was useless the man with his face made the two strides across the cage hauled him to his feet and then in an instants flash of insight he understood he let go of the basic litany abandoned all the lessons of akshara he had so assiduously learned and instead listened only to the tolling of the inner bell unpinned bathed in the radiance emanating from his tanjian eye he broke the hold on him he struck with a quick atemi which the messulethe easily swept aside nicholas abandoning aikido dropped to the levelhorse stance smashing the outside of his forearm into the messulethes right hip the messulethe struck out in an appallingly swift kite striking nicholas a glancing blow on his shoulder struck out again this time nicholas had lowered himself far enough so that one knee was on the ground very fast now he intercepted the blow with the callused edge of his left hand and rising up swept the messulethes extended arm out and away in an unnatural arc intended to break bones the messulethe moved with astonishing speed twisting his torso into the attack so as to negate the unnatural position of his arm at the same time he delivered a vicious kite meant for nicholass kidneys nicholas in the rightangle horse position directed a snapkick to the messulethes groin both blows struck almost simultaneously and both men went down but nicholas rolled and angling his knuckles down struck the messulethe delivered a short twan chuan to the messulethes forehead his own head snapped back but he was already caught ill the viselike grip of the messulethes powerful legs kneed in the stomach he tried to twist away and caught another kite on the jaw he slumped back and the messulethe on one knee stamped at his armpit extending his arm out twisting it nicholas felt the tendons being strained beyond tolerance and his left hand scrabbled under his body his fingers dosed around a broken chair leg and he smashed it into the side of the messulethes head just above his ear the messulethe staggered his grip on nicholas broken and nicholas was up kicking him a glancing blow he fell on him knowing he had only moments in which to kill him before his superior psyche reasserted itself he used the heel of his hand in an atemi meant to splinter the nose cartilage send it directly into the brain it was invariably a lethal blow and the mind had to be absolutely centered the organism in mortal danger the resolve wholly unimpaired because once committed there was no turning back death was the only possible result nicholas was certain he had that resolve in him the conviction that this soul must be dispatched that there was no other option available that without this singular attack his risk was intolerable but the blow never landed the heel of his hand stopped perhaps a centimeter from its objective hanging in the air then the muscles of his wrist and forearm began to spasm as if he had plunged them into a bed of live coals nicholas deep in mindnomind continued to resist the messulethe with his upper body even while his left leg kicked out mindless as if in galvanic response the toe of nicholass shoe caught his enemy on the point of his hip where the flexor muscles covered an important nerve nexus for the lower body the messulethe fell and as his concentration shifted the numbing force of his psyche lifted nicholas slammed the edge of his hand into the spot between and just above the messulethes eyes a crucial point in the line of the major conception meridian the messulethes eyes crossed and nicholas could feel the almost total withdrawal of his psyche as he hovered at the point of unconsciousness still nicholas felt the squirming of his enemys powerful mind trying to break through the temporary paralysis and he knew he had only moments in which to act he threw himself headlong across the enervated form ripped the key from the messulethes belt and leaping at the doorway unlocked it a fusillade of needles scourged his mind as the messulethe recovering with appalling rapidity lashed out with his psyche trying to keep nicholas from leaving the cage nicholas stumbled fell to one knee almost in celestes up she wrapped her arm around his waist and together they loped awkwardly away from the cage celeste looked back terrified but the messulethe was still lying on the ground had nicholas killed him she hurried them on once nicholas fell heavily bringing them both down and celeste cried out blood on her palms as she skidded feeling the creeping along her nerves of not only what had been done to him but what was coming after them the heat through the vivid electric discharges billowing along the reinforced concrete floor a low mist with form and substance the lethal rhythms of the messulethe reaching out for them but with aheavy grunt she hauled him to his feet propelled him on and kept him at it with that thing so near her mind she could feel it singe her like a bright leap of flame the terror running through her but she kept him at it out across the ferroconcrete beehive of the robotics factory with its spinning blue lightning arcs its scents of hot metal and fused plastics the presence in her mind growing stronger seeking to fill her limbs with lead as they stumbled past lines of stainlesssteel heads being fitted onto blocky inhuman shoulders infraredlensed eyes stared unblinking as the running shadows struck them and were gone kept him going in this cold crucible where machines created more machines where the miracle of creation in a manner inconceivable even decades ago was occurring every minute of the day and night down the voice in her head confused her get down and nicholas struck her a swift blow behind her knees so that she went down in an instant she was aware of him of his body spread over hers and of a great heat like a concentrated beam running along the backs of her legs where they were exposed crack like a bolt of thunder and she whimpered the percussion shaking the floor and then nicholas was dragging her to her feet and as she was pulled past a section of wall she stared wideeyed at the ovoid indentation in it as if it had been struck by a gigantic fist he hauled her round the end of the wall and the light dimmed they were in a corridor and up ahead she could see a set of stainlesssteel doors which he hit full tilt using his shoulder and his momentum to slam them open they found themselves in a wide service entrance and they ran as best they could up the long ramp through another set of metal doors onto a loading platform deserted save for a heavyduty truck nicholas jerked open the door slid behind the wheel he looked under the floormat above the sun visor for keys not finding them he used a screwdriver he found on the floor to pry open the steering column watching him hotwire the truck celeste felt her stomach rebelling it was eerie seeing the face of the messulethe knowing because she was linked with it that nicholass mind lay beneath it still she had thought she would pass out the first time she saw his eyes staring at her from out of that face she had learned to fear above all others nicholas she shook him and he groaned his forehead coming up off the steering wheel his fingers resuming their work on the wiring celeste looked up shivering at the edge of her mind was that awful sensation as if some beast were snuffling obscenely through her innermost thoughts she felt the onset of the heat rushing up the ramp at them and she screamed wordlessly her terror an anodyne for her nausea the engine barked to life and nicholas slumped back in the seat near exhaustion celeste youll have to drive but ive never get behind the wheel he slid over displacing her and she settled herself her feet feeling for the pedals celeste gunned the engine just as the metal doors blew open with such force that one of them was ripped free of its hinges she pressed herself back into the seat as she banged the gears into reverse and with a squeal of tires launched the truck out of the loading bay swinging it round a whoosh behind them which celeste rigid in her seat refused to look at then she slammed the truck into first gunned the engine hitting second a little early the gears grinding in protest then kicking in as the speed came up and they were on the road wrong side nicholas shouted get over to the left an airhorn sounded so close celeste jumped as they veered crazily away from a semi coming in the opposite direction celeste cutting it way too close the wail of metal scraping against metal paint strips whipping by and the nimble heavy as an earthquake as the sides of the two trucks hit once twice and then they were past nicholas slumped beside her the truck roaring like a wounded animal as they accelerated away from the killing ground seventeen tokyo the shapes humped and bestial like the leviathan and the devil moved in grainy silhouette until they moved sufficiently into the one light an unshaded photographers lamp which threw off light with the violence of heat nangi sucked in his breath as the true nature of what the two men were doing to one another became apparent nangi part of a culture where the traditional western taboo against homosexuality was nonexistent was nevertheless shocked not by seeing the men naked together but by what they were perpetrating on one another so this was william justice lillehammer the older taller one the young blond energetic intense as a method actor with the astonishingly supple body seemed born for this kind of reckless abandonment nangi leaned forward and directing the remote at the vcr rewound the images to a certain sequence he had already watched the mm tape manny mannheim had brought from the late harley gaunt through several times and now he was taking notes the phone rang moshi nangisan i have been able to trace the phone number you gave me this was jisaku shindo the private investigator nangi had engaged and he was speaking of the number nangi had copied off the ghostly fax machine he had discovered in the capsule office masamoto goei had rented in the ginza its here in saigon all right shindo said in art office building directly across the road from your own office complex who owns it nangi asked a company thats nonexistent as it turns out nangi could hear the pi shuffling through the pages of his notebook it appears as if your own man vincent tinh paid the rent every month nangi closed his eyes for a moment nangisan theres quite a bit more im listening okay a friend of a friend of mine works in the coroners office so i got to take a look at the autopsy report on tinh he was burned in sulfuric acid all right just like van kiel told you but they also dug twentyfive bullets out of him twentyfive right from the caliber of the bullets and the pattern of the wounds id say he was on the wrong end of some kind of heavyduty machinegun a military weapon would be my guess but im following it up good christ nangi thought theres one more thing shindo said the friend of a friend was on duty when the body was picked up he claims the man was japanese he also swears he was yakuza nangis mind was reeling how could he know that little finger of the mans left hand shindo said the top joint was missing yakuza often cut a digit in such a way in order to swear allegiance to an oyabun or to atone for a committed sin to affirm their subservience good work thank you sir ive used my contacts and ive managed to get an interview with inspector van kiel tomorrow morning the idea is to find out what form of persuasion will work best on these people theyre all utterly corrupt i trust youll be successful keep me informed as always nangi broke the connection sat back on the couch in his study it was very quiet in the house something he dearly loved but now abruptly he longed for sound a radio playing rock music or a womans voice he found himself again at the same gate thoughts of kisoko curling around him like mist but there was no time for her now tomorrow lew croaker would be here with god only knew what news before then nangi knew he had much to do part of his mind chewing over what shindo had told him he began again to watch a certain section of the video in slow motion this time however he ignored the main attraction the two bodies coupling so oddly instead he watched the extreme upperright corner of the frame where his eye had caught a flicker of movement he saw it come and go and return like the shadow of a flame cast upon a wall and he switched on the digital enhancer immediately the images shot into focus all traces of fuzziness and motionsmear a consequence of shooting in the low light vanished and nangi found himself staring right into a face the face was turned slightly away from the lens of the video camera calmly observing the sexual acrobatics as if they were a tennis match nangi hit the digital freeze button stared for a long time at the face it was partly in shadow but curiously the sections of darkness helped define and reveal the features of the face the odd thing was that he recognized it and it was the trigger his memory needed to pull up okamis reference to william justice lillehammer nangi could recall the conversation as if it had occurred yesterday instead of two years ago okami had been in tokyo on one of his infrequent visits nangi remembered the place the meiji shrine it had been springtime when everything was shedding the somber colors of winter the air had been perfumed with the heady scents of budding flowers am on the edge of a great precipice okami had told him i must make a decision either to live and die as i have up until now or to make a great leap into the unknown do you need help okamisan no no curious now in retrospect how okamis agitation seemed so much more significant dont want you involved in this at all not in any material way but i seek your advice whatever i can do nangi had said there is a man with whom elements within my inner council insist i deal and there is much about him that concerns me but even though i have a profound sense of foreboding i nevertheless feel that i must take this path i know it is the wrong one nangisan but i must make this attempt to appease the other oyabun if there is to be any peace among the clans i do not want a fullscale war on my hands okami had paused to watch several children playing and daydreaming in the grass who knew what was in his mind at that moment perhaps he was thinking as nangi had been of the terrible price one paid for adulthood this man whose name is lillehammer works for someone who i believe is known to you so i thought we should meet they had moved on leaving the children to their play coming upon strolling lovers hands linked faces turned toward one another blessed by the sunlight lean waxman yes i know him nangi had said we met here in tokyo several years after the occupation began lets see perhaps it was in or in any case i met him in hospital i was doing work for the building ministry at that time i believe and there was some structural damage at the hospital i was sent out with a team of engineers to see what needed to be done waxman was an american but he was recuperating in a japanese hospital thats right nangi had said the hospital specialized in neural surgery his wounds were extensive so i assume a number of operations of that nature had to be done what kind of a man did he seem to you curious nangi said he seemed to have two personalities one canny and bright the other terribly suspicious and dark the nurses i spoke with said he was so prone to violent nightmares and night sweats they had gotten in the habit of sedating him right after dinner and after he got out of hospital you kept in touch yes for one thing he was hungry for contacts in tokyo for another he actually helped me move upward into miti how did he manage that the lovers had vanished with the sun and now the two men were in an area populated by punks in pink and green spiky mohawk hairdos black leather jackets insectoid sunglasses and black and chromium kawasaki motorcycles they sneered at the passersby and gunned their engines muscular bassheavy rock music blared apparently he wasnt without contacts already nangi said he had been in public liaison when he had been in the army so he had done plenty of interfacing with ministry personnel especially the ministry of commerce and industry which would eventually become miti he desperately wanted contacts in the business world and so we bartered favors i remember being impressed with how well he understood the japanese way so he wanted to become a businessman apparently well hes in an entirely different line of work now okami said hes the head of a spook network thats buried deep inside the american federal bureaucracy they had come to an area of the park under construction now even the punks were left behind and for the moment at least they were alone palebudded trees their rootballs wrapped in burlap and twine lay heeled over against an iron fence awaiting planting i can see how hed be drawn to that kind of life nangi said waxman always impressed me as being someone who saw designs in shadows besides even though he had a knack for it my impression was that business bored him it was too easy like shooting fish in a barrel he once told me okami said waxman s network is so deeply buried even the american congress has never heard of it that can be good or bad nangi said theres more okami said he put his hands behind his bade and frowned deep in thought waxman has risen to the top of a loosely knit group of men who call themselves lookingglass lookingglass ive never heard of them im not surprised virtually nobody has okami said these men seek power and control over their governments political and economic policies we speak here of an exceedingly dangerous man okami came to a halt stood facing nangi and nangi knew they had come to the crucial moment waxman is the end of this particular path for me okami said if he proves untrustworthy i fear that i will have to take my great leap into the unknown i have my own agenda which i will implement despite the extreme danger to me apologize for involving you in this crucial decision nangisan but there is no one else i can trust i remember waxman as being smart nangi had said that last time he had seen mikio okami before he had abruptly disappeared perhaps too smart for his own good what do you mean just this his intelligence made for a restless soul and i personally can never fully trust restless souls now as nangi stared at the digitally enhanced stillframe of the mm video he knew he was looking at the face of the man he hadnt seen in so many years observing in cool objectivity the sexual burlesque of one of his agents icon waxman tomoo kozo covered his mouth as if without that commitment he would articulate to the world his hatred for nicholas linnear kozo stood naked in front of a fulllength mirror staring at the movie of his body the prismatic irizumi told a story of loss revenge and death to kozos way of thinking the three cornerstones of honor loss revenge and death were all that concerned kozo now he stared down at the phoenix that girdled his penis with its wings its fierce head was tattooed on the helmet the phoenix grew as he did spreading its curious wings in ardor loss revenge and death defined not only honor but kozos relationship with nicholas linnear the two had never met perhaps nicholas did not even know of kozos existence but kozo knew nicholas intimately despite the lies he had told minister ushiba kozo had deliberately put the white toyota on justine unnear and her lover yes kozo had known who he was the moment he had landed at narita long before ushiba or the other oyabun of the kaishos inner council had and because of that nicholas linnears wife was dead loss katsuodo kozo tomoos father had once played a role in the rise of mikio okami but okami had outlasted him of course okami had the colonel kozo was sick to death of the japanese deification of colonel linnear even many of the oyabun held him in high esteem because of what they saw as his efforts on behalf of their clans during the early years of the occupation kozo had no doubt that the colonel was more japanese in his thinking than he was western in his opinion that was what had made the colonel such a dangerous creature it was what had killed katsuodo kozo kozo believed it was colonel linnear himself who had murdered his father who had been found floating in the sumida river with not a scratch on him but katsuodo could not swim and the colonel knew that kozo had heard them speaking one hazy summer afternoon when the sweat collected on the skin like rain in the treetops a week later katsuodos bluewhite body was fished out of the sumida and kozo had lost a father an irreparable loss it was only years later that kozo began to glean the nature and the context of the terrible incident almost from the beginning katsuodo and okami were at loggerheads over yakuza policy okami was for accommodation with the americans especially since the occupation forces often turned to the yakuza to help quell riots instigated by communist infiltrators it looked better for japanese gangsters to be banging the heads of japanese workers than it did for the american military to do it but katsuodo argued vehemently against any association with the americans he despised being used by the americans for any purpose even the supposedly virtuous eradication of the communists from japanese soil the disagreements between the two oyabun finally erupted into open warfare until katsuodos body was discovered floating in the sumida because no marks were found on him no blame could be assessed no revenge taken okami and the colonel exerted their influence order was restored but nothing could return tomoo kozos life to the way it had been and he never forgot in true japanese fashion he took okami as a mentor studied under him became a true and loyal friend consolidated his power as okami rose through the ranks and when okami became the kaisho kozo was his staunches and most vocal supporter he had stood by okamis side at the rite of ascension because of his clandestine investigation into the history surrounding katsuodos death hating him and his connection with colonel linnear all the while the colonel had died before kozo could exact his revenge that left the son but the son was a ninja powerful in his own right even the oyabun feared him and then there was the memory of the colonel a reverence that kozo could not fight so he bided his time patient as a spider whose intricate web is destroyed by wind rain and frost but who nevertheless respins it time and again revenge kozo turned away from the mirror began methodically to dress it was time to see do duc time to recall honor and mete out death nicholas pale as ash lay among the fallen maple leaves as if he were in a bed of fire celeste kneeling over him said the house your house isnt it is just a hundred yards further through the trees his eyes clouded with pain stared up at her as if she were a stranger celestes heart skipped a beat what had the messulethe done to him why had she waited so long to act but she knew the terror that had gripped her from the moment he had established their psychic link was like nothing she had ever experienced before always in her mind lurked the shadow knowledge that beyond the world she could see with her eyes hear with her ears lay another more ephemeral one with which her mind intersected in times of extreme stress or dreaming being so directly connected to it had scoured her nerves raw but look at what her terror had wrought ah nicholas she bent over him and tenderly placed her lips over his she thought she heard him moan and she jerked away afraid she had somehow hurt him they were beside a stone basin filled with water that seemed to bubble up from below the ground there was a single japanese kanji carved into the stone and across its top lay a bamboo ladle nicholas whispering in a reedy voice bade her let him drink from the ladle she scooped up the cold clear water and lifting his head put the ladle against his lips he drank slowly and noisily for some time his eyes closed as if the water defined his world he put his hand flat on the carpet of leaves sat up home he said did i direct you here you dont remember no she put her hand against his cheek nicholas how badly are you hurt i dont know he looked around this is where justine and i buried our daughter little thing so tiny and white she had no chance at life he put his head down and celeste drew him into her arms rocked him gently while he softly sobbed its all right he said after a time that was a long time ago another life really celeste closed her eyes for an instant bit her lip nicholas im afraid they stared into one anothers eyes i think at the end the messulethe understood i think he became aware of me of how i helped you it was true through the haze of pain and shock nicholas understood that he could no longer shield her in that way he had used her and now they would both pay the price it had been a desperate gamble putting his head into the jaws of the messulethes snare but in a way it had paid off from the interrogation he knew that the messulethe did not have access to okami otherwise he would have known that nicholas was not nishiki the conduit between okami and dominic goldoni that meant okami was alive and most likely in hiding nicholas he looked up into celestes eyes and suddenly he felt her psyche emerging from its shell enfolding him in warmth and light she put her hands on him at first gingerly then as her sense of her inner self grew more firmly with the physical touch her strength flowed into him more fully a floodlight illuminating shadowed depths you have the hands the mind of a healer he said through cracked lips automatically he began the silent chanting of akshara abruptly he stopped celeste said what is it she had sensed the change in him this is all so new to me have i done something wrong he shook his head no its me i was taught the pan of tautau akshara by a certain man i trusted him for many years but in the end it turned out that he was my enemy he had learned both akshara and its dark counter part kshira without koryoku the path and shuken the protection of integration the dark side had corrupted him as it has corrupted the messulethe nicholas signed for more water and she placed the ladle to his mouth he drank in silence the wet scent of leaves and rich soil perfumed the air birds flitted in the branches calling sweetly to one another this far from the winding road there were no sounds of traffic celeste did not want to think of the nightmare of navigating the truck driving highways then perilous snaking roads on the left past signs she could not read banging and shearing the gears nicholas half slumped beside her this man my sensei taught me everything i know about tautau nicholas continued when he had slaked his thirst seeing how ineffective it was against the messulethe i began to wonder and then in the cage between consciousness and unconsciousness my dreaming mind conjured up this man again and saw him i saw hint celeste deceiving me he was teaching me only those things he wanted me to know something stirred in the brush beyond the stand of bare ginkgo trees and they both turned their heads but it was only a small animal foraging for fallen nuts nicholas arranged himself so that his back was against the stone basin as if he drew strength from contact with it this man was exceedingly clever he said after a time i took his teachings at face value even after i unmasked him im now astonished that i could have been so naive he looked at her celeste i think what he taught me wasnt simply akshara i believe now it was an incomplete combination of akshara and kshira what if this dark side of tautau has begun to change me celeste smoothed his dark damp hair off his forehead kissed him gently im sure youre wrong she said reassuringly the effects of being in that cage with the messulethe cant be shrugged off so easily he knew what she was saying that the shock of the drugs and the interrogation had made him prone to paranoid delusions but she was wrong he could not shake the terrifying feeling that kansatsu had somehow sabotaged him he remembered how kansatsu had told him mat nicholas had come to see him high up on the hodaka many times though nicholas knew that moment had only occurred once time kansatsu had said is somehow akin to the ocean there are tides currents eddies which at certain nexus points overlap creating a kind of whirlpool of events that repeat like ripples until having spread sufficiently outward they are spent upon a rocky shore nicholas who had only begun to journey outside time knew better now than he had then what kansatsu was speaking of if kansatsu was able to live and relive moments in time he might easily have foreseen his own death at nicholass hands just as he would have understood the inevitability of it and accepting it as karma had gone about exacting his revenge by planting a kind of psychic timebomb inside nicholass head the question nicholas faced now was how to get it out there was a way but it was so dangerous so filled with unknown pitfalls he did not know whether he dared take ithe wondered whether he had a choice it was at that moment that the birds ceased their songs and nicholas and celeste their eyes meeting in recognitioni both knew that he was coming for them the messulethe dead im afraid so it was tragic an automobile accident jesus god justine dead lew croaker stared into tanzan nangis face he looked older his face more lined and weary than croaker had remembered it does nicholas know nangi shook his head as you have heard he has been out of touch for some time croaker sat down and margarite put a hand on his shoulder he had told her all about nicholas and justine on the flight over they were blearyeyed but not as tired as they could have been they had shared a sleepingpill margarite had found at the bottom of her cosmetics case and so had slept soundly for six hours they were in the livingroom of nicholass house outside of tokyo proper massive cedar beams crisscrossed the ceiling and the late autumnal light spilled into the large room through enormous plateglass windows thickly padded couches and oversized chairs filled the central tatami space two steps lower than the surrounding woodfloored area along the walls were ranged western artwork and brilliantly colored textiles from france and italy the house smelled of oiled wood straw and rosemary nangi felt this was the logical place to come when seiko had given him the message he had been furious that she had not interrupted his meeting but he quickly put his anger aside and did some fast thinking seiko had given him croakers message verbatim and that along with a thorough crossexamination of her had given him enough clues as to croakers tone and attitude to understand the urgency of the trip considering his own current situation as well as that of sato international he did not want anyone to know of croakers presence in tokyo that ruled out the office as well as his own residence neither did he want to take the chance of meeting them in so public a place as a hotel lobby since justines death nicholass house had remained empty save for the cleaning woman nangi had keys to the place and its remote location made it ideal he had taken his car to the airport had met croaker and his companion himself driving them directly here but not before he had gotten rid of seiko she was the only person in the office who knew of croakers arrival and he did not want her around while the meeting was taking place he had assigned her to vietnam to temporarily take over the sato saigon office he gave her jisaku shindos name but told her the private investigator was a production consultant hired to help integrate the relatively new overseas office with headquarters he instructed her to help shindo in any way she could the whole idea of providing her with so much freedom was risky but nangi was used to risk he phoned shindo told him she was on her way and that she was suspected of working against the company he knew this was the best he could do for now he had no real evidence of her perfidy except hearsay and he was not prepared to act prematurely besides she was less important than the people she reported to if she was guilty perhaps her sense of freedom in saigon would be her undoing if so shindo would be there to document her fall goei the chi project leader was another story he had damned himself with his coded fax and although nangis people were still in the process of deciphering it nangi had no doubts as to his guilt in the best of all possible worlds nangi would have preferred to keep him in place and under twentyfourhouraday surveillance but he did not have that luxury he knew that the moment he handed goei over to the authorities he would at the very feast mitigate senator banes allegations against nicholas and satotomkin and with luck destroy the case against them goei was the one who had leaked the chi project technology to vincent tinh in saigon not nicholas and because goei could now be directly linked to tinh who had proved himself a renegade ready willing and able to betray satotomkin the keiretsu would be exonerated as well so he had had goei arrested and had handed seiko her new assignment she had seemed thrilled also relieved which disturbed him he had packed her off to saigon that morning with a weekend suitcase of clothes promising to have the rest of her things sent as soon as possible she had not protested understanding better than most the emergency vincent tinhs death had created whatever misgivings he had about letting her go were soon submerged by croakers arrival and the subsequent revelations of events that had taken place in the united states nangi listened closely as croaker told him about being brought in by lillehammer to solve dominic goldonis murder his growing suspicions that lillehammer was more than he made himself out to be and the subsequent revelations that lillehammer had his own personal agenda to pursue against the vietnamese assassin do duc fujiru croaker was intrigued to learn that nangi already knew about harley gaunts death and its aftermath but he surrprised nangi when he recounted margarites relationship with her stepmother renata loti with her brother dominic and revealed the legacy he had left her of running his empire when croaker finished telling him of margarites suspicion that the war between the leonfortes and the goldonis was far more than a simple blood feud between mafia families nangi turned to margarite said you have told croaker that your brother gave you access to the secret information he held on highranking officials of government and law enforcement where did this information come from a secret source margarite said his name is nishiki abruptly restless she got up from her seat walked tensely bade and forth over the tatami did your brother ever allow you to meet this nishiki nangi asked no i my impression was that dom never met him himself he was just a voice but my stepmother knows who he is she sent us over here to protect him from do duc so croakersan has said nangi looked shrewdly at margarite goldoni decamillo wondering if she could be trusted he trusted lew croaker nicholass closest western friend but that was all he could afford to take for granted did your stepmother give you a name yes she said were supposed to see a man named mikio oka mi nangi stood very still for some time okami is the kaisho the head of all the oyabun of the yakuza he told them but his enemies have already moved against him hes missing now you tell me that you believe he himself is nishiki dominic goldonis source faith seemed certain of it margarite said but what if hes already dead that thought had crossed my mind as well nangi said until i started putting some clues together regarding the allegations against nicholas and satotomkin i have found the traitors inside the company one of them vincent tinh was murdered last week in saigon it seems he was involved in just about everything you can imagine thats illegal but who murdered him the saigon police were of no help but the curious thing is his body was claimed by a man purporting to be tinhs brother he had no family at all and this man said he worked at a company called avalon ltd ive done some checking though avalon ltd claims no kabwiedge of this man it is an exceedingly strange concern which appears to be a conduit for transferring money across international borders now i have discovered that the man who came for tinhs body was japanese and yakuza it seemed clear that i was being deliberately directed to avalon ltd all these factors lead me to one conclusion that mikio okami is alive and in hiding that he is secretly sending dues concerning his enemies to those who can best help him you see members of okamis inner council were compelling him against his will into an alliance with a man named leon waxman a man i knew in tokyo many years ago who had subsequently become a major player in the shadows of washington i think okami must have rebelled i told him i thought waxman was unreliable and so okami secretly abandoned the godaishu forming another alliance he had been secretly cultivating for years one with your brother ms goldoni dominic was murdered because of this alliance and okami has been driven into hiding but is he safe margarite asked nangi looked at her even if he is he said there is so much power arrayed against him i wonder how long he can survive eighteen washington tokyo when faith goldoni opened the door to her house lillehammer smiled and said will lillehammer mrs loti charmed to meet you at last may i come in faith staring at the working end of the pistol he was pointing at her heart said but of course as she led him past the grand foyer and into the hallway she heard him say theres no one else at home mrs loti i checked im sure you did he nudged her along the kitchen and then out the back door she could tell now without him saying anything that they were headed for the stables she knew what that meant in a way she wondered that this moment hadnt occurred some time ago it was only recently when lillehammers lover douglas moon had sold her the videotape and she had viewed it that she had recognized the man observing them as johnny leonfprte he looked very different to be sure what with the passage of time and the lopsided face but this was a man with whom she had been intimate and the moment she had seen the image she had known who he was it had been long ago but truly not far away those days in tokyo during the occupation had set the scene for everything that was to come those days were etched into her memory as if with a laser how long had johnny known who she was she did not live in the shadows as he must and although she had had some subtle plastic surgery done in los angeles while getting her tucks she was stilt faith goldoni johnny would have recognized her johnny alive at first she had found it inconceivable but she had survived against all odds why not him and he had an innate advantage over her he was a man open the door she did and smelled the pungency of the horses the manure the silage the animals turned their heads in her direction snorting dont worry lillehammer said im not going to shoot you too many questions that way she turned round her back against one of the stalls youre going to be kicked in the head by one of these he gestured at the horses faith could feel the tackle against her back moved a little to ease the pressure nobody will believe that she said im too good a horsewoman not only to ease the pressure but to get a grip with her left hand on the leather and steel theyll have to believe it lillehammer said moving closer to her and the horses because it will be the coroners findings there wont be another mark on you no sign of foul play he smiled believe me im a master at this why are you doing this she did not expect an answer she wanted merely to reinforce his sense of control heres a big stallion he gestured with the pistol open the stall door it was what faith had been waiting for she opened the stall door with her right hand while with her left she lifted the tackle off its hook flung it with a practiced flick of her wrist it acted much as a whip would the thick leather and steel slapping into the side of lillehammers face and neck drawing blood he roared staggering and kicked out catching faith on the point of her hip she screamed went down on one knee the horses terrified banged into the sides of their stalls whinnying eyes wide nostrils flaring catching whiffs of her own fear and pain bitch lillehammer shouted freeing himself from the tackle and reaching for her he was right in front of the open stall door and faith slammed her shoulder into his knees with all the force she could muster lillehammer lost his balance falling backward into the stall with the panicked stallion lillehammer struck the stallions side with such force that the horse reared up its forelegs clawing the air the beast clearly terrified out of its mind brought its hooves down squarely on lillehammer who was in the process of rising he crashed into the side of the stall the noise and confusion further panicking the stallion whose hooves beat a steady tattoo on the creature that had attacked it faith rising to her feet could smell the blood oh mr dominic she said to the horse poor poor frightened baby the stallion his eyes still rolling caught the tone of her familiar voice he turned his great head his left eye staring at her she continued her cooing sounds and he came down on his four legs snorting shaking his head like her he did not care for the smell of blood she moved to the open doorway of the stall reached up to stroke the place just above his nose she put a cube of sugar in his mouth as she held on to him he was quieting now responding to her ministrations it was only then she looked to her left saw the red pulp that had been william justice lillehammer crumpled against the stall wall ah mr dominic she whispered kissing the stallion nuzzling it everythings all right now im afraid youre being a bit premature she turned knowing that voice seeing the man she had spotted in moons homemade video he was truly hideous now seeming in real life less like the johnny leonforte she had known than he had in the video ironically she thought he could have been seated next to her at a restaurant or the opera and she might never have recognized him unless she happened to be looking at him as the lights went down and in the shadows and halflight the man he had once been had emerged as he had in the video part real part memory hello johnny she said youve come a long way since i saw you last we both have he said and its been a hard painful journey for one of us at least johnny leonforte tried to smile but the nerves on one side of his face didnt seem to work and the result was grotesque your friend okami cut me up real good he said but im too tough to kill he moved slightly with the movement of the stallion really faith id be much obliged if youd move slowly out of the stall observing firsthand the rapport you have with these creatures i see it was a mistake on wills pan to think he could maneuver you and them just right he kept moving besides we dont warn you getting your hands on wills weaponry do we faith who had already thought of that said mr dominic is still agitated i think itd be best if i stayed here with him johnny took out a magnum where should i put the bullet faith just below the horses right ear he aimed at the stallions head faith broke her contact with the stallion stepped out of the stall all right she said now what close the door to the stall johnny said we dont want to be disturbed she did as he said moved down the stables away from the stallion what are you doing i dont want any mistakes she said i dont want you suddenly deciding to shoot mr dominic johnny made a grimace named after your not very dearly departed son eh faith big mansion stables horses more money and influence than you know what to do with jesus what a life youve jived she looked at him mutely its my life you ve been living you queen bitch the ferocity of his scream made her flinch she could see all the rage and envy pent up over the years swimming in his eyes like a school of ravenous sharks you took everything away from me you and that jap sonuvabitch okami you schemed it all along fucking goldoni masquerading as faith sawhill and i bought it you threw your body at me and i took it it hurts doesnt it faith said to know that in the end you were just a man like all the rest of the men ive known i opened my thighs at will took a slab of your flesh in my mouth and everything i wanted followed as easily as saying open sesame im gonna fucking kill you now you sound like the johnny leonforte i used to know she said as she backed down the stables away from his threat not the red queen who conned all of washingtons mightiest minds speaking of influence how many presidents did you manage to manipulate imagine a sicilian thug like you an actor she laughed why do you hate me johnny i did you the biggest favor of your life you were born to the shadows and acting remember how bored you were with the business side of things you even talked about me taking over the bookkeeping remember you took life away from me faith look at my face i was handsome once i had to change my name undergo so many operations i lost count and the pain and then i had to hide myself away yes in the shadows but without a house a family the admiration of bluebloods all the things i ever wanted in life you took them all johnnys face was so flushed it was as if she could see every venal emotion that drove him crawling along his skin like maggots he came after her his shoulders hunched as if against the words she flung at him like knives she laughed again a cruel edge coming into her tone nothings changed johnny im still doing your bookkeeping i nol you and okami and dominic were intent on putting me out of business you made bad friends johnny when you decided to play both ends against the middle to the feds you were the red queen playing the deepcover governmental spook a hero to his country but secretly you were running lookingglass toward your own ends handpicking mafia men using your nephew caesare to move them up the family ranks until they became dons beholden to him and to you you were hero and villain wrapped up in one unholy package she was against the far wall now and she moved to her left her body blocking his vision of what hung there on the wall and now youre doing it again with the godaishu you linked lookingglass up with the godaishu to undermine the feds circumvent their laws and expand your network into business worldwide only this time youre out of your league those boys in the godaishu dont care one iota about you you thought you and caesare were going to remain their partners sony to disillusion you they were using you you and caesare were their meal ticket into all the restricted areas of america she brushed the softness of the scarred leather with her back and it comforted her think of it the mafia and the government in an alliance it was an irresistible combination to the japanese yakuza she moved her right hand felt the leather with her fingers but after the godaishu was well established here what do you imagine theyd do with you and caesare i have protection against that possibility johnny said it was intelligence passed to me by a powerful source codenamed he paused then said but why shouldnt i tell you now what good will it do you youll soon be dead he tried to smile and faith shivered my source is codenamed nishiki his intelligence allowed me to rise in rank to become the head of lookingglass idiot faith said nishiki is mikio okami he only passed you intelligence that he and dominic wanted you to have no it cant be you lying bitch the magnum came up but faiths hand had already drawn the old revolver out of the scarred leather holster the colt she used in case a horse went down with a broken leg she smelled the oil felt the hickory grips solid against her palm she leveled the barrel and fired once twice the stench of cordite filling her nostrils as the revolver bucked in her hand later she would remember johnny leonfortes astonished expression the stretched o of his mouth so like a little boys he staggered backward amid the rearing stamping whinnying horses fell to his knees faith in full possessibn of her wits fired into his face and he slammed backward onto the strawcovered plank floor not so hard to kill after all she said standing over him just because you are supremely talented kansatsu had said does not mean that you are capable of fully comprehending that talent just how ironic he was being nicholas could not appreciate until now a now that had perhaps been occurring over and over like ripples in a lake expanding outward affecting everything in its wake a now that was as inevitable as taking another breath what had seiko said to him at narita airport in the last moment before he had flown to venice with something akin to panic in her eyes you will be different so different that no one will recognize you yes it was happening now celeste her heart beating fast at the knowledge of the messulethes approach held his hand but he could not feel it all his senses were turned inward to make this one great leap of faith he had to abandon everything kansatsu had taught him he had to have faith now not in his training not in those who had trained him whether in good faith or in bad but in his own innate talent he used haragei to center himself to bring his breathing his pulse down to almost nil the color drained out of his face but celeste did not utter a sound though her heart skipped a beat he had warned her blood and energy pooled in hara the center of intrinsic energy inside the body as he returned himself to that moment in the cage when he and the messulethe had been both physically and psychically linked when the messulethe calling upon the help of the sacred white magpie had summoned the opening of the sixth gate nicholas had absorbed the incantation then and now with the aid of haragei he recalled it pronouncing the strange syllables just as the messulethe had done at the robot factory the gate opened and nicholas freed of tautau altogether entered the forbidden sixth gate dear god hes here margarite but she was already running down the hall throwing open the front door disappearing outside as croaker taken by surprise ran belatedly after her a hundred yards away through the stands of trees he saw the other woman rising up as out of the ground itself looking toward margarite as she ran racing after margarite he could make out her features the thick red hair the oval face with its beautiful aggressive features and his own instinct told him who this woman must be celeste he could hear margarite calling the womans name and a moment later he saw the two sisters embracing there was no doubt in his mind that the redheaded celeste must be the sister she had alluded to he came upon them still clinging to one another in tears lew margarite said my sister celeste has been with your friend nicholas nick where is he and now he could see the despair in her eyes as she wiped the tears off her cheeks nick and do duc which way lew margarite said i have to go with you no celeste cried you dont know what the messulethes like what hes done to nick you dont know what hes done to me margarite said quietly celeste he murdered dom ah god it was a quiet wail but it stirred the hairs at the back of croakers neck celeste gripped her sister all the more reason for you to stay away but margarite shook her head he wont harm me there is something unspoken that must be done she looked hard into her sisters beautiful face you understand what im saying croaker was aware of a subtle shift in the light and he shivered he saw celeste nodding then she said if you must the two men are masked this was do ducs doing he has nicholass face and nicholas has his i think in some eerie way do duc wants to become nicholas lets go croaker said to margarite as celeste indicated the direction in which the two men had set out and to celeste theres a man named tanzan nangi in nicks house hes a friend you can trust him with your life stay with him celeste nodded uncertainly watching them as they headed toward the stand of bare ginkgo and what lay beyond how many sins had he committed in his lifetime he could not say either he had lost count or he no longer recognized the definition of sin except one he had murdered ao for the one secret that ao in his wisdom would not divulge to his student the incantation that would open the sixth gate ao who had taken in a homeless frightened boy had accepted him when perhaps the other elders of the nungs would have done otherwise ao who had tutored him initiating him into the magic of the messulethe who had made him privy to the power of the ages perhaps do duc thought as he struck out through the woods in pursuit of nicholas he had known he would sin in that singular unforgivable way how else to explain why he had chosen the sacred white magpie as his familiar had ao an intimation of the future as well at that moment do duc could see his face the astonishment etched upon it at his pupils choice of the white magpie perhaps in that moment he scented his own death on the wind perhaps the white magpie whispered it in his ear ao who had loved him now dust do duc had pulled what he had wanted most from the depths of acs dreaming mind and then taking his insensate form down to the river had closed his eyes and pushed the head beneath the water there had been nothing else to do he had violated every code of the nungs he had invaded the mind of their head shaman and so was marked for death he had had to kill ao and in the moment of aos spirit passing out of his ancient body the sacred white magpie alighting on do ducs shoulder had spoken to him for the first time he stirred aos body in the muddy current immediately there was a stirring from the far shore and two crocodiles slithered into the river swimming directly for him they hit the body almost simultaneously tearing great strips of flesh from the carcass the water began to boil and change color it became viscous and as the beasts ate do duc did as the white magpie directed him and joined in the feast the sky had been quite clear he remembered that and the sweetness of the air it had been like slipping from the birth canal taking air into the lungs for the very first time now running up the small grassy knoll he felt the weight on his shoulder heard the white magpie speak to him again whispering the path that nicholas had taken he crested the knoll saw the slope downward to the lake on the far side a pair of cranes perhaps sensing some disturbance lifted off from the glassy surface took to the sky in that moment do ducs nostrils flared and he turned back the way he had come uncertain he scented margarite not her body but her soul close to his and coming closer he crouched like a cornered animal his spirit torn by utter despair and a love he could conceive of only in the form of a butchers bloody knife rending him he saw her breaking through the stand of tall ginkgo catching sight of him coming still unafraid terrifying him margarite he whispered he shivered as she came closer i want he said i want i know what you want margarite said she was so beautiful framed by the high white trees the lowering sunlight caught in her eyes ive always known youre the only one his breathing was ragged and he longed to tug the mask off him so that she could see his real face but it didnt matter he was naked before her as he had been all the time they had been on the road together heading toward minnesota those days and nights he had never wanted to end she saw him all of him and she did not flinch or look away she had seen clear through the beguiling mask he had donned for all his women and just as astonishing the essence that had once been do duc before all the deaths and the incantations and the sin did not wither beneath her gaze i knew the moment i met you that you would be the end of me he said i saw you and somewhere deep inside i knew i could no longer go on being what i had spent my whole life becoming he felt himself beginning to lose control he was battling emotions so clotted it felt like inhaling water i have learned to kill so easily but the thought of harming you is intolerable i would rather destroy myself i know were inside one another he was moving closer to her wavering the old and the newly birthed halfformed frightened thing inside him vying for control at first i thought i wanted you to fear me as everyone else fears me but you wouldnt fierce woman that you are you defeated me ended me brought me down by piercing my armor and now theyre all around me the baying hounds who will tear me apart it doesnt have to be that way she reached out a hand to him its over now i can protect you save you if youll come with but in a forlorn flash he saw that he could never have her that he would never again experience the inexpressible emotion he felt at this moment and he made a snakelike lunge for her and was struck broadside by a great weight he moaned as margarite gave a sharp scream no wait i can he crashed to the earth dirt in his eyes and nose rolling the weight alternately crushing and releasing him the proximity of margarite blinded him he wanted to call out to her to reach for her to tell her he had been so close to taking her hand to making contact in that moment when all things but her had ceased to have meaning for him he was a stag caught in the headlights of a speeding car in the wrong place at the wrong time or perhaps not perhaps this was his time the moment to choose between life and death but how could he make that choice life was a desperate war to keep at bay those disenfranchised emotions he knew would destroy him and death for a messulethe was inconceivable he cried out as something needlesharp pierced his flesh and looking down he saw a mechanical hand the articulated alloy fingers surmounted by steel nails with another cry he pulled himself free then kicked out once twice heard the heavy grunt the thick body going down and he drove his elbow into the midsection pulling away staggering a bit as he turned inward his mind searching formargarite but as he had known the moment was gone forever the man with his face came out of nowhere struck him a blow close to the carotid artery in the side of his neck and out of blind instinct he countered with a swordstrike to the major nerve bundle just below the sternum both men hit the water at once in this part of the lake the bank was steep leading out onto a shallow strip perhaps two feet wide where the floor of the lake came up so that the water level was shallow from there a precipitous falloff brought them immediately into the deep water nicholas half paralyzed by do ducs swordstrike went immediately for the head he knew he needed a killing blow but the water worked against them both slowing them down making traditional percussive atemi ineffectual nicholas tightened his hold around do ducs head began pressure with the heel of one hand against the spot where major nerve meridians converged he drove his hand into do ducs upper lip and nose locked together their legs churning they spun out of control further and further into the lake darkness and light interspersed with air and water until they found themselves in a kind of twilight world between the air and the land aqueous chill and darkening do duc dizzying with the pressure on his face struck again at nicholass sternum took possession of his own hold as they flipped over went down beneath the silver surface of the lake they fought each other fought to keep sufficient air in their lungs but their extreme exertions and the chill of the water were taking their toll they kicked out but could no longer keep themselves afloat down they drifted into the chill unnatural night locked together they seemed to be moving but do duc could not understand where he was concentrating on his hold the pressure he was putting on nicholass windpipe he felt nicholass hands scrabbling at his body perhaps some pain but he exerted the power of his psyche blocked out everything but the pressure he must maintain on the windpipe he could feel the pressure building in his ears as they sank but he had no time for that his mind was filled with red blood with the magic of the messulethe and the one thought that he must rise out of this blackness to get to margarite who was waiting for him on the near bank nicholas knew he was drowning the fact was they were both drowning but he doubted now whether the messulethe was even aware of that he could feel the concentration of the messulethes mind like a dark star dense with abnormal gravity and lethal emissions he had led the messulethe here to the lake quite deliberately for he knew what lay within its depths what he had thrown there so many years ago when he and justine were just starting out full of love and hope now he must not only survive the assault on his mind and body but he must move them closer closer to what lay within the purling shadows of the lake bottom he could feel it he could dimly as if through the veil of dreams his battered mind had picked up the messulethes breakdowns at the robot factory he could hear his sobs like echoes almost see the image of the woman who swam in his thoughts like a prehistoric beast and now it had happened again stronger this time as if the icon had appeared in the flesh he could for the first time sense all the muddled and compressed emotions coiled within the messulethes mind like a basketful of cobras he had been set to use the power he had found beyond the sixth gate he had been fully prepared to blast the messulethe with a fireball of psychic energy and then they had come together and he had felt it all burning there like rubble from a disaster it had made him hesitate compassion momentarily overcoming his rage for revenge and now he was paying for that hesitation he was drowning he looked inward opening his tanjian eye stepping through the sixth gate ready now to summon the power to break away from this demon and destroy him but he found the essence of the messulethe already there inside the gate at the same place and all either of them could do was to block the others access stalemate deeper into the lake they sank nicholas kicking out at regular intervals propelling them further toward the center until during one of their slow revolutions he saw the vague humped shadows of the lake bottom he prayed as he kicked out prayed that he had calculated correctly because he had only one chance now for life one chance to keep the water out of his nose and throat keep it from filling his lungs all the breath going out of him the end and there it was illuminated by pale light like the ghostly finger of god was fee tip of the samurais daikatana his father the colonel had given him its name isshogai meant for life his eyes began to roll up and darkness began to flicker at the periphery of his vision he kicked out with his legs propelling them toward the long keen blade of the sword which he had thrown into the lake thinking never again to need it the heavy hilt had struck the lake bottom embedding itself into the soft silt and now there it was the blade shooting up at an angle from the lake bed do duc sensing nicholass weakness tightened his hold and now nicholas did not believe he would have the energy to get them the last six feet to the tip of the blade his hands moved upward clamping onto do ducs face his face his fingertips sought the edge of the mask finding it he dug his nails into the adhesive getting purchase lifting a minute strip of it breaking the seal the lake water soaked the adhesive and he lifted more of the mask away from the messulethes face he moved it so that the acrylic resin slipped across the messulethes nostrils and mouth covered his eyes the messulethe reacted and as he did so nicholas drove his legs in a powerful scissor kick they rolled and for a moment nicholas was dangerously close to the blade point then their momentum rolled them again and the messulethes back was coming up on the point nicholas drove his legs one more time beating them down toward the lake bed he saw and felt it happen all at once there was no expression he could see on the messulethes face hidden as it was beneath the grotesquely twisted mask but the point of the daikatanas long blade popped through the messulethes breastbone piercing him all the way through the messulethes legs kicked and churned the muscles spasming as clouds of filmy blood drifted upward like kites upon a summers breeze nicholas pressed downward the blade rising upward as if itself alive eager to rend flesh and bone he felt the pressure come off his windpipe and dizzy with lack of oxygen he immediately struck upward for the surface but he did not move he looked down saw the messulethes hand gripped tightly around his left ankle he tried to jackknife his body in order to reach the death grip but the angle was so acute it took all his energy just to get his fingers on the messulethes then he found he could not release the grip so nicholas hung there exhausted staring into the leering face at the blue crescent tattooed on the inside of the powerful wrist and into his mind blew the last scattered memories of his antagonist the river in the jungle sunlight filtering through the triplecanopied trees heat and a black leopard speaking runic promises and portents an old man his face weathered by time and magic and the bluewhite bloat of death crocodiles lazily swinging their tails in the hot sun jaws opening to feed the taste of a mans brain a white magpie screaming in triumph a it rises burning into a copper sun hung there dying slowly with the messulethe whose deteriorating mind shed ardent thoughts like bubbles rising to the roof of this aqueous graveyard incantations of the earth and the air and a beautiful darkhaired ambereyed woman margarite i want to tell you magnificent in your terrible beauty tell you that i like circe that i more powerful even than gim the blue crescent all the ancient rituals of the messulethe i cant touch you this is all that is left me in this one moment that i love and then nicholas was alone in the utter silence and stillness of the deep time seemed to have come to a halt even his heartbeat seemed to flicker and slow blood turning to ice and then through the darkness of neardeath he felt a stirring of a current against his cold cheek his head turned slowly wearily he thought he saw a shape emerging from the dimness saw a man approaching his cheeks puffed out as he held air in his lungs air he blinked it was croaker swimming quickly and efficiently cutting through the water his hand was extended as if in greeting the biomechanical hand of stainless steel titanium and polycarbonate the replacement for the one he had lost helping nicholas nicholas had never forgiven himself for being the cause of his friends disfigurement though croaker had himself forgiven him and now here croaker was offering that hand nicholas wanted to take it in his in friendship ready at last to forgive himself he watched in a haze as croakers hand took the messulethes fingers and bending them back one by one snapped the joints broke the death grip croaker grabbed him around the waist and kicking powerfully upward brought them both through the increasingly paler layers of twilight out of the icy night out of the graveyard to the surface and the last light of day epilogue new years day ah to be a child on new years day issa tokyo with an earrattling rumble the jumbo took off leaving behind it an ashy cloud that clung to the air like gauze to a wound through it the bloated sun was stained the color of dried blood i want you to know something margarite said her amber eyeswere leveled on croaker if i never see you again ill shrivel up and die maybe you really are the siren do duc thought you were he smiled trying to make light of it but she swung her head away i felt it when he died she whispered i felt him call my name why did he do it margarite murder dom all the others i think its all he knew she said to him life was death there was nothing else he was just trying to survive poor bastard i wonder she said raising her voice as another jumbo roared down the runway what he would have done if you and nicholas had let him grab me who knows croaker said but my guess is even he didnt want to know he made the move to provoke us because there was no other way out for him he said the hounds were out for him and he was right she turned back toward him and he could tell by the look in her eyes that she wanted to put the topic of do duc to rest i meant what i said before i know you did croaker said but i also know where youre going now back to tony d he paused for a moment as if he did not want to go on it would help if you gave me the procedure for contacting nishiki margarite shook her head that was doms only legacy the perpetuation of all his power i wont jeopardize it even for you she gave him a desolate smile business she said taking his face in her hands she kissed him hard on the lips and he held on long enough to taste her tears come home soon she said when at last she broke away francie will already have begun to miss you she hefted her bag will you walk me to the gate he looked at her ive come as far as i can margarite its farther than i ever thought i would go she nodded turned away toward the terminal a moment later she looked back at him over her shoulder when will you come home when this is over he said when i can and then its up to fate isnt it she seemed uncertain for a moment then she smiled for the moment at least i suppose it is i should never have thrown it away nicholas said that was an act of arrogance like a slap in my fathers face behind him on the wall of the livingroom isshogai the great daikatana was hung in its temporary leather scabbard a new one of handmade lacquer tooled silver and cured mantaray skin was being made for him in the traditional manner by a man of ninety years whom nicholas had known for some time this place wasnt the same without it croaker said there was a silence for a time he looked from the long sword to the pair of armatures nicholas had made himself to display do ducs two masks it had seemed grotesque at first that nicholas should want to keep these grisly reminders of a man who had almost killed him but then as he had learned from margarite nothing was ever so cut and dried in life evil as well as good wore many different faces at last he said have you gone to the grave nicholas knew he meant justines grave not yet he said it will take some time before i can reconcile her death in my mind i dont want to go there until thats settled until theres a kind of peace between us he put his hands together theres still part of her spirit here restless i feel her every morning at dawn when i wake up to do my exercises i think she needs to be free of this place lew croaker nodded understanding give it time nick he said and sighed deeply at least senator banes no longer a force to deal with when the red queen died his power base collapsed it wasnt difficult for faith goldoni to get those who had feared him to join his enemies in denouncing him but the godaishu still lives nicholas said and whatever weve accomplished i have a premonition weve so iar only scratched the surface where is okami what happened to him nangi is convinced hes still alive certainly the threat to him still exists and now there are some hard questions he needs to answer outside there was snow on the ground tomorrow it would be new years day a time of renewal when all things were possible what id like to know croaker said is what okami and dominic goldoni were up to we only have to follow this maze far enough nicholas said if we can get that far ill start with tetsuo akinaga akira chosa and tomoo kozo the three oyabun in the kaishos inner council one of them is responsible for plotting his death and then theres avalon ltd theyre suppliers of every kind of war materiel you can name its relatively easy to buy chinese and russian weapons but they also have access to american f jet fighters waxman the red queen would have been able to provide that access croaker said nicholas nodded true i just hope hes the only one who did croaker poured himself some coffee from an insulated pot why do you think dominic gave do duc your name as nishikis identity nicholas shrugged who can say maybe okami led dominic to believe i was nishiki in the event of the kind of disaster that actually occurred okami knew id be the only one whod be able to stop do duc nicholas looked out the windows at the deep snow the silence of winter had stolen over the countryside like fog obscuring the stars right now what worries me most is torch the codeword i found embedded in the avalon software in paris ive been thinking about it ever since you mentioned it croaker said id bet the farm its some kind of experimental weapon theyre trying to get their hands on if thats so its better than even money its one of ours ill check that out nicholas was silent for some time i agree thats the most likely possibility he said but theres another one we dare not ignore he tapped his fingertips together thoughtfully what if isnt a number but a deadline he said that would be two and a half months from now ides of march nicholas shook his head ruefully if only okami were here i have a feeling hed be able to tell us what torch was nangi seems to think okamis been trying to give us clues to follow right avalon ltd and then theres this international arms dealer timothy delacroix who harley gaunt mentioned in the material that manny mannheim delivered according to harley delacroix claimed that sato was one of his suppliers that means the late vincent tinh was one of his suppliers the two men stared at each other and the look they exchanged brought no words to mind only memories you put margarite on the plane nicholas asked late yesterday evening he looked at croaker sure you made the right choice not in the least croaker grinned at him but it felt false and he put it away i cant let her walk out of my life nick but what else was i supposed to do im a cop for christs sake ive always worked the right side of the law are you certain shes on the wrong side croaker looked at his friend astonished what are you talking about this is one hell of a woman lew shes the fucking mafia buddy nicholas his hands laced in front of him said softly mikio okami is kaisho of all the yakuza two months ago i would have cheerfully turned him in if id been given even half a chance now i cant be that certain of things he looked from the snowy landscape outside to his friends bleak face let me ask you a question lew is margarite an amoral person i croaker stopped not knowing what he was going to say in what gray landscape did the truth lie we all wear masks nicholas said to hide what is most important to us there was a silence again and the two men heard the hushed crunch of footfalls from outside nicholas stirred and said you know what youre going to have to do yeah nangi and faith goldoni are convinced that okami is nishiki if thats the case margarite is going to know how to contact him even the indirect route he set up with dominic goldoni will be better than what we have now which is nothing croaker sloshed the coffee around in the ceramic mug what if theyre wrong what if okami isnt nishiki we still have to try to find okami are you up to it croaker examined his biomechanical hand as if hed never seen it before he knew what he was being asked to do spy on margarite long enough so that he could follow the elaborate chain of cutouts back to the source nishiki i love her nick but we both know the rules we know who we are and what roads weve chosen to travel he looked into his friends dark eyes it isnt simple but its all either of us has the front door opened then closed softly and croaker rose went toward the kitchen dinner in an hour fine nicholas said grabbing his thinsulate jacket dont bother cleaning up sashiko will be in first thing in the morning celeste was waiting for him in the hallway she silently watched him put on his boots then slipped her fingers through his as they went out into the twilight blue shadows lay everywhere beneath a cedar wreathed in snow and its copperfringed winter coat he could see rabbit tracks a bright blur of fur bounding swiftly into the underbrush they went through the stand of ghostly ginkgo up the small knoll and then down toward the lake it was almost all frozen over bright patches of ice like stained glass in the spring nicholas said ill take a dive are you afraid he wont be there no but his soul needs company it never had any during life celeste squeezed his hand in hers this man was a coldblooded killer i cant understand your attitude toward him or my sisters then i cant explain it neither could she its just as well they turned back went up to the crest of the knoll from here they could see across to the other side of the lake to houses huddled together as if for warmth a dog barked while men worked assiduously pruning trees into knobby precise globes the japanese celeste had learned in her short time here did not like to leave anything to chance what about koryoku the illuminating power celeste asked do you still think its so important tm planning to ask okami that when i see him nicholas said but yes i think its more important than ever he had been thinking of the gift he had found beyond the sixth gate perhaps this was why he felt so dose to do duc do duc had given nicholas and margarite very precious things which had changed both their lives the power beyond the sixth gate was still by and large a mystery what it would portend nicholas could not yet say except that as seiko had predicted he was no longer the same he broke his train of thought looked at her you didnt leave with your sister were two different kinds of goldonis celeste said i need to find okami before memory and obligation can be laid to rest a wind off the lake caught her hair as she shook her head besides i could never live in america id miss the water and the light the weight of venice the significance of history now in winter all the beautiful colors are muted by cloud and rain until that magical moment in late afternoon when a thick shaft of sunlight breaks through turning the piazze to byzantine gold her eyes had a faraway look soon it will be time for the carnival and the masks will be born again in silence they began to walk slowly back to the house in time celeste said i know youre angry with me am i yes you think i should have told you in the beginning that i was a goldohi but the truth is nicholas that i doubt you would have trusted me had you known okami knew your personality and he warned me to keep my true identity hidden from you mikio okami continues to haunt me like a specter nicholas said his bett noire the mastermind of the godaishu has become mine they paused at the front porch to stamp the snow off their boots nicholas opened the front door and they took off their footwear please dont be angry with me she said it hurts too much shadows in the night the moonlight sliced into pieces by the bamboo swept across nicholas as he lay on his futon he should have been asleep hours ago but his body betrayed him vibrating in blood and heat wanting the woman in the next bedroom he knew he should get up go and lie down beside her he knew that was what she wanted what they both wanted but he felt paralyzed images of justine haunted his mind he knew not because anyone had told him but because he simply felt it like moss upon a rock too long without sunlight that she had died because he hadnt been there to protect her and if they had grown apart in the last years if in fact their love had not survived he knew that this too was his doing his and japans he heard a small sound as the shoji the ricepaper screen to his bedroom was slowly drawn back in its track he saw a shadow stepping lightly and without any sound into the room it avoided the slivers of moonlight keeping to the deep shadows in the corners of the room it stood very still for a moment watching him then like a wraith it shed its kimono and with a soft sigh slid beneath the covers of the futon he smelted celestes scent as exciting as he remembered it in venice and paris whatever happened from this time forward he knew that he would always remember her in that first electric moment masked in the schola cantorum of the church of san belisario robed in enigma and power the currencies of venice i cant be her i so much dont want you to be nicholas said do you mean that look inside me i dont want to do that with you ever this was one of the things he loved about her i see only you when i look at you she sighed again but this time it was because he had enfolded her in his arms his lips came down over hers and he found them trembling as they opened as her tongue twined with his and then it was all right their bodies melting together as if they had been made for each other at dawn nicholas arose he did not want to leave celeste but his body and mind needed to flex it was new years day outside another snow silent and deep was coming down obscuring all but the large trees nearest the house nicholas meditated feeling more at peace than he had since nangi had told him about justines death he breathed deeply in and out in and out prana he knew she didnt mind celeste being here would have welcomed the attachment had she still been alive where would she have been now in that event what would have made her happy breathe in and out that was the saddest part he thought that he had lost touch with all the things that made her happy part of him became aware of the shoji being slid quietly back but he paid it no attention sashiko came early on holidays went about her business and left by noon to be with her family a drawer was opened as she got out her cleaning implements one two the tiny steps the small woman took and nicholas twisted up and to the left as a voice whispered to his mind using its own momentum to pull the figure over and down ft landed fiat on its back the wig coming off the kimono parting the blade of the wakizashi gleaming wickedly recognition was instantaneous tomoo kozos visage blossomed from the photographs celeste had shown him in venice he tried a swordstrike but he was at a disadvantage sitting with his legs crossed and kozo was suddenly inside his defense the point of the long knife just inches from his throat and by the fixed glare of hatred in the oyabuns eyes he knew he had no choice at all he drove the stiffened tips of his fingers in a killing blow into the soft spot just below kozos sternum tearing through skin flesh and viscera to the hot beating heart he stared into tomoo kozos face as the life left it listening intently for foreign sounds within the house then he searched for the voice in his mind but he knew that justine if it had been justine had spoken for the last time he relaxed his vigilance but not for long he knew so it had already begun the kaishos inner council was moving against him but he was still alive and somewhere too mikio okami his charge his quarry was alive pulling the strings in a still unknown shadow dance nicholas breathed in out feeling the excess adrenalin bubbling in his veins as it drained away once again he was so close to death he could taste its peculiar taint in his mouth covered in another mans blood he steeped himself in the silence of the snow bowed his head greeting new years day with a prayer
