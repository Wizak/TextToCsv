 chapter one so have you talked to him yet hmm cybil campbell continued to work at her drawing board diligently sectioning off the paper with the skill of long habit who am i talking to there was a long and gusty sigh one that had cybil fighting to keep her lips from twitching she knew her firstfloor neighbor jody myers well and understood exactly what him she was referring to the gorgeous mr mysterious in b cyb come on he moved in a week ago and hasnt said a word to anyone but youre right across the hall we need some details here ive been pretty busy cybil flicked a glance up watching jody with her expressive brown eyes and mop of duskyblond hair energetically pace around the studio hardly noticed him jodys first response was a snort get real you notice everything jody wandered to the drawing board hung over cybils shoulder then wrinkled her nose nothing much interesting about a bunch of blue lines she liked it better when cybil started sketching in the sections he doesnt even have a name on the mailbox yet and nobody ever sees him leave the building during the day not even mrs wolinsky and nobody gets by her maybe hes a vampire wow intrigued with the idea jody pursed her pretty lips would that be cool or what too cool cybil agreed and continued to prep her drawing as jody danced around the studio and chattered like a magpie it never bothered cybil to have company while she worked the fact was she enjoyed it shed never been one for isolation and quiet it was the reason she was happy living in new york happy to be settled into a small building with a handful of unapologetically nosy neighbors such things not only satisfied her on a personal level they were grist for her professional mill and of all the occupants of the old converted warehouse jody myers was cybils favorite three years earlier when cybil had moved in jody had been an energetic newlywed who fervently believed that everyone should be as blissfully happy as she herself was meaning cybil mused married now the mother of the seriously adorable eightmonthold charlie jody was only more committed to her cause and cybil knew she herself was jodys primary objective havent you even run into him in the hall jody wanted to know not yet idly cybil picked up a pencil tapped it against her fulltopouty bottom lip her longlidded eyes were the green of a clear sea at twilight and might have been exotic or sultry if they werent almost always shimmering with humor actually mrs wolinskys losing her touch i have seen him leave the building during the day which rules out vampire status you have instantly caught jody dragged a rolling stool over to the drawing board when where how when dawn where heading east on grand how insomnia getting into the spirit cybil swiveled on her stool her eyes danced with amusement woke up early and i kept thinking about the brownies left over from the party the other night atomic brownies jody agreed yeah so i couldnt get back to sleep until i ate one since i was up anyhow i came in here to work awhile and ended up just standing at the window i saw him go out you cant miss him he must be sixfour and those shoulders both women rolled their eyes in appreciation anyway he was carrying a gym bag and wearing black jeans and a black sweatshirt so my deduction was he was heading to the gym to work out you dont get those shoulders by lying around eating chips and drinking beer all day aha jody speared a finger in the air you are interested im not dead jody the man is dangerously gorgeous and you add that air of mystery along with a tight butt her hands rarely still spread wide whats a girl to do but wonder why wonder why dont you go knock on his door take him some cookies or something welcome him to the neighborhood then you can find out what he does in there all day if hes single what he does for a living if hes single what she broke off head lifting in alert thats charlie waking up i didnt hear a thing cybil turned her head aiming an ear toward the doorway listened shrugged i swear jody since you gave birth you have ears like a bat im going to change him and take him for a walk want to come no cant ive got to work ill see you tonight then dinners at seven right cybil managed to smile as jody dashed off to retrieve charlie from the bedroom where shed put him down for a nap dinner at seven with jodys tedious and annoying cousin frank when cybil asked herself was she going to develop a backbone and tell jody to stop trying to fix her up probably she decided about the same time she told mrs wolinsky the same thing and mr peebles on the first floor and her dry cleaner what was this obsession with the people in her life to find her a man she was twentyfour single and happy not that she didnt want a family one day and maybe a nice house out in the burbs somewhere with a yard for the kids and the dog thered have to be a dog but that was for some time or other she liked her life right now very much thanks resting her elbows on her drawing board she propped her chin on her fists and gave in enough to stare out the window and allow herself to daydream must be spring she mused that was making her feel so restless and full of nervous energy she reconsidered going for that walk with jody and charlie after all but then heard her friend call out a goodbye and slam the door behind her so much for that work she reminded herself and swiveled back to begin sketching in the first section of her comic strip friends and neighbors she had a steady and clever hand for drawing and had come by it naturally her mother was a successful internationally respected artist her father the reclusive genius behind the longrunning macintosh comic strip together they had given her and her siblings a love of art a sense of the ridiculous and a solid foundation cybil had known even when shed left the security of their home in maine shed be welcomed back if new york rejected her but it hadnt for over three years now her strip had grown in popularity she was proud of it proud of the simplicity warmth and humor she was able to create with everyday characters in everyday situations she didnt attempt to mimic her fathers irony or his often sharp political satires for her it was life that made her laugh being stuck in line at the movies finding the right pair of shoes surviving yet another blind date while many saw her emily as autobiographical cybil saw her as a marvelous well of ideas but never recognized the reflection after all emily was a statuesque blonde who had miserable luck holding a job and worse luck with men cybil herself was a brunette of average height with a successful career as for men well they werent enough of a priority for her to worry about luck one way or the other a scowl marred her expression narrowing her lightgreen eyes as she caught herself tapping her pencil rather than using it she just couldnt seem to concentrate she scooped her fingers through her short cap of brandybrown hair pursed her softly sculpted mouth and shrugged maybe what she needed was a short break a snack perhaps a little chocolate would get the juices flowing she pushed back tucking her pencil behind her ear in an absentminded habit shed been trying to break since childhood left the sundrenched studio and headed downstairs her apartment was wonderfully open aside from the studio space that had been the main reason shed snapped it up so quickly a long service bar separated the kitchen from the living area leaving the lower level all one area tall windows let in light and the street noises that had kept her awake and thrilled for weeks after her arrival in the city she moved well another trait inherited from her mother what her father called the grandeau grace she had long limbs that had been suited to the ballet lessons shed begged for as a child then grown tired of barefoot she padded into the kitchen opened the refrigerator and considered she could whip something interesting up she mused shed had cooking lessons too and hadnt become bored with them untilshed outdistanced her instructor in creativity then she heard it and sighed the music carried through the old walls across the short hallway outside her door sad and sexy she mused the quiet sob of the alto sax mr mysterious in b didnt play every day but shed come to wish he would it always stirred her those long liquid notes and the swirl of emotion behind them a struggling musician she wondered hoping to find his break in new york brokenhearted no doubt she continued weaving one of her scenarios for him as she began to take out ingredients a woman behind it of course some coldblooded redhead whod caught him under her spell stripped his soul then crushed his stillthrobbing heart under her fourinch italian heel a few days before shed invented a different lifestyle for him one where hed run away from his filthy rich and abusive family as a boy of sixteen had survived on the streets by playing on street corners in new orleans one of her favorite cities then had worked his way north as that same vicious family headed by an insane uncle scoured the country for him she hadnt quite worked out why they were scouring but it wasnt really important he was on the run and comforted only by his music or he was a government agent working undercover an international jewel thief hiding from a government agent a serial killer trolling for his next victim she laughed at herself then looked down at the ingredients shed lined up without thinking whatever he was she realized with another laugh apparently it looked like she was making him those cookies his name was preston mcquinn he wouldnt have considered himself particularly mysterious just private it was that ingrained need for privacy that had plopped him down in the heart of one of the worlds busiest cities temporarily he mused as he slipped his sax back into its case just temporarily in another couple of months the rehab would be completed on his house on connecticuts rocky coast some called it his fortress and that was fine with him a man could be blissfully alone for weeks at a time in a fortress and no one got in unless the gates were lifted he started back upstairs leaving behind the nearly empty living room he only used it to play the acoustics were dandy or to work out if he didnt feel like going to the gym a couple of blocks away the second floor was where he lived temporarily he thought again and all he needed in this way station was a bed a dresser the right lighting and a desk sturdy enough to hold his laptop monitor and the paperwork that they often generated he wouldnt have had a phone but his agent had forced a cell phone on him and had pleaded with him to keep it on he did unless he didnt feel like it preston sat at the desk pleased that the little turn with his sax had cleared out the cobwebs mandy his agent was busy chewing on her inchlong nails over the progress of his latest play he could have told her to spare the enamel it would be done when it was done and not a minute before the trouble with success he thought was that it became its own entity once you did something people liked they wanted you to do it again only faster and bigger preston didnt give a damn about what people wanted they could break down the doors of the theater to see his next play give him another pulitzer toss him another tony and bring him money by the truckloads or they could stay away in droves critically bomb the work and demand their money back it was the work that mattered and it only had to matter to him financially he was secure always had been mandy said that was part of his problem without the need or desire for money to keep him hungry he was arrogant and aloof from his audience then again she also said that was what made him a genius because he simply didnt give a damn he sat in the big room a tall muscular man with disordered hair the color of a wellfed minks pelt eyes of coo blue scanned the words already typed his mouth was firm and unsmiling his face narrow rawboned and carelessly handsome he tuned out the street sounds that seemed to batter against the windows day and night and let himself slip back into the soul of the man hed created inside the clever little computer a man struggling desperately to survive his own desires the harsh sound of his buzzer made him swear as he felt himself sucked back into that empty room he considered snarling and waiting it out then weighed in human nature and decided the intruder would probably keep coming back until he dispatched them once and for all probably the eagleeyed old woman from the ground floor preston decided as he started down shed already tried to snag him twice when hed headed out to the club in the evening he was good at evading but it was becoming a nuisance smarter to hit her faceon with a few rude remarks and let her huff away to gossip about him but when he checked the peephole he didnt see the tidy woman with her bright birds eyes but a pretty brunette with hair short as a boys and big green eyes from across the hall he realized and wondered what the hell she could want hed figured since shed left him alone for nearly a week she intended to keep right on doing so which made her in his mind the perfect neighbor annoyed that shed spoiled it he opened the door leaned against it yeah hi oh yes indeed cybil thought he was even better when you got a good closeup look at the face im cybil campbell a she offered a bright friendly smile and gestured to her own door he only lifted an intriguingly winged eyebrow yeah a man of few words she decided and continued to smile though she wished his eyes would flicker away just long enough for her to crane her neck and see beyond him into the apartment she couldnt very well try it when he was focused on her without appearing to be prying which of course she wasnt really i heard you playing a while ago i work at home and sound travels if she was here to bitch about the noise she was out of luck preston mused he played when he felt like playing he continued to study her coolly the pert slightly turnedup nose the sensuously ripe mouth the long narrow feet with sassily painted pink toes i usually forget to turn the stereo on while im working she went on cheerfully making him notice a tiny dimple that winked off and on beside her mouth so its nice to hear you play ralph and sissy were into vivaldi bigtime which is fine really but monotonous when thats all you hear they used to live in your place ralph and sissy she explained waving a hand toward his apartment they moved to white plains after ralph had an affair with a clerk at saks well he didnt really have an affair but he was thinking about it and sissy said it was move out of the city or shed scalp him in a divorce mrs wolinsky gives them six months but i dont know i think they might make it anyway she held out the pretty yellow plate with a small mountain of chocolatechip cookies heaped on it covered by clear pink plastic wrap i brought you some cookies he glanced down at them giving her a very brief window of opportunity to sneak a peek around him and see his empty living room the poor guy couldnt even afford a couch she thought then his unsmiling blue eyes flicked back to hers why why what why did you bring me cookies oh well i was baking them sometimes i cook to clear out my head when i cant seem to concentrate on work most often its baking that does it for me and if i keep them all ill just eat them all and hate myself the dimple kept fluttering dont you like cookies ive got nothing against them well then enjoy she pushed them into his hands and welcome to the building if you need anything im usually around again she gestured vaguely with pretty slimfingered hands and if you want to find out whos who around here i can fill you in ive lived here a few years now and i know everybody i wont he stepped back and shut the door in her face cybil stood where she was a moment stunned speechless by the abrupt dismissal she was fairly certain that shed lived for twentyfour years without ever having had a door shut in her face and now that shed had the experience she decided she didnt care for it she caught herself before she could pound on his door and demand her cookies back she wouldnt sink that low she told herself turning sharply on her heel and marching back to her own door now she knew the mysterious mr mysterious was insanely attractive built like a god and as rude as a cranky twoyearold who needed a swat on the butt and a nap well that was fine just fine she could stay out of his way she didnt slam her door figuring hed hear it and smirk with that gotohell mouth of his but when she was safely inside she turned to the door and indulged in a juvenile exhibition of making faces sticking out her tongue and wagging her fingers from her ears it made her feel marginally better but the bottom line was the man had her cookies her favorite dessert plate her very rare animosity and she still didnt know his name preston didnt regret his actions not for a minute he calculated his studied rudeness would keep his terminally pert neighbor with the turnedup nose and sexy pink toenails out of his hair during his stay across the hall the last thing he needed was the local welcoming committee rolling up at his door especially when it was led by a bubbly motormouth brunette with eyes like a fairy damn it in new york people were supposed to ignore their neighbors he was pretty sure it was a city ordinance and if not it should be just his luck he thought that she was single he had no doubt that if shed had a husband shed have poured out all his virtues and delights that she worked at home and would therefore be easy to trip over whenever he headed out was just another black mark and that she made handsdown the best chocolatechip cookies in the known universe was close to unforgivable hed managed to ignore them while he worked preston mcquinn could ignore a nuclear holocaust if the words were pumping but when he surfaced he started to think about them lying in his kitchen on their chirpy yellow plate he thought about them while he showered while he dressed while he eased out the kinks brought on by hours sitting in one spot with posture his thirdgrade teacher sister mary joseph had termed deplorable so when he went down for what he considered a wellearned beer he eyed the plate on the counter hed popped the top took a thoughtful drink so what if he had a couple he mused tossing them in the trash wasnt necessary hed given perky cybil the heaveho she was going to want her party plate back he imagined he might as well sample the wares before he dumped the plate outside her door so he ate one grunted in approval ate a second and blew out a breath of pure appreciation and when hed consumed nearly two dozen he cursed like a damn drug he thought feeling slightly ill and definitely sluggish he stared at the nearempty plate with a combination of selfdisgust and greed with what scraps of willpower he had left he dumped the remaining cookies in a plastic bowl then crossed the room to get his sax he was going to walk around the block a few times before he headed to the club when he opened the door he heard her stomping up the stairs wincing he drew back leaving his door open only a crack he could hear that mileaminute voice of hers going which had him lifting a brow when he saw she was alone never again she muttered i dont care if she sticks bamboo shoots under my nails holds a hot poker to my eye i will never ever go through that torture again in this lifetime thats it over done shed changed her clothes preston noted and was wearing snug black pants with a tailored black blazer offsetting them with a shirt the color of ripe strawberries and long dangles at her ears she kept talking to herself as she opened a purse the size of a postage stamp lifes too short to be bored witless for two precious hours of it she will not do this to me again i know how to say no i just have to practice thats all where the bloody hell are my keys the sound of the door opening behind her made her jump spin around preston noted that the dangles in her ears didnt match and wondered if it was a fashion statement or carelessness since she apparently couldnt find her keys in a bag smaller than the palm of his hand he opted for the latter she looked flushed flustered and fresh and smelled even better than her cookies and because he noticed she only irritated him more hold on he said simply then turned back into his apartment to get her plate cybil had no intention of holding on and finally found her key where it had decided to hide in the narrow inner pocket of the bag where shed put it so shed know just where it was when she needed it but he beat her he strode out of his apartment letting the door slam at his back he carried his saxophone case in one hand and her plate in the other here he wasnt going to ask her what had put that sulky look on her seafairy face he had no doubt that shed tell him for the next half hour youre welcome she snapped snatching it from him because her head was throbbing after two hours of listening to jodys cousin franks monotone account of the vagaries of the stock market she decided shed give mr mysterious a piece of her mind while the mood was on her look buddy you dont want to be friends thats just fine i dont need any more friends she said swinging the plate for emphasis i have so many now i cant take another on until one moves out of the country but theres no excuse for behaving like a snot either all i did was introduce myself and give you some damn cookies his lips wanted to twitch but he controlled it damn good cookies he said before he could stop himself then immediately regretted it as the temper in her eyes switched to amusement oh really yeah he walked away leaving her reluctantly intrigued and completely baffled so she followed impulse one of her favorite hobbies after unlocking her door quickly she stuck the plate on the table inside locked up again then trying to keep her footsteps muffled set off to follow him it would be a great strip gag for emily she thought and handled right could play out for weeks of course shed have to make emily wild about the guy cybil decided as she tried to tiptoe and race down the steps at the same time it wouldnt just be normal perfectly acceptable curiosity but dreamyeyed obsession breathless with the excitement of the chase her mind whirling with possibilities cybil rushed out the front door looked quickly right and left he was already halfway down the block long stride she thought and grinning started after him emily of course would be sort of skulking then jumping behind lampposts or flattening herself against walls in case he turned around and nearly yelping cybil jumped behind a lamppost as the object of the chase sent an absent glance over his shoulder with a hand over her heart cybil dared a peek and watched him turn the corner annoyed that shed worn heels instead of flats to dinner she sucked in a breath and made the dash to the corner he walked for twenty minutes until her feet were screaming and her initial rush of excitement was draining fast did the man just wander the streets with his saxophone every night she wondered maybe he wasnt just rude maybe he was crazy hed been recently released from the asylum thats why he didnt know how to relate to people in the normal way his filthy rich and abusive family had caught him locked him up so that he couldnt claim his rightful inheritance from his beloved grandmother who had died under suspicious circumstances and had left him her entire fortune and all those years of being imprisoned by the corrupt psychiatrist had warped his mind yes that would be exactly what emily would cook up in her head and shed be certain her tender care her unqualified love would cure him then all the friends and neighbors would try to talk her out of it even as she dragged them into her schemes and before it was over mr mysterious would she pulled up short as he walked into a small dingy club called deltas finally she thought and skimmed back her hair now all she had to do was slip inside find a dark corner and see what happened next chapter two contents prev next the place smelled of whiskey and smoke not really offensive cybil thought more atmospheric it was dimly lit with a paleblue light illuminating a stingy stage round tables hardly bigger than pie plates were crammed together and though most of them were occupied the noise level was muted she decided people talked in whispers in such places planning liaisons affairs or enjoying those already made at a thick wooden bar on the side wall patrons loitered on stools and huddled over their drinks as if protecting the contents from invaders it was she decided the kind of club that belonged in a blackandwhite movie from the forties the kind where the heroine wore long slinky dresses darkred lipstick with a sweep of her platinum hair falling sulkily over her left eye as she stood on the stage under a single key light torching her way through songs about the men whod done her wrong and while she did the man who wanted her and had done her wrong brooded into his whiskey with his worldweary eyes shadowed by the brim of his fedora in other words she thought with a smile it was perfect hoping to go unnoticed she scooted along the rear wall and found a table and sitting watched him through a haze of smoke and whiskey fumes he wore black jeans with a tshirt tucked into the waistband hed already taken off the leather jacket hed put on against the evening chill the woman he was speaking with was gorgeous black and outfitted in a hot red jumpsuit that hugged every curvaceous inch she had to be six feet tall cybil mused and when she threw back her beautiful head and laughed the full rich sound rocked through the room for the first time cybil saw him smile no not just smile she thought transfixed by the lightning transformation of that stern and handsome face that hot punch of grin the hammerblow power of it couldnt be called anything as tame as a smile it was full of fun and affection and sly humor it made her rest her chin on her fisted hands and grin in response she imagined he and the beautiful amazon were lovers was certain of it when the woman grabbed his face in her hands and kissed him lavishly of course cybil thought a man like that with all those secrets and heartaches would have an exotic lover and they would meet in a dim smoky bar where the music was dreamy and sad finding it wonderfully romantic she sighed onstage delta gave prestons cheeks an affectionate pinch so now you got women following you sugar lips shes a lunatic you want me to bounce her out no he didnt glance back but could feel those big green eyes on him im pretty sure shes a harmless lunatic deltas tawny eyes glittered with amusement then ill just check her out woman starts stalking my sugar lips i gotta see whats she made of right andre the skinny black man at the piano stopped noodling keys long enough to smile up at her out of a face as battered and worn as the old spinet he played that you do delta dont hurt her now shes just a little thing you ready to blow he asked preston you start ill catch up as delta glided offstage andres long narrow fingers began to make magic preston let the mood of it slide into him then closing his eyes let the music come it took him away it cleared his head of the words and the people and the scenes that often crowded his head when he played like this there was nothing but the music and the aching pleasure of making it hed once told delta it was like sex it dragged something out of you put something back and when it was over it was always too soon in the back cybil drifted into it slid down into those low bluesy notes rose up with the sudden wailing sobs it was different she thought watching him play than just hearing it through the walls watching him there was more power more heartbreak more of that subtle sexual pull it was music to weep by to make love to to dream on it caught her focused her on the stage so she didnt see delta moving toward her table whats your pleasure little sister hmm distracted cybil glanced up smiled vaguely its wonderful the music it makes my heart hurt delta lifted a brow the girl had a bright and pretty face she mused didnt look much like a lunatic with that tipped nose and those longlidded eyes you drinking or just taking up space oh of course cybil realized a place like this needed to sell drinks its whiskey music she said with another smile ill have a whiskey deltas brow only arched higher you dont look old enough to be ordering whiskey little sister cybil didnt bother to sigh it was an opinion she heard constantly she flipped open her purse pulled out her drivers license delta took it studied it all right cybil angela campbell ill get your whiskey thanks content cybil rested her chin on her fists again and just listened it surprised her when delta came back not with one glass of whiskey but two then folded that glamorous body into the chair next to her so what are you doing in a place like this young cybil you got a rainbow room face cybil opened her mouth then realized she could hardly say shed followed her mysterious neighbor all over soho i dont live far from here i suppose i just followed an impulse she lifted the whiskey gestured with it to the stage im glad i did she said then drank deltas lips pursed the girl might look like a varsity cheerleader but she drank her whiskey like a man you go wandering around the streets alone at night somebodys going to eat you up little sister cybils eyes gleamed over the rim of her glass oh i dont think so big sister considering delta nodded maybe maybe not delta pardue she touched her glass to cybils this is my place i like your place delta maybe maybe not delta let loose that rich laugh again but you sure like my man there youve had your pretty catseyes on him since you came in thoughtfully cybil swirled her whiskey while she debated how to play it though she had no doubt she could handle herself on the streets or anywhere else for that matter delta outweighed her by at least thirty pounds and as shed said it was her place her man no point in making a potential new friend want to rip out her lungs at their first meeting hes very attractive cybil said casually its hard not to look so ill keep looking if its all the same to you i doubt his eyes are going to wander when hes got someone like you in focus deltas teeth flashed in a brilliant grin maybe you can take care of yourself after all youre a smart girl arent you cybil chuckled into her whiskey oh yeah i am and i do like your place i like it a lot how long have you owned it delta this two years here and before its new orleans im hearing in your voice isnt it delta inclined her head you got good ears i do actually for dialects but yours is one i couldnt miss i have family in new orleans my mother grew up there i dont know any campbells whats your mamas maiden name grandeau delta eased back i know grandeaus many grandeaus are you kin to miss adelaide greataunt grand lady cybil snorted drank stuffy irritating and cold as winter the twins and i my brother and sister used to think she was a witch of the wicked sort she has power but it only comes from money and a name grandeau eh whos your mama genvieve grandeau campbell the artist miss gennie delta set her whiskey down so that she could rear back and thump a hand to her heart as she rocked with laughter miss gennies little girl comes into my place oh the world is a wonderful thing you know my mother my mama cleaned house for your grandmere little sister mazie youre mazies daughter oh instantly bonded cybil grabbed deltas hand my mother talked about mazie all the time we visited her once when i was a little girl she gave us beignets fresh and wonderful we sat on the front porch and had lemonade and my father did a sketch of her she put it in her parlor and was very proud i was in the city when your family came i was working my mama she talked of that visit for weeks after she had a place deep in her heart for miss gennie wait until i tell them i met you how is your mother delta she died last year oh cybil laid her other hand over deltas cupping it warmly im so sorry she lived a good life died sleeping so died a good death your mama and your daddy they came to the funeral they sat in the church they stood at the grave you come from good people young cybil yes i do so do you preston didnt know how to figure it there was delta a woman he considered the most sane of anyone he knew huddled together with the pretty crazy woman apparently already the fastest of friends sharing whiskey laughs holding hands the way women do for more than an hour they sat together in the back of the room now and then cybil would begin what could only have been one of her chattering monologues her hands gesturing her face mobile delta would lean back and laugh or lean forward shaking her head in amazement look at that andre preston leaned on the piano andre wiggled his fingers loose then lit a cigarette like a couple of hens in the coop thats a pretty girl there my man got sparkle to her i hate sparkle preston muttered and no longer in the mood to play tucked his sax in the case catch you next time ill be here he thought he should just walk out but he was just a little irritated to have his good friend getting chummy with his lunatic besides it would give him some satisfaction to let his nosy neighbor know he was onto her but when he stopped by the table cybil only glanced up and smiled at him hi arent you going to play anymore it was wonderful you followed me i know it was rude but im so glad i did i loved listening and i might never have met delta otherwise we were just dont do it again he said shortly and stalked to the door ooooh hes plenty pissed off delta said with a chuckle got that ice in his eyes chills down to bone i should apologize cybil said as she bolted to her feet i dont want him angry with you me hes ill come back soon she dropped a kiss on deltas cheek making the woman blink in surprise dont worry ill smooth things over when she dashed out delta simply stared after her then let out one of her long laughs little sister you got no idea what youre in for then again she mused neither does sugar lips outside cybil dashed down the sidewalk hey she shouted at his retreating back then cursed herself for not having the sense to ask delta what the mans name was hey risking a twisted ankle she switched from jog to run and managed to catch up im sorry she began tugging on the sleeve of his jacket really its completely my fault who said it wasnt i shouldnt have followed you it was impulse i have such a problem resisting impulse always have and i was irritated because of that idiot frank and well that doesnt matter i only wanted to could you slow down a little no cybil rolled her eyes all right all right you wish id get run over by a truck but theres no need to be upset with delta we just started talking and we found out that her mother used to work for my grandmother and she delta i mean knows my parents and some of my grandeau cousins so we hit it off he did stop now to simply stare at her of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world he muttered and made her laugh i had to follow you into that one and make pals with your girlfriend sorry my girlfriend delta and to cybils amazement the man could laugh really laugh with a wonderful baritone rumble that melted all the ice and made her sigh in delight does delta look like anyones girlfriend man you are from mars its just an expression i didnt want to be presumptive and call her your lover his eyes were still warm with amusement as he stared down at her thats a happy thought kid but the guy i was just jamming with happens to be her husband and a friend of mine the skinny man at the piano really pursing her lips cybil thought about it found it charming and romantic isnt that lovely preston only shook his head and started walking again what i meant was cybil continued hed just known she couldnt possibly be finished as she hurried along beside him im sure she came back to check me out you know to make sure i wasnt going to hassle you and then well one thing led to another i dont want you to be annoyed with her im not annoyed with her you on the other hand have gone so far beyond being an annoyance i cant find the word her mouth fell into a pout well im sorry and ill certainly make it a point to leave you alone since thats apparently what you like best her perky nose went up in the air and she sailed across the street in the opposite direction from their building preston stood there a moment watching her scissor those very pretty legs down the opposite sidewalk then with a shrug he turned the corner telling himself he was glad to be rid of her it wasnt his concern if she wandered around alone at night she wouldnt have been out walking around on those silly skinny heels if she hadnt followed him in the first place he wasnt going to worry about it and swearing he turned around headed back he was going to make sure she got home that was all back inside where he could wash any responsibility for her welfare off his hands and forget her he was still the best part of a crosstown block away when he saw it happen the man slid out of the shadows made his grab and had cybil letting out an earpiercing scream as she struggled preston dumped his case sprinted forward with his fists already clenched then skidded to an amazed halt as cybil not only broke free but doubled her attacker over with a hard knee to the groin knocked him flat with a perfect uppercut i only had ten lousy dollars in here ten lousy dollars you jerk she was shouting by the time preston gathered his wits and rushed up beside her if youd needed money why didnt you just ask you hurt yes damn it and its your fault i wouldnt have hit him so hard if i hadnt been mad at you noting that she was nursing the knuckles on her right hand preston grabbed it by the wrist lets see wiggle your fingers go away come on wiggle hey the shout came from a woman hanging out an open window across the street you want i should call the cops yes cybil snapped the word back as she wiggled her fingers and preston probed then blew out a steadying breath yes please thanks polite little victim arent you preston muttered nothings broken you might want to get it xrayed anyway thanks so much dr doom she jerked a hand away kept her chin lifted and gestured with her uninjured hand in what preston thought of as a grandly regal gesture you can go im just fine as the man sprawled on the sidewalk began to moan and stir preston set a foot on his throat i think ill just stick around why dont you go get my sax for me i dropped it back there when i still believed the big bad wolf ate red riding hood she nearly told him to go get it himself then decided if she had to hit the jerk on the sidewalk again shed hurt herself as much as him with stiff dignity she walked down the block picked up the case and carried it back thank you she said for what for the thought dont mention it preston added a bit more weight when the man on the ground began to curse when the squad car pulled up ten minutes later he stepped back cybil wasnt having any trouble giving the cops the details and preston harbored the hope that he could just slide away and stay out of it the hope died as one of the uniforms turned to him did you see what happened here preston sighed yeah and that was why it was nearly am before he trooped up the steps with cybil toward their respective apartments he still had the unappealing taste of police station coffee in his mouth and a lowgrade headache on the brew it was kind of exciting wasnt it all those cops and bad guys it was hard to tell one from the other in the detective bureau well you could because the detectives have to wear ties i wonder why it was nice of them to show me around you should have come the interrogation rooms look just the way you imagine they would dark and creepy he was certain she had to be the only person on the planet who could find a sunny side to being mugged im wired she announced arent you wired want some cookies i still have plenty he nearly ignored her as he dug out his keys then his stomach reminded him he hadnt eaten anything for the past eight hours and her cookies were a minor miracle maybe great she unlocked her door left it open stepping out of her shoes as she walked to the kitchen you can come in she called out ill put them on a plate for you so you can take them back and eat them in your own den but theres no point in waiting in the hall he stepped in leaving the door open behind him he should have known her place would be bright and cheerful full of cute and classy little accents with his hands in his pockets he wandered around tuning out her bubbling chatter while she transferred cookies from a canister in the shape of a manically grinning cow to the same brightyellow plate shed used before you talk too much i know she skimmed a hand over her spiky bangs especially when im nervous or wired up are you ever otherwise now and then he noted a scatter of framed photos several pairs of earrings another shoe a romance novel and the scent of apple blossoms each suited her he thought as perfectly as the next then he paused in front of a framed copy of a comic strip on the wall friends and neighbors he mused then studied the signature under the last section it read simply cybil this you she glanced over yes thats my strip i dont imagine you spend much time reading the comics do you knowing a dig when he heard one he looked back over his shoulder it must have been the late hour he decided after a long day that made her look so fresh and pretty and appealing grant campbell macintosh that your old man hes not old but yes hes my father the campbells preston mused meant the macgregors and wasnt that a coincidence he moved over to stand on the opposite side of the counter and help himself to the cookies she was arranging in a stylish circular pattern i like the edge to his work im sure hell appreciate that because he was reaching for another cookie cybil smiled want some milk no got a beer with cookies she grimaced but turned to her refrigerator preston had a chance to see it was well stocked as she bent down which gave him a chance to appreciate just what snug black slacks could do for a perky womans excellent butt and retrieved a bottle of becks dark this do its what chuck likes chuck has good taste boyfriend she smirked getting out a pilsner glass before he could tell her hed just take the bottle i suppose that indicates that im the type to have boyfriends but no hes jodys husband jody and chuck myers just below you in b i was out to dinner with them tonight and jodys excessively boring cousin frank is that what you were muttering about when you came home was i muttering she frowned then leaned on the counter and ate one of his cookies muttering was another habit she kept trying to break probably its the third time jodys roped me into a date with frank hes a stockbroker thirtyfive single handsome if you like that lanternjawed chiseledbrow sort he drives a bmw coupe has an apartment on the upper east side a summer place in the hamptons wears armani suits enjoys frenchprovincial cuisine and has perfect teeth amused despite himself preston washed down cookies with cold beer so why arent you married and looking for a nice splitlevel in westchester ah youve just voiced my friend jodys dream and ill tell you why she wagged a cookie then bit in one i dont want to get married or move to westchester two and really more to the point i would rather be strapped to an anthill than strapped to frank whats wrong with him he bores me she said then winced thats so unkind why sounds honest to me it is honest she picked up another cookie ate it with only a little guilt hes really a very nice man but i dont think hes read a book in the last five years or seen a movie a few selected films perhaps but not a movie then he critiques them i dont even know him and im already bored that made her laugh and reach for another cookie hes been known to check out his grooming in the back of his spoon at the dinner table just to make sure hes still perfect and he can spend the rest of his life and yours talking about annuities and stock futures and all that aside he kisses like a fish really he forgot hed wanted to grab a handful of cookies and get out and how is that exactly you know she made an o with her mouth then laughed you can imagine how a fish kisses which i suppose they dont but if they did i nearly escaped without having the experience tonight then jody got in the way and it doesnt occur to you to say no of course it occurs to me her grin was quick and completely selfdeprecating i just cant seem to get it out in time jody loves me and for reasons that continue to elude me she loves frank shes sure wed make a wonderful couple you know how it is when someone you care about puts that kind of benign pressure on you no i dont she tilted her head remembering his empty living room no furniture and now no family thats too bad as inconvenient as it may be from time to time i wouldnt trade it for anything hows the hand he asked when he saw her rubbing her knuckles oh a little sore still itll probably give me some trouble working tomorrow but i should be able to turn the experience into a good strip i cant see emily laying a mugger out on his ass cybils face glowed on a grin you do read it now and again she was entirely too pretty he thought suddenly entirely too bright and it was abruptly too tempting to find out if she tasted the same way thats what happened preston supposed when you hung around eating homemade cookies in the middle of the night with a woman who made her living looking at the light side of life you dont have your fathers edge or your mothers artistic genius but you have a nice little talent for the absurd she let out a half laugh well thank you so much for that unsolicited critique no problem he picked up the plate thanks for the cookies she narrowed her eyes as he headed for the door well he was going to see just how much of a talent she had for the absurd in some upcoming strips she decided hey he paused glanced back hey what you got a name apartment b yeah ive got a name a its mcquinn he balanced his beer and his plate and shut the door between them chapter three contents prev next when scenes and people filled her head cybil could work until her fingers cramped and refused to hold pencil or brush she spent the next day fueled on cookies and the diet soft drinks she liked to pretend balanced out the cookie calories on paper section by section emily and her friend cari who over the last couple of years had taken on several jodylike attributes plotted and planned on how to discover the secrets of the mr mysterious she was going to call him quinn but not for several installments for three days she rarely left her drawing board jody had a key so it wasnt necessary to run down and let her in every time she dropped over for a visit and jody was always happy enough to dash down to open the door for mrs wolinsky or one of the other neighbors who stopped by at one point on the third evening enough people were in the apartment to have put together a small informal party while cybil remained coloring in her big sunday strip someone had turned on the stereo music blared but it didnt distract her laughter and conversation rose up the stairs and there was a shout of greeting as someone else dropped in she smelled popcorn and wondered idly if anyone would bring her some leaning back she studied her work no she didnt have her fathers edge she acknowledged or her mothers genius but all in all she did indeed have a nice little talent she had a quick and clever hand at drawing she could paint quite well really she mused if the mood was right the strip gave her an arena for her own brand of social commentary perhaps she didnt dig into sore spots or turn a sarcastic pencil toward politics but her work made people laugh it gave them company in the morning over their hurried cup of coffee or along with a lazy sunday breakfast more than anything she thought as she signed her name it made her happy if mcquinn in b thought his careless comment insulted her he was wrong she was more than content with her nice little talent flushed with the success of three days intense work she picked up the phone as it rang and all but sang into it hello well well theres a cheery lass grandpa cybil leaned back in her chair and stretched cramped muscles yes im a cheery lass and theres no one id rather talk to than you technically daniel macgregor wasnt her grandfather but that had never stopped either of them from thinking of him as such love ignored technicalities is that so then why havent you called me or your grandmother you know how she worries about you down there in that big city all alone alone amused she held out the phone so the sounds of the party downstairs would travel through the receiver to hyannis port it doesnt feel as if im ever alone youve got the place full of people again so it seems how are you how is everyone tell me everything she settled back happy to chat with him about family her aunts and uncles her cousins the babies she listened and laughed added her own comments and was pleased when he told her there was a family gathering in the works for the summer wonderful i cant wait to see everyone again its been too long since ian and naomis wedding last fall i miss you well then why do you have to wait until summer were right here after all maybe ill surprise you i called with one for you ill wager you havent heard as yet that little naomis expecting well have another bairn under the christmas tree this year oh grandpa thats wonderful ill call them tonight and with darcy and mac ready to have theirs any day well have lots of babies to cuddle this christmas for a young woman so fond of babes you ought to be busy making your own it was an old theme and made her grin but my cousins are doing such a fine job of it hah that they are but that doesnt mean you can shirk your duty little girl you may be a campbell by birth but youve got some macgregor in your heart well i could always give in and marry frank the one with the fish mouth no he just kisses like a fish then again yeah the one with the fish mouth we could make you some guppies bah you need a man not a trout in an italian suit a man with more on his mind than dollars and cents with an understanding of art with enough of a serious nature to keep you out of trouble i keep myself out of trouble she reminded him but decided it was best not to mention the mugging incident besides grandma wont let me have you so ill just have to pine away here in the big bad city he let out a bark of a laugh all the men in that city you ought to be able to find one to suit you you get out and about dont you youre not sitting there all day writing your funny papers just lately but i hit a hot streak here and needed to run with it theres this new guy across the hall kind of surly and standoffish no actually lets just say it straight hes rude and abrupt i think hes out of work except he plays the sax sometimes in this little club a few blocks from here hes just the perfect new neighbor for emily is that so he stays inside his apartment all day doesnt talk to anyone his names mcquinn if he doesnt talk to anyone how do you know his name grandpa she allowed herself a smug smile have you ever known me to fail getting anyone to talk to me if i put my mind to it not that hes the chatty sort even when you prime his pump with cookies but i wheedled his name out of him and how does he look to you little girl he looks good very very good hes going to drive emily crazy is he now daniel said and laughed with delight when hed gotten all that he needed to know out of his honorary granddaughter daniel made his next call he hummed to himself examined his nails buffed them on his shirt then grinned fiercely when preston answered the phone with an impatient yeah what ah youve such a sweet nature to you mcquinn it warms my heart mr macgregor there was no mistaking that booming scottish burr in an abrupt shift of mood preston smiled warmly and pushed away from his computer right you are and how are you settling in to the apartment there well enough i have to thank you again for letting me use it while my house is a construction zone id never have been able to work with all those people around he scowled at the wall as the noise from across the hall battered against it not that its much better here tonight my neighbor seems to be celebrating something cybil shes my granddaughter you know sociable child youre telling me i didnt realize she was your granddaughter well in a roundabout way you ought to shake yourself loose boy and join the party no thanks hed rather drink drain cleaner i think half the population of sohos crammed in there this building of yours mr macgregor is full of people whod rather talk than eat your granddaughter appears to be the leader friendly girl it comforts me to know youre across the hall for a bit youre a sensible sort mcquinn i dont mind imposing by asking you to keep an eye on her she can be naive if you get my meaning i worry about her preston had the image of her flattening a mugger with the speed and precision of a lightweight boxer and smiled to himself i wouldnt worry well i wont knowing youre close by pretty young thing like cybil she is a pretty thing isnt she cute as a button smart too and responsible for all it seems like shes fluttering through life you cant be a dimwitted flutterer and produce a popular comic strip day after day now can you got to be creative artistic and practical enough to meet deadlines but you know about that sort of business dont you writing plays isnt an easy business no preston rubbed his eyes gritty from fighting with work that refused to run smooth its not but youve a gift mcquinn a rare one i admire that its been feeling like a curse lately but i appreciate it you should get yourself out take your mind off it kiss a pretty girl not that i know much about writing though ive two grandchildren who make their living from it and damn well too you should make the most of being right there in the city before you take yourself back and lock the doors on your house maybe i will oh and mcquinn youll do me the favor of not mentioning to cybil that i asked you to mind her a bit shed get huffy over it but her grandmother worries herself sick over that girl she wont hear it from me preston promised since the noise was going to drive him crazy preston took himself off he played at the club but found it didnt quite get him past the thoughts that jangled in his brain it was too easy to imagine cybil sitting at the table in the back her chin on her fists her lips curved her eyes dreamy shed invaded one of his more wellguarded vaults and he resented it bitterly deltas was one of his escapes there were times hed drive into the city from connecticut just to slip onto the stage with andre and play until all the tension of the day dissolved into then out of the music he could drive home again or if the hour grew too late just drop down on the cot in deltas back room and sleep until morning no one bothered him at the club or expected more than he wanted to give but now that cybil had been here hed started to look at that back table and wondered if shed slip in again to watch him with those big green eyes my man andre said as he stopped to take a long drink from the water glass he kept on his beloved piano you aint just playing the blues tonight you got em yeah looks like usually a woman tangled up there when a mans got that look about him preston shook his head scowling as he lifted the sax to his lips no no woman its work andre merely pursed his lips as preston sent out music that throbbed like a pulse you say so brother if you say so he got home at three prepared to beat on cybils door and demand quiet it was a letdown to arrive and discover the party was over there wasnt a sound coming from her apartment he let himself in locked up then told himself hed take advantage of the peace after brewing a pot of coffee strong enough to dance on he settled back at his machine back into his play back into the minds of characters who were destroying their lives because they couldnt reach their own hearts the sun was up when he stopped when the sudden rush of energy that had flooded him drained out again he decided it was the first solid work hed managed in nearly a week and celebrated by falling facedown and fully dressed into bed and there he dreamed of a pretty face framed by a fringe of glossy brown hair offset by longlidded and enormous eyes the color of willow fronds of a voice that bubbled like a brook why does everything have to be so serious she asked him laughing as she slid her arms up his chest linked them around his neck because lifes a serious business thats only onehalf of one of the coins there are lots and lots of coins arent you going to dance with me he already was they were in deltas and though it was empty the music was playing low and sultry im not going to keep my eye on you i cant afford it but you already are the top of her head reached his chin when she tilted her head back flicked her tongue lazily over his jaw he felt the rush of his own blood thats not all you want to keep on me is it i dont want you there was that laugh light as air frothy as champagne whats the point of lying she asked him in your own dreams you can do anything you want to me in dreams it wont matter i dont want you he said again even as he pulled her to the floor he awoke sweating tangled in sheets appalled amazed and finally when his head started to clear amused the woman was a menace he decided and the only thing that had reflected any sort of reality in the painfully erotic dream was that he didnt want her he rubbed his hands over his face glanced at the watch still on his wrist since it was after four in the afternoon he judged hed gotten the first decent eight hours of sleep hed had in nearly a week so what if it was at the wrong end of the time scale he trooped down to the kitchen drank the dregs of the coffee and rooted out the only bagel that still looked edible he was going to have to break down and buy some food he spent an hour working out mechanically lifting weights reminding his body it wasnt built to simply sit at a keyboard pleased that the sweat hed worked up this time had nothing to do with sexual fantasies he spent another twenty minutes indulging in a hot shower and shaved for the first time in three or maybe it was four days he thought he might take himself out for a decent meal which would be a nice change of pace then hed face the tedium and lowgrade horror of going to the market dressed and feeling remarkably clearheaded and cheerful he opened his door cybil dropped the hand shed lifted to ring his buzzer thank god youre home his mood wavered as his thought zoomed right back to the dream and the barroom floor what you have to do me a favor no i dont its an emergency she grabbed his arm before he could walk by its life and death my life and very possibly mrs wolinskys nephew johnnys death because one of us is going to die if i have to go out with him which is why i told her i had a date tonight and you think this interests me because oh dont be surly now mcquinn im a desperate woman look she didnt give me time to think im a terrible liar i mean i just dont lie very often so im bad at it she kept asking who i was going out with and i couldnt think of anybody so i said you because shed meant it when shed told him she was desperate she darted in front of him to block his path kid let me point out one simple fact this isnt my problem no its mine i know it and i would have made something better up if she hadnt caught me when i was working and thinking of something else she lifted her hands pushed them through her hair and had it standing in spikes shes going to be watching dont you see shes going to know if we dont go out of here together she whirled away to pace and rap her knuckles against her temples as if to stimulate thought look all you have to do is walk out of here with me give an appearance of a nice casual date well go have a cup of coffee or something spend a couple of hours then come back because shell know if we dont come back together too she knows everything ill give you a hundred dollars that stopped him the basic absurdity of it pulled him up short at the head of the stairs youll pay me to go out with you its not exactly like that but close enough i know you can use the money and its only fair to compensate you for your time a hundred dollars mcquinn for a couple hours and ill buy the coffee he leaned back against the wall studying her it was just ridiculous enough to appeal to a sense of the absurd hed all but forgotten he had no pie her laugh erupted on a gush of relief pie you want pie you got pie wheres the c note the oh the money hold on she dashed back into her apartment he could hear her running up the steps slamming around just let me fix myself up a little she called out meters running kid okay okay where the hell is my ah two minutes two minutes i dont want her to tell me id hold on to a man if id just put on lipstick he had to give her credit when she said two minutes she meant it she ran back out her feet in another pair of those skinny heels her lips slicked with deep pink and earrings dangling mismatched again he noted as she handed him a crisp hundreddollar bill i really appreciate this i know how foolish it must seem i cant stand to hurt her feelings thats all her feelings are worth a hundred bucks to you its your business entertained he stuffed the bill in his back pocket lets go im hungry oh do you want dinner i can spring for a meal theres a diner just down the street good pasta okay now pretend you dont know shes keeping her eye out for us she murmured as they walked to the entrance just look natural hold my hand will you why oh for heavens sake she snatched his hand linked her fingers firmly with his then shot him a bright smile were going on a date our first try to look like were enjoying ourselves you only gave me a hundred he reminded her surprised when she laughed god youre a hard man b a really hard man lets get you a hot meal and see if it improves your mood it did but it would have taken a stronger man than he to hold out against an enormous familystyle bowl of spaghetti and meatballs and cybils sunny disposition its great isnt it she watched him plow through the food with pleasure poor man she thought probably hasnt had a decent meal in weeks i always eat too much when i come here they give you enough for six starving teenagers with each serving then i end up taking home the rest and eating too much the next day you can save me from that and take mine home with you fine he topped off their glasses of chianti you know i bet there are dozens of clubs downtown that would be thrilled to hire you to play huh your sax she smiled at him luring him to look at her mouth that flickering dimple and wonder again youre so good i cant imagine you wont find steady work really soon amused he lifted his wine she thought he was an outofwork musician fine then why not gigs come and they go do you work private parties inspired she leaned on the table i know a lot of people someones always having a party i bet they are in your little world i could give your name out if you like do you mind traveling where am i going some of my relatives own hotels atlantic citys not far i dont suppose you have a car he had a snazzy new porsche stored in a downtown garage not on me she laughed nibbled on bread well its not difficult to get from new york to atlantic city as entertaining as it was he thought it wise to steer off awhile cybil i dont need anyone to manage my life terrible habit of mine unoffended she broke the bread in half and offered him part i get involved then im annoyed when other people do the same to me like mrs wolinsky the current president of lets find cybil a nice young man club it drives me crazy because you dont want a nice young man oh i suppose i will eventually coming from a big family sort of predisposes you or me anyway into wanting one of your own but theres lots of time for that i like living in the city doing what i want when i want id hate to keep regular hours which is why nothing ever stuck before cartooning not that it isnt work or doesnt take discipline but its my work and my time like your music i guess i guess his work was very rarely a pleasure as hers seemed to be but his music was mcquinn smiling she nudged her bowl to the side thinking it would make him a very nice meal later in the week how often do you really rip loose and come up with more than oh say three declarative sentences in a row during a conversation he ate the last half of his last meatball studied her i like november i talk a lot in november its the kind of transitory month that makes me feel philosophical three on the button and clever too she laughed at him you have a sly sense of humor in there dont you sitting back she sighed lustily want dessert damn right okay but dont order the tiramisu because then id be forced to beg you for a bite then two then id end up stealing half of it and go into a coma keeping his eyes on hers he signaled for the waitress with the casual authority of a man used to giving orders it made cybils brow crease tiramisu he told the waitress two forks and made cybil weak with laughter i want to see if putting you into a coma actually shuts you up wont she patted her chest as the last laugh bubbled out i even talk in my sleep my sister used to threaten to put a pillow over my head i think id like your sister adrias gorgeous probably just your type too cool and sophisticated and brilliant she runs an art gallery in portsmith preston decided they might as well finish off the wine it was a very nice chianti he mused which probably explained why he was feeling more relaxed than he had in weeks months he corrected maybe years so are you going to fix me up with her she might go for you cybil considered eyeing him over her glass and enjoying the happy little buzz the wine had given her youre greatlooking in a sort of rough idontgiveadamn way you play a musical instrument which would appeal to her love and appreciation of the arts and youre too nasty to treat her like royalty too many men do do they he murmured realizing that his talkative dinner companion was well on her way to being plowed shes so beautiful they cant help it worse shes irritated when theyre dazzled by the way she looks so she ends up tossing them back shed probably end up breaking your heart she added gesturing with her glass but it might be good for you i dont have a heart he said when the waitress brought their dessert i thought youd figured that out sure you do with a sigh of surrender cybil picked up her fork scooped up the first bite and tasted with a long moan of pleasure youve just got it wrapped in armor so nobody can bayonet it again god isnt this wonderful dont let me eat any more than this one bite okay but he was staring at her amazed that the little lunatic across the hall had zeroed in on him so accurately so casually when those who claimed to love him had never come close why do you say that say what didnt i tell you not to let me eat any more of this are you a sadist never mind deciding to let it go he yanked the plate out of her reach mine he said simply and proceeded to eat the rest he only had to poke her once with his fork to hold her off well i had fun cybil tucked her arm through his as they walked back toward their building really that was so much more entertaining than an evening trying to keep johnny from sliding his hand up my skirt for some reason the image irritated him but preston merely glanced down youre not wearing a skirt i know i wasnt sure i could get out of the date and this was my automatic defense system the breezy saffroncolored slacks struck him abruptly as more sexy than defensive so why dont you just break johnnys face like you did the muggers the other night because mrs wolinsky adores him and id never be able to tell her that the apple of her eye has hands like an ape i think thats a mixed metaphor but i get the picture youre a pushover am not are so he said before he caught himself and fell too deeply into the childish game you let your friend joanie jody right push her cousin on you and the old lady downstairs sticks you with her nephew with the fast hands and god knows how many other friends you have dumping their castoff relatives in your lap all because you cant just say butt out they mean well theyre meddling with your life it doesnt matter what they mean oh i dont know she blew out a breath and smiled at a young couple strolling on the opposite side of the street take my grandfather well hes not really my grandfather if you get picky which we dont hes my dads sister shelbys fatherinlaw and on my mothers side shes cousin to the spouses of his other two children its a little complicated if you get picky which you dont exactly theres all this convoluted family connection between daniel and anna macgregor and my parents so why niggle my aunt shelby married their son alan macgregor you might have heard of him he used to live in the white house the name rings a distant bell and my mother the former genvieve grandeau is a cousin of justin and diana blade siblings who married respectively daniel and annas other two children serena and caine macgregor so daniel and anna are grandpa and grandma is that clear yes i can follow that but ive forgotten the entire point of the exercise me too she laughed in delight then had to tighten her grip before she overbalanced a little too much wine she explained anyway let me think yes i have it meddling we were talking about meddling which my grandfather who would be daniel macgregor is the uncontested world champ at when it comes to matchmaking he knows no peer im telling you mcquinn the man is a wizard i have she had to stop use her fingers to count um i think its seven cousins so far hes managed to match up marry off hes terrifying what do you mean match up he just sort of finds the right person for them dont ask me how then he works out a way to put them together let nature take its course and before you know it youve got wedding bells and bassinets he just told me my cousin ian and his wife are expecting their first they were married last fall the mans batting a thousand does anyone tell him to butt out oh constantly she tipped up her head and grinned he just doesnt pay attention i figure hes going to work on adria or mel next give my brother matthew time to season what about you oh im too slick for him i know his canny tricks and im not going to fall in love for years what about you ever been there where would that be love mcquinn dont be dense its not a place its a situation and theres nothing there oh i think there will be she said dreamily eventually for the second time she pulled up short oh damn thats johnnys car hes come in from new jersey after all damn damn damn okay heres the plan she whirled around shook her head clear when it spun i should never have had that last glass of wine but im still master of my fate you bet you are kid enough to know you call me kid so you can feel superior and aloof but thats beside the point were just going to stroll on down a few more feet until were right in front of her window very natural okay thats a tough one but ill see what i can do i just love that nasty streak of sarcasm okay this is fine this is good now were going to stand right here because shes watching i promise any minute youll see her curtains twitch look for it because it seemed harmless and he was starting to enjoy the way she held on to him he flicked a glance over her head right on cue so youre going to have to kiss me his gaze shot back to hers am i and youre going to have to make it look good if you do it right shell figure johnnys a lost cause for a while anyway and ill give you another fifty he ran his tongue around his teeth she had her face tipped back and looked as appealing as a single rosebud in a garden of thorns youre going to pay me fifty bucks to kiss you like a bonus this could send johnny back to jersey for good just think of it as being onstage doesnt have to mean anything is she still watching yeah but he wasnt looking at the window now and didnt have a clue great good make it count okay romantic just slide your arms around me then lean down and i know how to kiss a woman cybil of course you do no offense meant whatsoever but this should be choreographed so that he decided the only way to shut her up was to get on with it and to get on with it his way he didnt slide his arms around her he yanked her against him and nearly off her feet he had one glimpse of those big green eyes widening in shock before his mouth crushed down on hers and sent the next babbling words sliding down her throat he was right that was her last dizzy thought he was absolutely right he did know how to kiss a woman she had to grab on to his shoulders had to rise up to her toes she had to moan her head was spinning in fast giddy circles her heart had flipped straight into her throat to block any chance of air it made her feel helpless lost shaky as his mouth pumped heat like a furnace into her body and his mouth was so hard so hard and stunningly hungry what else could she do but let him feed it was like the dream he thought only better much much better her taste hadnt been so unique in his imagination her body hadnt trembled with quick hard little shock waves her hands hadnt clawed their way up into his hair to fist while she moaned pure pleasure into his mouth he yanked her back but only to see if her eyes had gone dark if heat had climbed into her cheeks the way he felt it climb through his system she only stared at him her breath coming short and fast through parted lips her hands still clutched in his hair next ones on me he murmured and took her under again a horn blasted someone cursed there was a rush of displaced air from a passing car someone shoved an apartment window open and let out a stream of blistering rock music and the acrid smell of burned dinner she might have been on a deserted island with crystalblue waves crashing at her feet when he drew her away the second time he did so slowly with his hands skimming down from her shoulders to her elbows then back in a gesture that stopped only a hint short of a caress it gave her enough time to feel her head revolve once like a slowmotion merrygoround before it settled weakly on her shoulders he wanted to lap her up on the spot every inch of that flushed lovely skin to devour her innate and to him misplaced cheerfulness that shone out of her like sunlight he wanted all that impossible unflagging energy under him over him open to him and he had no doubt that once he had hed leave them both bitter now the hands that lingered on her shoulders eased her back off her toes steadied her released her i think that ought to do it do it she echoed staring up at him satisfy mrs wolinsky mrs wolinsky absolutely blank she shook her head oh oh yeah she blew out a long breath and decided her system might settle sometime before the end of the next decade if it doesnt its hopeless youre awfully good at it mcquinn a reluctant smile flitted around his mouth the woman was damn near irresistible he thought and taking her arm turned her toward the front of the building youre not halfbad at it yourself kid chapter four contents prev next cybil sang as she worked belting out a duet with aretha franklin behind her the open window welcomed the cool april breeze and the amazing noise that was the downtown streets in brilliant sunshine the stream of light was no sunnier than her mood turning to the mirror on the wall beside her she tried to work her face into a state of shock to help her with a character expression but all she could do was grin shed been kissed before shed been held by and against a man before as far as she was concerned comparing all her other experiences to that stunning sidewalk embrace with the man across the hall was like pitting a firecracker against a nuclear attack one hissed popped and was momentarily entertaining the other detonated and changed the landscape for centuries it had left her marvelously dizzy for hours she loved the sensation adored every moment of that giddy slackmuscled purely feminine rush could there be anything more wonderful than feeling weak and strong foolish and wise confused and aware all at the same time and all she had to do was close her eyes let her mind wander back to feel it all over again she wondered what he was thinking what he was feeling no one could be unaffected by an experience of that magnitude and after all hed been right there with her at ground zero a man couldnt kiss a woman like that and not suffer some potent residual effects suffering cybil decided as her body tingled was highly underrated she chuckled she sighed then bending over her work sang with aretha about the joys of feeling like a natural woman god cyb its freezing in here cybil looked up beamed hi jody hi sweet charlie the baby gave her a sleepyeyed smile as jody strode to the window with him cocked on her hip youre sitting in front of an open window it cant be more than sixty degrees out there with a little grunt jody shoved the window closed i was feeling kind of warm cybil set her pencil aside to stroke charlies pudgy cheek its miraculous isnt it that men start out this way as pretty little babies then they wow boy do they grow up into something else yeah puzzled jody frowned examined her friends somewhat glassy eyes you look funny are you okay jody laid a maternal hand on cybils forehead no fever stick out your tongue cybil obeyed crossing her eyes as she did and making charlie bubble with laughter im not sick im fabulous i feel like a million after taxes hmm unconvinced jody pursed her lips im going to put charlie down for his morning nap hes zonked then ill get us some coffee and you can tell me whats going on sure umhmm dreaming again cybil picked up a red pen and began to doodle pretty little hearts on scrap paper since that was fun she drew larger ones sketching prestons face inside one he had a great one she mused hard mouth cool eyes very strong features set off by that thick dark hair but that mouth softened a bit when he smiled and his eyes werent cool when he laughed she loved making him laugh he always sounded just a little out of practice she could help him with that she mused drawing his face again with the warmth of laughter added after all one of her nice little talents was making people laugh and after shed helped him find some steady work he wouldnt have so much to worry about shed get him some work make certain that he ate regular meals she was always cooking too much for one person anyway and she was sure she could find someone who had a secondhand sofa they were willing to part with on the cheap she knew enough people to start the ball rolling here and there for him hed feel better wouldnt he once he was more settled in more secure it wouldnt be like meddling that was her grandfathers territory she would just be helping out a neighbor a gorgeous sexy neighbor who could kiss a woman straight into the paradise of delirium of course that wouldnt be why she was doing it cybil shook herself turned the scraps of paper over a little guiltily shed helped mr peebles find a good podiatrist hadnt she and nobody would consider him a cooleyed adonis with great hands would they of course not she was just being a good neighbor and if there were any other benefits well so what satisfied with her plans she folded her legs under her and got back to work jody settled the baby thinking as she always did when she tucked him in that he was the most beautiful child ever to grace the planet when his heavy eyes shut his blanket was smoothed and his favorite teddy bear left on guard she trotted downstairs to turn down the music as at home in cybils kitchen as her own she poured morning coffee into two thick yellow mugs sniffed out a couple of cranberry muffins then loaded up a tray the midmorning ritual was one of her favorite parts of the day in the past few years cybil had become as close as a sister to her closer jody thought wrinkling her nose her own sisters were always bragging about their husbands their kids their houses when anyone could see her chuck and her charlie were miles superior but cybil listened cybil had held her hand through the difficult decision to quit her job and stay home with the baby fulltime it had been cybil whod stood by during those early days when she and chuck had been panicked over every burp and sniffle charlie had made there was no better friend in the world which was why jody was determined to see cybil blissfully happy she carried the tray up set it on the table then handed cybil her mug thanks jody great strip this morning i cant believe emily decking herself out in a trench coat and fedora and tailing mr mysterious all over soho where does she get this stuff shes a creature of impulse and drama cybil broke off a piece of a muffin it was usual for them to discuss emily and the other characters as separate people and shes nosy she just has to know what about you did you find out anything yet about our mr mysterious yeah cybil said it on a sigh his names mcquinn i heard that instantly alert jody jabbed out a finger you sighed no i was just breathing uhuh you sighed what gives well actually she was dying to talk about it we sort of went out last night went out like a date quickly jody pulled over a chair sat leaned close where how when details cyb okay so cybil swiveled so they were face to face you know how mrs wolinskys always trying to fix me up with her nephew not again jody rolled her dark eyes why cant she see you two are totally wrong for each other vast affection prevented cybil from mentioning that it might be the same selective blindness that prevented jody from seeing the flaws in the cybilfrank match she just loves him but anyway shed cooked up another date for me for last night and i just couldnt face it you have to swear you wont tell her or anyone except chuck husbands are excluded from the vow of silence in this case i told her i already had a date with mcquinn you had a date with b no i just told her i did because i was flustered you know how i start babbling when i lie you should practice nodding jody bit into a muffin youd get better at it maybe so after i tell her i realize shes going to be looking for us to leave together and i have to cut some kind of deal with mcquinn to go along with it i gave him a hundred and bought him dinner you paid him jodys eyes widened then narrowed in speculation thats brilliant the whole time i was dating especially during that drought period i told you about my sophomore year in college i never thought about just offering a guy some money to have dinner with me howd you settle on the hundred do you think thats like the going rate it seemed right hes not working regularly you know and i figured he could use the money and a hot meal we had a good time she added with a new smile really good just spaghetti and conversation well mostly onesided conversation as mcquinn doesnt say a lot mcquinn jody let the name roll over her tongue still sounds mysterious you dont know his first name it never came up anyway it gets better were walking back i think i loosened him up jody he really seemed relaxed almost friendly then i see johnny wolinskys car and i panicked im figuring shes not going to stop trying to shove him at me unless she thinks ive got a guy so i cut another deal with mcquinn and offered him fifty bucks to kiss me jody pursed her lips then sipped coffee i think you shouldve said that was included in the hundred no wed already defined terms and there wasnt time to renegotiate she was looking out the window so he did right there on the sidewalk wow jody grabbed the rest of her muffin what move did he use he just sort of yanked me against him oh man the yank i really like the yank then i was plastered there up on my toes because hes tall yeah jody chewed licked crumbs off her lips hes tall and built really built jody i mean the man is like a rock oh god on the moan jody rubbed her stomach wow okay so youre plastered up there on your toes what next then he just swooped ohoh the yank and swoop crumbs scattered as jody waved her hands its a classic hardly any guy can really pull it off though chuck did on date six thats how we ended up back at my apartment eating chinese in bed mcquinn pulled it off he really really pulled it off then while my head was exploding he yanked me back just looked at me man man then he just did it all again a double near tears with vicarious excitement jody gripped cybils hand you got a double there are women who go all their lives without a double dreaming of yes but never achieving the double yank and swoop it was my first cybil confessed it was great okay okay just the kiss part okay just the lips and tongues and teeth thing how was that it was very hot oh im going to have to open the window im starting to sweat she jumped up shoved up the window and took a deep gulp of air so it was hot very hot keep going it was like being well devoured when your system just goes at a loss she lifted her hands wiggled them wildly and your heads circling around about a foot above your shoulders and i dont know how to describe it youve got to desperate jody squeezed cybils shoulders im on the edge here try this on the onetoten scale where did it hit cybil closed her eyes there is no scale theres always a scale you can say off the scale but theres always a scale no jody there is no scale eyeing cybil jody stepped back the no scale is an urban myth it exists cybil said soberly the no scale exists my friend and has now been documented sweet lord i have to sit down she did so her eyes never leaving cybils face you experienced a no scale i believe you cyb thousands wouldnt millions would scoff but i believe you i knew i could count on you you know what this means dont you hes ruined you for anything less even a ten wont satisfy you now youll always be looking for the next no scale ive thought of that considering cybil picked up her pencil to tap i believe its possible to live a full and happy life hitting with some regularity between seven and ten even after this experience man goes to the moon jody travels through space and time finds himself on another world but only briefly he must come back to earth and live thats so wise jody murmured and had to dig a tissue out of her pocket so brave thank you but in the meantime cybil added with a grin theres no harm in knocking on the door across the hall from time to time because she didnt want to appear overanxious cybil put in a full mornings work she didnt break until after two when she thought her neighbor might enjoy sharing a cup of coffee maybe a nice walk in the april sunshine he really had to get out of that apartment more she decided take advantage of all the city had to offer she imagined him brooding behind his locked door worried about his lack of employment the bills she was certain she could help him with that there was no reason she couldnt put a buzz in a few ears and get him a few gigs to tide him over she heard the sax begin to weep as she stood in her bedroom fussing with her makeup it made her tingle again the low sexy throb of it he deserved a break something to take that cynical gleam out of his eyes something that would prove to him life was full of surprises she wanted to help him there was a quality about him an underlying unhappiness she was driven to smooth away after all shed made him laugh shed helped him relax if she could do it once she could do it again she badly wanted to see him laugh again to hear that sardonic edge to his voice when he made some pithy comment to see that grin flash when she said or did something that got through his cynical shield and if they lit a few sexual sparks between them while she was at it what was wrong with that she was on her way downstairs and singing again when the buzzer from the entrance door sounded on her intercom yes im looking for mcquinn a no hes b well damn it why doesnt he answer oh he probably doesnt hear you hes practicing buzz me in will you sweetie im his agent and im running way behind his agent cybil perked up if he had an agent cybil wanted to meet her shed already thought of half a dozen names to pass on for possible jobs sure come on up she released the door then opened her own and waited the woman who stepped out of the littleused elevator looked very professional very successful cybil noted with some surprise in her snazzy power suit of dropdead red she was thin and wiry with a sharpfeatured face darkblue eyes that were snapping with annoyance and an incredibly fabulous mane of streaked blond hair she moved with the precision of a bullet and carried a leather briefcase that cybil estimated cost the equivalent of a months rent on a good uptown apartment so she mused why was her client scrambling for work if his agent could afford designer duds and pricey accessories a yes im cybil amanda dresher thanks cybil our boy here isnt answering his phone and apparently forgot we had a one oclock at the four seasons the four seasons baffled cybil stared on park is there another with a laugh mandy pressed the buzzer on b and knowing her prey held it down our prestons loaded with talent but hes my biggest pain in the butt preston it only took a minute for the confusion to form settle then clear away preston mcquinn she let out a shaky breath that was equal parts betrayal and mortification a tangle of souls thats our boy mandy said cheerfully come on come on mcquinn answer the damn door i thought when he decided to stay in the city for a couple months id be able to keep better track of him but its still an obstacle course ah here we go they both heard the badtempered snick of locks being turned then he yanked open the door what the hell do you mandy you missed lunch she snapped youre not answering the phone i forgot lunch the phone didnt ring did you charge the battery probably not he stood where he was staring across the hall to where cybil watched him with wounded eyes in a pale face come on in just give me a minute ive already given you an hour she tossed a glance over her shoulder as she walked inside thanks for buzzing me up sweetie no problem no problem at all then cybil looked preston dead in the eye you bastard she said quietly and closed her door dont you have any place to sit in here mandy complained behind him no yes upstairs damn it he muttered despising the slide of guilt doing his best to shrug it off he closed his door i dont use the space down here much no kidding so whos the kid across the hall she asked as she set her briefcase on the kitchen counter nobody campbell cybil campbell i thought she looked familiar friends and neighbors i know her agent hes crazy about her claims shes the only egoproof neurosisfree client hes ever had never whines doesnt miss deadlines never demands coddling and is currently making him a fat pile of money on the sales of her trade books and calendars plus the merchandising tieins she sent preston a baleful look i wonder what its like to have a neurosisfree client who remembers lunch dates and sends me gifts on my birthday the neuroses are part of the package but im sorry about lunch annoyance faded into concern whats up preston you look ragged out is the play stalled no its moving better than i expected i just didnt get a lot of sleep out playing your horn till all hours again no thinking of the woman in a he thought pacing the floor wanting the woman in a the woman who now undoubtedly considered him a slightly lower lifeform than slime just a bad night mandy okay because as irritated as he could make her she cared about him she crossed the room to give his tensed shoulders a brisk rub but you owe me lunch how about some coffee theres some on the stove it was fresh at six this morning lets start over then ill make it she moved behind the counter after she had the coffee going she poked into the cupboards she considered prestons welfare part of her job god mcquinn are you on a hunger strike theres nothing in here but potatochip crumbs and what once might have been crackedwheat bread and is now a science project i didnt make it to the market yesterday again his gaze flicked to the door and his mind to cybil mostly i call in dinner on the phone you dont answer ill recharge the battery mandy see that you do if youd remembered sooner wed be sitting in the four seasons right now drinking cristal to celebrate she grinned as she leaned on the counter toward him i closed the deal preston a tangle of souls is going to be a major motion picture you got the producers you wanted the director you wanted and the option to do the screenplay yourself all that plus a tidy little fee she gave him ah amount in seven figures i dont want them to screw it up was prestons first reaction leave it to you mandy sighed if theres a downside you find it so do the screenplay no he shook his head walking to the window to try to absorb the news a film would change the intimacy the play had achieved in the theater but it would also take his work to millions and the work mattered to him i dont want to go back there mandy not that deep she poured two cups of coffee and joined him at the window supervisory capacity consultant yeah that works for me fix it will you i can do that now if youll stop turning cartwheels and dancing on the ceiling we can talk about your work in progress her dry tone got through made his lips twitch he set his coffee on the windowsill turned and took her sharpboned face in his hands youre the best and certainly the most patient agent in the business youre so right i hope youre as proud of yourself as i am are you going to call your family let me sit on it a couple days its going to hit the trades preston you dont want them to hear about it that way no youre right ill call them finally he smiled after i charge the phone why dont i clean up and take you out for that champagne why dont you oh one more thing she added as he started for the stairs pretty miss a are you going to tell me whats going on between you im not sure theres anything to tell he murmured he still wasnt sure when he knocked on her door later that evening but he knew he had to answer for that look hed put in her eyes not that it had been any of her business in the first place he reminded himself he hadnt asked her to come nosing around in fact hed done everything to discourage her until last night he thought and hissed out a breath bad judgment he decided it had just been bad judgment he shouldnt have followed impulse and gone along with her shouldnt have compounded the mistake by enjoying himself or by kissing her which he wouldnt have done his mind circled back if she hadnt asked him to when she pulled open the door he was ready with an apology look im sorry he began delivering it with an impatient edge of annoyance but it was none of your business anyway lets just straighten this out he started to step in coming up short when she slapped a hand on his chest i dont want you in here for gods sake you started it maybe i let it get out of hand but started what this he snapped furious at the sudden lack of words hating the kickedpuppy look in her eyes all right i started it i should never have brought you cookies that was devious of me i shouldnt have worried that you didnt have a job shouldnt have bought you a decent meal because i thought you couldnt afford it on your own damn it cybil you let me think that you let me believe you were some poor outofwork musician and im sure you had a few private laughs over it the brilliant awardwinning playwright preston mcquinn author of the stunning emotionally wrenching a tangle of souls but i bet youre surprised i even know your work a bubblehead like me she shoved him back a step what would a fluffy comicstrip writer know about real art after all about serious theater about literature why shouldnt you have a few laughs at my expense you narrowminded arrogant creep her voice broke when shed promised herself she wouldnt let it i was only trying to help you i didnt ask for your help i didnt want it he could see she was close to tears the closer she got the more furious he became he knew how women used tears to destroy a man he wouldnt let it happen my works my own business your works produced on broadway that makes it public business she shot back and that has nothing to do with pretending to be a sax player i play the damn sax because i like to play the damn sax i didnt pretend to be anything you assumed you let me assume what if i did i moved in here for a little peace and quiet to be left alone the next thing i know youre bringing me cookies then youre following me and im spending half the night in the police station then youre asking me to go out so you can slip by a seventyyearold woman because you dont have the guts to tell her to butt out of your personal life and you top it off by offering me fifty dollars to kiss you humiliation had the first tear spilling over trailing slowly down her cheek and making his stomach clench dont the order whipped out of him dont start that dont cry when you humiliate me when you make me feel stupid and ridiculous and ashamed she didnt bother to dash the tears away but simply looked at him out of unapologetically drenched eyes sorry i dont work that way i cry when someone hurts me you brought it on yourself he had to say it was desperate to believe it and escaped by stalking to his own door you have the facts preston she said quietly you have them all in an accurate row but youve missed the feelings behind them i brought you cookies because i thought you could use a friend ive already apologized for following you but ill apologize again i dont want im not finished she said with such quiet dignity he felt one more wave of guilt i took you to dinner because i didnt want to hurt a very nice woman and i thought you might be hungry i enjoyed being with you and i felt something when you kissed me i thought you did too so youre right she nodded coolly even as another tear slid down her cheek i did bring it all on myself i suppose you save all your emotions for your work and cant find the way to let them into your life im sorry for you and im sorry i trod on your sacred ground i wont do it again before he could think of how to respond she shut her door he heard her locks slide into place with quick deliberate clicks turning he let himself in to his own apartment followed her example by closing then locking the door behind him he had what he wanted he told himself solitude quiet she wouldnt come knocking on his door again to interrupt his thoughts to distract him to tangle him up in feelings and conversations he didnt want in feelings he didnt know what to do with and he stood exhausted by the storm and sick of himself staring at an empty room chapter five contents prev next he couldnt sleep except in patches and the patches were riddled with dreams in them he would find himself wrapped around cybil his back in a corner up against a wall at the edge of a cliff it always seemed as if shed maneuvered him there where there was nowhere to go but to her and when he did the dreams became brutally erotic so that when he managed to rip himself from them he found himself aroused furious and filled with the memory the taste of her in his mouth he couldnt eat found himself picking at food when he bothered with it at all nothing satisfied him everything reminded him of that simple meal theyd shared a few nights before he lived on coffee until his nerves jangled and his stomach burned in protest but he could work it seemed he could always flow into a story into his people when his emotions were pumped it was painful to tear those feelings out of his own heart and have the characters he created gobble them greedily up but he relished the exchange even fed on it he remembered what cybil had said before shed closed the door on him that he used all his emotions in his work and didnt know how to let them into his life she was right and it was better that way there were to his mind very few people he could trust with feelings his parents his sister though his need to fulfill their expectations of and for him was a doubleedged sword then delta and andre those rare friends he allowed himself and who expected no more from him than what he wanted himself mandy who pushed him when he needed pushing listened when he needed to unburden and somehow managed to care about him even when he didnt he didnt want a woman digging her way into his heart not again hed learned his lesson there and had kept any and all applicants since pamela out of that vulnerable territory shed cured him he thought with lies deceptions betrayals a man could learn a good deal at the tender age of twentyfive that held him in good stead for the duration since hed stopped believing in love he never wasted time looking for it but he couldnt stop thinking of cybil hed heard her go out several times in the last three days hed been distracted more than once by the laughter and voices and music from her apartment she wasnt suffering he reminded himself so why was he it was guilt he decided hed hurt her and it had been neither necessary nor intentional hed been charmed by her reluctantly but charmed nonetheless he hadnt meant to make her feel foolish to bruise her feelings tears could still rip at him even knowing how false and sly they could be when they slid down a womans cheek but they hadnt looked false or sly on cybil he remembered theyd looked as natural as rain he wasnt going to resolve the problem his problem he thought until hed settled with her he hadnt apologized well he could admit that so hed apologize again now that shed had some time to get those emotions of hers she was so free with under some control there was no reason for them to be enemies after all she was the granddaughter of a man he admired and respected he doubted daniel macgregor would return the compliment if he learned that preston mcquinn had made his little girl cry and preston realized daniel macgregors opinion mattered to him so a little voice nagged at him did cybils that was why he was pacing the living area of his apartment instead of working hed heard her go out again but hadnt been quite quick enough to get downstairs and into the hall before shed gone he could wait her out preston thought she had to come back sometime and when she did hed head her off and offer her a very civilized apology it was blatantly obvious the woman had a soft heart shed have to forgive him once she had they could go back to being neighbors there was the matter of the hundred dollars as well which instead of amusing him as it had initially now made him feel nasty he was sure shed be ready to laugh the whole thing off now how long could that kind of cheerful nature hold a grudge he would have been surprised to find out just how long and how well if hed seen cybils face as she rode the elevator up to the third floor it annoyed her outrageously that she had to pass the mans door to get to her own it infuriated her that doing so made her think of him remember how stupid shed been and how much more stupid hed made her feel she shifted the weight of the two bags of groceries she carried in either arm and tried to dig out her key so she wouldnt have to linger in the hallway a second longer than necessary the elevator gave its usual announcing thud when it reached her floor she was still searching for the elusive key when she stepped off her teeth set when she saw him and her eyes went frosty cybil hed never seen her eyes cold and the chill of them threw him off rhythm ah let me give you a hand with those i dont need a hand thank you she could only pray to grow a third one rapidly that could find her bloody keys yes you do if youre going to keep rooting around in that purse he tried a smile then scowled as they played tugofwar with one of her bags in the end he just wrenched it out of her grip look damn it i said i was sorry how many times do i have to say it before you get out of this snit youre in go to hell she shot back how many times do i have to say it before you start to feel the heat she finally snagged the key jabbed it into the lock give me my groceries ill take them in for you i said give me the damn bag they were back to tugging until she hissed out a breath keep them then she shoved open the door but before she could slam it in his face hed shoved it open again and pushed his way inside their eyes met both narrowed and he thought he caught a glint of violence in hers dont even think about it he warned her im not an underweight mugger she thought she could still do some damage but decided it would only make him seem more important than shed determined he would be instead she turned on the heel of her pink suede sneakers dumped her bag on the counter when he did the same she nodded briskly thanks now youve delivered them want a tip very funny lets just settle this first he reached in his pocket where hed folded the hundreddollar bill shed given him here she flicked the money a disinterested glance im not taking it back you earned it im not keeping your money over what turned out to be a bad joke bad joke the ice in her eyes turned to sharp green flames is that what it was well haha now that you bring it up i owe you another fifty dont i that hit the mark had his jaw clenching as she grabbed up her purse dont push it cybil take the money back no i said take the damn money he grabbed her wrist yanked her around and crumpled the bill into her palm now then watched in astonishment as she ripped a hundred dollars into confetti there problem solved that he said on what he hoped was a calming breath was amazingly stupid stupid well why break pattern you can go now she said her voice was so suddenly regal so completely princess to peon he nearly blinked very good very effective he murmured the ladyofthemanor tone was so utterly unexpected her next suggestion delivered in the same haughty tone was also utterly unexpected to the point and made him blink that works too he acknowledged and i dont think you meant that in a romantic sense she simply turned stalked around the counter and began to put away her groceries if insults and swearing didnt work perhaps ignoring him would it might have if he hadnt seen her fingers tremble as she pushed a box into the cupboard and seeing it he felt everything inside him fade but the guilt cybil im sorry he watched her hand hesitate then grab a soup can and shove it away it took on a life of its own and i didnt do anything to stop it i should have you didnt have to lie to me id have left you alone i didnt lie or didnt start out to but i let you assume something other than the truth i want my privacy i need it youve got it im not the one who just bullied his way into someones apartment no youre not he stuck his hands in his pockets dragged them out again and laid them on the counter i hurt you and i didnt have to im sorry for it she closed her eyes as she felt the gate shed sworn to keep locked on her heart creak open why did you because i thought it would keep you on your own side of the hall because you were a little too appealing for comfort and because part of me got a kick out of you wanting to help me find work he saw her shoulders draw up at that and winced i didnt mean it that way cybil how could i not be amused when you offered me a hundred dollars to have dinner with you a hundred dollars so you could spare an old womans feelings and get some outofwork sax player a hot meal it was sweet thats not a word that comes easy to me its humiliating she muttered and grabbed the second bag and began shoving produce into the fridge dont let it be he took a chance and walked around the counter so they both stood in the kitchen it only backfired because the timing was off and thats my fault if id told you who i was over dinner as i should have youd have laughed about it instead i made you cry and i cant stand knowing that she stood where she was staring into the refrigerator she hadnt expected him to care for it to matter to him but it did she simply couldnt hold out against a caring heart drawing a deep breath she told herself they would start fresh try for casual friends want a beer every knot in his shoulders loosened oh yeah figured she reached in for a bottle disposed of the top reached for a glass i havent heard you talk so much at one time since i met you when she turned offering the beer her eyes were smiling you must be dry thanks her dimple fluttered but im out of cookies you could always make some more maybe she turned away to deal with the groceries but i was thinking about baking a pie tossing a look over her shoulder she lifted a brow we never did have that pie no we didnt too appealing for comfort he thought again she was wearing an oversize cotton shirt plain white leggings the color of summer skies those silly shoes since shed been marketing he doubted that the justunderthesmolderingpoint perfume had been dabbed on to please anyone but herself and had no idea why she would wear two gold hoops in one ear and a single diamond stud in the other but it all combined into one fascinating package when she turned back to reach into the bag again he took her wrist with his free hand are we on level ground now looks like then theres something else he set the beer down i dream about you now it was her mouth that went dry and her stomach erupted with the crazed flapping of a hundred wings what i dream about you he repeated and stepped forward until her back was against the refrigerator her back against the wall this time he thought not his about being with you touching you watching her face he skimmed his fingertips over the tops of her breasts and i wake up tasting you oh god you said you felt something when i kissed you and thought i did too with his eyes still on hers he ran his hands down her sides to her hips you were right weak at the knees she swallowed hard i was yeah and i want to feel it again she strained back as he leaned forward wait his mouth paused a breath from hers why and her mind went blank i dont know his lips curved in one of his rare smiles stop me when you do he suggested then captured her it was the same she was sure it wouldnt be couldnt be the same fast hot spin of heart and mind and body but all those parts of her seemed to have been waiting and poised to leap jody was right she thought dimly hed ruined her bright fresh soft as a sunbeam she was all those things warm sweet generous all the things hed forgotten to need were trembling in his arms and he wanted them wanted her with a quick punch of greed he hadnt expected on an oath he savaged her throat here right here no it was the last thing shed expected to hear come out of her own mouth when his hands were making her ache for more even as the need roared in her blood she said it again no wait he lifted his head kept eyes that had gone the color of a storm at sea on hers why because i her head fell back on a moan when his hands slow and firm stroked up her body awakening every pore i want you his thumbs circled her breasts over them you want me yes but her hands opened and closed on his shoulders as she fought off a new spurt of longing there are a few things i dont let myself do on impulse im really sorry to say this is one of them she opened her eyes again let out one more shaky breath how closely he watched her she realized how sharply even with desire clouding his mind he could step back from it look through it and measure its not a game preston he lifted a brow surprised that shed understood his thoughts so clearly no no he decided because he believed her you wouldnt be good at that kind of game would you someone had been she thought and was suddenly brutally sorry for him i dont know ive never played it he stepped back shrugged and seemed completely in control again while her system continued to jangle unconsciously she lifted her fingertips to her throat where his mouth had aroused dozens of raw nerves i need time before i share myself that way making love is a gift and shouldnt be given thoughtlessly her words touched him and for reasons he couldnt understand settled him it often is not for me she shook her head not from me because he had a sudden urge to stroke her cheek he hooked his thumbs in his front pockets better not to touch again he reasoned not quite yet and telling me that is supposed to make me content to step back telling you that is supposed to make you understand why i said no when i want to say yes when we both know you could make me say yes heat flicked into his eyes thats a dangerous kind of honesty you have there you need the truth she didnt believe shed ever known anyone who needed it more and i dont lie to men im planning to be intimate with he stepped forward again watched her lips tremble on a strangled breath he could make her say yes and the power of that was heady using it he realized would damage something he wasnt completely sure he believed existed you need time he said you got an estimate on that her breath shuddered out again right now it feels like five minutes ago but she managed a weak laugh when his lips curved i cant really say except youll be the first to know maybe we could shave a couple of days off it he murmured and indulged himself by leaning down to rub his lips over hers hoping it would focus her she kept her eyes open but her vision went blurry at the edges um yes thats probably going to work lets shoot for a week he murmured deepening the kiss degree by degree until she went limp when he stepped back she pressed a hand to her heart fortnight ive always liked that word havent you we could try for a fortnight the last thing hed expected to do when buffeted by desire was laugh i think well save that one for later right good smart she concentrated on breathing as he turned and picked up his beer well i have all this she gestured vaguely food he suggested delighted by her bewilderment food yes i have all this food i thought id fix some he waited a beat while she pressed her hand to her temple and frowned at the stove dinner thats it ha dinner funny how words just skip out of reach sometimes im going to fix dinner she blew out a breath would you like to stay for dinner he sipped his beer leaned back against the counter can i watch you cook sure you can sit there and maybe slice vegetables or something okay because the idea had amazing appeal he skirted the counter to sit on a stool you cook a lot yes i guess i really like to cook its an adventurous process all the ingredients heat timing the mix of smells and textures and tastes so do you ever cook naked she paused in the act of sniffing a glossy red pepper giggling she set it on the counter between them mcquinn you made a joke she put a hand over his squeezed im so proud no i didnt that was a perfectly serious question when she laughed leaned over to grab his face and kiss him noisily on the mouth he wouldnt have recognized his own foolish grin so do you never when im sautéing chicken which is what im about to do thats all right i have an excellent imagination she laughed again then catching the wicked gleam in his eyes cleared her throat i think i want some wine do you want wine he only lifted his nearly full glass of beer oh yeah she took a bottle of white out of the refrigerator then turned back giggling again youre going to have to stop that stop what stop making me think im naked go put on some music she ordered waving a hand toward the living area maybe open a window because its really hot in here and give me a minute to clear the lust out of my head so i can think of something else to talk about you never have trouble talking you consider that an insult she said as he slid off the stool i dont im a conversation connoisseur is that the current term for chatterbox well youre just full of wit and humor tonight arent you and nothing could have pleased her more must be the company he murmured then cocked a brow as he flipped through her cds you have decent taste in music you were expecting otherwise i wasnt expecting fats waller aretha bb king of course youve got plenty of chirpy stuff in here too whats wrong with chirpy music in answer he held up a cd of the partridge familys greatest hits i rest my case excuse me but that was given to me by a very dear friend and it happens to be a classic a classic what obviously you have no appreciation for nostalgia and have failed to recognize the sly underlying social commentary of david cassidys rendition of i think i love you or the desperate sexual motivation that permeates the mood of doesnt somebody want to be wanted but id be happy to discuss them with you i bet you actually know the lyrics she managed to swallow the chuckle and began to wash the vegetables naturally during a brief shining period in my youth i was in a band right he settled on bb lead vocals and rhythm guitar the turbos she smiled as he walked back to the counter jesse lead guitar was into cars you play guitar yes well i played the guitar a hot red fender which i imagine my mother still has in my old room along with my toe shoes my chemistry set the sketches i made when i was going to be a fashion designer and the books i collected on animal husbandry before i realized that if i became a vet id have to euthanize animals as well as play with them she laid a cutting board on the counter selected the proper knife from her block they were all quests fascinating he thought the woman was absolutely fascinating fender guitars and toe shoes were quests i couldnt make up my mind what i wanted to be everything i tried was so much fun at first then it was just work do you know how to slice peppers no dont you consider what you do now work of a sort she sighed and began to slice the peppers herself yes and its not of a sort either its a lot of work but its still fun dont you enjoy writing rarely she looked up again then why do you do it it wont let me do anything else its my only quest she nodded switching to fat white mushrooms its like that for my mother she never wanted to do anything but paint sometimes when i watch her working i can see how painful it is for her to have a vision and to have to pull out all her skills to transfer what she wants to communicate to canvas but when shes finished when its right she glows the satisfaction maybe even the shock of seeing what shes capable of doing i suppose it would be like that for you she glanced up saw him studying her speculatively it always surprises you when i understand something other than whats right on the surface doesnt it he grabbed her hand before she could turn away if it does it only means im the one who doesnt understand you im likely to keep offending you until i do im ridiculously easy to understand no thats what i thought i was wrong youre a maze cybil with dozens of twists and turns and unexpected angles her smile bloomed slowly beautifully thats the nicest thing youve ever said to me im not a nice man youd be smart to boot me out lock your door and keep it that way being smart ive figured that out for myself already however gently she laid a hand to his cheek you seem to be my new quest until it stops being fun and just becomes work his eyes were so serious she thought and he was so ready to believe the worst mcquinn youre already work and youre still sitting in my kitchen she smiled again do you know how to slice carrots into pencil sticks i dont have a clue then watch and learn next time youre going to have to carry your weight she peeled a carrot clean with a few quick experienced strokes then flicked a glance up at him am i still naked do you want to be she laughed and picked up her neglected wine it took a long time to cook a simple meal when you were distracted by conversation by lingering looks by seductive touches it took a long time to eat a simple meal when you were sliding lazily into love with the man across from you she recognized the signs the erratic beating of the heart the bubbling in the blood that was desire when those were tangled so silkily around dreamy smiles and soft sighs love was definitely a short trip away she wondered what it would be like when she reached it it took a long time to say goodnight when you were floating on deep dark kisses in the doorway and longer still to sleep when your body ached and your mind was full of dreams when she heard the faint drift of his music she smiled and let it lull her to sleep chapter six contents prev next with his hair still wet from his morning shower preston sat at his own kitchen counter on one of cybils stools shed insisted he borrow he scanned the paper as he ate cold cereal and bananas because cybil had pushed both on him once shed gotten a look at his cupboards even a kitchen klutz which apparently meant him could manage to pour milk onto cold cereal and slice a banana shed told him hed decided against taking offense though he didnt think he was quite as clumsy in the kitchen as she did hed managed to put a salad together hadnt he while shed done something incredible and marvelous to a couple of pork chops the woman was one hell of a cook he mused and was rapidly spoiling his appetite for the quick slaptogether sandwiches he often lived on it didnt seem to bother her that they hadnt gone out to dinner since that first meal shed cooked for him he imagined she would before much longer tire of preparing the evening meal and demand a restaurant people generally got itchy for a change of pace when the novelty wore off and routines became ruts and he supposed they already had a kind of routine they kept to their separate corners during the day well except for the couple of times shed dropped by and persuaded him to go out to the market just for a walk to buy a lamp he glanced back toward his living room frowning at the whimsical bronze frog holding up a triangularshaped lamp shade he still wasnt sure how shed talked him into buying such a thing or into paying mrs wolinsky for a secondhand recliner shed wanted to get rid of and rightfully so he decided who the hell wanted a greenandyellow plaid recliner in their living room but somehow he had one which despite its hideous looks was amazingly comfortable of course if you had a chair and a lamp you needed a table his was a sturdy chippendale in desperate need of refinishing and as cybil had pointed out a bargain because of it she just happened to have a friend who refinished furniture as a hobby and would put him in touch she also just happened to have a friend who was a florist which explained why there was a vase of cheerful yellow daisies on prestons kitchen counter another friend of which preston had decided she had a legion painted new york street scenes and sold them on the sidewalk and couldnt he use a couple of paintings to brighten up the walls hed told her he didnt want to brighten anything but there were now three very decent original watercolors on his wall she was already making noises about rugs he didnt know how she worked it preston thought shaking his head as he went back to his breakfast she just kept talking until you were pulling out your wallet or holding out your hand but they kept out of each others way well there had been saturday afternoon when shed invaded with buckets and mops and brooms and god knows what if he was going to live in a place shed told him at least it could be clean and somehow hed ended up spending three hours of a rainy afternoon when he should have been writing scrubbing floors and chasing down dust then again hed nearly gotten her into bed very nearly gotten her there he remembered when shed stood in speechless shock at the state of his bedroom shed gotten her voice back quickly enough and had launched into a lecture he should have more respect for his workplace if not for his sleeping area since they seemed to be one in the same why the hell did he keep the curtains drawn over the windows did he like caves did he have a religious objection to doing laundry hed grabbed her out of selfdefense and had stopped her mouth in the most satisfying of ways and if they hadnt tripped over a small mountain of laundry on the way to the bed he doubted theyd have ended the afternoon with a trip to the cleaners still there were advantages he thought he appreciated a clean space even though he rarely noticed a messy one he liked tumbling into bed on freshly laundered sheets though he would have preferred to tumble on them with cybil and it was hard to complain when you opened a cupboard and found actual food even the sexual frustration was working for him the writing was pouring out of it and out of him maybe the play had taken a turn on him focusing now more on a female character one with a shining naiveté and enthusiasm a woman alive with energy and optimism and one whod be seduced by and damaged by a man who had none of those things inside him a man who wouldnt be able to stop himself from taking them from her then leaving her shattered he saw the parallels well enough between what he created and what was but he refused to worry about it he sipped his coffee reminding himself to ask cybil why his always tasted faintly of swamp water and turned to the comic section to see what shed been up to he skimmed it frowned then went back to the first section and read it again she was already at work her window open because spring had decided to be kind a lovely warm breeze wafted through along with the chaos of street noise after her sheet of paper was set and scaled she set her tsquare back in its place in the custombuilt tool area shed designed to suit herself she tilted her head facing the first blank section it was double the size of what would appear in the dailies in a couple of weeks she already had it in her mind the setup the situation and the punch line that would comprise those five windows and give the readership their morning chuckle over coffee the elusive mr mysterious now known as quinn huddled in his dim cave writing the great american novel sexy cranky irresistible quinn so serious so intense in his own little world he was completely unaware that emily was crouched on his fire escape peering through the narrow chink of his perpetually drawn curtains struggling to read his work in progress through a pair of binoculars amused at herself because in her own way cybil knew her subtle little probes and questions on how his play was going were the more civilized version of her counterparts voyeurism she settled down to lightly sketch her professional interpretation of the man across the hall she exaggerated ruthlessly his good points and his bad the tall muscular body the ruggedly chiseled looks the cool eyes his rudeness his humor and his perpetual bafflement with the world emily lived in poor guy she thought he doesnt have a clue what to do with her when the buzzer sounded she tucked her pencil behind her ear thinking jody had forgotten her key she stopped to top off her coffee cup on the way just hang on coming then she opened the door and experienced one more rapid meltdown his hair was just a little damp and he wasnt wearing a shirt boy oh boy just look at those pecs she thought and barely resisted licking her lips his jeans were faded his feet bare and his face his face was so wonderfully serious and sober hi she managed to make it sound bright and easy while she pictured herself biting him you run out of soap in the shower need to borrow some what no hed forgotten he was only halfdressed i want to ask you about this he continued lifting the paper sure come on in it would be safe she told herself jody would be there any minute and stop her from jumping preston why dont you get some coffee and come up im working and its rolling pretty well i dont want to interrupt but not much does she said cheerfully over her shoulder as she started up the stairs theres cinnamon bagels if you want one no hell he thought and ended up pouring a cup of coffee and taking a bagel after all he hadnt been upstairs before since hed never come over when she was working he tormented himself by glancing into her bedroom studying the big bed with its bold blue cover and sumptuous mountain of jeweltoned pillows the slim rods of the white iron headboard where he could imagine trapping her hands under his as he finally did everything he wanted with her to her it smelled of her fresh female with seductive undertones of vanilla she kept rose petals in a bowl a book beside the bed and candles in the window find everything she called out he shook himself yeah listen cybil he stepped into her studio god how do you work with all that noise she barely glanced up what noise oh that she continued to sketch using a new pencil as shed forgotten the one behind her ear sort of like background music half the time i dont hear it the room looked efficient and creative with its neat shelves holding both supplies and clever tchotchkes he recognized the work of the sidewalk artist in one of the paintings on her wall and the genius of her mother in two others there was a complex and fascinating metal sculpture in the corner a little clutch of violets tucked into a glass inkwell and a cozy divan heaped with more pillows against the wall but she didnt look efficient bent over the big slanted board with her legs folded up under her the toenails of her bare feet painted pink a pencil behind one ear and a gold hoop in the other she looked scattered and sexy curious he walked around to peer over her shoulder an act that he admitted had anyone dared to try on him would have earned the offender a quick and painful death what are all the blue lines for scaling perspective takes a little math before you can get down to business i work in five windows for the dailies she continued sketching easily i have to set them on paper like this work out the theme the gag the hit so that the strip can move from start to finish in five connected beats satisfied she moved to the next section i sketch it in first just need to see how it hangs youd say a draft where you get the story line down then decide where it needs to be punched up ill give it more details fiddle a bit before i switch to pen and ink he frowned focusing on the first sketch is that supposed to be me hmm why dont you pull up a stool youre blocking the light what is she doing there ignoring the suggestion he tapped a finger on the second window spying on me youre spying on me dont be ridiculous you dont even have a fire escape outside your bedroom she looked into her mirror made several faces that left him staring at her then started on the third section what about this he demanded rapping the paper on her shoulder what about it god you smell fabulous pleasing herself she turned and sniffed him what kind of soap is that are you going to have this guy take a shower next when she pursed her lips in obvious consideration preston shook his head no there has to be a line i was oddly amused when you introduced this parody of me into the script but he broke off as he heard her front door open and slam shut whos that that would be jody and charlie so youve gotten a kick out of the new guy she stopped sketching and shifted to smile up at him i wondered because you hadnt mentioned it before you know some people dont even recognize themselves they just have no selfawareness i suppose but i thought youd see it if you happened to read the strip hi jody theres charlie hi it wasnt an easy matter even for a happily married woman to keep her tongue from falling out when she was so suddenly and unexpectedly faced with a wellmuscled naked male chest uh hi are we interrupting no preston just had some questions about the strip i love the new guy hes really got emily in a spin i cant wait to see what happens next she broke into a wide grin as charlie exploded out a da and reached for preston he calls every man he sees da chucks a little put out by it but charlies just a guys guy you know right absently preston ran a hand over charlies downy brown hair i just want to get something straight about how this thing is going he began turning back to cybil da charlie said again arms extended hopefully smile sleepy just how close to reality do you work preston asked automatically taking the baby and settling him on his shoulder cybils heart simply melted you like babies no i toss them out of thirdstory windows at every opportunity he said impatiently then shook his head when jody squeaked relax hes fine what i want to know is this business here shifting the baby he dropped the comic section on her board oh the no scale bit this is really part one theyll run the second half of it tomorrow i think it works chuck and i fell over laughing when we read it this morning jody put in relaxed again as she watched preston absently patting the nowsleeping baby youve got these two women here emily and cari i know who they are by now preston muttered narrowing his eyes at both women theyre discussing theyre rating for gods sake the way quinn kissed emily a couple days ago uhhuh chuck laughed cybil wanted to know i wondered if men would get it or if it would just hit with women oh yeah he died over it pardon me with what he considered admirable restraint preston held up a hand id like to know if the two of you sit around here discussing your various sexual encounters and then rating them on a scale of one to ten before you then give the american public a good chuckle over it with their corn flakes discussing them eyes wide and innocent cybil stared up at preston honestly mcquinn this is a comic strip youre taking it too seriously so all this about the no scale is just a bit what else he studied her face i wouldnt like to think that when i finally get you into bed im going to read about my performance in five sections in the morning paper oh my oh well jody patted a hand on her heart i think ill just take charlie and go put him down for his nap she eased him out of prestons arms and hurried out mcquinn cybil smiled tapped her pencil i have a feeling that event would be worth the full sunday spread is that a threat or a joke when she only laughed he spun her stool around then knocked the air out of her lungs with a fierce and demanding kiss tell your friend to go away and well find out no im keeping her shes all that stopped me from biting your throat when you came in are you trying to drive me crazy not really its kind of a side effect her pulse had gone from slow shuffle to manic tap dance youve got to go ive finally found a distraction i cant work through and youre it seeing no reason he should go crazy alone he leaned down one last time and took her mouth when you speak of this he caught her bottom lip between his teeth drawing it erotically through them and i expect you will be accurate he walked to the doorway turning back in time to see her shudder no scale he said realizing he suddenly found it not just amusing but gratifying when she managed to do nothing more than make one helpless gesture with her hands he laughed and was still grinning when he jogged down her steps and out the door safe jody whispered poking her head into the doorway oh god god jody what am i going to do here shaken cybil stabbed the second pencil behind her ear knocked the first out of place and didnt even bother to curse i thought i had it all figured out i mean whats wrong with easing yourself into what promises to be a blistering roofraising affair with an incredibly intense gorgeous interesting man let me think holding up a finger jody strolled in and picked up the coffee preston had never touched okay ive got it nothing the answer to that question is nothing and if youre a little bit in love with him that only sweetens the deal right absolutely otherwise its fun but sort of like eating too much chocolate at one sitting you enjoy it when its going on then you feel a little queasy and ashamed but what if you went all the way in what do you do when youve gone over the brink jody set down the coffee you went over the brink just now oh honey all sympathy jody wrapped her arms around cybil and rocked its all right it had to happen sooner or later i know but i always thought it would be later we all do he wont want me to be in love with him itll just annoy him turning her face to jodys shoulder she let out a shaky breath im not too happy about it myself but ill get used to it sure you will poor frank with a sigh jody patted cybils shoulder then stepped back he never really had a shot did he sorry oh well jody dismissed her favorite cousin with an absent flick of the wrist what are you going to do i dont know i guess running and hidings out thats for wimps yeah wimps how about pretending itll go away thats for morons cybil drew a bracing breath how about shopping now youre talking on a quick salute jody headed for the door ill see if mrs wolinsky will watch charlie then well handle this problem like real women she bought a new dress a slinky length of black sin that made jody roll her eyes and declare the mans a goner when cybil tried it on she bought new shoes milehigh heels as thin as honed scalpels she bought new lingerie the kind women wear when they expect it to be seen by a man wholl then be compelled to rip it off and she imagined prestons wide hands and long fingers peeling the silkyascobwebs hose down her legs then there were flowers to choose candles wine marketing for a meal she would design to tease the senses and whet the palate for a more primitive kind of appetite by the time she got home she was loaded down and she was calm there was a scene to be set and doing so gave her focus because she wanted to take the rest of the day to prepare because she needed it to be perfect she wrote a note to preston and stuck it to her door then she locked herself in drew a deep breath and took everything up to the bedroom she arranged tender lilies and fragrant rosebuds in vases in bowls and set them on tables the dresser the windowsills then she grouped candles all white a trio here a single there a halfdozen scented tealights on a circle of mirrored glass some she lit so the room would fill with soft light and gentle fragrance while she worked she unwrapped two slenderstemmed wineglasses placed them just so on the low table in front of the curved wicker chaise reminded herself to chill the wine facing the bed she stopped considered would turning down the duvet and sheets be too obvious then she laughed at herself why stop now when it was done when she could look around the room and see there was nothing that wasnt as she needed it to be she went down to make the early preparations for the meal she intended to cook she listened hoping hed begin to play so that some of him would come inside her rooms with her but his apartment remained silent with careful deliberation she chose music for mood arranging cds in her changer satisfied she went back up laid her new dress on the bed shivered in anticipation as she set the black lace bra and the blatantly provocative matching garter belt beside it and imagined what it would feel like to wear them powerful she decided secretive and certain she shivered again thrilling to the clutch of lust deep in her center then went to draw a hot frothy bath she poured wine lit more candles to promote the mood before she slipped into the tub and closing her eyes she imagined prestons hands rather than the frothy water on her nearly an hour later she was slathering every inch of her body with cream sliding her fingers along to make certain her skin was silky and scented when preston tugged her note off the front door mcquinn ive got plans ill see you later cybil plans plans she had plans when hed worked himself into a turmoil over her all day he read the note again furious with both of them as he hadnt been able to get the image of spending yet another foolish evening with her out of his head for gods sake hed gone out and bought her flowers he hadnt bought flowers for a woman since he crumpled the note in his hand what else could he expect women were first and foremost tuned to their own agenda hed known it accepted it and if hed let himself forget that single relevant detail with cybil he had no one to blame but himself shed see him later it appeared she was a game player after all but he didnt have to step up to bat he turned marched back into his apartment where he tossed the lilacs that had inexplicably reminded him of her on the kitchen counter he flipped her balled note across the room picked up his sax and stalked out to work off his temper at deltas at exactly seventhirty cybil took the stuffed mushrooms shed slaved over out of the oven the table was set for two with more candles more flowers precisely arranged there was a wonderfully colorful avocadoandtomato salad chilling along with the wine once theyd enjoyed their appetizers and first course she intended to destroy him with her seafood crepes if all went according the plan theyd polish off the meal with icy champagne and fresh raspberries and cream in bed okay cybil she took off her apron marched to the mirror to check the fit and line of the dress she slipped on her heels added another dash of perfume then gave her reflection a bracing smile lets go get him she sauntered across the hall pressed his buzzer then waited with her heart hammering shifting from foot to foot she buzzed again how could you not be home how could you didnt you get the note you must have its not on the door is it didnt i specifically say id see you later groaning she thumped her fist against the door then she jerked upright and blinked i said i had plans oh my god you didnt get it did you you thickheaded jerk youre the plans oh hell she made a dash back through her open door for her key realized she didnt have anywhere to put it with a shrug she stuck it into her bra rather than waste time running upstairs for a bag in thirty seconds flat she was risking a broken neck by running down the stairs woman trouble sugar lips preston looked over at delta as he took a break to wet his throat no woman no trouble this is delta she tapped a finger to his cheek every night this week you come in here late and you play like a man whos got a woman on his mind and this man doesnt much mind having her there now tonight you come in early and youre playing like a man whos got trouble with the woman did you have a fight with that pretty little girl no weve both got other things to do still holding you off is she she laughed but not without sympathy some woman take more romance than others it has nothing to do with romance maybe thats your problem delta wrapped an arm around his shoulders and squeezed do you ever buy her flowers tell her she has beautiful eyes no damn it he had brought her flowers she hadnt bothered to stick around to take them its sex not a courtship oh sweetheart you want one you better do the other with a woman like that thats why im better off without a woman like that i want it simple he picked up the sax lifted a brow now are you going to let me play or do you want to give me more advice on my love life with a shake of her head she stepped back when you have a love life cher ill have advice he blew off a riff listening to the music inside his head inside his blood he let the notes come but the music didnt take his mind off her he could use that as well he told himself here where sharing was a pleasure not with words where it was often pain the notes slipped out throbbed in the air sobbed into a wail and she walked in the door her eyes full of secrets met his through the haze of smoke held and the smile she sent him as she slid into a chair made his palms go damp she moistened her lips trailed a finger up from the center of the low bodice of the slinky black dress to the base of her throat and back again he watched his blood swimming as she crossed long long legs with a movement so slow so studied it had to be deliberate surely the way she ran her hand from calf to knee to thigh was designed to make a mans gaze follow the movement his did and his pulse leaped like a wolf on the hunt she sat through the song leaning back in the chair hooking one arm provocatively over the back when the notes faded she traced the tip of her tongue lazily over those hot red lips then she rose her gaze still locked with his as the music pumped she ran a hand down her hip turned on those mankiller heels and started back out she glanced over her shoulder sent him a sultry invitation with no more than a lift of eyebrow and left the door swinging behind her the oath that came out of his mouth when he lowered the sax was absolutely reverent you going after that brother preston crouched to push his sax into its case do i look stupid andre no andre chuckled and kept on playing no you dont chapter seven contents prev next she was waiting on the sidewalk when he came out standing in the white wash of a streetlight with one hand resting on a cocked hip her head angled her lips curved in the barest hint of a smile it made him think of a photograph some arty shot perfectly framed and cropped for a classy magazine sex in black and white he started toward her taking more in the closer he came the short whiskeycolored hair sleeked to frame her face the short black dress sleeked to frame her body no jewelry to distract the eye milehigh heels designed to showcase milelong legs the only color was on those huge green eyes under sooty lashes and the siren red of her mouth a mouth he noted that was curved in smug female satisfaction he was three steps away when her scent reached out like a crooked finger and beckoned him the rest of the way hello neighbor she purred it one more hot bullet to his loins he tilted his head lifted a brow change of plans neighbor i hope not she took the last step moving into him deliberately sliding her hands up his sides over his shoulders around his neck her body fit suggestively to his as she purred again then she laughed shook her head you were the plans you knothead she wondered if it was the announcement or the mild insult that had his eyes narrowing in speculation is that so mcquinn she tilted her head brought her mouth a whisper from his then with her eyes on his slowly licked didnt i tell you youd be the first to know yeah with his free hand he cupped her neck keeping that wet red mouth tantalizingly close to his how fast can you walk in those heels she laughed again just a little breathlessly now not very but weve got all night dont we it might just take longer than that he stepped back and after a moment held out a hand for hers where did you get the lethal weapon the dress he added when she gave him a blank look oh this old thing this time her laugh was warm and rich i bought it today thinking of you and when i put it on tonight i was thinking of what it was going to be like when you took it off me you must have been practicing he said when he could manage to form words again because youre damn good at this actually im making it up as i go along dont stop on my account it was amazing she thought that a balmy spring evening could suddenly seem as sultry as summer in the tropics sorry i wasnt more specific in my note i had a lot on my mind she turned delighted that the heels brought her eye level with his mouth a lot of you on my mind it pissed me off it didnt seem so hard to admit it pardon me if i find that very flattering when i knocked on your door and you didnt answer i had essentially the same reaction i spent a lot of time getting ready for you you can be flattered it must have taken a while to paint on what there is of that dress not just that shed managed to keep her heartbeat fairly steady but as she paused at the entrance to their building it began to plunge and kick i made dinner you did he wasnt just flattered he realized he wasnt just aroused he was touched a fairly fabulous one if i do say so myself she added backing into the building with a sassy little white wine to set it off and an elegant and icy champagne to go with dessert she led the way into the elevator pushed the button for three then leaned back against the wall which i thought we could enjoy in bed he kept a step away knowing if he touched her they wouldnt be leaving the elevator for a very long time anything else i should know about these plans of yours oh i dont think youre going to need me to write anything down she stepped off the elevator tossed one of those slow smiles over her shoulder and strolled to her door he thought if he managed to get inside without exploding hed show her he could make plans of his own key hmm keeping her eyes on his she slid a finger under the deep scoop of her bodice touched metal and watched his gaze drop heat linger gee she slid her finger up again circled it lazily at the base of her throat i cant seem to find it maybe you can get it for me he decided he had news for medical science it was possible to remain conscious and upright after all the blood had drained out of your head he trailed his finger along the inviting swell above the black silk felt her shiver heard the catchy intake of her breath then dipped down taking his time gliding his finger lazily over heated flesh gently abrading her nipple until her eyes clouded and closed id say youre the one whos been practicing she managed and made him smile im just making it up as i go along mmmhmm dont stop on my account he didnt intend to not for hours looks like i found it he murmured hooking the key yeah she let out a long long breath i just knew you would he slid the key home released locks ask me in cybil come in he pushed open the door backed her inside reaching behind he locked the door clamping his hands on her hips he kept walking dinner can wait he lifted the phone off the hook as they passed it the wine later much later her heels bumped into the bottom step this time he smiled keep going on legs that had gone weak she moved up the stairs with her hands braced on his shoulders ask me to touch you touch me she sighed as his hands traveled up ask me to taste you taste me and moaned as his mouth brushed over the rise of her breasts when they reached the bedroom door his teeth scraped along her throat her jaw and left her mouth aching for attention kiss me i will but he only teased the corners of her lips with the tip of his tongue i want the light no i have candles theyre everywhere she broke free to grab a matchbook then fumbled i cant im shaking isnt that ridiculous he took the matches from her and danced his fingertips along her thigh i want you to dont move he ordered then worked his way around the room setting the candles alight the glow shimmered the scent whispered tossing the matches aside he moved back to where she stood her eyes huge and full of nerves needs and candlelight now his hands slid around her waist down ask me to take you she kept her eyes on his take me his mouth captured hers plundered rocking her with the first punch of the power theyd built between them she grabbed on as much to add to the storm as ride it this was what she wanted this bold blistering battering heat the crash of senses the war of needs i want you she raced wild kisses over his face i want you in bed then she gasped as he whirled her around dragged her back against him it stunned her to see them reflected in the mirror to see the gleam of desire in his gaze as it traveled down her body we have all night he reminded her watch he dipped his head to the curve of her neck and shoulder sharp little bites that had the first helpless sounds catching in her throat she watched his hands travel up saw them felt them cup her breasts squeeze release slide over silk his fingers sliding under it tugging the material she braced for him to rip then shuddered as he simply let his hands glide over her again then down she cried out in aroused shock as he pressed against her center his head lifted his teeth catching the lobe of her ear as their gazes met in the mirror shed driven him crazy when shed walked into the club he intended to return the favor tell me you want more her muscles had gone lax her bones to jelly preston he traced his fingers up and down her thighs felt the muscles quiver and the flesh heat tell me you want more god her head fell back on his shoulder as she fought for air i want more so do i he moved from silky hose to silky flesh torturing himself her scent was destroying him the feel of her urging him to take all of her but he drew it out even as his own breath became labored he held back the animal pacing inside him because when he let it go he knew it would devour them both he nipped his way around the back of her neck her shoulders while he tugged down the zipper of her dress he peeled it off her then bit back a groan sex in black and white he thought again even through the haze of desire she saw his eyes change saw something dangerous flash into them it shocked her to realize that was what she wanted the danger the risk the glory of breaking whatever choke chain he had on his control power swirled into her as she covered his hands with hers arid guided them over her i bought this today she whispered holding his hands to her breasts so you could rip it off me tonight she curled her fingers with his nudged them over the thin silk connecting the lace and let out one sharp gasp when he yanked the dress apart and with that single movement he broke he spun her around his mouth ravishing hers now his hands close to brutal as he dragged her to the bed he was going to eat her alive and couldnt stop it he felt her arch and buck when his hand covered her heard her choked scream as he drove her over the first ragged edge then he was tearing at silk and lace desperate for more he feasted on her breasts the firm fragrant swell of them while her heart hammered against his mouth her hands drove him wild as they pulled at his shirt as her nails scraped down his back her mouth was as greedy as his her hands as rough and impatient as they tugged and dragged at his jeans and when they closed around him fire burst in his blood she rolled with him tangling in the sheets shed so carefully smoothed panting shuddering she wrapped herself around him bowed up in urgent demand when he drove into her heat into heat the explosion of pleasure was huge a fast hard turbulent wave that drenched the skin and swamped the soul with one throaty moan she matched him for speed and fury more was all he could think he had to have more of her clamping her hands on the slim iron poles of the headboard he plunged deeper she arched accepted mad on the pleasure of her he watched her face absorbing every flicker of shock and delight as he took her higher and faster then over so that she sobbed out his name so that her eyes went dark and blind as her body melted under his he let himself pour into her surrendered himself his hands continued to hold hers on the rungs though her fingers had gone limp his body continued to cover hers while she quaked he stayed inside her mated are we still breathing he turned his head felt the pulse in her throat scrambling your hearts still beating good thats good is yours seems to be okay then its probably safe for us to stay here like this for the next five or ten years im pretty sure ill be able to move by then he lifted his head though she kept her eyes closed cybil was aware she was being studied imagined that clear blue and focused gaze and smiled i seduced the hell out of you mcquinn it was awfully nice of you to return the favor no problem it was the least i could do nobody ever made me feel like this before she opened her eyes no one ever touched me this way she saw her mistake immediately the way his eyes shuttered the way he retreated from the intimacy if it was light if it was sexy if it was dangerous he was with her but there was to be no tenderness no heart no slippery sentiment to change the balance it made her ache for both of them youve got great hands she made her smile sassy as she wiggled her fingers under his definitely majorleague hands youve got some real contenders yourself he rolled onto his back relieved and annoyed with himself for feeling that deep inner jolt when shed looked at him with so much dazzled emotion in her eyes he wasnt going to let things shift into that area between them because once it did it was over that part of him that was hope and heart had long ago been calcified she wanted to curl into him to curve her body into the warmth of his but imagined that was another taboo keep it simple she warned herself or hell walk right out the door so she sat up instead flicked her fingers through her disordered hair i think that wine would go down well right now dont you oh yeah he skimmed his fingers along her calf because he had to touch had to keep that connection you mentioned something about dinner mcquinn i have an amazing meal in store for you she leaned down to give him a careless kiss everythings done but the crepes seafood crepes which i will whip up in front of your astonished eyes youre going to cook mmmhmm he watched her slide out of bed walk to the closet on legs that had his blood stirring again whats that for this its called a robe she said with a laugh as she slipped into it its often used to cover nakedness he got up crossed to her and tugged the belt loose again take it off a quick thrill shimmied down her spine i thought you wanted dinner i do and i want to watch you cook it then oh she laughed again and pulled the robe together i am not cooking crepes naked that little fantasy of yours is doomed he didnt think so actually i was wondering if you had any more of he turned to the bed found what was left of the lacy black garter belt this sort of thing surprised then intrigued she lifted her eyebrows no intelligent shopper buys only one i have another little ensemble in red breakyourheart tart red his smile spread slowly as he tossed the black lace aside why dont you put it on im really hungry preparing crepes in sexy underwear was not without its risks cybil discovered just what it was like to be ravished against the pantry door amazing and plundered on the livingroom rug incredible and being savaged under the hot beating spray of the shower was an experience she would be more than willing to repeat through the hours of the night hed reached for her thrilled her had never seemed quite able to get enough of her or she of him theyd been so completely in tune so utterly together that at times it had seemed his heart had beat inside hers the candles had gutted out in their own fragrant pools and light had been seeping softly through the windows when shed fallen into an exhausted sleep only to wake alone she knew it shouldnt hurt her that he hadnt slept with her hadnt woken with her it wasnt to be like that between them she knew that accepted that there would be no soft and foolish words between them no baring of souls the border of intimacy stopped at the physical with his side of it walled thick her heart was her own problem not his how could he know shed never given herself so absolutely to any other man why should he be expected to know that the primitive power of their desire for each other was driven by love on her side she rubbed her tired eyes and ordered herself up and out of bed shed walked into the relationship with her eyes open she thought as she tidied up the bedroom shed known its limitations his limitations they could be together enjoy each other as long as certain lines werent crossed well that was fine she wasnt going to pine and sigh over it she was in charge of her own emotions she was responsible for her own actions and she was hardly going to mope around because she was involved with an exciting fascinating interesting man damn it she hurled her shoes into the closet damn it damn it damn it cybil leaped on the bed grabbed the phone she had to tell someone talk to someone and when it was this vital there was really only one someone mama mama im in love she said then burst into wild tears prestons fingers flew over the keyboard hed had less than three hours sleep but his system was revved his mind clear as crystal his first major play had been wrenched out of him every word a wound but this was pouring out streaming like wine out of a magic bottle that had only been waiting to be decanted it was so fully alive and for the first time in longer than he could remember so was he he could see it all perfectly the sets the staging the characters and everything inside them the doomed the damned the triumphant a world in three acts there was an energy here inside these people who formed on the page and lived on the stage already set inside his head he knew them knew how their hearts would leap and how they would break the thread of hope that ran through their lives hadnt been planned but it was there woven through and tangled so that he found himself riding on it with them he wrote until he ran dry then disoriented glanced around the room it was dark but for the lamp hed switched on and the steady glow from his computer screen he hadnt a clue what time it was what day for that matter but his neck and shoulders were stiff his stomach empty and the coffee in the cup on his desk looked faintly revolting standing he worked out the worst of the kinks then walked to the window pushed open the curtains there was a hell of a spring storm going on he hadnt noticed now he watched the flashing of lightning the scurry of desperate pedestrians rushing to appointments or shelter the entrepreneur on the corner was doing a brisk business in the umbrellas which no one in new york seemed to own for longer than it took the pavement to dry he wondered if cybil was looking out her window watching the same scene what she would think of it how she would turn something so simple and ordinary as a thunderstorm in the city into the bright and ridiculous shed use the umbrella man he decided work up an entire biography for him give the figure in black slicker and hood a name a background a personality full of quirks and the anonymous street vendor would become part of her world she had such a gift for drawing people into her world he was in it now preston mused he hadnt been able to stop himself from opening that colorful door and stepping inside the confusion the delights the energy she didnt seem to understand he didnt belong there when he was inside when he was surrounded by her it seemed as though he could stay that if he let it life could be just that simple and extraordinary like a storm in the city he thought but storms pass hed nearly let himself sink into it that morning nearly let himself sink in and stay in that warm bed with that warm body that had turned to curl around him in sleep shed looked so soft he thought now so welcoming what had moved through him as hed watched her in that fragile light had been a different kind of hunger one that yearned to hold to sigh out all the troubles and doubts and hold on to dreams it had been safer for both of them to leave her sleeping he flicked the curtains closed and walked downstairs he started fresh coffee foraged for food toyed with the idea of a nap but he thought of her and of the night and knew the restlessness inside him wouldnt allow him to rest what was she doing over there he had no business knocking on her door interrupting her work just because his was finished for now just because the drum of rain made him feel edgy and alone just because he wanted her he liked being alone he reminded himself as he prowled the living area he needed the edge for his work he wanted to sit with her and watch the rain to make slow lazy love with her while it pounded the streets and sidewalks and cocooned them from everything but each other wanted her he admitted just a little too much for comfort he told himself it was safe enough to want it was crossing the line from want to need that was dangerous just how close he wondered was he already skirting that very thin very shaky line when a woman got inside a man this way it changed him left him wideopen so that he made mistakes and exposed pieces of himself better left alone she wasnt pamela he wasnt so blind he believed every woman was a liar and a cheat and cold as stone if hed ever known anyone with less potential for cruelty and deceit it was cybil campbell but that didnt change the bottom line from want to need to love were short skidding steps once a man had taken the fall and ended up broken he learned to keep his balance at all costs he didnt want the desperation the vulnerability the loss of self that went hand in hand with genuine intimacy and hed stopped believing himself capable of those things which meant there was nothing to worry about he told himself sipping his coffee and staring at his door as if he could see through it and through the one across the hall she wasnt asking for anything more than passion companionship enjoyment exactly as he was she was perfectly aware the arrangement was temporary hed be gone in a few weeks and their lives would go comfortably in other directions she with her crowds of friends he with his contented solitude hed set his cup down with a violent snap before he realized the idea annoyed him they could still see each other from time to time he told himself as he began to pace again his house in connecticut was a reasonable commute from the city isnt that why hed chosen it in the first place he came into the city often enough there was no reason he couldnt make it more often until she got involved with someone else he thought jamming his hands in his pockets why should a woman like that wait around for him to breeze in and out of her life and that was fine too he decided as his temper began to rumble like the thunder outside who was asking her to wait around she could damn well hook herself up with any idiot her interfering friends tossed at her but not by god while he was still across the hall he strode to her door intending to make a few things clear and opened it just in time to watch cybil launch herself joyfully into the arms of a tall man with sunstreaked brown hair still the prettiest girl in new york he said in a voice that hinted of beignets and chicory give me a kiss and as she did lavishly preston wondered which method of murder would be most satisfying chapter eight contents prev next matthew why didnt you tell me you were coming when did you get in how long are you staying oh im so happy to see you youre all wet come inside take off your jacket when are you going to buy a new one this one looks like its been through a war he only laughed hefted her off her feet and kissed her again you still never shut up i babble when im happy when are you oh preston she beamed at him out of eyes shining with joy i didnt see you there obviously bare hands he thought would be the most satisfying he would simply take the guy with the smug brown eyes and the scarred leather jacket apart piece by piece and feed each one to cybil dont let me interrupt the reunion its great isnt it matthew this is preston mcquinn mcquinn matthew ran his tongue around his teeth he was fairly sure the man braced in the hallway wanted to break them the playwright i caught your work the last time i was in the city cyb cried buckets i practically had to carry her out of the theater i wasnt that bad yes you were of course you used to tear up during greetingcard commercials so youre an easy mark thats ridiculous and oh my phone hang on a minute she darted inside leaving the men eyeing each other narrowly im a sculptor matthew said in the same lazy drawl and since i really need my hands to work ill tell you im cybils brother before i offer to shake brother the murderous gleam shifted but didnt quite fade not much family resemblance not especially want to see my id mcquinn that was mrs wolinsky cybil announced as she dashed back she saw you come in but couldnt get to her door in time to waylay you im supposed to tell you she thinks youre more handsome than ever chuckling cybil grabbed both his cheeks isnt he pretty dont start oh but you are such a pretty face all the female hearts flutter she laughed again then snagged prestons hand come on lets have a drink to celebrate he started to refuse then shrugged it wouldnt do any harm to take a few minutes to size up cybils brother what kind of sculptor i work in metal primarily matthew peeled off his jacket tossed it carelessly over the arm of a chair it barely had time to land before cybil snatched it off ill just hang this in the bathroom to dry preston pour us some wine will you sure she have any beer matthew wanted to know and sauntered over to lean on the counter while preston moved through the kitchen with a familiarity that had the big brother arching a brow yeah he plucked out two popped the tops then took out the wine for cybil you work in the south thats right new orleans suits me better than new england weatherwise it gives me more room to work outside if i want cyb hasnt mentioned you when did you move in preston lifted his beer noted matthews eyes were nearly the exact color of cybils hair like good aged whiskey not long ago work fast do you depends preston cybil heaved a sigh as she came back couldnt you have used glasses we dont need glasses matthew grinned keeping a challenging eye on preston well just drink our beer like real men then chew up the bottle then you probably dont want any dainty cheese and crackers or girlie pate to go with it says who matthew demanded and slid onto a stool you used to have four of these didnt you oh preston borrowed one what are you doing in new york matthew she stuck her head in the fridge just some quick preliminary business for my show this fall im only here for a couple days and you checked into a hotel didnt you your revolvingdoor policy drives me crazy matthew gestured toward preston with his beer youve lived across the hall for a bit right so you know what goes on in here its terrifying she lets he shuddered dramatically people in here matthew is a professional recluse cybil said dryly as she began preparing a small feast you two should get along famously preston doesnt like people either ah finally a man of sense matthew aimed one of his quick crooked smiles at preston and decided he might like him after all i let her talk me into staying here once matthew continued stealing a cracker oh the horror three days people dropping in talking eating drinking standing around bringing their relatives and pets it was only one little dog who insisted on sitting in my lap without invitation then ate my socks if you hadnt left them lying on the floor he wouldnt have eaten them besides he only chewed them a bit its all a matter of perspective matthew concluded and you see in a civilized hotel the only people who drop in are housekeeping and room service and they knock first and very rarely bring along small toothy dogs he reached over pinched her chin but ill let you cook me dinner darling youre so good to me you ever had cybs homemade chicken potpie mcquinn cant say i have well watch me sweettalk us into some it was an interesting way to spend the evening preston thought later watching cybil relate to her brother the ease of affection humor occasional exasperation he remembered it had been like that between him and his sister before pamela after that there had still been affection but the ease of it had vanished all too often he had felt an awkwardness that had never been there before but awkwardness wasnt a problem with the campbells they cheerfully told embarrassing stories about each other and when that paled ganged up to tell him about their absent and therefore defenseless sister and any number of cousins by the time he left he was wondering if he could work bits of them into act for a little comic relief work preston decided since cybil was likely to be occupied with family for quite some time yet was his best hope for the rest of the night i like your friend matthew stretched out his legs and swirled the brandy cybil had opened in his honor thats handy so do i a little on the sober side for you ah well she settled in beside him on the sofa a little change of pace now and again cant hurt is that what he is matthew gave her earlobe a tug i noticed you two didnt waste any time getting locked together when i so accommodatingly strolled upstairs to make a phone call if you were making a phone call how do you know what we were doing down here unless you were spying she smiled sweetly fluttered her lashes and got another jerk on the ear i wasnt spying i just happened to glance down the stairs at one very strategic moment and since he looked at you any number of times during the evening like he knew youd be a lot more tasty than your chicken potpie which was great by the way i cleverly put two and two together you were always bright matthew i suppose its reasonable to say since youre being nosy that preston and i are together youre sleeping with him deliberately cybil widened her eyes why no weve decided to be canasta partners we realize its a big commitment but we think we can handle it you always were a smartass he muttered thats how i make my fame and fortune now youre making it turning mcquinn across the hall into emilys elusive and irritable quinn how could i resist matthew drummed his fingers shifted emily thinks shes in love with him cybil said nothing for a moment then shook her head emily is a cartoon character who pretty much does what i tell her to do shes not me she has pieces of you some of your most endearing and annoying pieces true thats why i like her matthew blew out a breath frowned into his brandy look cyb i dont want to horn into your personal life but im still your big brother and youre so good at it matthew she leaned over to kiss his cheek you dont have to worry about this preston didnt and isnt taking advantage of your baby sister she took matthews brandy sipped handed it back i took advantage of him i baked him cookies and ever since hes been my love slave theres that mouth again uncomfortable he pushed off the sofa paced a bit okay i dont want the details but oh and i was so looking forward to sharing all of them with you especially the home videos shut up cybil working his way from uncomfortable to embarrassed matthew dragged a hand through his hair i know youre grownup and youre seriously cute in spite of that nose my nose is very attractive she sniffed with it we all worked hard to make you believe that and youve overcome that little deformity so well she had to laugh shut up matthew all i want to say is be careful you know careful her eyes went soft as she rose i love you matthew in spite of that annoying facial tic i dont have a facial tic we worked hard to make you believe that laughing again she slipped her arms around him for a fierce hug its so nice to have you here cant you stay longer cant he rested his cheek on the top of her head im going up to hyannis for a couple days ill hang out do some sketching grandpa wheedled hes the champ is grandma pining for you cybil asked leaning back to grin fretting herself down to skin and bones why dont you come up give him a bonus and that way we can spot each other when he starts on why were not settled down and raising a pack of little people hmm well he has called here a couple times in the last few weeks hasnt given me a chance to call first she considered juggling time and duties in her head im enough strips ahead to take a couple of days i do have a meeting day after tomorrow though that i shouldnt break come up afterward he angled his head when he saw her mull it over hesitate you can ask your canasta partner to drive up with you well have a tournament he might enjoy that she murmured ill check with him either way ill come good and matthew thought he hoped preston accepted the invitation he would love to see daniel macgregor work him over since it was after midnight when matthew went off to his hotel cybil told herself to go upstairs to bed she hadnt gotten much sleep the night before and neither had preston the reasonable the practical thing to do was climb into bed shut off the light and get some muchneeded rest so she walked across the hall and pushed his buzzer she was beginning to think hed gone to bed or down to the club when she heard the rattle of locks hi i never offered you a nightcap he glanced over her shoulder back at her face wheres your brother on his way to his hotel i opened some brandy and she didnt manage the rest or even much of a squeak of surprise as he yanked her inside kicked the door closed and shoved her against it her mouth was much too busy being assaulted by his when he switched to her neck she managed to suck in a breath i guess you dont want any brandy since he was already dragging off her shirt she returned the favor or afterdinner mints the force of need that had slammed into him the moment hed seen her was outrageous he couldnt stem it even with his hands rushing over her to take greedy his mouth crushed back on hers while he pulled her head back to dive yet deeper and she strained against him just as urgently just as desperately groaning in pleasure as he tugged her trousers down her hips whatever she had was his he filled his hands with her breasts then his mouth descended sucking nipping while her nails bit arousing points of pain into his back her skin like warmed silk drove him to possess desire a freshly whetted blade twisted as he moved down her until her hands vised on his shoulder and her breath was only gasping sobs not possible not possible to feel so much and survive was her last coherent thought then he used his mouth on her his fingernails raking lightly down her body as with lips and teeth and tongue he drove her beyond reason she heard her own cry of shocked release dimly struggling for air as her system rocked from the hot explosion of pleasure destroyed she sagged against the door utterly open to him surrender only fanned the flames his hands slipped slid over her damp skin his mouth continued its relentless assault demanding more still more until her body began to quiver again until he felt her begin to heat and move and stretch toward the next peak he left her groaning traveling back up her body slicking his tongue over flesh that tasted erotically of salt and woman his hands were rougher than he intended as he dragged her to the chair pulled her down on him lifted her hips his eyes met hers watching watching as that soft clouded green darkened and blurred watching as those long lids flickered watching still as he lowered her now as she closed around him surrounded him in hot slippery heat their groans mixed her head fell back exposing that lovely white arch of throat where a pulse beat in wild hammer blows and she began to ride the pace was hers now and it was fast and fierce each thrust of hips slapped them both toward the dark swirl of delirium he craved it that moment when sanity ripped away bright arrows of sensation each separate and sharp stabbed through him the sumptuous taste of her flesh in his mouth the wet silk texture of it as his hands sought more of her those low animal sounds in her throat and the sheer wonder of her face flushed with pleasure and purpose he teetered on the edge struggling to hold on another instant just one more instant where he could no longer tell where she began and he left off but she closed around him a glorious fist of triumph and breathing his name dragged him over with her then as she had before she melted onto him the sensation of having her head lie on his shoulder her lips against his throat spread a hazy glow through him closing his eyes he held on to it and to her he remembered what she had said to him before no one had ever touched her as he had no one he thought had ever reached him as she had but however clever he was with words on paper he didnt know how to begin to tell her i wanted to get my hands on you all evening that at least he could say without risking either of them mmm and to think i nearly went up to bed with a long contented sigh she nuzzled his hair i knew this chair was perfect for you a chuckle rumbled in his chest i was thinking of having it recovered but now im having it bronzed she leaned back cupping her hands on his face i love those little unexpected pockets of humor in you its not funny he said in serious tones its going to cost me a fortune he expected her to laugh a sound hed grown to depend on but her smile was wistful her eyes soft preston she murmured it then lowered her mouth to his the slow deep gentle kiss stirred the soul rather than the blood it reached into him brushed hesitant fingers over his heart and made him yearn for something he refused to believe in something struggled to shift inside him made his hands tremble with the effort to hold it still and steady but the sweetness of it seeped in left him reeling he crossed over that thin line between want and need and felt himself stumble terrifyingly close to the edge of love she sighed pressed her cheek to his and wished youre cold he murmured feeling her skin chill a little she kept her eyes squeezed tight another moment reminding herself you couldnt always have everything you wished for thirsty want some water yeah ill get it no thats all right she slid off him leaving him slightly baffled by the sense of loss do you have a robe he worked up a smile again what is this obsession you have with robes never mind she snatched up his shirt and pulled it on matthew likes you she commented as she walked into the kitchen i like him he could take a deep breath now could he told himself regain his balance now the piece up in your studio thats his work yeah terrific isnt it hes got such a unique vision of things and watching him work if he doesnt murder you is an amazing experience she opened a bottle of water poured a tall glass to the rim then drank down nearly a third before moving back to preston she didnt notice his blink of surprise when she settled cozy as a cat into his lap so anyway she began offering him the glass how do you feel about taking a little trip a trip a couple of days in hyannis port matthews going up to see our grandparents the macgregors and i thought i might do the same grandpa loves to complain that we dont visit enough its a great place the house is well i cant describe it but youd like it youd like them want to get out of dodge for a bit mcquinn it sounds like a family thing it struck him as odd and totally out of character that he should feel so unhappy with the idea of her being away for a couple of days with the macgregor everything is a family thing grandpa loves people hes over ninety and has the most amazing energy i know hes fascinating they both are he glanced back as she frowned at him i know them slightly theyre acquaintances of my parents oh i didnt realize i told you the rather convoluted family connection didnt i macgregor to blade blade to grandeau grandeau to campbell campbell to macgregor not necessarily in that order dont start it makes my ears ring she laughed dutifully kissed them well since you know them and youve met matthew it wouldnt be like dropping yourself in on a group of strangers come with me she ran her lips from his ear to his neck itll be fun we could stay right here in this chair and have even more fun she chuckled warmly there are dozens and dozens of rooms in castle macgregor she murmured and in many of them there are big soft beds when do we leave really thrilled at the idea she leaned back day after tomorrow i have a meeting midmorning we can leave right after i can rent a car i have a car oh she cocked her head hmm is it a sexy car how do you feel about fourdoor sedans its probably very sturdy very reliable i appreciate a sensible car then youre not going to like my porsche a porsche she giggled in delight oh tell me its a convertible what else oh yeah tell me its a fivespeed sorry its a sixspeed her eyes widened really really can i drive of course if by the day after tomorrow the icicles have finished forming in hell youre at the wheel pouting only a little she began to play with his hair im an excellent driver im sure you are he decided it would be much more productive to distract her than to listen to her try to change his mind he rolled the cold glass over her naked back making her gasp and arch so that her breasts flattened delightfully against his chest now what do you think we could accomplish if we laid this recliner back all manner of amazing things she murmured turning her neck to give his teeth better access did you know my grandfather owns this building sure he told me about the apartment when i was looking for a place turn like yeah thats the way he told you about the apartment somehow hed managed to shift so that his body covered hers distracting her from a niggling thought just beginning to form in her mind when did he oh god youre so awfully good at that thank you but im about to get much better chapter nine contents prev next the house the macgregor built stood arrogantly on the cliffs above a surging sea nothing about the old gray stone was sober everything about it from its spearing towers and jutting turrets to the snapping flag that carried the crest of the clan shouted pride he had built as hed intended to on a sturdy foundation with grandiose vision and he had built to last the wild and rambling roses that would bloom brilliantly come summer did nothing to soften the effect but only added to that sense of magic stop preston murmured and laid a hand on cybils arm stop the car because she understood and was pleased to see the sight of that fanciful structure affect him as it always did her she braked gently its like a fairy tale isnt it she leaned on the steering wheel to study the house through a driving curtain of rain not one of the wimpy grated versions but one with blood and guts ive seen photographs they dont come close its not just a house its the most generous of homes whenever we visited wed always find something new something marvelous as she would this time she thought with preston it shows well in the rain doesnt it she commented i imagine it always shows well youre right you should see it in the winter we always come up during christmas the snow and the wind turn it into something frozen out of time and last year just at the end of summer when the roses were tumbling and the sky was so hard and blue you waited for it to crack like an egg my cousin duncan got married here but in the rain she smiled dreamily leaning on the wheel it feels like scotland have you ever been mmm twice have you no you should its your roots youll be surprised how much they tug at you when you breathe the air in the highlands or look out at a lowland loch maybe i will i might want a couple of weeks to decompress when the plays finished he turned his head lifted his eyebrows hows the car handling for you since youve only let me drive it for approximately fortyfive seconds its difficult to be sure now if you let me take it out for a spin tomorrow even your powers of persuasion arent going to get you behind the wheel longer than it takes to go up the drive cybil shrugged carelessly thought well see about that and drove decorously up the hill parked thank you very much she gave him a light kiss and the keys youre welcome lets not worry about the bags now well make a dash for it and see how long it takes to have whiskey and scones by the fire she pushed open the car door ran like a bullet through the rain then stopped on the covered porch to shake her head like a wet dog and laugh for ten full seconds he couldnt move he could only stare at her through the shimmering curtain of rain her cap of hair sleek and soaked her face alive with the delight of it he wanted to think it was desire straight and uncomplicated but desire rarely struck so deeply or had fingers of fear clawing at the gut if he couldnt ignore it hed deny it he stepped into the rain let the wind slap at his cheeks like a teasing woman as he walked to her and while she laughed he yanked her hard against him and took her mouth with a kind of violent possession for once her hands only fluttered helplessly as the sudden almost brutal kiss staggered her but she tasted the desperation on his mouth felt the barely restrained fury in the body that pressed to hers and her hands reached for him stroked once then held preston he heard her murmur through the roaring in his brain that was like the rain and the sea battering against him the soft sound of her voice had him gentling his hold then the kiss before he forced himself to draw back with all your family around he managed and skimmed her dripping hair behind her ear in an absent gesture that made her heart flutter foolishly i might not be able to do that for a while well she breathed deep hoping to settle herself that ought to hold me and smiling she took his hand and pulled him inside there was warmth immediate and welcoming bright swords and shields glowed on the walls it was after all the home of a warrior and one who had never forgotten it there was the scent of flowers and wood and of age that speaks of dignity rather than dust cybil anna macgregor came down the wide stairs her soft face aglow with pleasure her sable hair was swept back her deepbrown eyes clear and smiling as she held out her arms to take cybil into them grandma she breathed deep exhaled lavishly how can you always be so beautiful with a laugh anna squeezed tighter at my age the best you can hope for is presentable not you youre always beautiful isnt she preston very youre never too old to appreciate a considerate lie from a handsome young man anna shifted keeping one arm around cybils waist as she held out a hand hello preston i doubt youll remember me you couldnt have been more than sixteen the last i saw you about he agreed taking her hand but i remember you very well mrs macgregor it was at the spring ball in newport and you were very kind to a young boy who wanted to be anywhere else you remember now i am flattered come lets get you warmed up rains cold this time of year where are grandpa and matthew oh anna laughed lightly as she led them down the hall into what the family called the throne room daniels got poor matthew hammering on the pump for the pool he says its acting up and you know how your grandfather is about his daily swim claims it keeps him young everything keeps him young the term for the room was apt with daniels regal highback chair dominating a great space carpeted in scarlet the furnishings were old and massive the carvings deep lamps were already lit against the gloom and a fire blazed boldly in the big hearth well have tea i imagine daniel will insist we add whiskey to that and use company as an excuse for it sit be comfortable she invited if i dont let him know youre here ill never hear the end of it you sit cybil insisted ill go ill have the tea sent along on the way youre a good girl anna patted cybils hand as she sat by the fire you always were anna gestured to the chair beside hers preston daniel and i saw your play in boston some months ago it was powerful and wrenching your family must be so proud of what youve accomplished actually i think they were more surprised sometimes that amounts to the same thing we never really expect our children or our siblings no matter how we admire them to exhibit real genius it brings us a jolt and we think how could i have missed that all those years you know my family he said quietly so youd know the play cut very close to home yes i know sometimes a wound needs to be lanced or it festers is your sister well yes she has the children they center her and you preston is it your work that centers you apparently im sorry annoyed with herself anna lifted her hands im prying and i usually leave that to my husband im interested because i remember that young boy at the spring ball and the way he looked after his sister it reminded me of the way alan and caine always looked after serena and how it irritated her as it appeared to irritate its jenna isnt it yes he smiled now it used to drive her crazy but the smile soon faded if id done a better job of it years later shed never have been hurt preston you didnt hurt her anna reminded him and truly i didnt mean to take you back there will you tell me about what youre working on now or do you keep such matters secret its a love story set in new york at least thats the way its turning out his gaze flicked past her shoulder when he heard laughter rolling down the hall yes anna thought that seemed to be the way it was turning out havent you given the man a whiskey yet anna daniel stepped into the room and simply dominated it size presence and that great booming voice that refused to thin with age his eyes glittered blue as the lochs of his homeland his hair and rich full beard were stunningly white is that any way to welcome a man after hes come in out of the rain and brought up my favorite grandchild from the city oh fine matthew muttered trailing in behind him when you wanted your pool fixed i was your favorite grandchild well its fixed now isnt it daniel said and with a bark of laughter slapped matthew on the back with the affection a father grizzly might show to his cub its good to see you mr macgregor preston crossed the room hand extended to shake but for daniel this was rarely sufficient when hed taken an interest in a man he clapped preston into a hug with the force of a steel trap biting closed youre looking fit mcquinn and a good drink of whiskey always makes a scotsman fitter youll have a drop in your tea daniel anna warned him as she rose to fetch the decanter a drop for a big man he could still manage to sulk like a child anna two drops she conceded with a smile tugging at her mouth tell me preston do you smoke cigars not as a rule no anna turned angled her head in warning at daniel then if i come across you with one in your hand ill know who stuck it there before he dashed out of the room the womanll nag you to death daniel muttered well sit down boy and tell me how you and cybil are getting on little alarm bells sounded in prestons head getting on neighbors arent you yeah relieved preston sat acrossthehall neighbors pretty as a primrose isnt she grandpa cybil sighed as she wheeled in a loaded tea tray dont start on mcquinn he hasnt even been here ten minutes start what daniel narrowed his eyes at her are you pretty or not im adorable she laughed and kissed his nose while she was close she whispered in his ear behave and i might tip a bit of my whiskey into your tea while shes not looking daniels teeth flashed in a grin his eyebrows wiggled theres a lass you wont believe these scones mcquinn satisfied shed bribed the macgregor cybil loaded a small plate i cant quite pull them off mine are close but not quite there cybils a fine cook daniel agreed scowling when he watched his wife measure a measly two drops of whiskey into a cup for him youve been feeding the man a bit from time to time havent you lass like a proper neighbor she made us all a potpie last night matthew loaded a scone with strawberry jam hed promised to be a buffer he remembered preston you want whiskey or are you making do with tea ill take the whiskey thanks neat and how else would a man drink it daniel muttered pouting into his teacup so youve had a taste of our cybil he added and watched with a barely suppressed grin as preston nearly bobbled a scone excuse me her cooking daniels eyes radiated innocence oh aye he thought ive got you on the reel laddie woman who can cook like my darling here ought to have a family to feed grandpa cybil tapped her finger on her whiskey glass when a man was torn between his drink of choice and his granddaughters future what choice did he have sacrifices daniel mused had to be made what man doesnt appreciate a hot meal well made id like to know you cant disagree with that can you lad somehow somewhere there was dangerous ground was all preston could think no there daniel pounded a fist made plates rattle hah mcquinns a good and honorable name youve done proud by it thanks preston said cautiously but a man your age should be thinking of what comes after him you must be thirty by now thats right and how the hell do you know that preston wondered a man gets to be thirty its time to take stock to consider his duties to name and family ive got a few years left matthew whispered to cybil she merely elbowed him do something she hissed if he turns it on me its gonna cost you name your price oh i will and cheerfully throwing himself on the sword matthew dropped into a chair grandpa i havent told you about this woman ive been seeing lately woman distracted daniel blinked then zeroed in on his grandson what woman would that be i thought you were too busy building your big metal toys to pay any mind to women i pay them plenty of mind matthew grinned lifted his whiskey in salute this ones something special is she now shifting gears daniel settled back well it would take a special lass to catch your eye for more than a blink oh ive been looking at this one for a while names lulu matthew decided on the spot lulu larue though i think thats her stage name shes a table dancer dances on tables daniel roared as his wife choked back a laugh then continued to drink her tea naked on tables of course naked whats the point otherwise shes got the most amazing tattoo on her naked tattooed dancing girls ill be damned matthew campbell you want to break your dear mothers heart anna are you listening to this yes of course i am daniel matthew stop teasing your grandfather yes maam matthew shrugged grinned and watched daniels eyes narrow into blue slits but i dont see why i cant have a naked tattooed dancing girl if i want much later after the rain had passed and night had fallen and preston had slipped into her room to take advantage of her and the big fourposter bed cybil hummed in contentment it had been a near perfect day perfect enough that she let herself curl up against the man she loved and pretend in this fairy tale world that he had scaled the walls of the castle to find her and love her and stay with her for always tell me something he murmured too relaxed to worry about how soothing it was to lie there with her arm draped over him her head in the curve of his shoulder and their bodies sharing a lazy intimate warmth okay despite exhaustive research the exact number of angels who can dance on the head of a pin has never been fully documented i thought it was thats mere speculation nor in related studies has it ever been fully discovered precisely how many frogs one must kiss before finding the prince that goes without saying but he loved the way she chuckled as she shifted closer what i really wanted to know and you would be the handiest authority on the subject is what the hell was all that with your grandfather at tea which all she lifted her head skimmed her hair back from her brow then rolled her eyes oh that all i didnt warn you because i had the pathetic hope that it wouldnt be necessary the fault is entirely mine she shifted rolling over so that her body lounged cozily over his do you know you have wonderful eyes mcquinn theyre almost translucent like i could dive right into that moonlight blue and just disappear is that a genuine comment or an evasion of the subject at hand both but since it had to be dealt with she sat up kissed him then reached for the robe shed tossed at the foot of the bed earlier why do you have to cover up whenever you talk to me she glanced over and to his surprise flushed a little a latent puritanical streak incredibly latent he noted but only smiled as she belted the robe now about your grandfather and his sudden interest in my family name or as he put it during dinner the good blood strong stock in my ancestry well mcquinn youre a scotsman thirdgeneration rhode islander hardly matters in the vast and historic scheme of things she rose and poured them a glass to share from the pitcher of ice water that had been placed on the bedside table ill apologize first she said without looking at him but hope youll understand grandpa means well its all out of love and he wouldnt have done it if he didnt like you something much too akin to nerves moved into prestons stomach done what exactly i didnt realize it or it didnt sink in fully until we got here it should have she murmured sitting on the bed and handing him the glass before shed sipped herself the other night when you mentioned how you knew each other and hed put you onto the apartment across from mine i should have latched on to it well she jerked her shoulders it wouldnt have mattered anyway what cybil she blew out a breath lifted her lashes and looked directly into his eyes hes picked you out for me its just that he loves me she said quickly and he wants what he thinks is best for me thats marriage a family a home and that appears to be you it wasnt nerves preston discovered it was outright terror how the hell did he come to that conclusion he demanded and set his water back on the table with a hard click of glass on wood its not an insult mcquinn her voice chilled several frigid degrees its a compliment as i said he loves me very much so he obviously thinks a great deal of you if he believes youd make me a proper husband and be a good father for the many greatgrandchildren he hopes ill give him i thought you didnt want marriage i didnt say i did i said he wanted it for me her chin jerked up before she got out of bed again stalking to the bureau to snatch up her brush and drag it over her hair and the fact that youre so obviously appalled is incredibly insulting i suppose you think its amusing i think its sweet you think its sweet for your ninetysomething grandfather to pick out men for you he isnt grabbing them off the street corner for me to audition ridiculously hurt she slammed down the brush you neednt panic mcquinn im not buying my trousseau or booking chapels im perfectly capable of finding my own husband when and if i want one which ive already said i dont she tossed her head and for lack of something better to do with her hand wrenched open a jar of cream and began to slather it on her hands now im tired and id like to go to bed and since you dont care to sleep with me after sex you should go was it just temper he wondered or was there something more in the reflection of her eyes in the mirror why are you angry why am i angry she said quietly unsure if she wanted to weep or scream how can someone who writes about whats inside people with such insight such sensitivity ask a question like that why am i angry preston she turned then because it was best to face the issue headon because youre sitting there in the bed we just shared still warm from me and utterly baffled completely shocked that someone who loves me thinks there could or should be something more between us than sex of course theres more between us than sex his own temper started to twitch as he grabbed his jeans and tugged them on is there is there really the cool flat tone had him looking over had the sneaky worm of guilt sliding into him i care about you cybil you know i do you find me amusing thats not the same thing yes there was more than temper he realized before she turned away there was hurt somehow hed hurt her again without plan or purpose he took her arm firmly turned her back i care about you her heart already too much his softened all right she touched a hand to his squeezed released lets forget about it he wanted to agree to keep it simple but the smile shed tossed him before shed walked to the window hadnt reached her eyes and those eyes had been wounded cybil i dont have more than that i didnt ask for more than that the moons come out all the clouds have been blown away we can walk the cliffs tomorrow its a little chilly though absently her heart weeping in her breast she rubbed her arms i think we need another log on the fire ill do it the fire in the fieldstone hearth still burned bright and cheerful but he took a log from the carved box sat it on the flames then watched them rise up lick curve greedily around it for a time the only sound in the room was the crack and the hiss of wood being consumed maybe it was because she didnt ask so deliberately didnt ask that he was compelled to tell her would you sit down i like standing here looking at the stars you cant see the stars in new york its all the lights you forget to look up much less wonder where the stars are in maine where i grew up they filled the sky i never realize i miss them until i see them again you can get along very well for long periods without a lot of things hardly even noticing youre missing them when his hands came to her shoulders she tensed an instinctive movement it took concentrated effort to undo but she smiled when she turned why dont we go out and get a better look at them while theyre there i want you to sit down and listen to me all right struggling to be casual she walked to one of the deep chairs in front of the fire im listening he sat beside her leaned forward in his chair and kept his eyes on her face i always wanted to write i cant remember otherwise not the novels my father had hoped for it was always plays everything was very clear in my head the stage each set the movement of the actors the precise angle and quality of the lights often maybe too often that was the world i lived in you come from a prominent family one with a lot of social obligations and demands i suppose thats true so do i i tolerated that end of it enjoyed it occasionally but for the most part just tolerated or eluded it you value your privacy she said i understand that my fathers the same and matthew i valued it i needed it too restless to sit he rose to wander the room i love my parents my sister no matter how little we sometimes understand one another im sure i hurt them countless times with small acts of carelessness but i do love them cybil of course you do she began but said nothing more when he shook his head my sister jenna she was always so outgoing so easy with people shes a lovely woman she wasnt quite twentyone when she married married my best friend from college i introduced them it still scraped him raw to think of that the first step in the whole miserable journey had been his glancing at the water he wished it were whiskey they were great together he murmured shining with love full to bursting with hope and plans jacob came along just over a year later and less than a year after that she was pregnant again and glowing with it he stuck his hands in his pockets moved to the window but he didnt see the stars about that time my first play was being produced locally just a small theater group but a place with cachet my fathers an important writer so that made his sons work of some interest its of interest on its own cybil declared and he glanced back grateful to her for understanding his need for that separate legitimacy but she would he thought because of who she was and from what shed come now i certainly hope so but not then not right at the start and it was vital to me that my work stand on its own and not lean on his part of that was pride he continued thoughtfully but part of it was respect whatever the reason this play this first of mine to be produced was incredibly important to me because he turned away seemed to need a moment to gather himself she spoke again i didnt sleep at all the night before my first strip came out however much i loved the work i couldnt have stood it if people thought i was using my fathers accomplishments as a stepping stone some always will preston murmured you cant let it matter the work has to matter most and this play did to me there wasnt any aspect of it i wasnt involved in the set designs the staging the casting the rehearsals lighting cues all of it she smiled a little i imagine you drove everyone including yourself insane im sure i did the company had a lot of talent the actress who played the lead was stunning certainly the most beautiful woman id ever seen she dazzled me he faced her id just turned twentyfive and i was hopelessly in love with her every minute i spent with her was a gift just to watch her onstage saying lines id written that had come from me having her look at me and smile and ask me if that was how i meant it to be the more i became involved with her the less the play meant to me even now it burned inside him what hed tossed aside and what hed had stolen she was gentle oh and sweet even a little shy when she wasnt onstage i made excuses to be with her then began to realize she was making them to be with me we became lovers on a sunday afternoon in her bed and afterward she cried on my shoulder and told me she loved me i think i would have cut off my arm for her at that moment cybil folded her hands in her lap and wondered what it would be like to be loved like that by a man like him she didnt speak because she could see there was more and what was left still caused him pain for weeks he continued my world revolved around her the play opened garnered very decent reviews all i could think was that the play had been the vehicle that had given her to me that was all that mattered love should matter most should it he laughed shortly and the cynical light was back in his eyes but words last cybil thats why a writer should take care with them love lasts she wanted to say it nearly did but she could already see his hadnt i bought her gifts he continued because they made her happy took her dancing or to the club because she loved to be with people she was so beautiful i thought she deserved to be showcased she needed the right clothes the right jewelry to be showcased in didnt she so why not buy them for her and if she needed a little to tide her over why not write her a check it was only money and i had more than enough cybil could see where it was going or thought she could she wanted so badly to go to him to slip her arms around him in comfort but it wasnt unhappiness in his voice in his eyes it was bitterness she had talent and i wanted to help her become an important actress why not use my influence or my fathers my familys to boost her career you loved her cybil said quietly already hurting for him what you wouldnt have used for yourself you would use for someone you loved and that makes it right he shook his head no its never right to use someone else but i did she talked about marriage shyly again almost wistfully i hesitated there her career needed her attention we could wait to settle down after the play i told her after she began to move up wed go to new york and wed both own theater wed own it together together he thought was all too often a word that didnt hold true then one day she came to me weeping shaking so pale you could almost see through that beautiful skin she told me she was pregnant and lovely terrified tears slipped out of her eyes and down her cheeks she blamed herself begged me not to abandon her where would she go what would she do she had little money she was afraid she thought i would hate her no cybil whispered you wouldnt hate her of course i didnt i didnt hate her i didnt blame her i was afraid i was shaken but part of me was thrilled the decision had been taken out of my hands i didnt need to be practical now but could marry her start a life with her he prowled now restless in the cage of his own past money was no problem id come into a large part of my inheritance at twentyfive would come into more at thirty money wasnt a problem he said again then lifted the poker and jabbed viciously at the logs blazing i dried her tears and i held her told her everything would be fine it would be wonderful wed be married right away wed stay in newport until the baby was born then wed go to new york just as wed planned it would be three of us instead of two but wed be happy we had a touching parting scene as she left to go back to her little apartment to rest and call her family and tell them the wonderful news we agreed to go to my parents after the show that evening and tell them i started making plans almost immediately imagined myself as her husband as the father of the child wed made together you wanted the baby cybil said remembering the ease with which hed held little charlie yes i did he turned to her then his back to the fire but the heat that pumped from the flames couldnt reach the cold memories left inside him i wanted her and the child and the life i imagined we could make together and while i was floating on that particular cloud my sister came to my door he could still see it still bring it back every movement every gesture another play on another stage like pamela she was weeping she was trembling she was pale and like pamela she was pregnant further along just showing so i was worried at the state she was in she clung to me sobbing and sobbing and finally managed to tell me her husband was having an affair his voice changed now darkened flattened as did his eyes she told me that shed dashed back home leaving jacob with my mother because shed forgotten something they were to be out all day so she wasnt expected back only an hour after shed left wasnt expected to walk in and find her husband scrambling back into his trousers and a woman in her bed her own bed oh preston how horrible for her she rose then wanting to comfort how awful for your family she must have she trailed off as it clicked the scenes hed been painting for her the scenes hed painted in his play oh no oh god he stepped back from the sympathy she offered her name was leanna in tangle of souls but she was pure pamela beautiful and clever and cold a woman who could act without rehearsing the lines who could play a man brilliantly all for money for power for the possibilities she would have married me for those things and to give a socially prominent name to the baby my closest friend my sisters husband had planted in her but i was no longer in the mood you loved her and she hurt you hurt all of you im so sorry yes i loved her but she taught me you cant trust the heart my sister trusted hers and it almost destroyed her if she hadnt had jacob and the baby on the way i think it would have they needed her and thats what got her through but you didnt have that i had my work and the satisfaction of facing the woman whod cut through our lives she wept and she swore it was all a lie some terrible mistake she begged me to believe her and i very nearly did she was that good no cybil murmured you were in love youd have wanted to believe her either way we argued and some of the layers on that perfectly presented mask of hers fell away i saw her for what she was a schemer a liar a cheat a woman who thought nothing of seducing and sleeping with anothers husband for pleasure and going from him to another man for gain but she finished the run of the play he smiled thinly the show must go on how did you stand it she was good and it was only a matter of reminding myself the work was more important than she was more important than anything else he arched a brow you think that was a cold decision on my part no she laid her hands on his shoulders then on his cheeks wondering that he couldnt see the hurt was still there no i think it was brave then she leaned into him held him sighing when his arms finally came around her she didnt deserve even the smallest piece of your heart preston then or now now shes only an interesting character in a play i wont give anyone that much ever again i dont have it to give if you believe that youve let her take more she lifted her head and her eyes were drenched youve let her win nobody won my sister my friend me three lives damaged and all she got from it was a few auditions nobody won he murmured and brushed a tear from her cheek with his thumb dont cry i didnt tell you to make you cry just to help you understand who i am i know who you are and i cant help hurting for you cybil he brought her close again if you keep wearing your heart that close to the surface someones going to come along and break it she closed her eyes but didnt tell him someone already had chapter ten contents prev next it was time daniel decided to have a private little chat with young preston mcquinn it was simple enough to lure the man up into his tower office while cybil was busy with anna in another part of the house and matthew well the boy was likely off somewhere or other looking for inspiration for one of his metal toys matthews sculptures invariably brought daniel both puzzlement and pride have a seat lad stretch out your legs daniel walked to the bookshelf took out a copy of war and peace and chose a cigar out of the hollow will you have one preston only lifted a brow no thanks interesting literature mr macgregor well a man does what he can to keep his woman off his back daniel ran the length of the cigar under his nose sniffing in appreciation sighed in anticipation as he sat then took his time lighting it part of the pleasure was in the small and delightful steps he unlocked the bottom drawer in his huge oak desk took out a large carved shell and set it in the center of his blotter as an ashtray following that came a tiny batteryoperated fan it was the newest of daniels attempts to keep anna from sniffing him out wife doesnt want me smoking the pity of it had daniel shaking his head and the older she gets the sharper her nose got one like a bloodhound he muttered then settled back sighed now then what if she comes up preston wanted to know we worry about that if and when boy if and when but his healthy fear of his wifes wrath had him nudging the little fan closer so tell me your plays going well for you yes it is im not only asking as an investor i want you to know im interested in you mmmhmm admire your fathers work got some of his books around here daniel leaned back in the enormous leather chair puffed out smoke a bird tells me that hollywoods taken quite an interest in your work mcquinn youve got a good ear for birds i do indeed how does it sit with you this movie business well enough you play poker dont you mcquinn ive been known to ante up occasionally ill wager you play a fine game of it youre not one to give your hand away i like that contemplatively daniel tapped his cigar on the shell youll be in new york a few more weeks another month anyway most of the work on the house should be done by then a fine big house too by the sea daniel smiled as preston narrowed his eyes the birds tell me all manner of things its good for a man to have a house of his own some of us arent meant to live in a hive with people buzzing through the next wall we need our own space for ourselves for our family room to spread out he continued gesturing a place where a man can go to have a damn cigar in his own house without being nagged half to death as daniel scowled took another puff prestons lips twitched true enough preston agreed though i wouldnt say my house is anywhere near the scale of yours young yet arent you you build as you go and youd need the sea as i did having grown up with it outside your door i prefer it to the city since he wasnt quite sure where the conversation was headed preston didnt relax quite yet and if i had to live in a suburban development id likely slit my throat in a week daniel laughed puffed and eyed preston through the cloud of smoke youre a man who needs his privacy and thats a reasonable thing but when solitude and privacy become isolation its not always healthy is it preston angled his head i dont see any neighbors mowing their yards and trimming their hedges when i look out the windows of castle macgregor daniels grin flashed in his beard that you dont mcquinn but while private we are isolated we arent you know cybil grew up by the sea as well he clamped the cigar between his teeth along the coast of maine where her father guarded his privacy like a pit bull so ive heard preston said mildly her fathers a good man for all hes a campbell idly daniel drummed his fingers on the edge of his desk time was a highlanderd sooner bed down with rats and weasels than let a campbell through the front door you dont hold the against him and his do you mcquinn it took him a minute possibly longer to realize daniel referred to the jacobite rebellion over two hundred years before thinking a laugh would be out of place he disguised it with a cough no he said very seriously times change we have to move on right enough pleased daniel thumped a fist on the desk and as i said hes a good man and his wifes a fine woman comes from good stock herself their children do them proud at sea preston merely nodded im sure youre right of course im right youve seen for yourself havent you shes a bright and lovely woman my cybil a heart big as the moon warm as the sun she draws people to her just by being theres a light about her dont you think i think shes unique that she is theres no deceit in her or guile daniel continued his blue eyes sharp and focused too often she puts her own feelings aside to spare anothers not that shes a doormat not with that good scots blood in her shell spit when shes cornered but shes more likely to hurt herself before shed hurt another causes me some worry though he was hearing no more than hed seen for himself daniels words had preston shifting uncomfortably in the chair i dont think you have to worry about cybil its a grandparents right duty and pleasure if it comes down to it to worry about his chicks she wants a place to put all the love she holds inside her the man who engages that heart of hers will live his life lucky yes he will youve had your eye on her mcquinn daniel leaned forward now i dont need birds to tell me that more than my eye preston thought with an inward wince as you said shes a lovely woman and youre a single man of thirty what are your intentions well preston thought that was cutting straight to the core i dont have any then its time you got some to punctuate daniel banged his fist on the desk youre not blind or stupid are you no well then whats stopping you the girls exactly what you need to lighten up that serious nature of yours to keep you from burrowing into a cave like a bear with indigestion eyes narrowed he jabbed out with the cigar and if i didnt know you were just whats best for her you wouldnt be within arms reach i can tell you that you put me in arms reach mr macgregor feeling trapped and furious because of it preston pushed out of his chair you dumped me on her doorstep under the guise of doing me a favor i did you the finest favor of your life lad and you should be thanking me for it instead of looking murderous i dont know how the rest of the family and acquaintances handle your button pushing but i can tell you i dont appreciate or need it if you didnt need it daniel disagreed in a roar why are you still moping about something thats gone and never really was instead of taking hold of what is the temper that had been heating prestons eyes turned to ice thats my business its your flaw daniel disagreed more pleased than not to watch the anger and the control and a mans entitled to one or two ive had over ninety years in this world to watch people to measure them to see them as they are ill tell you something mcquinn that youre either too young or too stubborn to see for yourself you match the pair of you one balancing the other youre wrong hah damned if i am the lass wouldnt have asked you to this house if she wasnt already in love with you and youd not have come unless you were already in love with her so he goes pale at that daniel thought sitting back again with satisfaction love for some was a scary business youve miscalculated preston spoke softly as his stomach clenched into a dozen tight fists love has nothing to do with whats between cybil and me and if i hurt her when i hurt her preston corrected youll own part of the blame for it he stalked out leaving daniel puffing on his cigar hurt was part of love he acknowledged though hed suffer for knowing his precious girl would ache a bit along the way and yes hed own part of the blame for it but when the man stopped wriggling like a stubborn trout on the line and made her happy well then who would own the credit hed like to know if it wasnt daniel macgregor and laughing he finished his cigar in secret delight cybil was sorry the trip to hyannis had put preston in a prickly mood one she thought that hadnt completely reversed itself after a week back in new york he was a difficult man she accepted that now that she knew the full story of what hed been through what had been done to him she didnt see how he could be otherwise it would take him a man with that much sensitivity that much heart a long time to trust again a long time to allow himself to feel again she could wait but it hurt she couldnt stop it from hurting when he turned away from her just a little too quickly or barricaded himself against her with his work his music or the long solitary walks hed begun to take at odd hours walks where he made it clear he wanted to be alone that he didnt want to share with her she told herself his work was giving him trouble though he never talked about his play with her any longer she imagined he didnt think she could understand the pain the joy the frustration of his work or what parts of himself it could swallow that stung but she told herself she accepted it shed always been able to lie to herself more easily than she had to others her own work had taken a new turn and was involving more of her time and energy the meeting shed had just before leaving for hyannis had been a vital one but shed told no one not family not friends not her lover superstitious she supposed as she climbed out of a cab in front of her building shed been afraid to say it out loud and jinx it before it was real now it was she pressed a hand to her heart felt it thud in hard excited beats heard herself giggle now it was very real and she couldnt wait to tell everyone maybe shed have a party to celebrate a loud silly joyful bash of a party champagne and balloons pizza and caviar as if preparing for it she danced up the steps she had to call her parents her family to grab jody so they could squeal at each other but first she had to tell preston she used the knuckles of both fists rapping a cheerful tattoo on his door hed be working she thought but this couldnt wait hed understand they had to celebrate glug champagne in the middle of the afternoon get a little drunk and stupid and make crazy love when he opened the door she was shining like a sunbeam hi i just got back you wont believe it he was rumpled unshaven and resented the fact that one look at her could yank his mind right out of his play just one look im working cybil i know im sorry but im going to burst if i dont tell somebody she lifted her hands to his face rubbed them over the stubble you look like you could use a quick break anyway im in the middle of things he began but she was already breezing in i bet you havent eaten lunch i just had the most incredible lunch at this new hot spot uptown why dont i fix you a sandwich and well i dont want a sandwich he heard the edgy snap to his voice didnt bother to soften it as he stalked to the stove to pour coffee that had been ripening for hours and i dont have time for one i want to work you have to eat she had her head inside his fridge then brought it out again when she heard him go upstairs oh for heavens sake she blew out a breath rolled her eyes and started up after him okay forget the sandwich i just have to tell you how i spent my day god mcquinn its dark as a tomb in here instinctively she marched to the window started to throw open the drapes leave them alone damn it cybil her hand froze then dropped away as slowly as completely as her mood he was already at the keyboard she noted already closed off from her just as he closed himself off from the life that surged and pulsed outside his curtained window he worked with lamplight and stale coffee and with his back to her nothing that was inside her that had been bubbling like a geyser mattered to him its so easy for you to ignore me she murmured to dismiss me there was no mistaking the hurt in her voice he braced himself against it refused to feel guilty its not easy but right now its necessary yes youre working and ive got some nerve dont i interrupting genius interfering with such a grand enterprise one i couldnt possibly understand irritated he flicked a glance at her you can work with people hovering i cant then again she continued its easy for you to ignore and dismiss me at other times too when work has nothing to do with it he pushed away from the keyboard shifted toward her im not in the mood to argue with you and of course it always comes down to your moods if youre in the mood to be with me or be alone to talk to me or be quiet to touch me or turn away there was a hint of finality in her tone that had panic skating up his spine if that didnt suit you you should have said so youre right absolutely exactly right and just now it doesnt suit me preston to be treated like a mild annoyance easily swatted aside then picked up again when you have a moment it doesnt suit me to have what matters to me shrugged off as unimportant you want me to stop work and listen to how you spent the day shopping and having lunch she opened her mouth closed it again but not before one small sound of hurt had escaped im sorry furious with himself he got to his feet she looked as if hed slapped her im streaming toward the end of this and im distracted nasty he dragged his hands through his hair because she hadnt moved hadnt stopped staring at him with those wide wounded eyes lets go downstairs no i have to go because she could feel ridiculous tears stirring in her throat burning there i have some calls to make and i have a headache she said lifting a hand to rub at her throbbing temple it makes me irritable i think i need some aspirin and a nap she started out stopping when he laid a hand on her arm he felt her tremble and absorbed a hard wash of shame cybil i dont feel well preston im going home to lie down she broke free rushed out he winced as he heard the slam of the door you stupid son of a bitch he muttered rubbing his fingers against his eyes why didnt you just kick her a couple of times while you were at it disgusted with himself he paced the room shoving his hands in his pocket then pulling them out again to yank at the drapes the sun was brilliant streaming through the glass making him narrow his eyes in defense maybe he did close himself off from what was on the other side he thought he worked better that way and he didnt have to justify or explain his work habits to anyone he didnt have to hurt her that way but damn it shed burst in on him at the worst possible time he was entitled to his privacy to his space when the work and the words were racing through him he didnt dismiss her he didnt ignore her how the hell did you ignore someone who wouldnt get out of your mind no matter what else was sharing the space with her but hed been trying to hadnt he very deliberately trying to do both ever since the little session with daniel macgregor in his tower office in hyannis port because the clever canny meddling old man was right he was already in love with her if he ignored it dismissed it kept pushing it just a little further out of reach it might go away before it got a good firm grip on him he wasnt risking love again not when he knew exactly what it could do to twist heart and soul to wring every drop of blood out of them he wasnt going to allow himself to become that vulnerable to her hed get over it he told himself and pulled the curtains shut again hed put things back on balance and theyd both be happier and as far as his insufferable behavior of the last few days hed make it up to her she hadnt done anything to deserve it except exist shed done nothing but give he thought hed done nothing but take knowing work was out of the question he went downstairs he considered going across the hall knocking leading in with the apology he owed her but she was entitled to her privacy as well he decided hed give it to her and take a walk he didnt think about buying her flowers until he saw them bright and sunny in an outdoor cart not roses he mused too formal not the daisies they were cheerful but ordinary he settled on tulips in butter yellow and creamy white the minute they were in his hand he felt lighter he kept walking realizing hed gone on too long without taking the time to really let his mind clear as it did he thought more about what shed said in that brief dark scene in his room just how often had she nudged aside her own moods her own needs to accommodate his the macgregor had hit that one as well it was her nature to think about the needs of those she cared about before her own hed never known anyone as selfless generous or unfailingly happy in her own skin hed stopped being all those things except when he was with her when he let himself really be with her shed been so excited when shed burst into his apartment hed become so used to seeing her that way he hadnt considered it might have been something special that had put that shine in her eyes hed taken care of that quickly enough he thought viciously and hed taken her for granted he realized almost from the first moment he could change that and would hed give her back as much as he took put them on equal ground so when the time came to step back from each other and it would they might have a chance to do so as friends he simply couldnt imagine his life without her as part of it any longer he stayed out the rest of the afternoon into early evening when he went to her door with flowers he didnt feel foolish he felt settled and when she opened it he felt right did you get some rest yes shed dived into sleep the way a rabbit dives into a thicket to hide thanks feel like company he brought the tulips up into her line of sight and when she stared at them he recognized simple shock and tulips ah sure theyre wonderful ill get a vase just how much had he left out he wondered if his bringing her a handful of flowers stunned her im sorry about this afternoon oh so the flowers were an apology she thought as she took a blue glass vase from a cupboard she shook off the vague disappointment that they hadnt been for no reason at all and turned to smile it doesnt matter its what you get when you disturb a bear in his den it matters he laid a hand on hers over the tulips and im sorry all right thats it a lot of women would make a man grovel a little i dont care for groveling much arent you lucky he lifted her hand turning it over to press his lips to the palm yes i am and for the second time he saw blank shock on her face hed never given her tenderness he realized amazed at his own stupidity never given her the simple glow of romance i thought if youre feeling better you might like to go out to dinner she blinked out if you like or if youre not feeling up to it he continued coming around the counter we can have a quiet dinner in whatever you want he murmured cupping her face to brush his lips over her forehead who are you and what are you doing in prestons body he chuckled then kissed her cheeks one the other tell me what you want cybil to be touched like this looked at like this i i can just fix something here if you want to stay in ill take care of dinner you you all right thats it im calling the cops he drew her into his arms held her im not threatening to cook wed never survive the night that way he nuzzled her hair stroked it ill order in oh well all right he was holding her she thought dizzily just holding her as if that was enough as if that was everything youre tight he murmured it sliding his hands up to rub at the tension in her shoulders i dont think ive ever known you to be knotted up the headache still bothering you no not much why dont you go up soak in the tub until youre relaxed then you can put on one of those robes youre so fond of and well have a quiet dinner im fine i can she trailed off as his mouth skimmed hers retreated then returned softly gently sweetly enough to dissolve her knees go on up he drew her away smiling as she stared up at him with slumberous confused eyes ill take care of everything all right i guess im a little unsteady yet which might explain why she wasnt entirely sure how to get upstairs in her own apartment the ah number for the pizza place is on the phone ill take care of it he gave her a nudge toward the steps go relax okay she started to the steps up then stopped and turned back to study him preston yeah are you with a half laugh she shook her head nothing never mind i wont be long take your time he told her it was going to require a bit of his to make certain everything was ready for her when she came back down if the hint of romance nearly shocked her speechless he thought shed have a hard time forming a single word by the time the evening he was planning was over he picked up the phone punched the button on memory next to jodys name jody preston mcquinn yeah listen does cybil have a favorite restaurant around here no not the diner he said with a laugh were moving upscale lets try french and fancy he had to grin at jodys long threetoned oh then scribbled down the name she gave him i dont suppose youd have the number handy you do huh youre a genius now lets see if you can hit three for three which dessert on their menu sends her into a coma got it thanks special he glanced upstairs grinned no nothing special just a quiet dinner in thanks for the tip he laughed again as jody continued to shoot out questions hey we both know shell tell you all about it tomorrow he hung up dialed the restaurant and outlined his needs then metaphorically pushing up his sleeves got down to work chapter eleven contents prev next she did as hed suggested and took her time she needed it to adjust to this strange new mood of his or was it a side of him she wondered he just hadnt shown her before how could she have known he had such sweetness in him and how could she have predicted that his showing her giving her that sweetness would make it so much more difficult for her to stay in control of her own feelings she loved him when he was careless and cross when he was amused and amusing when he was hot and hungry how much more could she love him when he was kind and caring he was making an effort she thought to apologize to her for hurting her and he didnt even know not really just what hed done but it mattered enough she mattered enough for him to want to make it right again how could she say no a quiet casual evening at home would be good for both of them he didnt like crowds and at the moment she didnt have the energy for them herself so theyd eat pizza in front of the tv be easy with each other again theyd laugh talk about something unimportant and make love on the sofa while an old movie flickered on the screen theyd make things simple again because simple was really what was best for both of them steadier she belted a long silky blue robe flicked her fingers through her nearly dry hair and started downstairs she heard the music first low dreamy the kind that set the pulse for seduction it didnt puzzle her for long after all the man liked his music but when she was halfway down the steps she saw the candles burning dozens of them with pinpoint flames that flickered and swayed he was standing in that shimmering light waiting for her hed changed into trousers and a black shirt and had shaved off the two days growth of beard his hand was already held out for hers and she stepped down to take it more than a little dazzled at the way the light glinted on his hair and deepened the blue of his eyes feeling better im fine whats going on here were having dinner the sets a little elaborate for he raised her hand to his lips nibbled lightly at her knuckles and had the breath strangling in her throat pizza she managed and he only smiled i like looking at you in candlelight seeing what it does to your eyes those exotic enormous eyes he murmured and drew her close to kiss them gently closed and your skin he trailed his lips over her cheek that impossibly soft skin im afraid ive put bruises on it forgetting just how soft it is what her head seemed to be circling slowly ive been careless with you cybil i wont be tonight he lifted her hands again kissed them again and had her heart stumbling i have something for you he told her and picked up a small square box with an elaborate pink bow from the counter instantly she whipped her hands behind her back i dont need gifts i dont want them he frowned puzzled at the shaky edge in her voice then realized she was thinking of pamela its not because you need them or ask for them or anything else for that matter its because they made me think of you he held the box out open it before you decide please feeling foolish she took the box gently removed the bow well who doesnt like presents she said lightly and you missed my birthday i did he said it with such guilty surprise she laughed yes it was in january and just because you didnt know me is really no excuse for not giving me a present so this will she stopped stared into the box at the earrings two long dangles of hematite in the shape of a dozen tiny foolish fish like minnows on the line she laughed rolled with it as she took them out held them up and shook so they would clack together theyre ridiculous i know i love them i figured you would eyes sparkling she slipped the thin wire backs through her ears well what do you think theyre you definitely its such a sweet thing to do she tossed her arms around him kissed him lavishly enough to have his blood heating then he heard the sniffle oh god dont dont do that sorry she pressed her face to his throat its just flowers and candles and silly fish all in one night its so thoughtful but she drew a long breath blew it out stepped back there all clear thank god he brushed his thumb over her lashes where a tiny tear clung ready for champagne champagne baffled she lifted her hands well its tough not to be ready for champagne she watched as he stepped into the kitchen took a bottle from her own crystal ice bucket and began to open it what in the world had gotten into him she wondered suddenly he was relaxed happy romantic you finished your play oh preston you finished it no i didnt not quite he popped the cork poured the wine oh trying to puzzle it out she angled her head as he turned handed her a glass full of strawcolored bubbling wine then what are we celebrating you he touched his glass to hers just you he laid a hand on her cheek then lifted his own glass to her lips she tasted the wine a froth on the tongue silk in the throat but it was the way he looked at her that made her head spin i dont know what to say to you well theres an unprecedented event smiling he brought the wine to his own lips tasted it tasted her ah so this is all a ploy to shut me up chuckling relaxed again she enjoyed the champagne very clever arent you i havent even started he took the glass from her set it aside then drew her into his arms even as she lifted her mouth expecting the kiss expecting he was sure demand and heat he skimmed his cheek over hers and began to move to the rhythm of the music ive never asked you to dance no her eyes drifted closed you havent dance with me cybil she ran her hands up his back laid her head on his shoulder and fell into the music and him they danced swaying together in the kitchen washed with candle glow when his lips grazed her jaw she turned her head so that his mouth cruised over hers her pulse was slow slow and thick her limbs weak as water preston she murmured it rising on her toes to give him more that must be dinner he said against her lips what dinner the buzzer oh shed thought the buzzing was in her head and had to brace a hand on the counter for balance when he left her to release the outer door i hope youre not disappointed he commented unlocking her door it isnt pizza oh thats all right anythings fine how was a woman supposed to eat when her stomach was full of tiny energetic butterflies but her eyes widened when rather than a delivery boy two tuxedoed waiters appeared at the door she watched astonished as with discretion and efficiency they arranged food on the table preston had already set with her best dishes in less than ten minutes they were gone and shed yet to find her voice hungry i it looks wonderful come sit down he took her hand again led her to the table in front of the window then bent to brash a kiss at her nape she must have eaten she would never be able to remember what or how it had tasted her innate powers of observation had deserted her all she could see was preston all she would remember was the way his fingers had brushed hers how his mouth had skimmed over her knuckles how he had smiled and poured more wine until her head was swimming with it how he had looked at her when hed risen and held out a hand for hers to bring her to her feet the way her heart had tripped when hed lifted her right off them and into his arms she suddenly seemed so delicate so vulnerable when she trembled even if hed wished it otherwise he couldnt have been anything but gentle he carried her up the steps into the bedroom and laid her on the pillows he lit the candles as he had once before but this time when he turned to her when he came to her his touch was feather soft and he took her dreaming into the kiss he gave more than hed thought he had left in him found more in her open response than hed believed possible if she trembled it wasnt triumph he felt but tenderness and he gave it back to her slow silky sumptuous kisses long liquid lingering caresses he had her floating on some high laceedged cloud where the air was full of perfume and the world beyond it insignificant gently he slipped the robe from her the glide of his hands sending silvery shivers along her skin and shimmering warmth beneath it through dazed eyes she watched as he drew back as his gaze followed the lazy trail of a single fingertip over her body youre so lovely cybil those suddenly intense blue eyes met hers how many times have i forgotten to tell you to show you preston no let me do both let me watch you enjoy being touched as i should have touched you before like this he murmured skimming his fingertips over her her breath caught and the cloud beneath her began to rock then he lowered his head and let his mouth follow the path his fingertips had blazed now she was drowning slowly floating beneath the surface of a warm dark sea helpless there drifting with only his hands and lips to anchor her and that first wave came in a long liquid crest that washed through her system to leave it weak and heavy with pleasure he wanted to have her steep in it sate her with it no sharp flash this time but a slow bum he explored and exploited every inch of her lingering when her breath quickened savoring when her body arched on each steadily building delight and his blood swam with it his heart jolted until he was as lost and open as she he murmured her name as he slipped into her moaned it as she wrapped around him in welcome with long deep thrusts he moved in her while their mouths met in a soft and stirring kiss in a slow sleek rhythm she moved under him while their hands met to complete yet another link they swallowed each others sighs gripped each others hands as they let themselves shatter and he was there when she awoke holding her as hed held her while they slept its definitely number one of the modernday top ten most romantic evenings jody expertly changed charlies diaper cooing at him between commentary it knocks that valentines day carriage ride around the park and dozen white roses with diamondchip earrings attached that my cousin sharon experienced down to a poor second place shes going to be peeved no ones ever paid that much attention cybil murmured hugging one of the teddy bears in charlies vast collection not just the youknow but the youknow jody cocked her eyebrows as she fastened charlies fresh diaper that was excellent right it was spectacular you know that scene in through the mist where dorian and alessa find each other after being cruelly separated by her evil ambitious uncle oh jody rolled her eyes lifting charlie up to bounce him do i ever i was up till two reading that book then i woke up chuck she smiled reminiscently we were both a little tired the next day but very very loose anyway she shook herself before carrying charlie into the living room so he could practice his crawling it was that good it was better no way it was like having him take my heart out and hold it then give it back to me oh man weakkneed jody slipped into a chair thats beautiful cyb just beautiful you ought to write a romance novel yourself but it wasnt just that it was all of it everything still giddy she threw her arms out and twirled in a circle making charlie rock back on his butt and clap in delight im so in love with him jody i didnt think you could be this much in love and not have it all just come steaming out of you there shouldnt be room inside for it all oh jodys sigh was long and loud when are you going to tell him i cant with a sigh of her own cybil picked up charlies red plastic hammer and tapped the oversize head on her palm im not brave enough to tell him something he doesnt want to hear cyb the guys crazy about you hes got feelings for me and maybe maybe if i can wait if he realizes im not going to let him down hell let himself feel more let him down the very idea ruffled jodys feathers you never let anyone down but maybe this time youre letting cybil down hes got reasons to be careful she said then shook her head before jody could speak i cant tell you about it theyre his own okay thanks ive got to go i have a million errands to run need anything actually i do if youre going out anyway ill just add it to the list ive got a few things to pick up for mrs wolinsky and i told mr peebles id see if the green grapes looked good at the market just let me find my shopping list im only asking because youre going out anyway and because its you jody bit her lip then grinned dont tell anybody what youre getting for me okay i wont absently cybil dug through her purse i know that list is in here somewhere it took longer than shed expected but cybil found shopping usually did then by the time shed delivered the goods to mrs wolinsky the grapes which had looked appetizing enough for her to buy a pound of her own to mr peebles and knocked on jodys door it was after five oclock she hissed in frustration when jody didnt answer it appeared her friend could stand the suspense though cybil herself wanted instant gratification but either jody had taken charlie out for a little walk or she was visiting one of the other neighbors and theyd both just have to wait arms loaded cybil took the elevator up and grinned like a fool when she saw preston waiting for her in the hall hi hi neighbor he scooped the bags out of her arms then bent down and kissed her hold it he said when she dropped back from her toes to the balls of her feet lets do that again okay laughing she wound her arms around his neck shifted back to her toes and put a great deal more energy into the greeting hows that that was fine what have you got in here bricks searching for her everelusive key she laughed again food mostly and some cleaning supplies some this and some that i picked up a few things for you the apples looked very good and theyre better for you to snack on while youre working than candy bars or stale bagels she found her key with a little aha and unlocked the door oh and i got you some ammonia itll take care of that grime youre letting build up on your windows apples and ammonia he set the bags on the counter what else could a man ask for cheesecake straight from the deli it was irresistible itll have to wait he spun her around off her feet and began to twirl with her well youre in a mood arent you grinning she bent down to kiss him if your smile got any bigger i might fall in youd be better than cheesecake i finished the play you did the hands that were braced on his shoulders slid around to hug his neck thats wonderful thats great ive never had anything move so fast it still needs work but its there all there you had a lot to do with it me so much of you kept jumping into it once i stopped trying to push you back out it just raced im speechless what did you write about me what was i like what did i do in it can i read it so much for speechless he noted and set her back on her feet after i fiddle with it a bit more you can read it lets go to the diner and celebrate the diner you want to go celebrate something like this with spaghetti and meatballs exactly and he didnt give a damn if it was sentimental with you where you once took a struggling musician out for a hot meal did you put that in there about me paying you god youll like it dont worry whats my name in the play whats my name zoe zoe she pursed her lips considered then the dimple fluttered at the corner of her mouth i like it nothing ordinary quite fit she kept tossing them back at me he laughed a little shook it off you look so happy she reached up brushing at his hair its nice to see you look so happy ive been doing a lot of that lately come on lets go i have to put the groceries away fix my face then well go go fix whatever you thinks wrong with your face ill put them away all right they actually have places she called out as she ran up the stairs they dont just get tossed into cupboards just make it fast he told her and started pulling things out of the first bag hed been going crazy for the past hour just waiting for her to get back so he could tell her tell her first and to tell her to find a way to tell her that somehow somewhere over the last few weeks everything had changed for him and though hed fought it ignored it denied it it had changed nonetheless he realized that for the first time in much much too long the sensation he continued to feel was simple happiness she was right he looked happy he was happy but it wasnt just the play it was cybil and it had been all along she made him happy it had come out in his work there was an underlying glow of hope in this play he hadnt intended to put there when hed begun but it was just there shimmering and impossible to resist the way she was it had come out in his life when she had come into his life with cookies and chatter and compassion with generosity and laughter and verve what he felt for her what she being who she was had given him no choice but to feel filled him completed him and he thought in a very real sense saved him the last line of his play said it he mused love heals with a little tune a little effort he thought he had a chance of making the kind of life with her hed stopped believing really existed he reached in the second bag pulled out a box and felt the world that had so recently gone rock steady waver shake and fall away under his feet i was going to change but i decided not to waste the time when we could be celebrating she clattered down the steps at a dead run the foolish earrings hed given her swinging i just have to call jody see if shes back yet then were out of here what the hell is this cybil pale coldly furious he tossed the home pregnancy test kit on the counter are you pregnant i you think youre pregnant but you dont tell me what were you going to pick your time your place your mood then let me in on it the color excitement and pleasure that had been glowing in her cheeks drained so that she was as pale as he now is that what you think preston what the hell am i supposed to think you waltz in all smiles not a care in the world and theres this he rapped a finger on the box and youre the one who claims she doesnt play games doesnt tell lies what else is keeping this from me but both of those and that makes me like pamela doesnt it all the joy that had shimmered in her heart throughout the day turned to ashes cold and gray calculating deceitful just one more user he had to steady himself to calm but the slash of betrayal where he had finally finally decided to trust was ripping through him this is you and me no one else i want an explanation i wonder if theres ever really been a you and me and no one else she murmured ill give you an explanation preston i picked up apples for you grapes for b and several small items for mrs wolinsky and i picked up that handy little willitbepinkorblue kit for jody she and chuck are hoping theyre expecting a baby brother or sister for charlie jody thats right every word she spoke hurt her throat im not pregnant so you can relax on that score im sorry oh so am i im terribly sorry her eyes ached as she picked up the box examined it jody was so excited when she asked me to buy this so hopeful for some people the idea of making a child is a joyful one but for you she went on putting the box down making herself look at him its a threat just a bad memory of a bad time it was a poor reaction cybil kneejerk you could say instinctive i suppose what would you have done preston if it had been mine if id been pregnant would you have thought id tricked you trapped you done it on purpose to ruin your life or maybe youd have wondered if id been with another man and was laughing at you behind your back no i wouldnt have thought that the very idea shocked him dont be ridiculous of course i wouldnt have thought that whats ridiculous about it she did it why not me why the hell not me you let her jump right back in here youre the one who left the door open for her youre right cybil she stepped back sharply when he reached for her oh dont i cant quite figure out if you think im just another calculating bitch or pathetically malleable but im neither im just me and ive been nothing but honest with you you had no right to hurt me like this and i had no right to let you but that stops now i want you to go im not going until we settle this its settled i dont blame you for it im just as much at fault i gave too much and expected too little you were honest with me this is all i have dont ask for more you said this is what i am take it or leave it its my own fault thats what i did but i wont be doing it anymore i need someone in my life who respects me who trusts me im not settling for less so i want you out she strode to the door flung it open get the hell out because in spite of the fire in her eyes they were swimming with tears despite the fists her hands were clenched in they were shaking he went to the door but he stopped looked at her i was wrong completely wrong cybil im sorry so am i she started to slam the door then drew a deep breath i lied i havent always been honest with you but now i will be im in love with you preston and thats the pity of it he said her name started toward her but she shut the door he heard the locks snap into place he pounded on the door cursed through it he paced the hallway then stalked into his own apartment to call her but she wouldnt answer he tried pounding again and finally feeling that everything hed begun to treasure in his life was slipping away he tried begging but she was upstairs with that door closed as well and couldnt hear him as she wept in the dark chapter twelve contents prev i ought to go find the son of a bitch and break his legs his arms then his neck grant campbell paced the kitchen of the home hed built with his wife his mood as dark and rough as the sea that thrashed outside that wouldnt stop her from hurting gennie turned from the window where shed been watching for her daughter and studied her husband long and lean she mused and still just a bit dangerous so much the man shed fallen in love with all those years ago and so much more itd make me feel a hell of a lot better grant muttered im going out to get her no dont gennie laid a hand on his arm before he could storm out the door let her be awhile its dark he said and felt helpless shell come in when shes ready i cant stand it i cant stand the look he put in her eyes she has to hurt before she can heal we both know that because they both needed it gennie slipped into his arms rested her head on his shoulder she knows were here it was easier when one of them would fall down scrape or break something you didnt think so then her laugh was as warm as it had been when hed first met her her voice was rich and recalled the scent of magnolias in full bloom she tipped back her head cupped his face you always hurt more than they did i just want to put her on my lap make it go away he lowered his brow to gennies then i want to rip the bastards lungs out me too she said pleased when he chuckled that was how cybil saw them when she came in the room the two of them standing in the kitchen standing close their eyes on each others and that she decided that bond that intimacy was what she wanted what shed been willing to give she walked to them slipped an arm around each to make a circle do you know how many times in my life ive come in here and seen the two of you just like this and how lovely it is your hairs wet grant rubbed his cheek over it i was watching the waves crash she tilted her head to kiss him stop worrying so daddy i will when youre fifty maybe he patted her cheek want some coffee mmm no nothing really i think ill take a hot bath then snuggle into bed with a book it always worked for me when i was a teenager working off a crush during those crises i ran your bath her mother reminded her why break tradition you dont have to do that mama let me fuss gennie slipped an arm around her shoulders with a sigh cybil let herself be guided out i was sort of hoping you would your father needs to be alone to pace and curse your young man hes not my young man cybil muttered as they started up the wide circular stairs grant had designed to echo the narrow metal ones in the lighthouse just beyond the house he never was but youre not a teenager now gently gennie turned cybil as they moved into the bedroom where cybil had dreamed her younggirl dreams and this isnt a crush the tears came again spurting out of her center flooding her heart throat eyes as she shook her head oh mama there baby she led cybil to the bed still covered with its colorful quilt and sitting beside her opened her arms i want to hate him burrowing into the comfort cybil wept and clung i want to hate him if i could for just a little while id stop loving him i wish i could tell you that you would i wish i knew some men are so hard so baffling gennie rocked her daughter as she spoke i know you sweet baby i know if you love him theres something in him that makes him worthy of it hes wonderful hes horrible oh mama cybil leaned back weeping still hes just like daddy oh god help you with a half laugh gennie gathered her close again i always loved the story her breath hitched and she gratefully took the tissue gennie snagged from the box near the bed the story about how you met when your car broke down in the storm and you were lost and you stumbled on the lighthouse where he was living like a hermit and he was so cranky and rude she paused to blow her nose while gennie stroked her hair and added he couldnt wait to get rid of me the way he tells it you burst in on him and he was annoyed because you were wet and beautiful cybil sighed and studied her mothers face with its honeytoned skin its strong bones the lovely fall of dark hair that framed it youre so beautiful mama you have my eyes gennie said softly that makes me feel beautiful tired after the storm of tears cybil wiped them dry were just wrong for each other she said at length preston and i hes so fiercely private so absorbed in his work but its not that he doesnt have humor she sighed rose walked to the window so that she could see the moon on the water sometimes it can be incredibly charming unexpected delightful hes so moody you never know whats going to pop up and theres this amazing sensitivity and you realize hes almost afraid to trust to feel then he touches you and youre lost all the things that he is all of those complicated things he is are there when he touches you but he still doesnt quite let you in good lord he is like your father cybil you have to do whats right for you but if you love him this much you may never be happy unless you at least try to work things out with him he thinks im frivolous the fighting edge came back in her voice pleasing gennie enormously and that my work is less important than his just because its different he doesnt trust me he thinks he can flick me off like a gnat one minute and he cant keep his hands off me the next she whirled around ready to spew out more complaints and saw her mother smiling what how did you find another i thought i had the only one grandpa found him gennies smile sharpened her aristocratic eyebrows arched oh she said in the regal tone cybil recognized as dangerous oh really for the first time in more than twentyfour hours cybil smiled preston scowled and shoved his sax back in his case damn the woman he couldnt even play out his frustration he certainly couldnt work which hed proven after spending most of a miserable day between staring at his screen and going across the hall to bang on cybils door that was before hed finally realized she wasnt inside anymore shed left him which he decided was the smartest thing shed done since shed met him and after brooding over it hed figured out the best thing he could do for both of them was to be gone when she got back from wherever the hell shed gone he was going back to connecticut in the morning he could tolerate construction workers plumbers electricians and whoever else would descend on him on a daily basis for the next few weeks but he couldnt tolerate living across the hall from a woman he loved and couldnt have due to his own stupidity everything shed said to him had been completely true he had no defense i wont be around for a while andre the piano player looked up through the haze of smoke from the cigarette between his lips that so im heading back to connecticut tomorrow uhhuh woman chase you away brow cocked andre stretched back that your tail i see between your legs brother with a short humorless laugh preston picked up his case see you around ill be right here when prestons back was turned andre jerked up his chin signaling his wife then stabbed a thumb in prestons direction with a nod she glided over to block prestons exit leaving early

us a goodbye drink cause im gonna miss your pretty face ill miss yours too not just mine she said then held up two fingers to the bartender that little girl put the blues into you and you cant put them all in your sax not this time not with her no not with her he lifted his glass thats over whys that because she said it is he drank let the fire course through him but found it didnt quite warm his insides delta let out a short laugh when did a man take that for an answer when the woman means it this man takes it mcquinn delta patted his cheek you sure are a fool no argument thats why its over i ruined it i have to live with it you ruin it you have to fix it when you hurt someone that much theyve got the right to lock you out honey when you love someone that much youve got the right to pick that lock then do a lot of crawling on your hands and knees she turned studied him eye to eye you love her that much he turned his glass watched the whiskey through the smoke i didnt know there was this much that there could be sugar lips she kissed him go pick yourself a lock he shook his head tossed back the rest of his drink then started the walk home delta was wrong he told himself sometimes you couldnt fix it you couldnt pick the lock and you were better off not trying why should she let him back in he carried the image of how her face had paled how her eyes had gone huge and hollow and how the tears had swirled in them over the heat of anger he didnt have any right to ask her to listen to let him crawl or beg or play on her sympathies and he didnt realize hed started to run until hed reached jodys door out of breath and was pounding on it for gods sake after checking the peep jody wrenched open the door and hitched her robe closed if chuck didnt sleep like a rock she wouldnt have had to race out of bed before the noise woke the baby its after midnight are you crazy where is she jody where did she go she wrinkled her nose lifting her chin with a dignity that was difficult to maintain in a robe covered with pink kittens are you drunk i had one drink no im not drunk hed never felt more sober or more desperate wheres cybil like id tell you after you broke her heart go back up to your hole she ordered pointing dramatically before i wake up chuck and some of the other people around here they might just lynch you on the spot her bottom lip trembled everyone loves cybil so do i right thats why you made her cry her eyes out as her own threatened to fill jody dug a ratty tissue out of the pocket of her robe all preston could do was close his eyes against the vicious guilt please tell me where she is why should i so i can crawl and give her a chance to kick me while im down so i can beg for gods sake jody tell me where she is i have to see her jody sniffled into the tissue but the eyes over it had cleared and now they narrowed as they studied prestons face and saw pale desperation you really love her enough to let her send me away if thats what she wants but i have to see her first what could a romantic heart do but sigh shes at her parents in maine ill write it down for you rocked with relief stunned with gratitude he had to close his eyes again thanks if you hurt her again she muttered as she scribbled on the back of an envelope ill hunt you down and kill you with my bare hands i wont even put up a fight he blew out a breath are you ah she glanced over then smiled and laid a hand on her belly yeah im ah im due on valentines day isnt that perfect its great congratulations he took the envelope she handed him then stuffed it into his pocket framed her face in his hands and kissed her thank you she waited until hed dashed out then exhaled long and sharp oh yeah she murmured as she closed and locked the door i can see how that could work into a no scale definitely noscale potential then she closed her eyes crossed the fingers of both hands good luck cybil the macgregor grant said the words through clenched teeth his darkbrown eyes snapping as visions of murder and mayhem danced through his mind interfering old goat because it was a sentiment grant had expressed in various terms any number of times since shed told him the night before of daniels matchmaking plot gennie didnt bother to suppress the grin her husband adored daniel macgregor i thought it was meddling old blockhead that too if he wasnt six hundred years old id kick his butt grant gennie set down her sketch pad deciding the lovely old maple shed been sketching would be in full leaf rather than tender bud before her husband stopped pacing you know he did it out of love didnt work did it gennie started to speak then hearing the sound of a car turned shielding her eyes against the slant of the midmorning sun she felt a little ripple go through her heart im not so sure of that she murmured who the hell is that it was grants usual sentiment when someone dared to trespass on his staunchly guarded privacy if thats another tourist im getting the gun you dont have a gun im buying one she couldnt help it gennie sprang to her feet tossed the sketchbook down on the glider and threw her arms around him oh grant i love you the feel of her broke through his darkening mood like sun through storm clouds genvieve he lowered his head took her mouth his blood stirred and his heart warmed tell whoever that is to go away and never come back gennie kept her arms around him laid her head on his shoulder and watched the gorgeous little car fight its way down the narrow rutted road grant refused to have repaired i think thats going to be up to cybil what grants eyes narrowed as he shifted his gaze to watch the cars progress you figure thats him well well he said and would have pushed his way clear if his wifes arms hadnt tightened around him im going to be able to kick some butt after all behave the hell i will preston sported them as a particularly nasty bump snapped his teeth together hed been too busy cursing whoever considered this ditch in the middle of nowhere a road to notice much more than the next rut but as his gaze was drawn up he saw the couple standing in the yard of a rambling white farmhouse not really standing he thought embracing there on the grass just greening with spring beside an oldfashioned glider positioned to nestle between graceful shrubs were the parents of the woman he loved he wondered which one of them would kill him first resigned he muscled the car down the lane and scanned the place where he would likely be buried in a shallow grave hed seen it before he realized in the work of genvieve campbell shed painted here he thought with love and with brilliance the romantic old whitewashed lighthouse that loomed over the cliff the tumbling rocks that showed color and age in the morning light the bent and twisted trees all had been pulled together to form a place and a painting of wild beauty the house with its gleaming white paint its many windows and cozily covered porch the tidy flower beds waiting for the spring that would come late to this part of the world offered simple comfort cybil had grown up here he thought in this wild and wonderful place he stopped the car but the sense of relief that his bones could now stop rattling couldnt compete against nerves the couple on the lawn had turned to watch him even at a distance preston could see the sentiment on the rugged face of cybils father and the sentiment wasnt welcome he stepped out of the car determined to live long enough to see cybil and say his piece after that he supposed all bets were off no wonder gennie thought as she watched preston cross the yard no wonder shed fallen so hard feeling grant tense she dug her fingers into his waist in warning he vibrated like a pit bull on a choke chain mrs campbell mr campbell preston nodded but knew better than to offer his hand it would be very hard to type with a stub im preston mcquinn i need cybil need to see cybil he corrected flustered how old are you mcquinn prestons brows knit at the unexpected question delivered in slow measured tones that didnt dilute the threat thirty grant inclined his head you want to live to see thirtyone you get back in that car put it in reverse and just keep going preston kept his eyes level unconsciously rolling his shoulders like a boxer preparing for a bout not until ive seen cybil after that you can take me apart or try to youre not getting within ten feet of her grant set gennie aside as if she weighed little more than a childs doll as he took a menacing step forward preston kept his hands at his sides cybils father could have first blood he decided hed earned it stop it gennie dashed between them slapped a hand on each of their chests she sent her husband one withering look then offered preston the same he had a moment to think hed just been chastised by a queen then his heart stumbled she has your eyes he had to swallow cybil she has your eyes and the soft green of them warmed yes she does shes on the cliff behind the lighthouse damn it gennie before he could stop himself preston lifted a hand to the one she pressed to his heart he could feel his own thundering beat thank you he lifted his gaze to grants held it i wont hurt her not ever again damn it grant muttered again when preston started for the cliffs in long determined strides why did you do that with a sigh gennie turned back took her husbands face in her hands because he reminded me of someone like hell she laughed and i think our daughters going to be a very happy woman very shortly he let out one exasperated sigh i shouldve gotten just one punch in on principle damn if he wasnt going to let me then grant glanced over watched preston disappear behind the wide white base of the tower i mightve been able to do it if one look at your eyes hadnt cut him off at the knees hes stupid in love with her i know remember how scary that is its still scary with a laugh he pulled her against him again the boys got guts grant mused and being your daughter cybil will twist them into knots for a while before she forgives him of course she will he deserves it daniel was right about them she added i know grant grinned down at his wife but lets not tell him for a while and make him suffer she was sketching sitting on a rock with the wind ruffling through her dark hair her head bent over the pad her pencil flying the sight of her stole his breath hed driven through the night through the morning all the while trying to image how he would feel when he saw her again for once his imagination had fallen far short he said her name then realized his shaky whisper wouldnt carry over the sounds of wind and water he started down the narrow beaten path toward the sea maybe she heard him or perhaps his shadow changed her light or maybe she simply sensed him but her head came up and her eyes whipped to him emotions stormed through them before they turned the chilly green of a winter sea then as if his presence didnt matter in the least she began to sketch again youre a long way from home mcquinn cybil his throat felt rusty were not much on visitors around here my father often talks about mining the road too bad he hasnt gotten around to it cybil he said again while his fingers itched to touch her if id had any more to say to you id have said it in new york go away her mind screamed go away before the tears come back i have something to say to you she flicked him a disinterested glance if id wanted to hear it same goes she closed her sketchbook rose now please he lifted a hand but when her eyes flared in warning dropped it again hear me out then if you want me to go ill go youre too fair he said for a lack of a better word not to listen all right she sat back on the rock opened her sketchbook again ill just keep working if you dont mind i he didnt know where to begin all the speeches hed rehearsed all the pleas and promises deserted him my agent ran into yours yesterday really what a small insular world we live in he might have winced at that biting tone but he was too busy looking at her he told her about the series the television series theyre going to do based on your strip she said it was a major deal for some you didnt tell me she spared him another glance youre not interested in my work thats not true but i cant blame you for thinking it i worked it out timewise the day you came to see me almost bursting with excitement youd come to tell me and i ruined it for you i he broke off had to turn away and stare out over the green and restless sea i was distracted by the play and more what i was feeling for you what i didnt want to feel for you her fingers tightened and she broke the tip of her pencil furious with herself she stuck it behind her ear and dug in her small tool bag for another if thats what you came to say youve said it now you can go no thats not what i came to say but ill apologize for it and tell you im happy for you whoopee he shut his eyes fisted his hands so she could be cruel he thought when it was deserved everything you said to me the night you threw me out of your life was right i let something that had happened a long time ago stand in front of now i used it to cut myself off from the best thing thats ever happened to me i watched my sisters world shatter saw her struggle to function over the betrayal and the pain to raise her son alone and give birth to another before the ink was dry on her divorce papers how could she hold herself aloof from that cybil thought as she closed her book again how could she be unmoved i know it was hell for her for both of you no one should have gone through what your sister did preston no they shouldnt but people do he turned back met her eyes already he thought in wonder already there was sympathy in them it would work wouldnt it if i used my sister to play on your compassion thats not what i want to do not what im going to do he walked to where the land fell off where it seemed to have been hacked by an ax to form a wall that faced the churning sea gulls screamed overhead swooping down with flashes of white wings then rising up again to soar she came here he thought here to this place whenever she visited her childhood home came here on those rare times when she needed to be alone with her thoughts it was only right he supposed that he finally gave her his thoughts and the feelings behind them in a place that was hers i loved pamela what happened between us changed me i know she would have to forgive him cybil realized as she could feel her heart softening before she let him go i loved her he repeated turning toward her again stepping forward but what i felt for her isnt a shadow isnt even a pale substitute for what i feel for you what i feel when i think of you when i look at you it overwhelms me cybil it makes me ache it makes me hope her lips trembled open her heart began to beat in a quick almost painful rhythm she recognized as joy she saw on his face what shed never really believed she would see struggling to absorb it she looked away down the long rocky coast that seemed to stretch into forever for what she managed what does it make you hope for miracles i hurt you ive no excuse for it he spoke quickly terrified she would tell him it no longer mattered that it was too late i attacked when i thought you might be pregnant because i was angry at myself angry that part of me was thinking that having a baby with you would be a way i could keep you when her head whipped around her eyes wide with shock he dragged his hands through his hair i knew you didnt want marriage but if youd been i could have pushed you into it and my only defense against that kind of thinking against using something like that was to turn on you pushed me into marriage was all she could say staggered she rose walked a few feet away to stare blindly down into the thrashing waves how was she supposed to keep up with this she wondered how had it all changed so fast its no excuse but you have a right to know i never thought youd planned it or tricked me ive never known anyone less calculating than you cybil youre a warm generous woman with a capacity for joy unlike anyone else ive ever known having you in my life you made me happy and i think id forgotten how to be preston she turned back her vision blurry with tears please let me finish just hear me out he grabbed her hands now gripping hard i love you everything about you staggers me you said you loved me you dont lie no she saw him clearly now the exhaustion in his eyes the tension in his face if he hadnt been holding her hands so tightly she would have tried to smooth it all away i dont lie i need you so much more than you need me i know you can get over me and move on youre too resilient too open to life not to nothing would stop you from being what you are you can tell me to go youll forget me whatever part i played in your life wont keep you from being happy he kept his eyes on her face surrendering everything to the desperate whirl of emotion inside him and ill never in my life get over you ill never stop loving you or stop regretting everything i did to push you away from me you can tell me to go he said in a voice strained taut with emotion and i will please god helpless he lowered his brow to hers please dont tell me to go do you believe that she said quietly do you really believe i could forget you amazed at how steady her voice and her heart was she waited until he lifted his head and looked down at her maybe i could get over you and be happy but why should i risk it why should i tell you to go when i want you to stay he let out the air clogging his lungs even as her lips began to curve he pulled her against him kept her there swaying with relief she felt him shudder once as he pressed his face to her shoulder you didnt let me ruin it his voice was raw and his heart seemed to batter against hers until it moved inside her no i didnt she held on rocked with the knowledge that he had so much feeling for her in him this strong stubborn serious man was weak for love of her i couldnt i need you too he held her away from him his heart in his eyes as he skimmed his thumbs over her cheeks i love this face i thought i lost it he brushed his lips over her brow her eyelids i thought i lost you cybil i cant his mouth covered hers he meant to be gentle to show her she would be cherished but emotion raged through him wild and strong as the sea below them all of it poured into the kiss when he drew back her eyes were wet dont cry youre going to have to get used to it we campbells are an emotional lot i figured that out your father wants to break me into very small pieces when he sees you make me happy hell let you live she grinned and laughter bubbled out hell love you preston and so will my mother first because i do then because of who you are moody rude shorttempered yes she laughed again when he winced i could deny it but im such a lousy liar she took his hand in hers and began to walk i love it here this is where my parents met and fell in love he lived in the lighthouse then like a hermit guarding his work irritated that a woman had come along to distract him she shot him a sidelong look hes moody rude shorttempered the similarity had him grinning sounds like a very sensible man he brought their joined hands to his lips cybil will you go to newport with me and meet my family id like that she glanced up her head angling when she saw that familiar intense expression in his eyes what he stopped turned to her in the shadow of the great light with the water warring against the rocks below i know you dont want marriage or a house in the country you like living in new york in the center of things and i dont expect youd like the house he said interrupting his own thoughts its a great old place near the coast like this anyway he continued shaking his head as she remained silent just looking at him i dont expect you to change your lifestyle but if you decide later on that you want to marry me make a home and a family with me will you tell me her heart did three wonderful and stylish handsprings but she only nodded youll be the first to know telling himself to be content with that he gave her hand a quick squeeze okay he started to walk again surprised when she stopped pulling back so that both their arms were extended linked only by warm fingers preston yeah i want to marry you make a home and a family with you the smile lit up her face as he gaped at her see youre the first to know hope spun cheerfully into bliss sure he brought her stumbling into him with one quick jerk but did you have to keep me dangling for so long then she was laughing as he swung her off her feet spinning her in dizzy circles
