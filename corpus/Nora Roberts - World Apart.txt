nora roberts a world apart contents chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter in the sweltering jungle under the bloodred sun kadra hunted her steps were silent her eyesgreen as the trio of stones that encrusted the hilt of her swordwere alert watchful merciless for four days and four nights she had tracked her prey over the stone mountains beyond the singing river and into the verdant heat of the land of tulle what she stalked rarely ventured to these borders and she herself had never traveled so far in the south of adair there were villages here small enclaves of lesser hunters settlements of farmers and weavers with their young and their animals the young were as much food to what she hunted as the cattle and mounts were she trod on the mad red flowers that were strewn on the path ignored the sly silver slide of a snake down the trunk of a tree she saw sensed scented both but they were of no interest to her the bok demons were her only interest now and destroying them her only goal it was what she had been born for other scents came to herthe beasts large and small that inhabited the jungle and the thick wet fragrance of vine and blossom the bloodno longer freshof one that had been caught and consumed by what she hunted she passed a great fall of water that raged over the cliffs to pound its drumbeat into the river below though she had never walked upon this ground this she knew by its light and music as a sacred place one that no demon could enter so she stopped to drink of its purifying waters to fill her water bag for the journey yet to come and poured drops from her hand to the ground in thanks to the powers of life beyond the falls the busier scents of peoplesweat flesh cooking springwater from a village wellreached her keen senses it was her duty to protect them and her fate that none among them could ever be her companion her friend her lifemate these were truths she had never questioned at last she caught the overripe stench that was bok the sword streaked out of its sheath a bright battle sound as she pivoted on the heels of her soft leather boots the dagger its point a diamond in the sun flipped from its wrist mount to her hand the dark blue claws of the bok that had leaped from a branch overhead whizzed past her face missing their mark she set into a fighting stance and waited for his next charge it looked oddly normal other than those lethal retractable claws the scent the needlesharp fangs that snapped out when the lips were peeled back for battle the bok looked no different from the people they devoured at every opportunity this one was small for his species no more than six feet which put him on a level with her he was naked but for the thin skin of his traveling armor except for claws and teeth he was unarmed the vicious gouges across his chest and arms were stained from his pale green blood and told her he had run afoul of his companions and had been forced out of the pack a distraction for her she imagined and didnt intend to spend much time dispatching him they sacrificed you she said as she circled what was your crime he only hissed flicking his long tongue through those sharp teeth she taunted him with a happy grin muscles ready above all else she lived for combat when he leaped she spun her sword up down and severed his head with one smooth stroke though the ease of the job was a bit of a disappointment she grunted in satisfaction as the green blood sizzled and smoked and the body of the bok melted away to nothing but an ugly smear on the ground not much of a challenge she muttered and sheathed her sword still the day is young so there is hope for better her hand was still on the hilt when she heard the scream she ran her dark hair flying behind her the band of her rank that encircled her head glinting like vengeance when she burst into the small clearing with its tidy line of huts she saw that the single bok had been but a brief distraction delaying her just long enough bodies of animals and a few men who had tried to defend their homes lay torn and bleeding on the ground others were running in panic some holding their young clutched to them as they scattered and she knew they would be hunted down and rent to pieces if a single demon escaped her duty sorrow for the dead and the thrill of upcoming battle warred inside her three of the bok were crouched in the dirt still feeding their eyes glowed red their vicious teeth snapped as she charged they sprang mad enough with blood to choose fight over flight she cleaved the arm from one leaped into a flying kick to knock another out of her way as she plunged her ready dagger into the heart of the third i am kadra she shouted slayer of demons guardian of the red sun you are too late the remaining bok hissed at her you are outnumbered our king will tear out your heart and we will share in the feast today you go hungry he was faster than the others and fueled by his grisly meal this she knew would be an opponent more worthy of her skill he chose not his claws but the long hooked blade he drew from the sheath at his side steel rang to steel as the screams and the stench rose around her she knew there were at least three others and she knew now that the demon king the one called sorak was among them his death was her lifes work the bok fought well with his sickle sword and swiped out with those blue claws she felt the pain an absent annoyance as they dug furrows over her bare shoulder instead of retreating she pushed into the attack into the flashing blue and silver to run him through with a fierce thrust i am kadra she murmured as the bok smoked to the ground i am your death she wheeled to aim her weapon and her gaze on the demon king and the three warriors that flanked him outside the open doorway of a hut at last she thought praise the powers of life at last i am your death sorak she said as i was death for clud your father on this day in this hour i will rid my world of you keep your world the king of demons regal in his red tunic and bands of gold lifted a small clear globe i go to another there i will conquer and feed there i will rule his handsome face was sheened with sweat and blood his dark hair coiled sleek and twisted like snakes over his elegant shoulders then he bared his teeth and the illusion of rough beauty vanished into horror where i go the food is plentiful there i will be a god keep your world kadra demon slayer or come with me he beckoned with a voice seductive as a caress i will give you the demon kiss i will make you my queen and plant my young inside you we will rule this new world together you want to kiss me to join with me you have shed the blood of my sire i have drunk the blood of a slayer we are well matched together we will have power beyond all imagining his three warriors were armed and a demon kings strength knew no equal among his kind four against one kadra thought with a leap of her heart it would be her greatest battle come then she all but purred it come embrace me she pursed her own lips then charged to her shock the demon swirled his cloak and with his warriors vanished in a sudden flash of light where how she spun in a circle sword raised dagger ready and her blood still singing a war song she could smell them a lingering stench it was all that was left of them women were weeping children wailing and she had failed three bok and their hellborn king had escaped her their eyes had met and yet sorak had defeated her without landing a blow you have not lost them yet kadra looked toward the hut where a woman stood in the doorway she was pale and beautiful her hair a midnight rain her face like something carved from delicate glass but her eyes green as kadras own were ancient and in them it seemed worlds could live in them kadra saw pain lady she said respectfully as she stepped toward her you are injured i will heal i know my fate and it is not time for me to pass call the healer kadra told her i must hunt yes you must hunt come inside i will show you how now kadras eyebrows raised the woman was beautiful true and there was an air of magic about her but she was still only a female im a demon slayer hunting is what i know in this world the woman agreed but not in the one where you must go the demon king has stolen one of the keys but there are others she swayed and kadra leaped forward cursing to catch her frail bones she thought such delicate bones would shatter easily why did they let you live kadra demanded as she helped the woman inside it is not in their power to destroy me to harm but not to vanquish i did not know they were coming she shook her head as she lowered herself into a chair by a hearth left cold in the heat of day my own complacency blinded me to them but not to you she smiled then and those eyes were brilliant not to you kadra slayer of demons ive waited for you why you call me lady and once i was once i was a young girl of rank who took a brave warrior into her heart and gave him her body in love he was killed in the battle of the singing river it was a great battle against the bok and the demon tribes who joined them impressed kadra tilted her head she had been weaned on battle stories and this was the greatest of all many were destroyed on all sides many brave warriors perished as did three slayers the numbers of bok were halved but still clud escaped and since increased those numbers again to plague our world i watched the battle in my fire and in the moment my love was struck down in that moment of grief i bore a girl child she who was born to take up a sword as her father had done she who would be more than those who made her you are she you are my blood and flesh and bone i am she who bore you i am your mother kadra retreated one step where there had been pity was now anger i have no mother you know i speak true you have vision enough to see she felt the truth like a burn in the heart but wanted only to deny it humans who are not slayers keep their young they tend and guard and protect them even at the risk of death so it should be the womans voice thickened with regret i could not keep you with me my duty was here holding the keys and yours was your training i could not give you a mothers comfort a mothers care or a fathers pride parting with you was another death for me i need no mother kadra said flatly nor father i am a slayer yes this is your fate and even i could not turn your lifes wheel away from it as i cannot turn it now from where you must go from what you must do i must hunt and you will our world and another are at stake i could not keep you then she stated i cannot keep you now though i have never let you go kadra shook her head she was accustomed to physical pain but not to this hurt inside the heart the one who bore me was a warrior as i am she died at demon claws when i was but a child your foster mother a good and brave warrior at her side you learned what you needed to learn when she was taken from you you learned more now you will learn the rest i am rhee rhee kadra fearless in battle went pale rhee is a legend a sorceress of unspeakable power she is closed in a crystal mountain of her own making and will free herself when the world has need stories and tales with only some truths for the first time rhees lips curved in a smile lovely in humor the green of tulle is my home no mountain of glass you have my magic in you and it is you who must free herself there is great need in this world and the other what other kadra snapped this is the world the only world there are more countless others the world from which the demons sprang worlds of fire worlds of ice and a world not so different from thisyet so different sorak has gone to this world through the portal opened by the glass key he has gone to plunder and kill to gather power until he is immortal he wants your blood wants your death to avenge his father more even more he wants the power he believes he will gain by making you his mate he will not have me in this world or any he would have slain his own father in time if i had not destroyed clud before him you see the truth this is vision this is sense whatever you choose to name it rhee said with a wave of her hand but a king cannot rule without vanquishing his most feared foe or changing her he will not rest until you are destroyed by death or by his kiss he goes through the portal to begin his own hunt with every death from demon hands in that place another here will die this is the balance this is the price you speak in riddles i will fetch the healer before i hunt if you turn away rhee said as kadra got to her feet if you choose the wrong path all is lost the world you know the one you need to know there is more than one key rhee breathed raggedly as her pain grew took another clear globe from the folds of her skirt and more than one mirror she waved a hand toward the empty hearth fire bright as gold leaped into the cold shadow in it kadra saw another jungle one of silver and black mountains no structures of great heightsurely they could not be hutsrivers of black and white that had no current over them great armies of people marched over them battalions of animals on four round legs raced what is this place a great village they call it a city a place where people live and work where they eat and sleep where they live and die this is called new york and it is there youll find them the demons you must stop and the man who will help you though fascinated and just a bit frightened of the images in the flames kadra smirked i need no man in battle so you have been taught rhee said with a smile perhaps you needed to believe you needed no one no man to become what you have become now you will become more to do so you will need this man he is called doyle harper doyle what good is a harper to a warrior kadra demanded a fine warrior hell make with his song and story as sword and shield he is what you need you will fail without him even with him there is great risk why should i believe any of this any witch might conjure pictures in a fire any woman might spin a tale as easily as thread the stone in your crown of rank those in your sword i gave to you for strength for clear vision for valor and last for love they were my tears when i gave you to your fate in my eyes you see your own in your heart you see the truth now we must prepare kadra set her hand on the hilt of her sword i am prepared with a heavy sigh rhee got to her feet she walked to a wooden cupboard took out a metal box take this she offered a bag of stones where you go she explained they have great value kadra looked into the bag of shining stones then where i go is a very foolish place in some ways in others fantastic rhees expression was soft you have much to see i will give you what knowledge i can but there are limits even for me she held out her hands gripped kadras before kadra could draw back the rest she said and glinting tears scored down her cheeks is up to you and the man called doyle a great roar like rushing water over cliffs filled kadras head in it were words a hundred thousand words spoken in countless tongues a pressure as a boulder laid on her heart filled her chest the light was blinding valor and strength you have my child use them on this journey wild but open yourself to vision to love before its too late gather them close and face your fate would i could keep you safe with me she murmured and her lips brushed a kiss over kadras but once again i set you free the world whirled and spun the air sucked her in tumbled her then spat her rudely out chapter sprawled in bed plagued by the mother of all hangovers the man called doyle let out a surprised and pained grunt when a halfnaked woman dropped on top of him he saw eyes of intense and burning green eyes he thought wearily that hed been dreaming of moments before hed awakened with a head the size of nebraska there was an instant of recognition a strange and intimate knowledge and with it a bonedeep longing then there was nothing but shock he had time to blink a split second to admire what he was certain was a very creative hallucination before the very sharp and very real point of a dagger pressed against his carotid artery i am kadra the mostly naked and wellarmed hallucination stated in a throaty voice as oddly familiar as her eyes slayer of demons okay thats really interesting if hed been drunk and stupid enough the night before to bring a crazy woman back to his apartment and couldnt even remember heating up the sheets with her he deserved to get his throat cut but it really wasnt the way he wanted to start the day would you mind getting that pigsticker away from my jugular youre spoiling a perfectly good hangover frowning she sniffed at him then used her free hand to pull up his top lip and study his teeth satisfied she drew back the dagger slid it handily into its wrist sheath you are not a demon you may live appreciate it going with instinct rather than sanity harper shoved her snatched at the dagger the next thing he knew shed executed a neat back flip off the bed landed on her feet beside it with a very big sword raised over her head you win he tossed the dagger aside held up both hands you yield damn right why dont you put that thing down before somebodyespecially megets hurt then we can go call the nice people at the asylum theyll come pick you up and take you for a little ride disgusted that shed landed on a coward she shook her head but she lowered the sword are you the harper called doyle im harper doyle we have to hunt sure no problem smiling at her he eased toward the far side of the bed whatever that feeling had been when hed first looked into her eyes he was sure now he hadnt been drunk enough hadnt been stupid enough to bring her home with him just let me get my hunting gear and well be off using his body to block her view he slid open the drawer in the nightstand and drew out his glock now put that goddamn sword down xena i am kadra she corrected and studied the object in his hand this is a gun the name the purpose of it were floating in her head in the maze of knowledge rhee had given her the fascination for it this new weapon made her yearn i would like to have one she looked at him studying his face for the first time and found herself shocked that it brought her another kind of yearning i was sent to you she told him fine well get to that but right now put the sword down he repeated id really hate to spoil my record and shoot a woman it was more comfortable to study the gun and her feelings for an interesting weapon the missile goes through flesh and bone it can be very efficient she nodded sent her sword home perhaps you are a warrior we will talk oh yeah harper agreed were going to have a very nice chat his head felt as if someone had spent the night attempting a lobotomy with a dull rusty blade he could accept that in a bemused celebration of his thirtieth birthdayhow could he be thirty when hed been eighteen two minutes agohed consumed a tanker truck of alcohol hed been entitled to get plastered with a couple of pals he was entitled to the hangover having a womana gorgeous greeneyed amazon who filled out her black leather bikini in a way that gratified every young boys comic book fantasiesleap on him out of nowhere was a really nice plus just the sort of happy birthday surprise a man whod reached the point of no return on the path to adulthood could appreciate but having that erotic armful hold a knife to his throat wasnt part of the acceptable package and where the hell had she come from he wondered as she stood there eyeing his gun there was nothing but simple curiosity and avid interest on that sharpboned sirens face had he been so drunk hed forgotten to lock his door it was a possibilitya remote one but a possibility but shed called him by name no way she was from the neighborhood he was a trained observer and even if hed been a myopic accountant rather than a private investigator he would have noticed a sixfoot brunette with legs that went to eternity jake the solution trickled through his suffering brain though he relaxed a little he held the gun steady jake put you up to this didnt he some weirdass birthday surprise jakes who sent you i am sent by rhee the sorceress how is it that a harper has such a weapon have you killed many demons look its too early in the morning for dungeons and dragons shows over sister i am not your sister she began as he eased out of bed then her eyebrows shot up he was naked but that neither surprised nor shocked her her instant and elemental attraction did he was taller than she by nearly a full hand broader in the chest and shoulders with fine sleek muscles reevaluating she pursed her lips his hair was the deep brown of oak bark and though unkempt by sleep it created a good frame for a strong face his eyes were the bold blue of the marsh bells his nose slightly crooked which told her it had weathered a break his mouth was firm as was his jaw though his skin was pale like a scholars who closeted himself with scrolls she began to see possibilities you have a fine build for a harper she told him yeah amused now though still cautious he reached for the jeans hed peeled off the night before how much did jake pay you for the gig i know no jake i do not take payment for slaying it is my destiny do you require payment depends how the hell was he going to get into his jeans and hold the gun at the same time the knowledge was given me that these have value in your world she tugged the bag of stones from her belt tossed them on the bed take what you need then dress we must begin the hunt look i appreciate a joke as much as the next guy but im naked and hungover and it irritates me to wake up with a knife to my throat i want coffee a barrel of aspirin and a shower very well if you will not hunt show me how to use your weapon youre a piece of work he gestured toward the bedroom door with the glock out back to central casting or amazons r us or wherever the hell she moved so fast that all he saw was a blur of limbs and leather and flying hair she leaped executed a handspring off the bed and some part of herboot elbow fistconnected with his jaw an entire galaxy of stars exploded in his head by the time they novaed and died he was flat on his back with her standing astride him turning the glock over in her hands it has good weight she said conversationally how is the missile she trailed off when with a twitch of her finger she fired her eyes widened with something like lust when through the open bathroom door she saw the corner of his vanity sheared off it is faster than an arrow she commented very pleased not jake he corrected jake might have a weird sense of the ridiculous but his old college friend wouldnt have sent him a lunatic who liked to play with guns who the hell are you i am kadra she nearly sighed with the repetitionperhaps the harper was loose in the brains with some sympathy she offered a hand to help him up slayer of demons i have come to hunt to fulfill my destiny though it does not please either of us you are obliged to assist give me the gun kadra it is a good weapon yeah its a good weapon it belongs to me her lips moved into a pout then her face brightened again i will fight you for it im at a disadvantage at the moment he got to his feet very slowly kept his voice mild and easy you know naked hungover hung over what maybe we could fight later after we clear up a few points very well i will give you the weapon and you will give me your word that you will help me hunt the bok helping peoples what i do maybe she was in trouble he thought not that he intended to get involved but he could at least listen before he called the guys in the white coats is that why youre here gently he nudged her gun hand aside so he wouldnt end up with a bullet in the belly you need help i am a stranger here and require a guide she reached out squeezed his biceps you are strong but slow with no little regret she returned the glock can you make more of the gun maybe shed threatened him with a knife with a sword shed knocked him on his ass and disarmed him damn if he didnt respect her for it in any case shed made his first morning as a thirtyyearold man interesting he hadnt become a pi because he liked the boring added to that there was something something about her that pulled at him her looks were enough to knock a man flat but it wasnt thator not only that you couldnt find the answers he reminded himself unless you asked the questions im going to put my pants on he told her i want you to step back and keep your hands away from that sword she stepped back i have no wish to harm you or any of your people you have my word as a slayer good to know when she was at a safe distance he tugged on his jeans then snugged the gun in the waistband now im going to make coffee and well talk about all this coffee this is a stimulant consumed in liquid form there you go in the kitchen he added gesturing toward the door she strode out ahead of him whatever shape he might have been in harper thought however baffled he might be a man who didnt admire and appreciate that view was a sorry specimen still he glanced at the front door of his apartment as he passed it was locked bolted chained so shed locked up after shed come in he decided he looked back to see her stop and gape out the living room window like a kid might he mused at her first eyeful of disneyland so high she thought in wonder she had never been in a hut where the ground was so far below and so many people swarmed beneath their costumes were strange to her strange and fascinating but fascination turned to awe when she watched a cab zip to the curb saw the woman leap out she rose out of the belly of the yellow beast how is this done you pay the fare they let you out where the hell are you from i am from adair in my world we have no beasts with round legs i dontwait she closed her eyes searched through the knowledge rhee had given her cars those brilliant eyes opened again smiled into his they are machines called cars and are for transportation that is wonderful try to find one in the rain honey yes i would like honey and bread i am hungry right he shook his head coffee coffee first then all questions can be faced come with me i want you where i can see you she followed him into his tiny galley kitchen while he measured coffee she ran her fingers over the surface of the counter over the refrigerator and stove so much magic she said softly you must have great wealth yeah rolling in it he made a reasonable living harper thought but he was what you could call between active cases at the moment maybe he could hold off on the guys in the white coats see if she needed an investigator and had enough to pay his retainer jake didnt send you did he i do not know this jake she peered at the side of the toaster delighted with her own odd reflection i know no one in this world save you how did you get here to my place through the portal it is she straightened trying to decipher the knowledge then to express it there are many dimensions yours and mine are two the bok stole a key and have entered yours i have another she drew the clear globe out of her pouch so i have followed to hunt to kill so that our worlds will be safe you are to help me in this quest poor kid he thought she was definitely a few fries short of a happy meal you cant just kill people in this world they lock you up for that you have no slayers to fight against evil here he dragged a hand through his hair then rooted out some extrastrength excedrin isnt that what his father had done and what he himself had wanted to do as long as he could remember to go after the bad guys on his own terms yeah i guess we do the woman was definitely in some sort of jam even if it came out of her own oddball imagination he would just keep her calm ask some questions see if he could dig out the problem when hed done what he could he would make a few calls and have her taken someplace where she could get some help it would be the first good deed of his new decade so you come from another dimension and youre here to hunt down some demons the king of demons and three of his warriors have entered your world they will need to feed first they will hunt for animals the easy kill to gather strength where are your farms were a little short on farms on second avenue so what do you do back inwhere was it adair he could run a search on the name on his computer see if he could pinpoint where shed come from she didnt have a discernible accent but the cadence the rhythm of her speech sure as hell didnt say new york what do you do back in adair besides slay demons this is my purpose i was born a slayer trained educated it is what i do friends family i have no family she who raised me was killed by a tribe of bok mother killed he thought trauma role playing im sorry she was a fine warrior clud sire of sorak took her life and i have taken his so there is balance i have learned that she who bore me was another rhee the sorceress her blood is in me i think i am here able to be here because of that blood she sniffed the air this is coffee thats right it has a good scent he poured two mugs offered one she sniffed again sipped then frowned bitter but good to his surprise she downed the entire mug in one swallow then swiped a hand over her mouth i like this coffee dress now harper doyle how do you know my name it was told to me we will hunt the bok together sure well get to that in a little while her eyes narrowed you dont believe you think im loose in the brain you waste my time with too many questions when we should act part of what i do in my little world is ask questions nobodys calling you a liar here why shouldnt i believe youre a demon slayer from an alternate universe im always getting clients from other dimensions she paced up and down the narrow room to work out the logic he was mocking her and this was not proper lesser warriors were not permitted to show a slayer disrespect yet she admired him for it even as she found his demeanor frustrating this was his world kadra reminded herself one of wonders far beyond her ken so her world would be beyond his if she were in his place she would not believe without proof you must be shown i cannot blame you for doubt you would be weak and foolish if you didnt question and the weak and foolish would be of no use to me darling keep up that sweet talk and youll turn my head she didnt have to understand the words to recognize the sarcasm dripping from them a little impatient a little intrigued she held one hand up and the other with the globe in its palm out my blood is of the sorceress and the warrior my blood is the blood of the slayer i hold the power of the key she drew her mind down to the globe drew the power of the globe into her mind harpers kitchen wall dissolved as though it were a painting left out in the rain through it he saw not the apartment next door but a thick green jungle a curving white ribbon and a sky the color of pale blood under a fierce red sun holy shit he managed before he was sucked into it chapter the heat was enormous a drenching dripping wall of steaming water it was a shock even after the jolt of pain the blast of blinding light even so his bones felt frozen under his skin as he stared out at the tangle of towering green new york was gone it seemed and so was he not a hangover he thought but some sort of psychotic event brought on no doubt by too much liquor and too many loose women as he watched dumbfounded a snake with a body as thick as his thigh slithered off into the high damp grass we can stay only a short time kadra told him and her voice was dim tinny lightyears away this is the west jungle of adair near the coast of the great sea this is my world which exists beyond yours and the knowledge says in balance with it ive been drugged this is not so annoyed now she clamped her hands over his arms you can see you can hear and feel my world is as real as yours and as much in peril alternate universe the words felt foolish on his tongue thats pure science fiction is your world so perfect so important that you believe it stands alone in the vastness of time and space harper doyle can you have lived and still believe you are alone my heart she pressed his hand to her breast it beats as yours i am as you are how could he dismiss what he saw with his own eyes what he felt touchedand somehow knew just he thought as he had somehow known her the instant their eyes had met why she nearly smiled why not i recognized you he managed i pushed that aside clicked back into what made sense so i could deny it but i recognized you somehow the minute i saw you yes she kept her hand on his a moment longer it felt right there like a link it was the same for me this is not something i understand but only feel i do not know the meaning and in some secret chamber of her warriors heart she feared the meaning im standing here sweating in a jungle in some twilight zone and it doesnt feel half as strange as it should it doesnt feel half as strange as whats going on inside me about you you begin to believe im beginning to something im going to need a little time to process all the she whirled the sword streaking into her hand like a lightning bolt a creature no more than three feet high with snapping teeth in both its mouths shot out of the brush and leaped for harpers throat despite the shock of it his instincts were quick his hand whipped down for his gun it hadnt cleared the waistband of his jeans before kadras sword sliced through both heads with one massive stroke there was a fountaining gush of vile green liquid that stank like sulfur heads and body thunked a grisly trio onto the ground then began to smoke loki demon kadra said as the three pieces melted away small pests that usually travel in packs of three she lifted her head sniffed to your left you will need your weapon she added and pivoted to her right as another of the creatures jumped through a curtain of vine instinct had his finger on the trigger and if that finger trembled a bit he wasnt ashamed he heard the slice of her sword through air just as the lastplease godof the miniature monsters charged him he shot it between the eyesall four of them christ jesus christ this is good aim giving harper a congratulatory slap on the back she nodded over the smoking heads this is a fine weapon she added sending his glock an avaricious glance when we go back to your world you will provide me with one it lacks the beauty of the sword but it makes an enjoyable noise their bloods green harper said in a careful voice they have two heads and green blood and now how about that theyre just melting away like the wicked witch of the west all demons bleed green though only the loki and the mutant strain of the ploon are twoheaded on death the blood smokes and the body melts is not inaccurate she decided you have witches in the west of your world who die like demons when he only stared at her she shrugged we have witches as well and most of them the powers of life have instilled with good my home is east she continued beyond the stone mountains in the shadowed valley it is beautiful and the fields are rich there is no time to show you this is real he took one long deep breath and swallowed it all at once our time here is short there is a clearing and a village in it rhee lives there we will go since she set off in a punishing jog he had no choice but to follow slow it down wonder woman im barefoot here she tossed a scowl over her shoulder but modified her pace you drank excessive spirits last night i can smell them on you now you are sluggish alert enough to kill a twoheaded demon she let out a snort a child with a training bow could do the same lokis are stupid as they ran down the narrow beaten path a flock of birds flushed out of the trees and into that odd red sky he staggered to a halt each was its own rainbowa bleeding blending meld of pinks and blues and golds and the song they sent up was like the trill of flutes dregos she told him their gift is their song as they are poor eating stringy she slowed to a trot as they came to the clearing he saw houses small and tidy most with colorful gardens in the front people dressed in long thin robes harvested out of them what looked to be massive blue carrots tomatoes the size of melons and long yellow beans spotted with green flecks there were men women children and each stopped work or play and bowed as kadra came into view greetings demon slayer some called out she acknowledged this with what harper supposed was a kind of salute by laying her fist on her heart as she walked those long legs ate up the ground toward a small house with a lush garden and an open front door she had to duck her head to enter inside a young girl stood by what he assumed was a cookstove she stirred an iron pot and looked up at them with quiet blue eyes hail to kadra slayer of demons we come to speak with rhee she sleeps the girl said and continued to stir she suffered a demon bite during the attack she did not say kadra moved quickly shoving open a door within rhee lay pale and still on a bed the emotions that churned in her were mixed and confusing and through them came one clear thought mother will i lose yet another mother before my own end is it the sleep of change no she was not kissed only bitten beneath the shoulder as she tried to guard the keys nor was it a mortal bite though she had pain and there was sickness more than necessary as she did not see to the wound quickly she spent too much time with me not too much only what was needed your mother harper looked through the doorway at the woman on the bed and laid a hand on kadras shoulder can we get her to a doctor i am mav the healer the young girl told him i tend to her i have drained the poison given her the cure she must sleep until her body regains strength she said you would come kadra with the one from the other world you are to eat mav ladled out some of the thick broth from the pot and to wash in the falls in this way you will take some of this place with you into the next you must be gone within the hour do you want to sit with her awhile harper began take some time with her his hand caressed her shoulder a gesture of comfort she had known rarely in her life there is no time kadra turned away from the doorway shes your mother she bore me she set me on this path now i can only follow it she sat down at the table where mav had put the bowls and a round loaf of golden bread there was a squat pitcher of honey and another of water as white and sparkling as snow because he was tired hungry and confused harper sat this is real he thought again as he sampled the first taste of the rich spiced broth it wasnt a dream a hallucination he hadnt just lost his mind kadra tore off a hunk of bread poured honey over it and ate with a concentrated focus that told harper she wasnt concerned with taste only with fuel do you have family she asked mav between bites i have two brothers younger my mother who weaves my father was a healer as well sorak king of demons killed him this morning i was not quick enough grief thickened kadras voice and your mother is a widow he would have killed us all but you came he fears you he has cause i regret that death touched you he came for rhee for the key her powers are not as strong as they were and he made demons from wizards so he might track her she explained to me while i tended her so i might tell you mav folded her hands and spoke as if reciting a story learned by heart the other the world beyond with yellow sun and blue sky is full of so much life and most who live there have closed themselves off from the magic they will not understand they will not believe and so the bok will slaughter them flesh passion innocence and evil sorak craves this and the power he will gain from it the power to destroy you he will die there kadra drank the tankard of springwater quickly this is my vow on your fathers blood she pulled out her dagger sliced a shallow gash across her palm and let her blood drip onto the table and on mine it will comfort my mother to know it but there should be no more bloodshed here mav reached in her pocket took out a white cloth and deftly wrapped it around kadras hand you must wash in the falls for cleansing then go when kadra got to her feet harper sighed and got to his thanks for the food mav blushed cast down her gaze it is little to give the slayer and the savior blessings on you both harper took one last glance at her kid couldnt be more than ten he thought then ducked out the doorway he had to double his pace to catch up with kadra look just slow down a minute im trying to keep up here in more ways than one i dont usually spend my mornings visiting alternate dimensions and killing loco demons loki whatever so far youve jumped me held a knife to my throat threatened me with a sword punched me in the face and sucked me through some wormhole in my kitchen and all this on one lousy cup of coffee this isnt your average first date you do not have the knowledge so you require explanations she moved through the jungle at a brisk pace eyes tracking ears pricked i understand this beautiful then give them to me we will cleanse in the falls return to your world hunt down the bok and kill them he considered himself a reasonable guy a man with an open mind an active sense of adventure and curiosity but enough was enough he grabbed her arm yanked her around to face him thats what you call an explanation listen sister if thats the best you can do this is where we part ways send me back where i come from and well just put this all down to too much beer and fried food i am not your sister he stared at her at the faint irritation that clouded her glorious face helpless he began to laugh it rolled out of him pumping up from the belly so that he had to bend over brace his hands on his thighs as she cocked her head and studied him with a mixture of amusement puzzlement and impatience im losing it he managed losing whats left of my mind even as he sucked in a breath a spider the size of a chihuahua pranced between his feet on stiltlike legs and gibbered at him harper yelped whipping out his gun as he stumbled back but kadra merely booted the enormous insect off the path that species is not poisonous she informed him good great fine it just swallows a man whole kadra shook her head then loped down the path keeping his gun handy harper followed red sun he mused as he looked up at the sky like well krypton if he followed comic book logic didnt that mean that he from a planet with a yellow sun had superpowers here concentrating he took a little jump then another on the third kadra looked back at him her face a study in baffled frustration this is not the time for dancing i wasnt dancing i was just seeing if i could fly he thought amazed at himself nothing nothing at all he heard the roar like a highballing train it grew swelled pounded on his eardrums as he jogged after her she swung around a curve on the path and he looked up in front of them white water plunged from a height of two hundred feet or more it screamed over the cliff dived in a thundering wall then pounded into the surface of a white river flowers some unrecognizable some as simple as daisies teemed along its banks there with the wild grass and wildflowers with the sunlight spilling in rosy streaks through the canopy of trees a unicorn lazily grazed my god the hand still holding the gun fell to his side the mythical beast raised its regal white head and stared at harper out of eyes so blue and clear they might have been glass then it went back to cropping the grass the beauty of it the sheer wonder wiped his temper away now ive seen it all he thought nothing will ever surprise me again he realized the fallacy of that a second later when he glanced back at kadra shed stripped the black leather lay piled on the bank her sword her dagger crossed over it shed pulled off her boots her wrist sheaths and was even now reaching up to lift the circlet from her hair she was harper thought more mythical more wondrous that the whitehorned creature her body was curved and sleek the color of the fresh honey she had poured over the breakfast bread her dark hair arrow straight rained over her shoulders down her back lay tauntingly over one magnificent breast his body tightened his mouth went dry for one blissful moment he lost the power of speech this is a sacred place she began as she laid her circlet on her crossed blades no demon can cross its borders take off your clothing put down your weapon you may take no cloth or metal into the falls so saying she dived it was a picture he knew would remain etched in his mind forever things are looking up he decided and peeling off his jeans he jumped in after her the water was cool sluicing the sweat from his body in one glorious swipe when he surfaced he felt the last nasty dregs of the mornings hangover sink to the bottom of the river in fact he realized as he struck out after kadra and the falls he didnt just feel clearheaded didnt just feel good he felt charged energized she waited for him at the foot of the falls treading the churning water lazily her eyes were impossibly green impossibly brilliant whats in this water he shouted cleansing properties it washes away negative energies ill say she laughed did a quick surface dive that gave him a brief and wonderful flash of her butt then she rose again a vision of black and gold under the pounding spill of the water she climbed nimbly onto a plateau of rock stretched her arms wide to the sides and let the water beat over her he lost his breath and despite the cool relief of the water his blood ran hot he hoisted himself up in front of her laid his hands on her hips her eyes opened again and her eyebrow quirked youre the most magnificent thing ive ever seen in any dimension i have a good build she said easily its made for fighting she bent her right arm flexed her biceps i bet it holds its own in other sports though she couldnt ignore the trip of her own heart or the quick click of response in her belly she only smiled i enjoy sporting when theres time for such things youre very handsome harper doyle and i have a yearning for you that is stronger than any i have known before do you think you could pick one of my two names and stick with it since she didnt seem to object he slid his hands around her thighs then over her silky butt harper is your title no its my name my first name he really had to get a taste of that lush frowning mouth but as he dipped his head she laid a restraining hand on his chest i do not understand are you the harper called doyle im harper doyle and before this turns into a comedy routine doyle is my family name harper is the name my parents gave me when i was born thats how it works in my world im not a harper he added as the light began to dawn im not what like a minstrel jesus im a pi a peeeye what is this investigator private investigator i solve puzzles he decided ah you are a seeker this is better a seeker is more useful on a hunt than a harper now that weve worked that out why dont we go back to me being handsome he drew her closer so that her breastscool wet firmbrushed his chest his mouth was an inch from hers when he went flying he landed clumsily swallowing water on his own curse she was still on the rocks when he came up and swiped the hair out of his eyes she was grinning you made a good splash it is time to go she dived struck out for the bank oh he was handsome she thought as she hoisted herself out very handsome and with a clever look in his eyes that made her want to join her body to his something about him was making pricks on her heart as if trying to find the weakness the point of entry he would be a strong lover she knew and it had been a long time since she had desired one if time and fate allowed they would have each other but first there was the hunt by the time he pulled himself onto the bank put on his jeans she was strapping on her sword he didnt bother to think just went with the moment and tackled her she let out a surprised little grunt and studied his face with some approval i misjudged you do have speed yeah right itll help on the hunt but right now he lowered his head all but tasting that beautiful mouth and once more he went flying but this time it was through the portal the blast of light and sharp shocking pain he landed hard with kadra once more on top on his kitchen floor damn it he banged his head sharply on the base cabinet felt the unmistakable shape of his gun dig into his bare back give me some warning next time a damn signal or something you have your mind too much on sporting she gave his shoulder a pat then levered off him sniffed the air we will have more coffee and plan the hunt okay sheena lets reevaluate he said as he got up i am kadra shut up he slapped the gun down on the kitchen counter while her mouth dropped open you would speak so to a slayer yeah id speak so to anybody who busts uninvited into my house and keeps giving me orders you want my help you want my cooperation then you can just stop telling me what to do and start asking she was silent for a moment she had a ready temper something even her intense training hadnt completely tamed to lose it now she told herself would be gratifying but a sinful waste of time instead she measured harper then nodded with sudden understanding ah youre talking with your manthing this is a common ailment in my world as well this isnt my dick talking or at least hed be damned if hed admit it i want answers the way i see it youre looking to hire me thats fine you want me to help you track down these things thats what i do i find things solve problems thats my job i work my way lets get that part straight you are a seeker and you require payment very well though she thought less of him for it she wouldnt begrudge him his fee come with me she started out turned when she saw him standing firm if you will she added better he muttered and followed her into the bedroom where she scooped up the leather pouch shed tossed on the bed earlier is this enough he caught the bag when she flipped it to him curious he opened it and poured a storm of gems onto the bed holy mother of god i am told these have value here is this so intrigued she stepped over to poke a finger into the pool of diamonds rubies emeralds they are common stones in my world pretty she admitted attractive for adornments will they satisfy your needs satisfy my needs he grumbled yeah theyre pretty satisfactory he could retire move to tahiti and live like a king hell he could buy tahiti and live like a god for one outrageous moment he saw himself living in a white palace by the crystal blue water surrounded by gorgeous scantily clad women eager to do his bidding drinking champagne by the gallons frolicking on white sand beaches with those same womennot clad at all now master of all he surveyed then his conscience kicked in a small annoyance hed never been able to shake on the heels of conscience nipped the lowering admission that the fantasy hed just outlined would bore him brainless in a week he picked a single diamond comforting himself that it was worth more than he would earn in a decade thisll cover it that is all you require put the rest away before i change my mind for lack of a better option he stuffed the stone into his pocket now were going to sit down youre going to explain this whole demon deal to me and ill figure out our first move they are out in your world we have to hunt my world harper agreed my turf i dont go after anything until i know the score he walked to his dresser opened a drawer and pulled out a tshirt normally i dont meet clients at home he said as he pulled the shirt on but well make an exception living room he headed out took a legal pad from a desk drawer then plopped down on the sofa however fantastic the client however strange the case he was going to approach it as he would any other he made a few notes then jerked his chin at a chair when she continued to stand sit down bok demon right is that bok never mind how many they were four sorak demon king and three warriors description she sprawled in a chair all legs and attitude he looked more scholar than warrior now working with his odd scroll and quill though she had never found scholar appealing before this aspect of him was attractive to her as well he has brains as well as muscle she thought intellect as well as brawn description harper repeated what do they look like they are deceptively human in appearance and so often walk among people without detection they are handsome as you are though you have eyes blue as the marsh bell and your hair is cropped short those who are foolish enough to be influenced by such things as beauty are easy victims weve established that youre nobodys victim baby be more specific she huffed they have good height like you but their build is less it is more slender hair and eyes are dark black as a dead moon except in feeding or in attack where they glow red glowing red eyes he noted id say thats a fairly distinguishing mark soraks hair curls she demonstrated by waving a finger and is well groomed he is vain they outfitted like you it took her a moment then she glanced down at her hunting clothes no they wear a kind of armor black again close to the body and over this sorak wears the tunic and cloak of his rank even in new york body armor and tunics should stand out maybe theres something on the news he picked up the remote and flipped on the television kadra leaped up as if hed set her chair on fire even before her feet were planted her sword was out raised high above her head in preparation for a downward thrust hold it hold it hold it he jumped and as he might have done to save a beloved child threw himself between the blade and his tv i dont give a rats ass about what you did to the bathroom sink but put one scratch on my tv and youre going down her heart pounded in her chest and her muscles quivered what is this sorcery its not magic its espn he hissed out a breath then moved in to clamp his hands over hers on the hilt of the sword she tipped her head back so their eyes their mouths lined up its television which is arguably the national religion of my country an entertainment device he said more calmly a kind of communication we have programsah like plays i guess that tell us whats happening in the world even when its happening far away she drew a breath slowly lowered the sword while she stared at the picture box where the machines called cars ran swiftly around a circle how is this done something about airwaves transmissions cameras stuff hell i dont know you turn the thing on pick a channel this is a race you get that yes a contest of speed i have won many races with those legs baby ill just bet you have okay im turning on the news now so we can see if there are any reports on your demons so relax how can you use a thing when you have no knowledge of its workings same way i can use a computer and dont ask i thought you said you knew about this world i was given knowledge but i cannot learn it all at once it embarrassed her not to know so she went back to sprawling in the chair giving the television quick suspicious glances all right well take it in stages just dont attack any more of my household appliances he sat again flipped the channel to the allnews station then picked up his pad back to your demons distinguishing marks you know like two heads for instance feeling foolish she sulked he had nearly slain a spider with the weapon known as gun but she had not made him feel loose in the brain they are bok not loki what makes them stand out how do you recognize them even as she threw up her hands he tapped his pencil and dont say they are bok draw me a picture taking him literally she reared up snatched the pencil and pad in fast surprisingly deft strokes she sketched a figure of a man with long curled hair a strong rawboned face and large dark eyes thats good but its going to be tough to pick him out of the millions of other tall slim darkhaired guys in new york doesnt shout out demon to me how do you recognize themas a species lets say a slayer is born for this but others might do so by their stench they have a scent she struggled for a moment in her attempt to describe it between the ripe and the rot you would not mistake it okay they stink now were getting somewhere anything else teeth two rows long thin sharp claws which they show or conceal at will thick blue curved like talons and when they are wounded their blood is green now we hunt just settle down he said mildly he listened to the news reports with half an ear the usual mayhem and gossip but no frantic bulletins about maneating demons on the loose in new york why are they here he asked her why leave one world for another sorak is greedy and his hunger is great for flesh but also for power there are more of you in this place than on our world and you are unaware they can move among you without fear of the slayer they will feed gluttonously first on animals for quick strength then on humans those that he and his warriors do not consume he will change so he can build a vast army they will overtake the world you know and make it theirs whoa back up change what do you mean by change he will turn selected humans into demons into slaves and warriors and concubines youre telling me he can make people into things like what vampires i do not know this word explain never mind harper pushed himself to his feet to pace for reasons he couldnt explain the idea of having human beings turned into monsters was more disturbing than having them served up as demon meals how do they do it how are people changed the demon kiss mouth against mouth tongue teeth lips a bite to draw blood to mix it then the demon draws in the human essence breathes his own into his prey they are changed and are compelled to hunt to feed they remember nothing of their humanity this is worse than death yeah the thought sickened him yeah its worse no way this son of a bitch is going to turn my town into his personal breeding ground when he faced her his face was set and the warrior gleam in his eye gave kadra her first real hope animals you said cats dogs what these are pets she closed her eyes and searched the knowledge such small prey would not please them this would do only if the hunger was impossible they prefer the flesh of the unicorn above all unicorns dont spend a lot of time grazing in new york horses yes horses cows goats but there are no farms you said in the wild they feed often on the lion or the ape lions tigers and bears the zoo well start there as soon as we figure out how to outfit you so you blend in a little better with the general population frowning she looked down at herself i dont resemble the other females in your world he scanned the breasts barely constrained by black leather the long lean torso the swatch of leather over curvy hips and those endless legs encased in boots not to mention a twoandahalffoot sword i couldnt begin to tell you lets see what i can put together when she came out of his bedroom fifteen minutes later he decided she did more to sell a pair of levis than a milliondollar ad campaign and the old denim shirt had never looked better baby you are a picture she studied herself in his mirror and agreed it is tolerable hunting gear testing it she executed several quick deepknee bends that had harpers blood pressure rising it will do so saying she picked up her sword you cant walk around outside with that thing she glanced up smirked so do i slay demons with bad thoughts aha sarcasm i like it ive got something hold on he went to the closet shoved through it and came out with a long black coat a little warm for may but we cant be picky why do people in your world cover up so much flesh i ask myself that question every day he took another long look at her maybe just maybe if hed been able to design his own ideal woman hed have come close to the reality of her you going to wear the little crown her hand went to the gold on top of her head this is the circle of my rank you want to blend in he lifted the circlet off set it aside put on the coat and lets see scowling she dragged the coat on turned to him youre still going to turn heads and star in a lot of male fantasies tonight but youll do satisfied he pulled on a battered bomber jacket hitched it over his gun i want one he noted her look at his glock yeah i know but i dont have one to spare he slid on sunglasses grabbed his keys lets go why do you cover your eyes styling baby ive got a pair for you in my car he stopped at the elevator pushed the down button try not to talk to anybody if we have to have a conversation let me handle it she started to object but the wall opened a portal where does it lead its an elevator it goes up it goes down a kind of transportation a box she nodded as she stepped in with him that moves her grin spread when she felt the shift this is clever your world is very interesting the doors opened on three and a woman and small boy got on the elevator kadra said politely goes up and goes down the woman slid an arm around the boy and drew him close to her side didnt i tell you to keep quiet harper hissed when they reached the lobby and the woman hustled her son away i spoke with good manners and made no threat to her or her young just stick close he ordered and took her hand firmly in his when they stepped outside he thought it was a good thing he had a grip on her she froze in place her head swiveling right and left what a world this is she breathed blue sky great huts so many people so many scents there she pointed to a sidewalk vendor this is food later he pulled her along the sidewalk my cars in a garage a couple blocks over the ground is made of stone he had to jerk her up when she bent over to tap a fist on the sidewalk concrete men make it and pour it over the ground why is the ground poisonous no its just easier how can it be easier the ground was already there she stopped again mouth agape as an ambulance whizzed by sirens screaming lights flashing is it a war no its transportation for the sick or the wounded she digested this and other wonders on the twoblock hike the shops with their goods locked behind glass the crowds of people in a hurry the clatter and din of the machines that ran on the wide stone road this is a noisy world she commented i like it what are these trees she asked knocking a fist on a telephone pole ill explain later just say nothing harper strolled into the garage with a death grip on kadras hand he flipped a salute to the attendant who was passing the time with a magazine but one look at kadra had the attendant gaping oooh baby that is fine why am i called baby here she demanded as he whipped into the stairway i am not new young its an expression endearment or insult depending on your point of view on the second level he crossed the lines of cars and stopped at his beloved mustang he unlocked it opened the passenger door climb in she sniffed first caught the scent of leather and approved she was already fiddling with dials and jiggling the gearshift when he got behind the wheel dont touch he slapped her hand away she kicked her elbow under his jaw cut it out shoving her arm down he reached for her seat belt you need to strap in its the law of the land when he bent to buckle her up he saw that she was still miffed you sure push my buttons he muttered this is an expression yeah it means i do not need an explanation you are aroused by me and then some he trailed his fingers over her cheek then he opened the glove compartment and tossed a pair of wraparound shades in her lap i guess we have to go kick some demon butt before we deal with our buttons chapter she had a great deal to think about she was primarily a physical creature when she was hungry she ate when she was tired she slept and all of her life her purpose above all others had been to hunt it was a sacred trust a sacred gift she could laugh and weep desire and dislike dream and act but over it all through every cell in her body was the purpose she had been born raised and trained for it but no slayer lived long if she didnt use her brain as well as her might even with the wonder of her first car ride the thrill of seeing the structures and the people hearing the blasts of horns of music of voices her mind still chipped away at the puzzle she had been sent to this place and to this man so their destinies were joined she would protect him and his people with her life he was a seeker and deserved respect but as a slayer she ranked highest save for the sorcerer and if rhee had spoken true she had that in her blood as well the man had no right to usurp her authority he would have to be put in his place for it but he was correct this was his world and his knowledge of it exceeded hers if he was to be her guide then she must follow however much it rankled she desired him which both pleased and irritated her pleased because he was strong and handsome amusing and intelligentand he desired her in turn irritated because she was unused to experiencing a desire this keen without the time and means to act upon it and she was not prepared for what was tangled in and woven through that desire lust was appetite which could be easily sated but this longing fluttering inside her like a wild bird fighting to be free was stronger stranger than any need of the flesh it distracted her and she could not afford to be distracted if the bok escaped her this world and her world were doomed so howd you get into the slayer business she turned her head and even with the dark glasses harper felt the heat of her gaze it was a gift given me at my creation it is woven in my blood in my bone lets put it this way you didnt pop out of the womb with a broadsword in your hand and a little dagger clenched in your teeth i was trained she liked watching the lights turn colors shed processed their purpose herself because she was tired of asking questions to track to hunt in weaponry to fight to build my body my mind my spirit how about your parents i know no father it is the way of slayers all slayers are women we are female birthed by females raised trained and tested what do the guys do the men males hunt farm become warriors scholars seekers like yourself she shrugged whatever path is open to them some in protecting their land their families in battle or in defense of self kill demons but they are not slayers are there more like you back home there were ten now there are nine four weeks past sorak killed one of us a trap he drank the blood of a slayer that is how he had the power the strength to elude me to get this far she was laris she was my friend im sorry harper closed a hand over hers hell pay for it the gesture the simple warmth and connection moved her there is no payment rich enough his death will have to do she looked over quickly when he lifted her hand to his mouth brushed his lips over her knuckles a custom he said reading her shock like an expression comfort affection seduction whatever fits her lips curved in my world you would be thrashed for taking such a liberty with a slayer were in my world now baby and here the sky is different and the ground the customs i enjoy many of the new things in this place the drink called coffee the elevator and the car i have not decided if i like the box called television or all your expressions but i enjoy the sensation of your mouth on my skin he parked the car turned off the ignition you got a man back home a lover no youre going to have one here he climbed out skirted the hood and opened her door well walk for a while he told her and took her hand again stay close she let him lead it gave her the opportunity to observe and absorb to identify scents food came to her againsweet spiced tart her stomach tightened in hunger perhaps traveling through the portal sharpened the appetites she thought if that were true for the bok they would already have fed at least once she caught the scent of animal among the human great cats reptile fowl and more she couldnt identify and then she saw them exotic beasts prowling or dozing in enclosures while people strolled past or stopped to stare it gave her a pang at the most elemental level it is not right to lock them up they are not born for this maybe its not he agreed he hadnt come to the zoo since childhood because it invariably made him sad i cant say i care for it either this is a cruel thing you do here this is a sorry place this zoo is this what you teach your young she demanded gesturing to a little girl being wheeled in a stroller by her parents that one species can be locked away for the amusement of another i dont know how to explain it to you civilization has encroached there isnt as much room as there once was in captivity theyre safe i guess and tended they cant be hunted or taken as trophies they are not free was all she said and turned away okay maybe this was a bad idea its depressing and the place is jammed i wasnt thinking about it being sunday it doesnt seem like the time and place for a demon snack maybe we should try the animal shelterdogs and cats or hit the stables she held up a hand bared her teeth bok was all she said she was on the scent and ran like the wind people scrambled out of her way and those who caught a glimpse of the sword under her coat scrambled faster and farther it was a challenge to keep up with her under normal circumstances but with the obstacle course of people children benches and trash receptacles in the zoo harpers lungs were burning by the time he caught up slow down he snapped you mow down innocent bystanders well get arrested before we get where you want to go and i cant begin to tell you how much fun the cops will have with your demon story there she pointed to a building seconds before a stream of people rushed out screaming she drew her sword as she raced through the doorway whatever harper had expected it hadnt been this this stench of blood and death of fear and rot in the cages monkeys were wild screeching screaming leaping desperately from branch to branch he saw the blood and gore on the floor tracked it with his eyes and foundto his horrora man no a demon feeding savagely on a body a human body when the demon lifted his head his teeth his eyes glistened red it all happened in seconds the shock the disgust the fury all of those vicious sensations burst through him as harper drew his gun and something hideous pounced on his back claws dug into his shoulders gouged as the thing that attacked him let out a predatory howl he spun ramming back into the wall his gun flew out of his hand and slid across the floor cursing he battered the thing against the wall as his own blood spilled hot down his back he felt the rough edge of a tongue slide through it slurp hideously revolted he flew back with his elbow aiming high for the throat hammered down with his heel on the instep of a booted foot hard enough to hear bone snap there was a shriek inhuman harper jabbed behind him with his fingers where he hoped to find eyes now it screamed and the claws released he saw what it was now as he spun around the face of a man the eyes of a monster it came for him and harper sprang into the fight it was limping from the bones hed crushed but it was still fast lightning fast harper whirled and the thing hurtled past him when it turned to charge again he met its face with a flying kick kadra fought her own demons swinging her sword to block the slice of a curved blade evading the swipe of claws as she carefully retreated she gauged harpers position by sound she couldnt risk even a glance behind her out of the corner of her eye she saw sorak behind the bars grinning grinning as he feasted and watched the battle kadra flipped her dagger out of its sheath managed to turn enough to judge harpers distance and position she feinted thrust then leaped to cleave the demons sword arm from his body harper doyle she shouted then heaved him her sword as she snatched the sickle blade from the air to battle the next demon they fought backtoback now harper wielding the sword she slicing with the dagger and blade green blood mixed with red still she saw sorak watched i will have you he called out i will have your blood i will have your body i will have your mind i am kadra she almost sang it as she thrust through slicing claws and pinned the point of the dagger in the demon warriors throat i am your death she spun prepared to leap into the other battle and watched harpers sword cleave his opponents belly through the smoke curling from the demon dead she scooped the glock up on the fly as she rushed to where sorak fed and gloated she saw only the quick flash of his teeth the taunting swirl of his cloak as he bolted toward an open door on the side of the cage she fired the explosions of sound roaring through the building even so she could hear the demons laughter she vaulted over the safety rail closed her hands on the bars of the cage where beasts lay slaughtered and battered at the steel come on riding on adrenaline and pain harper wrenched her around he shot the sword back into her sheath snatched his gun and holstered it put this away now he snapped handing her the dagger were getting out fast theres no possible explanation for what just happened here so were not going to make one move she ran with him through the building out the rear he tugged the coat over her sword wrapped an arm around her shoulders and tried to look as normal as a couple could who had just battled a pack of demons keep it slow cops are already heading in he heard the sirens the shouts they turned away from the noise and kept walking how long had they been inside he wondered it had seemed like hours but now he realized it had been only minutes can you track it harper asked her alone on her world the answer would have been yes but here with the crowds of people the scents and sights so unfamiliar to her senses she was unsure he will go to ground now he knew he knew i would come here sorak has more knowledge than i thought now he has fed he has amused himself he will rest and wait he will not feed again in the daylight just as well the place is going to be crawling with cops since were covered with blood and armed we wouldnt get very far and he had a bad feeling that a lot of the blood was his own he wouldnt be any good to kadra in the next round if he was lightheaded and shocky first things first he thought as he concentrated on staying upright get bandaged up get steady then think well hunt the bastard down and kill him with his belly full it was difficult to turn away from the hunt but she had seen the demon attack him from the rear and knew he was wounded she would not leave him behind he has disguised his scent with the animals and the humans he will take time for me to find his lair she steadied him when he swayed against her and the hand she pressed to his shoulder came away smeared with his blood how bad is your wound i dont know bad enough fucking claws went right through the leather ive only had this jacket five six years she turned her head to look at the gouges and was relieved to see the demon had torn more cloth than flesh it is not so bad it was a good battle she said with sudden cheer you fight well three out of four its just the one now he will make more the horror of that seized harpers belly we have to stop him we will do what must be done now we go back to your hut your wounds must be tended we will rest eat think we will be ready for the night her unerring sense of direction took them back to his car can i sit on the side with the wheel now no you cant sit on the side with the wheel now or ever hurting exhausted he jabbed the key into the lock wrenched open the door are all so selfish with their possessions here a mans car is his castle harper stated and limped around to take the wheel are you hurt he remembered to ask no i am unharmed realizing he might take this as a criticism of his skill she took his hand as he had taken hers but i am a slayer kiss ass she cocked her head the battle had lifted her mood this is another expression he had to laugh had to hiss in pain on a combination of both he started the car yeah baby but its one i wouldnt mind you taking literally chapter though sheer will kept harper conscious he was in considerable pain and woozy from the loss of blood by the time he pulled back into his slot at the garage kadras idea of how to deal with the problem was to carry him he had just enough strength left to stop her from slinging him over her shoulder and just enough wit to realize she could have pulled it off no since his limbs had gone watery on him he warded her off with a scowl im not being carried across the lower east side by a woman this is foolish youre injured i am not yeah yeah keep rubbing it in just give me a hand when she frowned and held one out he shook his head youre a literal creature he slid an arm around her waist let her take some of his weight walk and talk he told her tell me more about this change after the kiss of change the victim falls into a trancea sleep that is not a sleep for one day during the sleep the demon blood mixes with the humans the human becomes what has poisoned him with the demons instincts his habits his appetites since harpers breathing was ragged she tightened her grip and shortened her stride when the human wakes he is demon though some wake before the change is complete and are demidemons in either stage the one who has changed is bound to the one who changed him is there a cure death she said flatly and shifted her grip on him as they stepped outside he was pale she noted and his breath was only more labored it would have been easier to carry him but she understood a warriors pride your hut is only a short journey we will go at your pace just keep talking his shoulder was going numb and that worried him i need to focus why did you become a seeker i like to find things out without a pi license its called nosiness with one its called a profession insurance fraud missing persons some skip tracing i try to stay out of the marital arena its just humiliating for all parties to stand outside a motel room with a camera she didnt know what he was talking about but she liked his voice despite his wounds or perhaps because of them there was grit in it are you a successful seeker i get by he looked around but couldnt quite pinpoint where they were the sounds of traffic the busy music of the city sounded dim she was the only thing clear to him nowthe supporting strength of her arm the firm curves of her body the scent of the sacred waterfall that lingered in her hair it was as if both their worlds had receded and they themselves were all that was left what must you get by hmm he turned his head hed been right he thought there really was nothing but her i mean i do all right i do regular legwork for a lawyer jake the one i thought had hired you hes got a sick sense of humor thats why i love him he staggered at the curb tried to orient himself when she steadied him it is this way she turned the corner glanced up and down the street where is the well you require water doesnt work that way here but she was right about one thing his thirst was vicious he nodded toward a sidewalk vendor there with her arm banded around his waist kadra watched harper exchange several small disks for a bottle he fought the top off drank deep you must pay for water does it have magical properties she took it drank nothing but water she said with some amazement the merchant is a robber i will go back and speak to him no no despite the dizziness harper laughed its just one of the acceptable lunacies of our little world when water comes out of the tap its free sort of when it comes out of a bottle you pay on the spot she pondered this as they came to the intersection shed watched the way the people the cars the lights worked together when the metal tree ordered the waiting group to walk everyone hurried often sliding and swooping between cars that jammed together and faced other metal trees with lights of amber emerald and ruby everyone in the village played along she felt harper sag and pinched his waist ruthlessly to snap him back we have only she flipped back to his earlier term for the section of road one more block okay okay he could feel sweat running a clammy line down his back his vision was going in and out lets talk about me im thirty as of yesterday unmarried came close a couple years ago but i came to my senses had the woman bewitched you no he had to smile at the term you could say that was the problem she didnt bewitch me this is a huge disappointment to my parents who want grandchildren as im an only child im their one shot at it is it not possible in this place to make young without a lifemate can you not select a breeding partner for this purpose yeah you could and a lot of people do i guess im more of a traditionalist in that one area if i have kids i want them to have the package you like kids i am fond of young they have innocence and potential and a special kind of beauty in time i will select a breeding partner so that i may make life it is a great honor to make life im with you on that nearly there he told himself please god were nearly there anyway my parents live in new jersey another world was old jersey destroyed ah no his head was spinning now concentrate he ordered himself just put one foot in front of the other geography and world history lessons later lets stick with personal revelations i didnt want to tie on my dads cops shoes so i veered off into private investigation i apprenticed with a big slick firm uptown but i didnt like the suit and tie brigade went out on my own about five years ago im good at what i do its wasteful to be bad at what you do you know my dad would lap you right up hed like you harper explained breathlessly now he was a good cop retired three years ago hed go for your sense of order he fumbled out his keys as they approached his buildings entrance she wanted to ask him why everything had to be locked like a treasure box but his face was dead white now she dragged him to the elevator puzzled out the buttons they had come down so now they would go up it pleased her enormously when the doors opened four he managed push four if we have to call im going to leave it to you to explain that ive been clawed by a bok demon ignoring him and regretting that she couldnt fully appreciate the ride this time she dragged him out when the doors opened again she took the keys from him selected the proper one and unlocked his door you dont miss a trick do you youd make a damn good pi she merely booted the door closed behind them then bending lifted him onto her shoulder honey his voice slurred this is so sudden she laid him facedown on the bed peeled off his ruined jacket then tore away what was left of his shut his breath hissed through his teeth at the bright burn of pain can you be a little more rough nurse ratched i live for pain quiet now the wounds were deeper than shed thought four ugly grooves and one jagged puncture the blood that had started to clot flowed freely again this must first be cleansed how do i fetch water tap bathroom tap the sink damn it the white bowlah the taller one he added as he got an image of her scooping water out of his toilet turn the handle she found the bathing room and the sink and was delighted when water gushed out she soaked a towel and carried it sopping wet into the bedroom she felt his body shudder when she laid it over his back he fought well she thought again as she cleaned the wounds and was stalwart in his pain he had more than the strength of a warrior he had the heart of one too she remembered how his hand had whipped up and closed around the hilt of the sword shed tossed him a good team she decided shed never found a partner she could admire respect and desire she retrieved her supply bag reached in for the vial of healing powder that all warriors carried her fingers brushed over the cloth mav had wrapped around her hand lips pursed kadra studied her own unmarked palm perhaps some of the healers powers were still in the cloth quickly she made a paste from powder and water this will sting she told him im sorry for it sting was a mild word for the blaze that erupted under his skin when she spread the medication over his wounds his hands fisted in the spread his body jerked in protest only a moment she murmured wrenched by his pain it eats any infection does it chew through flesh while its at it he spit the words out through gritted teeth no but it feels that way it is no shame to scream ill keep that in mind but he swore instead softly steadily viciously and earned more of the slayers respect when the paste began to turn from sickly yellow to white she breathed a sigh of relief the infection was dying over the smeared wounds she lay the thin healing cloth if there is any magic in my blood she whispered let it help him sleep now harper the valiant she brushed her fingers through his hair sleep and heal he dreamed strange colorful dreams battles and blood storms and swords kadra with her war cry echoing through dark dank tunnels the king of demons feasting on flesh in the shadows and he himself delivering the killing blow that sent green blood gushing in dreams he knew her body the feel of those luscious curves under his hand the taste of her skin the sound of her moan he saw her rising over him warrior goddess woman he felt real as life the warm press of her lips on his and woke aching for her he sat up instinctively reaching for the back of his shoulder he found nothing no wound no break in the skin no scar had it all been a dream after all one wild boozeinduced dream starring the most magnificent woman ever created the idea that she was only in his mind depressed him brutally what were a few bok demons between friends he thought as he pushed himself out of bed when you had a kadra in your life was the only woman whod ever stirred him on every level just a product of his imagination of wishful thinking if he could only fall in love in dreams why the hell did he have to wake up back to reality doyle he told himself then took a step toward the bedroom door and nearly tripped over his leather jacket he scooped it up fingers rushing over the battered material nothing nothing in his life had ever delighted him more than seeing those bloodstained rips he tossed it aside and bolted for the door shed changed back into her own clothes and was sitting crosslegged on the floor her nose all but pressed to the television screen where the yankees were taking on the tigers i like this battle she said without turning around the warriors in the white are beating the warriors in the gray by three runs they are better with the clubs girl of my dreams harper said aloud she likes baseball there were other images in the box and each had startled and fascinated but this is my favorite okay that does it we have to get married she turned then smiled at him his color was back and that relieved her his eyes were clear and held more than recovered health the lust in them aroused her you healed well i healed just dandy i hunted among your stores she told him you have little but i like this food and drink she gestured toward the bag of sourcreamandonion potato chips and the bottle of coors youre perfect its just a little scary we must eat fighting requires fuel yeah well eat well order some pizza he looked hungry as well she noted but not for food she rose smoothly her blood was already warm for him im pleased you are well yeah im feeling real healthy just now you can tell me how you managed that later you do not wish to talk at this time she nodded stepped toward him then she circled around him to check his shoulderand to admire his form when she stopped facetoface again her eyes were level with his do you wish to join your body to mine he blinked once slow as an owl is that a trick question you have desire for me charmed perplexed he dipped his hands in his pockets is that all it takes no she was never as sure of herself as a female as she was as a slayer but this time with him she felt sure but i have desire for you as well it is a heat in my belly a burn in my blood i want to join with you i wanted you before i even met you he told her this is like a poem and softened her under the skin you are well named i cannot speak as cleverly so i will say we have time for this and for food before we hunt again and that our minds and bodies will be stronger for appeasing both appetites on those long tantalizing legs she walked past him into the bedroom worlds he thought as he followed her were about to collide whoa wait hold on shed already stripped off her top and was pulling off her boots whats the rush she looked up a crease between her brows are you ready to sport yeah but we could take a minute to he stared at her golden skin naked breasts what am i saying he scooped her off her feet and made her laugh by tossing her on the bed she rolled came up on her haunches saliva pooled in his mouth as she grinned at him you have energy good strip she ordered we will wrestle first you wanna wrestle he unbuttoned his jeans it is stimulating she began then lowered her gaze you seem to be very stimulated already i admire your body baby it pleased her to use one of his terms of affection i want to touch it are you sure youre not a dream brought on by one too many bourbons and bumps i am real watching him she stroked her hands over her breasts cupped them touch me when he came forward reached she rolled away laughing and crooked her finger at him he dived she obviously took her wrestling seriouslyhe was pinned in under five seconds two out of three he said and put himself in the game they tumbled over the bed hands gripping sliding legs scissoring bodies straining he wasnt sure if he pinned her by skill or because shed allowed it he didnt give a damn not when she was sprawled under him her hair spread out her eyes hot and green lets call it a draw he suggested lowering his head her hand shot out wedged between them there can be no mouth on mouth this is not permitted kisses are illegal in your world a kiss is a gift now it was she who was breathless from the press of his body from the knowledge that his lips were nearly upon hers one given in promise between those who mate i had mating in mind no joining joining is sport mating is for life he wanted that mouth as much as he wanted to breathe and he wanted her to give it to him in this world a kiss is a sign of trust affection love friendship all manner of things when a man and a woman join here a kiss is a part of the union a pleasurable part youve never kissed a man ive made no promise to a man with my lips make one to me he thought let me show you the way its done in my world he brushed his lips over her cheek let me have your mouth kadra the hand separating them began to tremble i can take no lifemate she felt his breath on her lips warm seductive it is not permitted for a slayer in my world this is here this is now he closed his hand over the one she still held to his heart let me be the first let me be the only she could have resisted she had the strength and though she could feel it melting she still had the will but his lips were so lovely so soft against her skin the glide of them was like all the promises that could never be given and her own lips yearned his world she thought as she yielded she was in his world now their lips met silkily and her breath rushed out in shock at the sensation the intimacy the sweet flavor the smooth slide of tongue against tongue were more potent than any brew she had ever sipped with one drink she was drunk on him again she demanded and dragged him down by the hair until mouth ravaged mouth he had thought a kiss a simple thing just another part of the mating dance but with her he was whirled into the glory of it he sank deep into her and deeper still until the taste of her was a craving in his belly ive waited for you she thought bowing her body to hisa body that ached for his hands how could i have waited for you when i didnt know you existed how could i have needed you when you were never there but when his hands moved over her she knew it was true all the passion that was in her blood all the passion newly discovered she gave to him she was a fantasy come to life all curves and sleek skin urgent hands and avid mouth she raged beneath him demanding more even as he gave she was a feast who commanded him to feed now when they wrestled their breath was ragged and their skin damp the mouth that had conquered hers rushed everywhere tasted all of her when she crested it was like a wave rising up inside her spilling out on a throaty cry and pouring into him she rose above him as she had in dreams woman warrior lover she took him into her closed around him and throwing her head back rode joined he thought dimly as his blood pounded everything inside him was joined with her he reared up banding his arms around her fusing his mouth to hers as they took each other over the brink chapter no joining had ever been so intense or so pleasurable none had caused her to feel this mysterious sensation that was beyond the physical nor to find herself both conquered and victorious bards spoke of such unions but she had never believed the words were more than romantic delusion and they were joined still she realized wrapped tight fused like two links in one chain this was more than sport she thought she didnt wish it to end she rubbed her lips together experimenting his taste was still therehis flesh yesbut it was more his mouth the intimacy of the kiss that had been like feeding each other she hadnt known such matters could have such heat and yet be tender she had never known tenderness nor had she believed she required it small wonder that in the world she knew a mouth kiss was reserved for lifemates and was part of the sacred vows that stretched for all time if he lived in her world or she in his could there have been a lifetime between them thinking it brought such a pang such a wrench of longing she was a slayer she reminded herself and he a seeker they could walk the same path only until their battle was won then they like their worlds would stand apart but until their time was ended she could have what she could take i like the kissing she said sliding her hands into his hair as she eased back to see his face i would like to do more if theres an opportunity to join again kissing isnt just for joining still lost in her still steeped in the first heady brew of love he brushed his lips across hers what else teach me at the idea of tutoring her his pulse kicked again at times like this after making love making love following his lead she leaned in to rub her lips over his i like this expression sometimes after while a couple is still tuned to each other they kiss to show how much pleasure they were given it might be long and lazy like this he drew her in again on a slow gentle glide that brought a purr of approval to her throat soft so soft deep without demand sweet as a maidens dream yes she sighed again wait sometimes when passions have been roused and people are still caught in that last edge of the storm of them the tone of the kiss reflects that like this he caught her to him close and hard and his mouth was like a fever on hers now she groaned and wrapped around him like rope he felt the thrill of her on his skin in his blood down to the pit of his stomach you make me want her voice was thick now and her heart galloped as if shed raced to the pinnacle of the stone mountains in ways i have never wanted you make me need he held her now just held her in ways ive never needed what are we going to do about this kadra she shook her head what must be done is all that can be done things have changed things are different now if only they could be she thought with him a joy she hadnt known was locked inside her could be free what i feel for you fills me and empties me ive never known this with another still she made herself draw back from him the fate of two worlds is in our hands we cant take each other and lose them well save them and then dont talk of and then she touched her fingers to his lips whatever fate holds for us we have now its a gift to be treasured not to be questioned i want a life with you she smiled but there was sorrow in her eyes some lifetimes have to be lived in a day he wasnt going to accept that he was good at solving puzzles harper thought hed find a way to solve this one he also knew when he was banging against a head as hard as his own there were times for force and times for strategy having a warrior goddess drop on me out of another dimension visiting an alternate reality fighting demons making love its been a pretty full day so far he tangled his fingers in her hair whats next on the schedule strength kadra thought wasnt only a matter of muscle it was a matter of courage they would both be valiant enough to accept destiny we must hunt sorak but we will need food and planning time hes the mightiest of his kind and the most sly okay well order that pizza and fuel up while we figure out our plan of attack nodding and grateful he hadnt pressed where she was now vulnerable she rolled off the bed what is this pizza no pizza on adair he thought score one for earth its ah a kind of pie round usually he said as he allowed himself the pleasure of watching her slip on the brief bottom half of her hunting costume youre magnificent kadra beautiful is too ordinary too simple a word he added when she stared at him do men on adair tell you that you take their breath away that looking at you is like being struck blind by a force of beauty so strong its painful his words made her weak as if shed slain a thousand demons in one day men do not speak so to slayers he rose i do you are different so wonderfully different when i hear the words from you they make me feel proud and shy i have never been shy she added baffled it pleases me that you find me attractive to look at do you think thats all i meant you are very attractive youre right off the charts in that area but then you add the courage the brains the compassion i saw in you when mav told you of her fathers death the active curiosity the sense of fun the heart of a warrior youre unique to any world and im dazzled by you no one has ever her throat burned i need time to find the words to give back to you that are as fine and rich he took her hands lifted them to his lips they were free they dont require any trade or payment like a gift exactly thank you he dressed switched the tv to the news in case there were any updates he started to call in the pizza order then he remembered it wasnt just his taste that had to be satisfied this time okay pizza can come with a variety of options meat vegetablesstuff like onions mushrooms peppers sausage pepperoni its an endless parade i usually get it pretty loaded is there anything you dont eat i dont care for the meat of the grubhog he let out a quick huffing laugh check hold the grubhog he called in the orderexplained to her what a phone wasthen went into the kitchen for a couple of beers itll take about twenty minutes lets figure out what step we take next over a beer i like the beer she told him just one more reason were perfect for each other he tapped his bottle to hers so he dropped down on the couch stretched out you said sorak would have a lair what sort of digs would he look for whats his habit in living arrangements demons live belowground she crossed her feet at the ankles then lowered herself in one smooth move to the floor they like the dark after feeding they will burrow dig tunnels so they may travel under the ground she picked up the portable phone hed set down and began to play with it in the east laris and i once tracked a demon pack to a great lair with many tunnels through the rock and dirt with many chambers for stores and sleep and treasures we slew the pack and destroyed the lair with fire it was cluds palace and there i destroyed the king of demons but sorak then prince was not there when he heard of this he vowed to kill the slayers who had killed his sire and to build a great new kingdom in a place where no slayer could defeat him i have this she flipped back her hair to show him a thin hooked scar at the base of her neck only a demon king can leave his mark on a slayer this is cluds the last swipe of his claws before my sword took his heart impressive harper pulled down his shirt to expose the line of puckered skin on his shoulder skip trace with a bad attitude and a switchblade she nodded how did you kill him it doesnt work that way hereideally i kicked his ass then turned him over to the cops and collected my fee the authorities he explained we put bad guysour demonsin jail in cages like at the zoo today ah she considered that and found it just captivity was a living death is the demon who broke your nose also in his cage sucker punch harper told her running his hand down the uneven line of his nose yeah hes doing a stretch pissant grifter going around snuggling up to rich women then ripping them off copping their jewelry draining their bank accounts prick kadra angled her head i like the way you speak i find it arousing to listen to your stories oh yeah he slid down onto the floor beside her walked his fingers up her boot to her thigh ive got a million of them sporting must wait i like your face i find it arousing to look at your face he touched it just a skim of fingertips over her cheek when i was sleeping i dreamed of making love with you then it happened just the way id dreamed it this is vision maybe he thought of the blood and the battle of the dark and the smoke one thing before we get back on track ive always liked working alone thats why i went out on my own ive liked living alone which is why ive screwed up any potentially serious relationship with a woman i never wanted a partner until you she lifted a hand to his cheek in turn a kind of joining she realized with only a touch i have been alone it is the way of slayers i never wished it otherwise until you they will write songs about you in my world the great warrior from beyond adair and when she listened to them by the fire she thought she would be alone again she let her hand drop away then took a deep drink of her beer i tracked sorak across my world and killed many of his warriors he has sired no young and with his death the power of the bok will be diminished i thought he meant to build a lair in some faroff place a fortress of great defense but in my world i did not know he meant to come to this place to build his kingdom in yours we wont give him the chance you said he would burrow underground yes the bok require the cool dark when they rest ive got an idea where he mightve gone the subway we have a system of tunnels under the city for transportation the sewers are another option harper considered but i dont know why anyone even a demon would want to set up housekeeping in the sewers if he had any other choices the trick will be pinpointing the right sector what creatures of your world travel this subway this underground route the variety is endless just people of all walks its a crowded city its another reasonably efficient and inexpensive way to get around it he spent the next few minutes explaining the idea and basic workings of the subway system this is clever you have an innovative and interesting culture i would like to have more time to study it stick around take all the time you want he rose when his buzzer sounded he went to the intercom by the front door verified the pizza delivery and buzzed the entrance door open you keep a servant in that small box no amused when she came over to peer at it he explained its function then opened his door to the delivery boys knock paid him and sent him on his way was that your servant no i gave my servants this century off he works for the place that makes the food its his job to bring it to people when they call on the phone hungry yes she sniffed it smells very good he set the pizza box on the coffee table ill get some napkinswell need themthen you can see if it tastes as good as it smells when he came back she was sitting on the floor the lid of the box open poking a finger at the crust it is very colorful is this a staple of your peoples diet its a staple of mine he lifted a slice flicked strings of cheese with his finger you just pick it up with your hands and go for it he demonstrated with an enthusiastic bite following suit kadra brought a slice to her lips she bit through pepperoni through pepper through onion into cheese and spicy sauce down to the thin yeasty crust the sound she made harper thought was very like one shed made during sex i like this pie called pizza she stated and bit in again it is good food she added her mouth full baby this is the perfect food it goes well with the beer its like a celebration to have kissing and joining then pizza and beer he knew it was ridiculous but his heart simply melted im crazy about you kadra im a goddamn mental patient this is an expression it means im in love with you i go thirty years without a scratch and in less than a day im fatally wounded dont speak of death even as an expression not before battle she reached out closed her hand tight over his it is bad luck when it is done when it is done harper we will talk more of feelings all right well table itif i have your word that when its done you let me make my pitch baffled she frowned at him over what was left of her first slice like in the battle of baseball not exactly that youll let me tell you the way it could be for us when it is done you will make your pitch now tell me more of the subway hold on he switched his attention to the televised news bulletin the reporter spoke of the attack at the zoo the murder of the guard and the mutilation of several animals witness reports were confused and conflicting ranging from the claim of an attack by a dozen armed men to one by a pack of wild animals they dont know what theyre up against harper said quietly as the newscaster reported that the police were investigating the incident and that the zoo would remain closed until further notice they dont have a clue i call them with the truth im just another loony it is for us kadra told him rhee has said that we would fight this battle together he must be destroyed here or driven back where he belongs there must be balance again here harper rolled his shoulder where a demon had dug its claws we finish it here new york style kadra pondered the images on the television the moving paintings of the zoo this subway does it go near the place where they keep the animals where we battled today there are possibilities sorak would like a lair near prey it will be dark soon she said with a long look at the sky through the window then we hunt chapter she balked at changing her hunting gear for jeans a second time claiming they restricted her he let it pass figuring the long coat would cloak most of her attributes the thing about new york harper thought as they passed a guy with shoulderlength white hair two nose rings and a black leather jumpsuit was there was always someone dressed weirder than you were he wore his ripped jacket for sentimental reasons and for the practical one that if he was going up against a demon again there was no point to sacrificing another garment to the long blue claws he had his glock in a shoulder holster a backup in an ankle holster a combat knife sheathed at his back and a switchblade in his left boot hed have preferred an uzi but what he had on hand would have to do i like my work he told kadra and i like to think it makes a difference to some of the people who come to me with problems he paused to take a good look at his neighborhoodhis cityhis world but this heading out to save the planet stuff brings on a real high you were born for it when he glanced over at her she shrugged this is what i believe we are born for a purpose how we live how we treat others who live with us forms our spirit and determines if we will fulfill that purpose or fail we were meant to face this night together meant for it from the moment we were created i like that and ill take it one step further we were meant for each other too meant to love each other she thought and to live alone in two different worlds her life had been filled with sacrifices but none would bring the sorrow of the one she had yet to make harper led kadra down into the station for the train heading uptown she would have vaulted over the turnstile if he hadnt blocked her you have to use a token then you walk through these are very flimsy barricades she pointed out as she bumped through even a child could get over them yeah well its tradition like a ritual she decided satisfied she heard the roar felt the floor vibrate the earth trembles she was prepared to drag him to safety when he grabbed her hand its just a train coming in still holding her hand he pulled her onto the platform where she studied the other waiting passengers it was a huge cave strongly lit she had never seen so much life so much motion and magic in one place your people have so many colors of skin its beautiful you are blessed to have such richness of person such variety when she glanced back at him she saw he was smiling at her in an odd way what is it nothing he leaned toward her and to her utter shock kissed her mouth we cannot join here she said in a hissing whisper it is a private activity it wasnt that kind of a kiss remember there are all kinds i thought you were pretending is that a polite word for lying on this side of the portal people kiss all the time lovers friends relatives complete strangers she snorted now i will say you are lying locking lips is practically a global pastime and this onell get you people pay a fee to sit in a big darkened room as a group and watch other peoples images on a screena larger version of the tv where you saw baseball one of the things those images often do is kiss i think you are a harper after all because you tell fantastic tales with great ease and skill nothing in those knowledge banks about movies she frowned but tipped her head and searched through when her eyes widened lit with delight he knew shed hit on it movies she tested the word i would like to see one its a date he heard the rumble of the approaching uptown train they had another date to keep first she liked the train that flew under the earth she liked the way people crowded inside bumping together as they clung to metal straps there were colorful drawings to study and read some spoke of magical liquid that gifted the user with shiny sexy hair another advised her to practice safe sex there was a wall map provided for lost travelers and yet another picture that boasted its elixir could transform the skin to make it sexually attractive to others kadra leaned close to harpers ear is sex the religion of your world ah you could say a lot of people worship it why are you whispering no one is speaking is conversation permitted sure its just that most of these people dont know each other theyre strangers so they dont have anything to say kadra considered it and finding it reasonable she tapped the shoulder of the woman standing beside her i am kadra slayer of demons my companion in this dimension is harper doyle together we hunt sorak the sound harper made was somewhere between a laugh and a moan rehearsing he said with what he hoped was a nonthreatening smile new play way way off broadway honey harper said to kadra as the woman edged as far away as the press of bodies would allow maybe you should just talk to me making introductions is courteous yeah well you start chatting about demons it tends to weird people out the train stopped people poured off people poured on kadra scowled and planted her feet as you said how can they defend against sorak if they are unaware of him ive thought about that thought about going to the cops the national guard frustrated he dragged a hand through his hair nobodys going to believe us and the time wed waste trying to convince them were not candidates for a padded cell would only give sorak more of an advantage you said there were demons in this world that you put them in cages there are plenty of them but theyre a different type than youre used to fighting theyre not another species theyre us people come in a variety pack kadra most of them are goodat the core theyre good but a lot of them arent so they prey on their own kind to prey on your own kind is the greatest sin you hunt these demons who else hunts them ideally the law it just doesnt always work out itll take more than a subway ride for me to explain it to you i dont always understand it myself there is good and there is evil the good must always fight the evil as the strong must always protect the weak this is nothing that can change by walking through a portal he linked his hand with hers her vision was so clear he thought and her spirit so pure i love you he murmured i love everything about you the warmth poured into her flooding her belly overflowing her heart you only know one day of me time doesnt mean a damn the train jerked to a halt at the next station well be getting off soon whatever happens tonight i need you to believe what im telling you now i love you my world was incomplete until you came into it i believe what you say it felt strange and right to press her lips to his my heart is joined to yours but what she didnt say what she couldnt bear to say was that her world would be forever incomplete when she left him youre thinking that when this is over we wont be able to be together he put his hand on her cheek now kept his gaze steady on hers that ill have to stay in this world and youll have to go back to yours there is only one thing that should be occupying our minds now that is sorak when we get off this train well worry about sorak right now its you and me you have a very domineering nature i find it strangely appealing same goes when this is over kadra well find a way thats what people do when they love each other they find a way she thought of the globe in her pouch the key that was hers only until the battle was done the weight of it dragged on her heart like a stone and when there is no way to be found then they make one whatever i have to do to make it work ill do but i wont lose you i cant stay in your world harper i am a slayer bound by blood by oath and by honor to protect my people then ill go with you stunned she stared at him you would give up your world the wonders of it for me for mine for us ill do whatever has to be done to have a life with you tears swam into her eyes she would never have shed one for pain but one spilled down her cheek now for love it is not possible it would never be permitted who the hells in charge well have ourselves a sitdown she managed a wobbly smile it would take more than a subway ride to explain it to you there are balances harper that must be carefully held i am here to right a wrong and am given entrance by the power of rhees magic when i have done what ive been sent here to do ill have no choice but to return you will have no choice but to stay well just see about that heres our stop you are angry no this isnt my angry face this is my ificanfightdemonsicansureashellfightthecosmos face he gave her hand a squeeze trust me she trusted no one more if she had been permitted to take a lifemate it would have been harper doyle his strength his honesty his courage had stolen her heart she would miss for the rest of her life his strange humor his bravery his skilled mouth when they had defeated sorak she would go quickly and spare them both the pain of leaving and now she would treasure the time they had left as companions she would relish the great deed they were fated to accomplish together the first order of business harper thought was to get down on the tracks and into the tunnels while avoiding detection by the subway cops he explained the problem to kadra as they moved down the platform away from the bulk of the waiting commuters very well she said and solved the dilemma by jumping down onto the tracks or we could do it that way he grumbled he flashed his id in the direction of a couple of gawking businessmen transit inspectors hoping they subscribed to the new york credo of minding their own business he jumped move fast he took her arm stay out of the light once were into the tunnels our main goal is to avoid being smeared on the tracks by an oncoming train then theres the thirdrail factor see that he pointed whatever you do dont step on that dont touch it itll fry you like a trout he pulled his penlight from his pocket as they followed the track into the tunnel there are some areas in the system where homeless people set up housekeeping if they have a house to keep they cannot be homeless well save the tutorial on societys disenfranchised for later some of the people who manage to live down here are mentally unstable some are just desperate what were looking for i figure are the maintenance areas off the main tracks where theres room to establish a lair there is no scent of people or demon here let me know when that changes he felt the vibration saw the first flicker of light in the dark train lets move he doubled his pace toward the recess of an access door and pulling her up with him he plastered himself to the door think thin he advised he held on as the roar of the train blasted the air gritted his teeth as the air pummeled them through the trains lighted windows faces and bodies of its passengers blurred by it is more exciting to be outside the box as it flies by than to be inside it he looked over at kadra as the last car whizzed past one of these days youll have to tell me what you do for entertainment back in adair i have a feeling ill be riveted he tried to keep a map in his head as they wound through the labyrinth twice more they were forced to leap for a narrow shelter as a train sped past but it was kadra who swung toward a side tunnel here sorak has been this way harper caught no scent in the stale air other than the grease and metal of machines can you tell how long ago some hours past but fresh enough to track she moved carefully knowing the dangers of an underground ruled by a demon she kept her voice low as they began to hunt the bok sees as well in the dark as in the light perhaps better he will fight more fiercely for his lair than he would even for food in other words that skirmish we had this morning was just a preview of coming attractions she thought she was beginning to understand his odd expressions so nodded tonight it is to the death she whirled coat billowing as she laid a hand on the hilt of her sword though he had heard no sound the beam of harpers light picked out a shadow in the dark hed nearly drawn his gun when he recognized the uniform transit cop he said it under his breath to kadra let me handle this hey officer riley and tripp from the post were cleared to do a feature on he broke off as the figure took one shambling step toward him and his stilettolike teeth gleamed in the narrow beam of light the teeth parted row after monstrous row the hands tipped with bluing claws lifted but the eyesthe eyes were still painfully human help me please god help me and with a sound trapped between a sob and a howl he leaped kadras dagger shot through the air and into his throat with an ugly sound of steel piercing flesh the blood that trickled out of the wound was a thin reddish green the change was not complete with this one kadra stated he was still human furious harper dropped to his knees and tried to find a pulse goddamn it he was still a human being he was a fucking cop you killed him without a thought he was neither human nor demon but trapped between i ended his life to save yours is that all there is harpers head whipped around and his gaze burned into hers life or death he asked for help i gave him the only help i could do you think it gives me pleasure with his death one of my people dies that is the balance she crouched pulled his dagger free that is the price we could have gotten him to the hospital a blood transfusion something that is fantasy she shot her dagger home he was dead the instant sorak kissed him she gestured toward the body as it began to smoke infected with demon blood there was nothing to be done for him in your world or in mine if sorak has found one human to change he has changed others she glanced toward the dark maw of tunnel she would rather face it even if her own death waited inside than the hot accusation in his eyes if you are unable to do what must be done go back now i will go on alone he asked for help he was scared i saw the fear now all harper could see was a blackened skeleton and he never had a chance sickened harper got to his feet well finish it together this is the way i smell blood some still fresh she walked deeper into the tunnel chapter they moved in the dark guided by the thin beam of harpers penlight and kadras instincts and they moved in silence she had killed a manand to harper the charred remains they had left behind in the tunnel were still a man she had done so with the same cold efficiency she had used to destroy the hideous little twoheaded monster in adair in the zoo hed found her brutal focus fascinating admirable even sexy but there they had fought beastssavage and hungry and alien despite their form this had been a man how could she be so certain that his lunge forward had been an attack instead of a plea you said it takes time for the transformation harper began in my world she snapped the words out i cant knowno one can knowhow the change happens in yours no demon has ever traveled from my world to yours until now in adair the demon carries his victim off into a lair for twelve hours the human sleeps a changing sleep that is like death only during this period is there any hope of being saved and even that hope is small once the demon wakes it is too late the change is irreversible even if he is not complete he is demon and he feeds if theres a different time frame here maybe theres a different structure to the change he waked he walked he would have fed on you if he had not been stopped the blood was already mixed harper his death was a mercy what was still human inside knew she hadnt known love could be painful she hadnt known that when your heart lay open to another it could be so easily wounded but hers was and the hurt ran down to the bone he had looked at her as if she were the monster she didnt want to speak of it she wished to push it aside and do only what she had come to do but the ache in her heart was a distraction every human death is a death inside me she spoke quietly without looking at him i cannot save them all i would give my life if that would make it otherwise i know that but they both heard the doubt in his voice the pain of it sliced through her made her careless made her vulnerable to what leaped at her out of the dark it was snarling teeth snapping its claws swiped scoring her neck as she whirled to block it was old and female and it was mad it skittered back impossibly fast like a spider into the shadows kadra freed her sword and going by scent and sound struck out it cackled that was the only way to describe the sound it made as it attacked kadra from behind harpers bullet caught it in midair blood gushed that awful hue of mixed red and green as it thudded to the ground arms and legs drumming an old woman harper thought as he stared into the crazed and dying face one of the pitiful who so often slipped through societys fingers and into its bowels she was old enough to be his grandmother you did not kill her kadra crouched beside him you did not end her life and you must not take the weight of it sorak killed her and you ended her torment you slayed the monster the woman was already dead do you get used to it she hesitated nearly lied but when he lifted his head and looked into her eyes she gave him the truth yes you must or how could you pick up your sword day after day but there is regret harper there is sorrow for what is lost the demon has no regret no sorrow no joy or passion no love i think when they feed on us they hope to consume what it is that makes us human our heart our soul but they cannot all they can take and transform is the body the heart and soul live on in another place and that place is locked to them so soraks come here maybe he thinks hell have better luck eating souls in this dimension perhaps the woman was all but ashes when harper looked at kadra again im sorry about before i didnt want to believe it could happen that we could be used this way it was easier to blame you for stopping it than sorak for starting it there will be more and well both stop it he reached out touched a fingertip to the claw marks on her neck youre hurt scratches because i was careless i wont be a second time neither will i not with the battle he thought and not with her he took her hand as they got to their feet lets find this bastard and welcome him to new york harper kept his glock in one hand the knife in the other the tunnel curved and a dim light glowed at the end of it he heard the rumble of a train behind them but ahead there was silence he could see signs of human habitation now broken glass an empty pint bottle that had held cheap whiskey food wrappers an old tennis shoe with the toe ripped out his lair gesturing with her chin kadra slid her sword out of its sheath he is not alone well why dont we join the party he turned the knife in his hand weve brought our host some nice gifts she stripped off the coat flung it aside he will not be pleased to see us the tunnel widened there was more debris from the life that had chosen to spread underground spoiled food battered boxes that might have served as shelter a headless doll and as they drew closer to the light a splatter of blood against the dingy wall the first three came out in a mad rush all claws and teeth harper fired sweeping his aim left to right there was a stench of something not human as one threw the wounded at harper then came in like a missile beneath the body its teeth fixed in his calf as he sliced upward with the knife the teeth continued to grip his leg like a vice even as the thing began to smoke he cursed kicked and felt both cloth and flesh tear as the demidemon struck the tunnel wall he spun clear to see that kadra had already killed the third and a fourth that had tried to use the cover of their attack for one of his own she wasnt even winded that was too easy she commented yeah he limped over gritting his teeth against the burning pain of the bite that was a real breeze he toys with us now she pulled out the healing cloth he insults us bind your wound he knelt quickly tied the cloth around his bleeding leg and just how is sending four advance men with really nasty teeth an insult he knew we would destroy them four not fully changed are childs play yeah grimly he tightened the knot on the cloth im feeling real childlike at the moment he wants us in there wants to watch the battle the smell of blood feeds him almost as much as the taste okay he tested his weight on the injured leg it would have to hold lets go give his majesty a real fivestar meal she drew her dagger checked the balance of both blades then nodded for your world and for mine to the death lets make that soraks death they charged kadra caught a blur of movement above and went into a roll that sent the demon flying over her head she ran him through with one thrust pulled her sword out clean before his body hit the ground using her hips she reared up shot her boots into the next attackers face and was on her feet hacking and whirling she heard gunshots and pivoting saw harper slay two demidemons on his left and set to meet another on his right with his blade she spun clear slicing with her sword and positioned herself so they fought backtoback sorak is close she shouted i smell him yeah sweat dripped into harpers eyes and was ignored so do i he shot a bony bald demidemon who still wore a torn and faded new york mets tshirt as the demon smoked and died at his feet harper scanned the tunnel he couldnt think about who they had been he told himself only what they had become i dont see any more of them still backtoback they circled sorak kadra shouted come and meet your fate as if on cue light flashed into the tunnel through the glare of it three demons charged hes used the portal hes brought more through harper fired and when the glock clicked on empty he used it as a club his leg screamed as he sprang off it to launch himself into a roundhouse kick the demon barely staggered shoving harper so that his wounded leg buckled he skidded over the floor and lost his breath and the gun when the demon landed on him for the second time he felt the bite of claws screaming in rage he plunged the knife into the demons throat snarled like an animal himself when the thick green spewed onto his hands and face when he crawled out covered with blood he saw kadra fighting both of the remaining demons her blades flashed like lightning she blocked the sickle sword that one of them swung at her then plunged her dagger into his belly while she hacked her blade through the second demon next time harper said as he limped toward her i get the twoonone winded she nodded next time the smoking blood hazed the air she peered through it pointed her sword at sorak his claws and face were smeared with the blood of the body that lay at his feet he had fed and fed again she realized and would have the strength of ten still her stance was cocky her voice a sneer you should have brought an army demon king we would have littered this place with your dead i brought better than an army sorak reached back and hefted a small girl by the scruff of her neck she let out a sobbing squeal as her little legs kicked in the air two full feet off the ground leering sorak skimmed his teeth over her throat the young are so sweet to the taste how much for her life kadra lowered her blade though her hand was steady her heart stumbled in her chest will you bargain your life with a human childs is not a king worth more i was not speaking to you kadra slayer of demons sorak lifted his other hand and the gun subway cop harper thought on a jolt of panic sorak had taken the gun from the transit cop and he had been too angry to notice the empty holster on an oath harper shoved kadra aside as sorak fired as she fell blood streaming from her temple the sword clattered to the ground no goddamn it no harper fell to his knees gathering her up checking quickly for a pulse i was born for her death sorak shook the child until she began to wail tell me harper doyle were you born for death she was alive he told himself and slayers healed quickly he would do whatever he could to give her that time and to save an innocent child from death or worse he got to his feet the knife gripped in his hand for yours i was born for yours approach me and sorak ran a blue claw teasingly down the girls round cheek as her wails became the mewling sounds of a trapped animal i tear her to pieces how much for the child harper doyle how much are the young worth in this world her eyes were blue harper noted glassy as a dolls now filled with shock how much do you want you will do your life for her life i would enjoy taking what is the slayers and making it mine throw down your blade or the child dies now and kadra through the stinking smoke harper saw the gleam of jagged teeth do you think your life is worth both of theirs sorak stepped forward and harper could see blood coming from wounds of the claws sliding down the girls white neck i could kill you where you stand with this weapon but it would be unsporting make the bargain or watch while i give her my kiss there was no bargaining with monsters even knowing that harper could see no choice set her down let her go a knife isnt much good against a gun youre smart enough to know that in this world using a kid as a shield is a sign of a coward i thought you were a king i am more than king here i am god carelessly he tossed the girl on the floor then drew out the globe the portal burst open run little human child run quickly or i will take you after all she ran weeping the portal snapped shut behind her and now grinning sorak streaked forward in a move so fast that harper had no chance to evade or defend using the back of his hand sorak struck harper in the face with a blow so vicious that it threw harper back against the wall the knife spurted out of his hand like wet soap with the wall bracing him harper slid to the ground you are mine now a warrior slave in my army in this world i will rule here fry in hell harper choked out as those claws closed over his throat in his mind he called out to kadra to wake to save herself from the horror that was coming soon you will see what it is to be as i am to lose those weaknesses that make you human sorak leaned close his mouth only a fetid breath away from harpers his gleaming teeth bared i will give you the slayer when you wake and we will feed on her together he knew pain agony beyond imagining as that mouth those teeth closed over him the shock of it ripped through his system tore at his sanity as those keen blue claws tore through flesh until he felt his own heart prepare to burst the hand that had been fighting to reach the gun in his boot convulsed dropped limply to the ground he had visions of fire and smoke of blood and brutal death torment and anguish with them came a lethargy that weighed his limbs down like molten lead through the smoke through the pain he heard kadra scream his name his trembling fingers closed over the gun his numb arm moved slowly slowly in exquisite pain to bring it between their bodies without being fully aware of where the muzzle was pointed he fired chapter when kadra came to her vision was smeared with blood and pain her body knew a thousand stings and aches from the battle her ears still rang from it and her first thought as she pushed to her knees was harper the air was clogged with smoke and stink from the blood of a dozen demons and demidemons she remembered the child and her heart jerked burying her pain she picked up her sword gripped it in both hands the sound she heard now slicing through the filthy air was one of greed one of bitter glory whirling she swung the sword high over her head she saw huddled by the dripping wall sorak his regal cape unstained as he gifted the bleeding harper with his evil kiss fear rage horror gushed through her and poured out in a single urgent cry that was harpers name she ran screaming still the point of her blade pointing toward the ceiling where it caught the dim light and glinted like vengeance the gunshot was a small sound a muffled crack like the rap of a fist on wood soraks body jerked and his head lifted with a kind of baffled shock he pressed a hand to his belly where his blood spilled between his slender bluetipped fingers i am king of the bok sorak watched in confusion as his own blood poured i am god here i cannot be destroyed by human means wanna bet with what little strength he had left harper fired again you lose he managed before his head slumped kadra leaped between them as sorak collapsed she whipped her sword down the point at its heart he has killed you harper the warrior has sent you to hell and i have made him mine his grin spread and you kadra slayer of demons must destroy what you love or be destroyed by it i have won he will never be yours that is my vow with all of her strength she rammed the sword home leaving it buried in soraks body and in the stone beneath she dropped to her knees beside harper there was blood his own and soraks on his face the healing cloth around his wounded leg had soaked through his eyes were already going dim but they met kadras now with something like triumph hes done yes the slayers fingers shook as she brushed harpers hair from his face he is finished mission accomplished huh the kid he closed his eyes on a wave of agony a flood of impossible fatigue the kid got back through the portal you traded your life for hers for mine she thought and for mine she couldntve been more than two i couldnt stand there and let him christ he had to gather strength just to breathe your heads bleeding its only a scratch yeah yeah got a few of my own he bore down fought to clear his vision so he could see her better baby im pretty messed up here i will get you to a healer kadra he wanted to take her hand but couldnt lift his arm bastard kissed me it works faster here the change we cant be sure how fast you will not change you will not tears ran down her cheeks unchecked i will take you back through the portal to rhee the sorceress im going under i can feel it he was cold cold to the bone losing he knew the warmth of his own humanity we cant take the chance you know what you have to do no she gripped his face with desperate hands no i dropped the gun get it for me let me do it myself no she pressed his face to her breast and rocked no no no the smell of her flesh brought comfort but under it creeping under it was an ugly alien hunger that horrified him dont let me change if you love me end it let me die human he pressed his lips to her heart i love you let that be the last thing we both remember from this i love you he went limp panic filled her a wild weeping as she shook him slapped him called to him but he was in the changing sleep a kind of living death and could not be reached no you will not take him she leaped up whirled to where sorak had died all that was left was her sword still in the stone and the globe the demon king had stolen she scooped up the globe then with a piercing battle cry wrenched her sword free tears streamed down her stony face as she dropped down beside harper again wrapped her arms around him but when the portal opened and the light burst over them it took them to a world she had never seen the room was white through a wall of glass were trees of crimson and sapphire against a pale gold sky framed by it robed in white stood rhee help him kadra laid harper between them stretched out her arms in pleading save him i cannot you have power so do we all child do not call me child furious primed for battle kadra leaped to her feet some are saved from the changing sleep through sorcery i have heard the tales it is beyond my means to save him you say we share blood but you refuse the one thing i have ever asked of you you sent me to him not i but destiny destiny kadra spat out who weaves a destiny that asks a man to fight what is not his war to risk his life in a battle not his own this he did he fought with me and for me he destroyed the bok king when i failed he laid down his life for a child who was not his own and for this courage for this valor he is repaid by becoming what he fought against who asks such a sacrifice there are no answers to the questions you ask what did he bring to you what was your gift to him love then there is a way courage and strength rhee said as she stepped forward vision and love with these there is a way for you only you to save him how whatever it is i will do a quest a battle tell me and it is done a kiss a kiss a gift of breath of life and love if your love is true if it is pure one to the other the power of that kiss of the love in it will overcome the evil of the demons can it be so simple nothing ever is rhee said with a smile you must be cleansed first i will help you and tell you the rest there is no time her heart lurched as she gestured to harper his fingernails were a pale blue he is already changing time stops here that i can give you he will remain as he is while we prepare there is choice rhee said while kadra bathed there is great risk i am a warrior kadra replied you must be woman and warrior now so i bathe in scented oils wash my hair with jasmine blossoms i have no patience for such matters rituals rhees lips curved as she held out a thick white towel do you not sharpen your sword before battle this is not so different not all warriors are female daughter but all females should be warriors he will need all you are if he is to survive this if i fail may he stay here sleep as he is sleeping now gently rhee touched kadras hair would you wish that for him an eternity of nothing i cannot let him change it was the last thing he asked of me to take his life so he might end it as a man and will you i will not let him die a beast i will not fail him if i use my sword to end it i will never lift it again this rhee thought was what i wished for you beyond valor and might beyond battle cries and quests a love so deep it is a drowning pool these are choices that only you can make there is one more the magic that passed from my blood to yours is strong but more potent is the magic you found in your own heart trust it rhee closed her hands around her daughters arms arms she thought now that had learned to lift a sword and to embrace a man who was her equal give yourself to it without hesitation if you waver if you doubt and still do this thing he may live you may not rhee offered a long white robe wear this strange garb for battling life and death kadra put it on belted it if my love isnt strong enough i die rhee folded her hands because they longed to reach out to touch to soothe yes i gave you to your fate once before and my arms ached from emptiness i watched you in my way as you grew as you became and i was proud but my arms were empty now i give you once more to your fate did you love the man who was my father with everything i am and yet i could not save him i could only watch while he was taken from me he would have been proud as i am of the life we made together in you mother kadra said when rhee turned to the arched opening and she stepped forward let herself be gathered close let herself hold you found kindness rhee murmured and forgiveness they will make you stronger she held tight one moment more just one moment more be strong my daughter it is time she led kadra back into the white room now harper lay on a bed that was draped with thin white curtains a garden of white flowers surrounded it dozens of slender milky tapers added a quiet light he wore a white shirt and trousers his face while deathly pale was unmarked kadra parted the bed curtains his wounds this much i could do his flesh is healed as yours is he is beautiful he is my life she thought i have only known him a day yet he has changed me forever you changed each other and that change will be stronger than the one sorak put inside him you must believe it a sword is not enough kadra glanced over is this my lesson you have always had more than a sword sorak is dead together you have accomplished this great feat and both our worlds are safe for this gift each of you is granted passage into both worlds as you choose how can this be the balance love makes its own balance rhee walked to a table where each of the globes stood on a small pedestal one emerald one ruby the emerald is your stone and its key opens the portal to the world you knew the ruby is his and its key opens to his world i must leave you what you do now is between only you two i will always be with you kadra slayer of demons your fate is again in your own hands rhee held up her arms and vanished this i must do without sword or dagger still she took her circlet from the table placed it on her scented hair but i am what i am and all i am is yours harper doyle she stepped to the bed placed a hand on his cold cheek the words were inside her as if they too had been sleeping i love you with heart with soul with body in all worlds in all times come back to me and bending she laid her lips on his love and life she thought as she breathed both into his mouth life and love strong as a stallion pure as a dove she drew the poison in gave him her breath gift of heart and soul take now from me and from the demon kiss be free pain vibrated through her but she kept her lips warm and gentle on his dizzy she braced a hand beside his head and gave i would die for you she thought i would live for you when his mouth moved under hers when he stirred she slid bonelessly to her knees beside the bed outside the sky deepened gleamed gold and the jeweled trees shimmered harper dreamed of swimming fighting through a black and churning sea that was swallowing him whole he broke through its icy void searching for her battling the greedy waves that sucked him back until he slid into a warm white river floated there and woke speaking her name she lifted her head and felt no shame at the tears as she gripped his hand yes yes yes she pressed his hand to her cheek kissed it then taking his hand she laughed in relief at the healthy color in his skin and nails baby she said relishing the term i am with you he saw only white the gauzy draperies the glow of candles through them the richness of the flowers then he saw her as she rose up beside him and again laid her lips on his if this is hell he said aloud its not so bad you are not dead you live you are unchanged he sat up amazed at the energy running through him the absolute freedom from pain how love was enough works for me where are we what did you do were in yet another dimension rhee the sorceress my mother brought us she healed us and what exorcised the demon that was for me a kiss waked you and brought you back whole like sleeping beauty youre kidding she leaned back you look displeased well jesus its embarrassing he scooped his hair back slid off the bed you would rather die with pride though part of her understood the sentiment perfectly well it still rankled she who had never believed in romance had found the event desperately romantic the kind of moment the bards write of you are ungrateful and stupid stupid maybe ungrateful definitely not but if its all the same to you lets just keep this one portion of the experience completely to ourselves she jerked a shoulder lifted her chin and made him smile you saved my life and you made me a man thank you now she sniffed you are a brave warrior and did not deserve the fate sorak intended for you there you go my egos nearly back to normal now and can i just say you look gorgeous incredible in fact theres an expression in my world about how you look right now it goes something like wow ritual foolishness she replied flipping a hand at the robe i love the way you look i love you kadra she sighed i know if the love between us was not strong and true you would not have waked so i could be annoyed with you she looked away from him deliberately when he came to her when he wrapped his arms tight around her so he kissed her cheek kissed her temple where a bullet had grazed i thought i had lost you and that was worse than thinking id lost myself yielding she turned her lips to his harper doyle kadra slayer of demons she eased back her eyes solemn despite the humor in his do you wish me to be your lifemate and bear your young you bet i do this is what i wish as well this is not a traditional path for a slayer he lifted a hand to skim a finger over her circlet of rank well make new traditions stay with me kadra be with me well stay here wherever this is it doesnt matter this is not our place she stepped back gestured to the two globes the one on the emerald stand opens to my world the ruby to yours i believed that to keep the balance we must each go back must each remain in the world where we came from but i have vision she looked back at him my mother is a sorceress and her blood is my blood i see what i once refused to see i have magic inside me i must practice with this as i once practiced with a sword until i am skilled slayer and sorceress i get a twoforone there can be no balance when love is denied and refused we are meant so we will be choose he told her ill live in any world as long as its with you she picked up the bag that held their things tossed it to him she lifted her sword and crossing to the table she lifted the globe that rested on a ruby stand the bok have lost their king and the slayers who are my sisters will rout them and continue the fight against all demons but there are battles to be fought in your world demons of a different kind to be vanquished i wish to fight with you there partners then he took her hand kissed it we make a hell of a team and i like the pie called pizza and the beer and even more than these the kissing baby we were made for each other he swung her into his arms crushed his lips to hers when the portal opened and the light washed in they leaped into it together and went home the end
