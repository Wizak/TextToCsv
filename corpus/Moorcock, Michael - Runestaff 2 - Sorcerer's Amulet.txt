from conquest by the dark empire of granbretan his archenemy baron meliadus defeated hawkmoon set off west ward again bound for the besieged kamarg where his betrothed yisselda count brasss daughter awaited him with his boon companion oladahn beast man of the bulgar mountains hawkmoon rode from persia toward the cyprian sea and the port of tara bulus where they hoped to find a ship brave enough to bear them back to the kamarg but in the syranian desert they lost their way and came close to dying of thirst and exhaustion before they saw the peace ful ruins of soryandum lying at the foot of a range of green hills on which wild sheep grazed meanwhile in europe the dark empire extended its terrible rule while elsewhere the runestaff pulsed exerting its influence over thousands of miles to in volve the destinies of some several human souls of disparate character and ambitions the high history of the runestaff chapter one soryandum the city was old begrimed by time a place of windworn stones and tumbler masonry its towers tilting and its walls crumbling wild sheep cropped the grass that grew between cracked paving stones brightplumed birds nested among columns of faded mosaic the city had once been splendid and terrible now it was beautiful and tranquil the two travelers came to it in the mellow haze of morning when a melancholy wind blew through the silence of the ancient streets the hooves of the horses were hushed as the travelers led them between towers that were green with age passed by ruins bright with blossoms of orange ocher and purple and this was soryandum deserted by its folk the men and their horses were turned all one color by the dust that caked them making them re semble statues that had come to life they moved slowly looking wonderingly about them at the beauty of the dead city the first man was tall and lean and although weary he moved with the graceful stride of the trained war rior his long fair hair had been bleached near white by the sun and his pale blue eyes had a hint of mad ness in them but the thing most remarkable about his appearance was the dull black jewel sunk into his forehead just above and between the eyes a stigmata he owed to the perverted miracle workings of the sorcererscientists of granbretan his name was dor ian hawkmoon duke von koln driven from his hereditary lands by the conquests of the dark empire which schemed to rule the world dorian hawkmoon who had sworn vengeance against the most powerful nation on his wartormented planet the creature who followed hawkmoon bore a large bone bow and a quiver of arrows on his back he was clad only in a pair of britches and boots of soft floppy leather but the whole of his body in cluding his face was covered in red wiry hair his head came to just below hawkmoons shoulder this was oladahn crossbred offspring of a sorcerer and a mountain giantess from the bulgar mountains oladahn patted sand from his fur and looked per plexed never have i seen a city so fair why is it deserted who could leave such a place hawkmoon as was his habit when puzzled rubbed at the dull black jewel in his forehead perhaps diseasewho knows lets hope that if it was disease none of it lingers on ill speculate later but not now im sure i hear water somewhereand that my first re quirement foods my second sleeps my thirdand thought friend oladahn a very distant fourth in one of the citys plazas they found a wall of blue gray rock that had been carved with flowing figures from the eyes of one stone maiden fell pure spring water that splashed into a hollow fashioned below hawkmoon stooped and drank wiping wet hands over his dusty face he stepped back for oladahn to drink then led the horses forward to slake their thirst hawkmoon reached into one of his saddlebags and took out the cracked and crumpled map that had been given him in hamadan his finger crept across the map until it came to rest on the word soryandum he smiled with relief we are not too far off our original route he said beyond these hills the eu phrates flows and tarabulas lies beyond it by about a weeks journey well rest here for today and to night then continue on our way refreshed we will travel more rapidly oladahn grinned aye and youd explore the city before we leave i fancy he splashed water on his fur then bent to pick up his bow and quiver now to attend to your second requirementfood ill not be gone long i saw a wild ram in the hills tonight well dine off roast mutton he remounted his horse and was away riding for the broken gates of the city while hawkmoon stripped off his clothes and plunged his hands into the cool spring water gasping with a sense of utter luxury as he poured the water over his head and body then he took fresh clothing from the saddlebag pulling on a silk shirt given him by queen frawbra of hamadan and a pair of blue cotton brit ches with flaring bottoms glad to be out of the heav ier leather and iron he had worn for protections sake while crossing the desert in case any of the dark empires men were following them hawkmoon donned a pair of sandals to complete his outfit his only concession to his earlier fears was the sword he buckled about him it was scarcely possible that he could have been followed here and besides the city was so peaceful that he could not believe any kind of danger threat ened hawkmoon went to his horse and unsaddled it then crossed to the shade of a ruined tower to lie with his back against it and await oladahn and the mutton noon came and went and hawkmoon began to wonder what had become of his friend he dozed for another hour before real trepidation began to stir in him and he rose to resaddle his horse it was highly unlikely hawkmoon knew that an archer as skilled as oladahn would take so long in pursuit of one wild sheep yet there seemed to be no possible danger here perhaps oladahn had grown weary and decided to sleep for an hour or two before hauling the carcass back even if that were all that was delaying him hawkmoon decided he might need assistance he mounted his horse and rode through the streets to the crumbling outer wall of the city and to the hills beyond the horse seemed to recover much of its former energy as its hooves touched grass and hawk moon had to shorten the rein riding into the hills at a light canter ahead was a herd of wild sheep led by a large wise looking ram perhaps the one oladahn had mentioned but there was no sign at all of the little beastman oladahn hawkmoon yelled peering about him oladahn but only muffled echoes answered him hawkmoon frowned then urged his horse into a gallop riding up a hill taller than the rest in the hope that from this vantage point he would be able to see his friend wild sheep scattered before him as the horse raced over the springy grass he reached the top of the hill and shielded his eyes from the glare of the sun he stared in every direction but there was no sign of oladahn for some moments he continued to look around him hoping to see some trace of his friend then as he gazed toward the city he saw a movement near the plaza of the spring had his eyes tricked him or had he seen a man entering the shadows of the streets that led off the eastern side of the plaza could oladahn have returned by another route if so why hadnt he answered hawkmoons call hawkmoon had a nagging sense of terror in the back of his mind now but he still could not believe that the city itself offered any menace he spurred his horse back down the hillside and leaped it over a section of ruined wall muffled by the dust the horses hooves thudded through the streets as hawkmoon headed toward the plaza crying oladahns name but again he was an swered only by echoes in the plaza there was no sign of the little mountain man hawkmoon frowned almost certain now that he and oladahn had not after all been alone in the city yet there was no sign of inhabitants he turned his horse toward the streets as he did so his ears caught a faint sound from above he looked upward his eyes searching the sky certain that he recognized the sound at last he saw ita distant black shape in the air overhead then sunlight flashed on metal and the sound became distinct a clanking and whirring of giant bronze wings hawkmoons heart sank the thing descending from the sky was unmistak ably an ornate ornithopter wrought in the shape of a gigantic condor enameled in blue scarlet and green no other nation on earth possessed such vessels it was a flying machine of the dark empire of gran bretan now oladahns disappearance was fully explained the warriors of the dark empire were present in soryandum it was more than likely too that they had recognized oladahn and knew that hawkmoon could not be far away and hawkmoon was the dark empires most hated opponent chapter two huillam daverc hawkmoon made for the shadows of the streets hop ing that he had not been seen by the ornithopter could the granbretanians have followed him all the way across the dessert it was unlikely yet what else explained their presence in this remote place hawkmoon drew his great battle blade from its scabbard and then dismounted in his clothes of thin silk and cotton he felt more than ordinarily vulner able as he ran through the streets seeking cover now the ornithopter flew only a few feet above the tallest towers of soryandum almost certainly searching for hawkmoon the man whom the king emperor huon had sworn must be revenged upon for his betrayal of the dark empire hawkmoon might have slain baron meliadus at the battle of hamadan but without doubt king huon had swiftly dispatched a new emissary upon the task of hunting down the hated hawkmoon the young duke of koln had not expected to jour ney without danger but he had not believed that he would be found so soon he came to a dark building half in ruins whose cool doorway offered shelter he entered the build ing and found himself in a hallway with walls of pale carved stone partly overgrown with soft mosses and blooming lichens a stairway ran up one side of the hall and hawkmoon blade in hand climbed the wind ing mosscarpeted steps for several flights until he found himself in a small room into which sunlight streamed through a gap in the wall where the stones had fallen away flattening himself against the wall and peering around the broken section hawkmoon saw a large part of the city saw the ornithopter wheeling and dipping as its vulturemasked pilot searched the streets there was a tower of faded green granite not too distant it stood roughly in the center of soryandum dominating the city the ornithopter circled this for some time and at first hawkmoon guessed that the pilot believed him to be hidden there but then the flying machine settled on the flat battlementsur rounded roof of the tower from somewhere below other figures emerged to join the pilot these men were evidently of granbretan also they were all clad in heavy armor and cloaks with huge metal masks covering their heads in spite of the heat such was the twisted nature of dark empire men that they could not rid themselves of their masks whatever the circumstances they seemed to have a deeprooted psychological reliance on them the masks were of rust red and murky yellow fashioned to resemble rampant wild boars with fierce jeweled eyes that blazed in the sunlight and great ivory tusks curling from the flaring snouts these then were men of the order of the boar in famous in europe for its savagery there were six of them standing by their leader a tall slender man whose mask was of gold and bronze and much more delicately wroughtalmost to the point of caricatur ing the mask of the order the man leaned on the arms of two of his companionsone squat and bulky the other virtually a giant with naked arms and legs of almost inhuman hairiness was the leader ill or wounded wondered hawkmoon there seemed to be something almost artificial about the way he leaned on his mensomething theatrical hawkmoon thought then that he knew who the boar leader was it was almost certainly the renegade frenchman huillam daverc once a brilliant painter and architect who had joined the cause of granbretan long before they has conquered france an enigma daverc but a dangerous man for all that he affected illness now the boar leader spoke to the vulturemasked pilot who shook his head evidently he had not seen hawkmoon but he pointed toward the spot where hawkmoon had abandoned his horse davercif it was daverclanguidly signed to one of his men who disappeared below to reemerge almost at once with a struggling snarling oladahn relieved hawkmoon watched as two of the boar masked warriors dragged oladahn close to the battle ments at least his friend was alive then the boar leader signed again and the vulture pilot leaned into the cockpit of his flying machine and withdrew a bellshaped megaphone which he handed to the giant on whose arm the leader still rested the giant placed this close to the snout of his masters mask suddenly the quiet air of the city was filled with the bored worldweary voice of the boar leader duke von koln we know that you are present in this city for we have captured your servant in an hour the sun will set if you have not delivered your self to us by that time we must begin to kill the little fellow now hawkmoon knew for certain that it was daverc no other man alive could both look and sound like that hawkmoon saw the giant hand the megaphone back to the pilot and then with the help of his squat companion help his master to the partially ruined battlement so that daverc could lean against it and look down into the streets hawkmoon controlled his fury and studied the distance between his building and the tower by jump ing through the gap in the wall he could reach a series of flat roofs that would take him close to a pile of fallen masonry heaped against one wall of the tower from there he saw that he could easily climb to the battlements but he would be seen as soon as he left his cover it would be possible to take that route only at nightand by nightfall they would have begun torturing oladahn perplexed hawkmoon fingered the black jewel sign of his former slavery to granbretan he knew that if he gave himself up he would be killed instantly or be taken back to granbretan and there killed with terrible slowness for the pleasure of the perverted lords of the dark empire he thought of yisselda to whom he had sworn to return of count brass whom he had sworn to aid in the struggle against granbretan and he thought of oladahn with whom he had sworn friendship after the little beastman had saved his life could he sacrifice his friend could he justify such an action even if logic told him that his own life was of greater worth in the fight against the dark empire hawkmoon knew that logic was of no use here but he knew too that his sacrifice might be useless for there was no guarantee that the boar leader would let oladahn go once hawkmoon had delivered himself up hawkmoon bit his lips gripping his sword tightly then he came to a decision squeezed his body through the gap in the wall clung to the stonework with one hand and waved his bright blade at the tower daverc looked up slowly you must release oladahn before i come to you hawkmoon called for i know that all men of gran bretan are liars you have my word however that if you release oladahn i will deliver myself into your hands liars we may be came the languid voice barely audible but we are not fools how may i trust your word i am a duke of koln said hawkmoon simply we do not lie a light ironic laugh came from within the boar mask you may be naive duke of koln but sir huillam daverc is not however may i suggest a compromise what is that hawkmoon asked warily i would suggest you come halfway toward us so that you are well within the range of our ornithopters flamelance and then i shall release your servant daverc coughed ostentatiously and leaned heavily on the battlement what say you to that hardly a compromise called hawkmoon for then you could kill us both with little effort or danger to yourself my dear duke the kingemperor would much prefer you alive surely you know that my own interest is at stake killing you now would only earn me a baronetcy at mostdelivering you alive for the kingemperors pleasure would almost certainly gain me a princedom have you not heard of me duke dorian i am the ambitious huillam daverc davercs argument was convincing but hawk moon could not forget the frenchmans reputation for deviousness although it was true that he was worth more to daverc alive the renegade might well decide it expedient not to risk his gains and might therefore kill hawkmoon as soon as he came into certain range of the flamelance hawkmoon deliberated for a moment then sighed i will do as you suggest sir huillam he poised himself to leap across the narrow street separating him from the rooftops below then oladahn cried no duke dorian let them kill me my life is worthless hawkmoon acted as if he had not heard his friend and sprang out and down to land on the balls of his feet on the roof the old masonry shuddered at the impact and for a moment hawkmoon thought he would fall as the roof threatened to crack but it held and he began to walk gingerly toward the tower again oladahn called out and began to struggle in the hands of his captors hawkmoon ignored him walking steadily on sword still in one hand but held loosely virtually forgotten now oladahn broke free altogether and darted across the tower pursued by two cursing warriors hawkmoon saw him dash to the far edge pause for a moment and then fling himself over the parapet for a moment hawkmoon stood frozen in horror hardly understanding the nature of his friends sacri fice then he tightened his grip on his sword and raised his head to glare at daverc and his men bending low he made for the edge of the roof as the flame cannon began to turn in his direction there was a great whoosh of heat over his head as they sought his range then he had swung himself over the edge and hung by his hands peering down into the street far below there was a series of stone carvings quite close to him on his left he inched along until he could grasp the nearest they ran down the side of the house at an angle almost to street level but the stone was plainly rotten would the carvings support his weight hawkmoon did not pause he swung himself down on the first carving it began to creak and crumble like a bad tooth quickly hawkmoon dropped to the next and then the next bits of stone clattering down the sides of the building to crash in the distant street then at last hawkmoon was able to leap to the cobbles and land easily in the soft dust that covered them now he began to run not away from the tower but toward it he had nothing in his mind now but vengeance on daverc for driving oladahn to suicide he found the entrance to the tower and entered in time to hear the clatter of metalshod feet as daverc and his warriors descended he chose a spot on the staircase where he would be able to take the granbretanians one at a time daverc was the first to appear stopping suddenly as he saw the glowering hawkmoon then reaching with gaunt leted hand for his long blade you were foolish not to take the chance of escape your friends silly sacrifice gave you said the boar masked mercenary contemptuously now like it or not i suppose we shall have to kill you he began to cough doubling up in apparent agony leaning weakly against the wall he signed limply to the squat man behind himone of those hawkmoon had seen helping daverc across the battlements oh my dear duke dorian i must apologize my infirmity is liable to seize me at the most inconvenient moments ecardowould you the powerfully built ecardo sprang forward grunting and pulling a shorthafted battleaxe from his belt he tugged out his sword with his free hand and chuckled with pleasure thanks master now lets see how the nomask prances he moved like a cat to the attack hawkmoon poised himself ready to meet ecardos first blow then the man sprang with a great feral howl the battleax splashing the air to clang against hawk moons blade then ecardos short sword ripped up ward and hawkmoon already weak from exposure and hunger barely managed to turn his body in time even so the sword slashed through the cotton of his britches and he felt its cold edge against his flesh hawkmoons own blade slid from beneath the ax and crashed down on ecardos grinning boarmask wrenching one tusk loose and badly denting the snout ecardo cursed his sword stabbing again but hawk moon leaned against the mans sword arm trapping it beneath his body and the wall then he let go of his own sword so that it hung by its wrist thong grasped ecardos arm and tried to twist the ax from his hand ecardos armored knee drove into hawkmoons groin but hawkmoon held his position in spite of the pain tugged ecardo down the stairs pushed and let him fall to the floor under his own momentum ecardo hit the paving stones with a thud that shook the whole tower he did not move hawkmoon looked up at daverc well sir are you recovered daverc pushed back his ornate mask to reveal the pale face and pale eyes of an invalid his mouth twisted in a little smile i will do my best he said and when he advanced it was swiftly with the move ments of a man more than ordinarily fit this time hawkmoon took the initiative darting a thrust at his enemy that almost took him by surprise but that he parried with amazing speed his languid tone belied his reflexes hawkmoon realized that daverc was quite as dangerous in his own way as the powerful ecardo he realized too that if ecardo were merely stunned he himself might soon be trapped between two op ponents the swordplay was so swift that the two blades seemed a single blur of metal as both men held their ground with his great mask flung back daverc was smiling with an expression of quiet pleasure in his eyes he looked for all the world like a man en joying a musical performance or some other passive pastime wearied by his journey through the desert need ing food hawkmoon knew that he could not long sus tain the fight in this way desperately he sought an opening in davercs splendid defense once his op ponent stumbled slightly on a broken stair hawk moon thrust swiftly but was parried and had his fore arm nicked into the bargain behind daverc the warriors of the boar waited eagerly with swords ready to finish hawkmoon off once the opportunity was presented to them hawkmoon was tiring rapidly until he was fighting a purely defensive style barely managing to turn the thrusting steel that drove for his eye his throat his heart or his belly he took one step backward then another as he took the second step he heard a groan behind him and knew that ecardos senses were returning now it would not be long before the boars butchered him yet he scarcely cared now that oladahn was dead hawkmoons swordplay became wilder and davercs smile grew broader as he sensed his victory coming closer rather than have ecardo at his back hawkmoon sprang suddenly down the steps without turning around his shoulder bumped against another and he whirled prepared to face the brutish ecardo then his sword almost dropped from his hand in astonishment oladahn the little beastman was in the act of raising a swordthe boar warriors own swordover the stir ring ecardos head ayei live but do not ask me how its a mystery to me and he brought the flat of the blade down on ecardos helmet with a great clang ecardo collapsed again there was no more time for talk hawkmoon barely managed to block davercs next thrust there was a look of astonishment in davercs eyes too as he saw the living oladahn hawkmoon manager to break through the french mans guard piercing his shoulder armor but again daverc swept the blade aside and resumed the attack but now hawkmoon had lost the advantage of his position the savage boar mask grinned at him as warriors poured down the stairs hawkmoon and oladahn backed toward the door hoping to regain the advantage but there was little chance of that for another ten minutes they held their own against the overwhelming odds killing two granbretanians wounding three more but they were wearying rapidly hawkmoon could barely hold his sword his glazed eyes could hardly see his opponents as they closed in like brutes for the kill he heard davercs triumphant take them alive and then he went down beneath a tide of metal chapter three the wraithfolk wrapped in chains so that they could barely breathe hawkmoon and oladahn were borne down innumer able flights of stairs into the depths of the great tower which seemed to stretch as far belowground as it did above at length the boar warriors reached a chamber that had evidently been a storeroom but that now served as an effective dungeon there they were flung face down on the coarse rock they lay there until a booted foot turned them over to blink into the light of a guttering torch held by the squat ecardo whose battered mask seemed to snarl in glee daverc mask still pushed back to ex pose his face stood between ecardo and the huge hairy warrior hawkmoon had seen earlier daverc had a brocade scarf to his lips and he leaned heavily on the giants arm daverc coughed theatrically and smiled down at his prisoners i fear i must leave you soon gentlemen this subterranean air is not good for me however it should do little harm to two such robust young fellows as yourselves you will not have to stay here more than a day i assure you i have sent a request for a larger ornithopter that will be able to bear the two of you back to sicilia where my main force is now encamped you have taken sicilia already hawkmoon asked tonelessly you have conquered the isle aye the dark empire wastes little time i in factdaverc coughed with mock modesty into his scarfam the hero of sicilia it was my leadership that subjugated the island so swiftly but that triumph was no special one for the dark empire has many capable captains like myself we have made many gains in europe these past few monthsand in the east too but the kamarg still stands hawkmoon said that must irritate the kingemperor oh the kamarg cannot last long besieged said daverc airily we are concentrating our particular attention on that little province why it may have fallen already not while count brass lives hawkmoon smiled just so daverc said i heard he was badly wounded and his lieutenant von villach slain in a recent battle hawkmoon could not tell whether daverc was lying he let no emotion show on his face but the news had shocked him was the kamarg ready to fall and if so what would become of yisselda plainly that news disturbs you daverc mur mured but fear not duke for when the kamarg falls it will be in my safekeeping if all goes well i plan to claim the province as my reward for capturing you and these my boon companions he continued indi cating his brutish servants i will elevate to rule the kamarg when i cannot they share all aspects of my lifemy secrets my pleasures it is only fair that they should share my triumph ecardo i will make steward of my estates and i think i shall make peter here a count from within the giants mask came an animal grunt daverc smiled peter has few brains but his strength and his loyalty are without question perhaps ill replace count brass with him hawkmoon stirred angrily in his chains you are a wily beast daverc but i will not let you goad me to an outburst if thats what you desire ill bide my time perhaps ill escape you yet and if i doyou may live in terror for the day when our roles are reversed and you are in my power i fear you are too optimistic duke rest here enjoy the peace for youll know none when you get to granbretan with a mocking bow daverc left his men follow ing the torchlight faded and hawkmoon and ola dahn were left in darkness ah came oladahns voice after a while i find it difficult to take my position seriously after all that has happened today i am still not even sure whether this be dream death or reality what did happen to you oladahn hawkmoon asked how could you survive that great leap i had imagined you dashed to death beneath the tower by rights i should have been oladahn agreed if i had not been arrested by ghosts in midfall ghosts you jest nay these thingslike ghostsappeared from windows in the tower and bore me gently to earth they were the size and shape of men but barely tangible you fell and knocked your head and dreamed this stuff you could be right suddenly oladahn paused but if so i am dreaming still look to your left hawkmoon turned his head gasping in astonish ment at what he saw there quite plainly he could see the figure of a man yet as if through a pool of milk he could see beyond the man and make out the wall behind him a ghost of a classic sort hawkmoon said strange to share a dream faint musical laughter came from the figure stand ing over them you do not dream strangers we are men like you the mass of our bodies is merely altered a little that is all we do not exist in quite the same dimensions as you but we are real enough we are the men of soryandum so you have not deserted your city oladahn said but how did you attain this peculiar state of existence the wraithman laughed again by control of the mind by scientific experiment by a certain mastery of time and space i regret that it would be impossible to describe how we came to this condition for we reached it among other ways by the creation of an entirely new vocabulary and the language i would use would mean nothing to you however be assured of one thingwe are still able to judge human charac ter well enough and recognize you as potential friends and those others as actual enemies enemies of yours how so hawkmoon asked i will explain later the wraithman glided for ward until he was leaning over hawkmoon the young duke of koln felt a strange pressure on his body and then he was lifted up the man might have looked intangible but he seemed far stronger than an ordinary mortal from the shadows two more of the wraithpeople drifted one to pick up oladahn and the other to raise his hand and somehow produce a radiance in the dungeon that was mellow yet ade quate to illuminate the whole place hawkmoon saw that the wraithmen were tall and slender with thin handsome faces and blindseeming eyes hawkmoon had supposed at first that the people of soryandum were able to pass through solid walls but now he saw that they had entered from above for there was a large tunnel about halfway up the wall perhaps in the distant past this tunnel had been some land of chute down which sacks of stores had been rolled now the wraithpeople rose into the air toward the tunnel and entered it drifting up it until light could be seen far aheadthe light of moon and stars where are you taking us hawkmoon whis pered to a safer place where we shall be able to free you of your chains the man who carried him answered when they reached the top of the tunnel and felt the chill of the night air they paused while the one who had no burden went ahead to make sure that there were no granbretanian warriors about he signed to the others to follow and they drifted out into the ruined streets of the silent city until they came to a simple threestoried house that was in better condition than the rest but seemed to have no means of entrance at ground level the wraithfolk bore hawkmoon and oladahn up ward again to the second level and passed through a wide window into the house in a room bare of any ornamentation they came to rest setting the pair down gently what is this place hawkmoon asked still unable to trust his senses this is where we live the wraithman replied there are not many of us though we live for cen turies we are incapable of reproducing ourselves that is what we lost when we became as we are now through the door came other figures several of them female all were of the same beautiful and graceful appearance all had bodies of milky opaque ness none wore clothes the faces and bodies were ageless scarcely human but they radiated such a sense of tranquillity that hawkmoon immediately felt relaxed and secure one of the newcomers had brought with him a small instrument scarcely larger than hawkmoons index finger which he now applied to the several pad locks on the chains one by one the locks sprang open until at last hawkmoon and then oladahn were free hawkmoon sat up rubbing at his aching muscles i thank you he said you have save me from an unpleasant fate we are happy to have been of use replied one of their number slightly shorter than the rest i am rinal once chief councilor of soryandum he came forward smiling and we wonder if it would interest you that you could be of help to us also i would be glad to perform any service in repay ment of what you have done for me hawkmoon said earnestly what is it we too are in great danger from those strange warriors with their grotesque beastmasks rinal told him for they plan to raze soryandum raze it but why this city offers no threat to themand it is too remote to be worth their annex ing not so rinal said for we have listened to their conversations and know that soryandum is of value to them they wish to build a great structure here that will house scores and hundreds of their flying machines the machines can then be sent out to all the surrounding lands to threaten and defeat them i understand hawkmoon murmured it makes sense and that is why daverc the exarchitect was chosen for this particular mission building materials already exist here and could be remodeled to form one of their ornithopter bases and the spot is so remote that few if any would note the activity the dark empire would have surprise on their side right up to the moment they wished to launch an attack they must be stopped they must be if only for our sake rinal con tinued you see we are part of this city perhaps more than you can understand it and we exist as the same thing if the city were destroyed we should perish also but how can we stop them hawkmoon said and how can i be of use you must have the re sources of a sophisticated science at your disposal i have only a swordand even that is in the hands of daverc i told you that we are linked to the city rinal said patiently and that is exactly the case we can not move away from the city long ago we rid our selves of such unsubtle things as machines they were buried under a hillside many miles from soryandum now we have need for one particular machine and we cannot ourselves obtain it you however with your mortal mobility could get it for us willingly said hawkmoon if you give us the exact location of the machine we shall bring it to you best if we left soon before daverc realizes we have escaped i agree that the thing should be accomplished as soon as possible rinal nodded but i have omitted to tell you one thing the machines were placed there by us while we were still able to move short distances away from soryandum to make sure that they were not disturbed we protected them with a beastma chinea dreadful contraption designed to frighten off whoever should discover the store but the metal creature can also killwill kill any not of our race who dares enter the cavern then how may we nullify this beast oladahn asked there is but one way for you rinal said with a sigh you must fight itand destroy it i see hawkmoon smiled so i escape from one predicament to face another scarcely less dangerous rinal raised his hand no we make no demands on you if you feel that your life would be more use ful in the service of some other cause forget us at once and go your way i owe you my life hawkmoon said and my conscience would not be clear if i rode away from soryandum knowing that your city would be de stroyed your race exterminated and the dark empire given the opportunity to wreak even more havoc in the east than it has already noi will do what i can though without weapons it will not be an easy task rinal signed to one of the wraithfolk who drifted from the room to return at length with hawkmoons battered battleblade and oladahns bow arrows and sword we found it an easy matter to recover these smiled rinal and we have another weapon of sorts for you he handed hawkmoon the tiny device they had used earlier to open the padlocks this we re tained when we put most of our other machines in store it is capable of opening any lockall you must do is point at it it will help you gain entrance to the main storeroom where the mechanical beast guards the old machines of soryandum and what is the machine you desire us to find oladahn asked it is a small device about the size of a mans head its colors are those of the rainbow and it shines it looks like crystal but feels like metal it has a base of onyx and from this projects an octagonal object there may be two in the storeroom if you can bring both what does it do hawkmoon inquired that you will see when you return with it if we return with it said oladahn in a tone of philosophical gloom chapter four the mechanical beast having refreshed themselves on food and wine stolen from davercs men by the wraithfolk hawkmoon and oladahn strapped on their weapons and prepared to leave the house with two of the men of soryandum supporting them they were borne gently down to the ground may the runestaff protect you whispered one as the pair made for the city wall for we have heard that you serve it hawkmoon turned to ask him how he had heard this it was the second time he had been told that he served the runestaff yet he had no knowledge that he did but before he could speak the wraithman had vanished frowning hawkmoon led the way from the city deep in the hills several miles from soryandum hawkmoon paused to get his bearings rinal had told him to look for a cairn out of cut granite left there centuries before by rinals ancestors at last he saw it old stone turned to silver by the moonlight now we go north he said and look for the hill from which the granite was cut another half hour and they made out the hill it looked as if at some time a giant sword had sliced its face sheer since that time grass had grown over it again so that the characteristic seemed a natural one hawkmoon and oladahn crossed springy turf to a place where thick shrubs grew against the side of the hill parting these they discerned a narrow opening in the cliffside this was the secret entrance to the ma chine stores of the men of soryandum squeezing through the entrance the two men found themselves in a large cave oladahn lit the brand they had brought for the purpose and the flickering light revealed a great square cavern that had evidently been hewn artificially remembering his instructions hawkmoon crossed to the far wall of the cave and looked for a tiny mark at shoulder height at last he saw ita sign written in unfamiliar characters and beneath it a tiny hole hawkmoon took from his shirt the instrument they had been given and pointed it at the hole he felt a tingling sensation in his hand as he ap plied slight pressure to the instrument the rock before him began to tremble a powerful gust of air made the brand flames stream threatening to blow them out altogether the wall began to glow become transparent and then disappear altogether it will still be there rinald had told them but temporarily removed to another dimension cautiously swords in hand they passed through into a great tunnel that was full of cool green light that came from walls like fused glass ahead of them lay another wall on it glowed a single red spot and it was at this that hawkmoon now pointed the instrument again there was a sudden rush of air this time it nearly blew them over then the wall glowed white turning to a milky blue before vanishing altogether this section of the tunnel was the same milkyblue color but the wall ahead of them was black when it too had faded they entered a tunnel of yellow stone and knew that the main store chamber and its guardian lay ahead of them hawkmoon paused before applying the instrument to the white wall they faced we must be cunning and move swiftly he told oladahn for the creature beyond this wall will be activated the moment it senses our presence he broke off as a muffled sound reached their ears a fantastic clashing and clattering the white wall shuddered as if something on the other side had flung a huge weight against it oladahn looked dubiously at the wall perhaps we should reconsider after all if we wasted our lives uselessly we but hawkmoon was already activating the instru ment and the protecting wall had begun to change color as the strange cold wind struck their faces from behind the wall came an awesome wail of pain and bewilderment the wall turned to pink faded and revealed the machinebeast the walls disappearance seemed to have disturbed it for an instant for it made no move toward them it crouched on metal feet towering over them its multicolored scales halfblinding them the length of its back save for its neck was a mass of knifesharp horns it had a body fashioned somewhat like an apes with short hind legs and long forelegs ending in hands of taloned metal its eyes were multifaceted like a flys glowing with shifting colors and its snout was full of razorsharp metal teeth beyond the mechanical beast they could see great heaps of machinery stacked in orderly rows about the walls the room was vast somewhere in the middle of it on his left hawkmoon saw the two crystalline devices rinal had described silently he pointed to them then made to dash past the monster into the storeroom their movements as they ran stirred the beast from its daze it screamed and lumbered after them exuding a weird metallic smell that was repulsive to hawk moons nostrils from the corner of his eye hawkmoon saw a gi gantic taloned hand clutching at him he swerved aside knocking into a delicate machine that toppled and smashed to the floor scattering bits of glass and broken metal parts the hand plucked at air an inch from his face then grabbed again but hawkmoon had already sidestepped an arrow suddenly struck the beasts snout with a clatter of metal on metal but it did not scratch the yellow and black scales with a roar the beast sought its other enemy saw oladahn and pounced toward him oladahn scampered backward but not fast enough for the creature seized him in its paw and drew him toward its gaping mouth hawkmoon yelled and struck with his sword at the things groin it snorted and flung its prisoner aside oladahn lay supine in a corner by the door either stunned or slain hawkmoon backed away as the creature advanced then he suddenly changed tactics ducked and dashed between the surprised beasts legs as it began to turn hawkmoon dashed back again the metal monster snorted in fury its claws thrash ing about it it leaped into the air and came down with an earsplitting crash rushing across the floor of the gallery at hawkmoon who squeezed down between two machines and using them for cover crept closer to the machines he had come to take now the monster began to wrench machines aside in its insensate search for its enemy hawkmoon came to a stop by a machine with a bellshaped nozzle at the end of this nozzle was a lever the machine seemed to be some kind of weapon without pausing to think hawkmoon pulled the lever a faint noise came from the thing but nothing else seemed to result now the beast was almost upon him again hawkmoon prepared to make a stand deciding that eh would fling his sword at one of the eyes since they seemed to be the creatures most vulnerable feature rinal had told him that the mechanical beast could not be killed in any ordinary sense but if it were blinded he might stand a chance but now as the beast came into the direct line of the machine it staggered and grunted evidently some invisible ray was attacking it possibly interfer ing with its complicated mechanism it staggered and hawkmoon felt triumphant for an instant judging the beast defeated but the creature shook its body and began to advance again with slow painful movements hawkmoon saw that it was slowly regaining its strength he must strike now if he was to have any chance at all he ran toward the beast it turned its head slowly but then hawkmoon had leaped at its squat neck and was climbing up the scales to seat him self on the mechanical beasts shoulders with a growl it raised its arm to tear hawkmoon away desperately hawkmoon leaned forward and with the pommel of his sword struck first at one eye and then at the other with a sharp splintering sound both eyes were dashed to fragments the beast screamed its paws going not to hawk moon but to its injured eyes giving the young duke time to leap from the creatures back and dash for the two boxes he sought he pulled a sack from where it was looped over his belt and dropped the two boxes into it the mechanical monster was flailing around metal buckled and snapped wherever it struck blind it might now be but it had lost none of its strength skipping around the screaming beast hawkmoon ran to where oladahn lay bundled the little man over his shoulder and ran for the exit behind him the metal beast had caught the sound of his footsteps and had begun to turn in pursuit hawkmoon increased his pace his heart seeming about to burst from his ribcage with the effort down the corridors he raced one after the other until he reached the cave and the narrow opening that led to the outside world the metal monster would not be able to follow him through such a tiny crack as soon as he squeezed through the opening and felt the night air in his lungs he relaxed and studied oladahns face the little beastman was breathing well enough and there seemed to be nothing broken only a livid bruise on his head seemed serious ex plaining why he was unconscious even as he in spected oladahns body for worse injuries the beast mans eyes began to flutter open a faint sound came from his lips oladahn are you all right hawkmoon asked anxiously ughmy heads on fire oladahn grunted where are we safe now try to rise dawn is almost here and we must get back to soryandum before morning or davercs men will see us painfully oladahn pulled himself to his feet from within the cave came a wild howling and thundering as the mechanical beast sought to reach them safe oladahn said pointing to the hillside behind hawkmoon possiblybut for how long hawkmoon turned a great fissure had appeared in the cliff face as the mechanical beast strove to free itself and follow its enemies all the more need for speed said hawkmoon picking up his bundle and beginning to run back in the direction of soryandum they had not gone half a mile before they heard an enormous crash behind them looking back they saw the face of the hill split open and the metal beast emerge its howling echoing through the hills threat ening to reach all the way to soryandum the beast is blind hawkmoon explained so it may not follow us at once perhaps if we can reach the city we will be safe from it they increased their pace and were soon on the outskirts of soryandum not much later as dawn came they were creeping through the streets seeking the house of the wraith folk chapter five the machine rinal and two others met them by the house and hastily bore them up to the entrance window as the sun rose and light fell through the windows making the wraithfolk look even less tangible than before rinal eagerly took the boxes from hawk moons sack they are as i remember he murmured his strange body drifting into the light so that he might look at the objects better his ghostly hand stroked the octagon set in its onyx base now we need have no fear of the masked strangers we can escape from them whenever we please but i thought there was no way for you to leave the city oladahn said that is truebut with these machines we can take the whole city with us if we are lucky hawkmoon was about to question rinal further when he heard a commotion in the street outside and sidled to the window to peer cautiously down there he saw daverc his two brutish lieutenants and about twenty warriors one of the warriors was pointing up at the window we must have been seen hawkmoon gasped we must all leave we cannot fight so many rinal frowned we cannot leave either but if we use our machine it will leave you at davercs mercy i am in a dilemma use the machine then hawkmoon said and let us worry about daverc we cannot let you die for our sakes not after all you have done use the machine but rinal still hesitated hawkmoon heard another sound outside and glanced cautiously through the window theyve brought up ladders theyre about to enter use the machine rinal another of the wraithfolk a woman said softly use the machine rinal if what we heard was true then it is unlikely that our friend will come to much harm at davercs handsnot at this moment any way what do you mean hawkmoon asked how do you know this we have a friend not of our people the woman told him who sometimes visits us bringing us news of the outside world he too serves the runestaff is he a warrior in armor of jet and gold hawk moon interrupted aye he told us you duke dorian oladahn cried pointing to the window the first of the boar warriors had reached the window hawkmoon whipped his sword from the scabbard leaped forward and drove the blade into the throat of the warrior just below his gorget the man went back ward and down with a gurgling scream hawkmoon seized the ladder trying to twist it aside but it was firmly held below another warrior came level with the window and oladahn swung at his head knock ing him sideways but the man clung on hawkmoon relinquished his hold on the ladder and hacked at the mans gauntleted fingers with a yell he let go and crashed to the ground the machine hawkmoon called desperately use it rinal we cannot hold them for long from behind him there came a musical thrumming sound and hawkmoon felt slightly dizzy as his sword met that of the next attacker then everything began to vibrate rapidly and the walls of the house turned bright red outside in the street the boar warriors were yellingnot in surprise but in outright fear hawkmoon could not under stand why the sight terrified them so much he could see now that the whole city had turned the same vibrating scarlet and seemed to be shaking itself to pieces to harmony with the thrumming of the machine then abruptly sound and city vanished and hawkmoon was falling gently earthward he heard the voice of rinal faint and disappearing say we have left you the twin of this machine it is our gift to aid you against your enemies it has the ability to shift whole areas of the earth into a slightly different dimension of spacetime our enemies will not have soryandum now then hawkmoon landed on rocky ground ola dahn close by and saw that there was not a trace of the city instead there was pitted ground that looked as if it had recently been plowed some distance away were the troops of gran bretan daverc among them and hawkmoon could see now why they had screamed in terror the machine beast had come at last to the city and was attacking the boar warriors everywhere were the battered and bleeding corpses of granbretanians urged on by daverc who had his own sword drawn and was joining them in the battle the granbretanians were trying to destroy the monster its metal spines shook in fury its metal teeth clashed in its head and its metal talons ripped and rended armor and flesh the beast will take care of them hawkmoon said lookour horses about three hundred yards away stood the two bewildered steeds hawkmoon and oladahn ran for them and were soon mounted riding away from the site of soryandum and the carnage that the mechanical beast was making of davercs boars now with the strange gift of the wraithfolk wrapped carefully and placed in hawkmoons saddle bag the two adventurers continued their journey to the coast the coarse turf was easier on the horses hooves and they made rapid progress over the hills until they came at last to the wide valley where the euphrates flowed by the banks of the broad river they made their camp and debated how best to cross for the water was fastflowing at this stretch and according to hawkmoons map they would have to journey sev eral miles south before they came to a likely fording place hawkmoon stared across the water as the setting sun stained it the color of blood a long almost silent sigh escaped him and oladahn looked up curiously from where he was laying the fire what troubles you duke dorian one would have thought you in good spirits after our escape it is the future that troubles me oladahn if daverc was right and count brass lies wounded with von villach dead and the kamarg under power ful siege then i fear we shall return to find nothing but the ashes and mud baron meliadus once promised he would make of the kamarg let us wait until we get there oladahn said with attempted cheerfulness for it is likely that daverc only sought to make you gloomy almost certainly your kamarg still stands from all you have told me of the great defenses and the mighty valor of the province i do not doubt that they still hold against the dark empire you will see but will i hawkmoons gaze dropped to the darkening ground will i oladahn daverc was almost certainly right when he spoke of granbretans other conquests if sicilia is theirs then so must be parts of italia and espanyia dont you see what that means outside of the bulgar mountains my geography is weak oladahn said embarrassedly it means that all routes to the kamargby both land and seaare blocked by the dark empires hordes even if we reach the sea and find a ship what chance will we have of passing unharmed through the sicilian channel the waters there must be thick with dark empire ships but do we have to travel that way what about the route you used to reach the east hawkmoon frowned much of that territory i flew across and it would take twice the time to go back that way also granbretan has already made extra gains there but the territories under their control could be circumnavigated oladahn said at least on land we should stand some chance while on sea from what you say no chance at all aye said hawkmoon thoughtfully but it would mean crossing turkiaa journey of several weeks but then perhaps we could use the black sea which i hear is fairly free of dark empire ships still he consulted the map ayethe black sea across to romaniabut then it would become increasingly dan gerous as we neared france for the dark empires forces are everywhere thereabouts still you are right we would have a better chance by that route might even slay a couple of granbretanians and use their masks as disguises one disadvantage that they have is that their faces cannot be recognized as those of friend or foe if it were not for the secret languages of the various orders we could travel safely enough if tricked out in beast masks and armor then we change our route oladahn said yes we go north in the morning for a number of long days they followed the eu phrates north crossing the borders between syria and turkia and coming at length to the quiet white town of birachek where the euphrates became the firat river in birachek a wary innkeeper suspecting them as servants of the dark empire told them at first that there were no rooms but then hawkmoon pointed to the black jewel in his forehead and said my name dorian last duke of koln sworn enemy of gran bretan and the innkeeper even in this remote town had heard of him and let them in later that night they sat in the public room of the inn drinking sweet wine and talking to the members of a trading caravan that had arrived in birachek shortly before them the traders were swarthy men with blueblack hair and beards that gleamed with oil they were dressed in leather shirts and brightly colored divided kilts of wool over these clothes they wore woven cloaks also of wool in geometric designs of purple red and yellow these cloaks they told the travelers showed that they were the men of yenahan merchant of ankara at their waists were curved sabers with richly decorated hilts and engraved blades worn un scabbarded these traders were as used to fighting as they were to bartering their leader saleem hawknosed and with piercing blue eyes leaned forward over the table to speak slowly to the duke of koln and oladahn you have heard that emissaries of the dark em pire pay court to the calif of istanbul and pay that thriftless monarch to let them station a large force of bullmasked warriors within the city walls hawkmoon shook his head i have little news of the world but i believe you it is the way of gran bretan to take with gold rather than take with force only if gold is no longer of use will they produce their weapons and armies saleem nodded as i thought you would not then think turkia safe from the western wolves not any part of the world even amarehk is safe from their ambition they dream of conquering lands that might not even exist save in fables they plan to take asiacommunista though they must find it first arabia and the east are mere camping grounds for their armies but could they have such power saleem asked astonished they have the power hawkmoon said with con fidence they have a madness too which makes them savage cunningand inventive i have seen lon dra capital of granbretan and its vast architecture is that of brilliant nightmares made solid i have seen the kingemperor himself in his throne globe of milky fluida wizened immortal with the golden voice of a youth i have seen the laboratories of the sorcerer scientistsinnumerable caverns of bizarre machines many whose functions have yet to be rediscovered by the granbretanians themselves and i have talked with their nobles learned of their ambitions know them to be more insane than anything you or any other normal man could imagine they are without humanity have little feeling for each other and none at all for those they regard as lower speciesthat is all those not of granbretan they crucify men wo men children and animals to decorate and mark the roads to and from their conquests saleem leaned back with a wave of his hand ah come now duke dorian you exaggerate hawkmoon said forcefully glaring into saleems eyes i tell you this trader of turkiai cannot ex aggerate the evil of granbretan saleem frowned then and shuddered ii believe you he said but i wish that i could not for how can the little nation of turkia withstand such might and cruelty hawkmoon sighed i can offer no solution i would say that you should band together do not let them weaken you with gold and gradual encroachment in your landsbut i would waste my rhetoric if i tried for men are greedy and will not see the truth for the gleam of coin resist them i would say with honor and honest courage with wisdom and with idealism yet those who resist them are vanquished and tor tured see their wives raped and torn apart before their eyes their children become playthings of warriors and heaped on fires lit to burn whole cities but if you do not resist if you escape death in battle then the same could still happen to you or you and yours become cringing things less than human willing to perform any indignity any act of evil to save your skins i spoke of honestyand honesty forbids me to encour age you with brave talk of noble battle and warriors deaths i seek to destroy themi am their declared en emybut i have great allies and considerable luck and even i feel that i cannot forever escape their ven geance though i have done so several times i can only advise those who would save something to resist the minions of king huonuse cunning use cunning my friend it is the only weapon we have against the dark empire pretend to serve them you mean saleem said thoughtfully i did so i am alive now and comparatively free i will remember your words westerner remember them all hawkmoon warned him for the hardest compromise to make is when you decide to appear to compromise often the deception becomes the reality long before you realize it saleem fingered his beard i understand you he glanced about the room the flickering shadows of the torches seemed to take on a sudden menace how long i wonder will it be so much of europe is already theirs have you heard anything of the province called the kamarg asked hawkmoon the kamarg a land of horned werebeasts is it not and halfhuman monsters with mighty powers who have somehow managed to stand against the dark empire they are led by a metal giant the brass count hawkmoon smiled you have heard much that is legend count brass is flesh and blood and there are few monsters in the kamarg the only horned beasts are the bulls of the marshlands and the horses too and have they still resisted the dark empire heard you of how count brass fares or his lieutenant von villachor count brasss daughter yisselda i heard count brass dead and his lieutenant too but of a girl i heard nothingand as far as i know the kamarg still stands hawkmoon rubbed at the black jewel your infor mation is not certain enough i cannot believe that if count brass is dead the kamarg still stands if count brass goes down so does the province well i speak only of rumors surrounding other rumors saleem said we traders are sure of local gossip but most of what we hear of the west is vague and obscure you come from the kamarg do you not it is my adopted home hawkmoon agreed if it still exists oladahn put his hand on hawkmoons shoulder do not be depressed duke dorian you said your self that trader saleems information is barely cred ible wait until we are nearer our goal before you lose hope hawkmoon made an effort to rid himself of the mood calling for more wine and plates of broiled pieces of mutton and hot unleavened bread and al though he was able to appear more cheerful his mind was not at rest for fear that all those he loved were in deed dead and the wild beauty of the kamarg marsh lands now turned to a burning waste chapter six mad gods ship traveling with saleem and his traders to ankara and thence to the port of zonguldak on the black sea hawkmoon and oladahn were able with the help of papers supplied by saleems master to get passage on board the smiling girl the only ship ready to take them with it to simferopol on the coast of a land called crimia smiling girl was not a pretty vessel and neither did she seem happy captain and crew were filthy and the decks below stank of a thousand different kinds of rot yet they were forced to pay heavily for the privilege of passage on the tub and their quarters were little less noxious than the bilges over which they were positioned captain mouso with his long greasy mustachios and shifty eyes did not inspire their confidence and neither did the bottle of strong wine that seemed permanently in the mates hairy paw philosophically hawkmoon decided that at least the ship would hardly be worth a pirates attention and for the same reason a dark empire ships atten tionand went aboard with oladahn shortly before she sailed smiling girl lumbered away from the quayside on the earlymorning ride as her patched sails caught the wind every timber in her groaned and creaked she turned sluggishly north northeast under a darken ing sky that was full of rain the morning was cool and gray with a peculiar muted quality to it that dampened sounds and made seeing an effort huddled in his cloak hawkmoon stood in the focsle and watched as zonguldak disappeared behind them rain had begun to fall in heavy drops by the time the port was out of sight and oladahn came up from below to move along the heaving deck toward hawk moon ive cleaned up our quarters as best i can duke dorian though well not be free of the smell from the rest of the shipand theres little id guess that would scare away such fat rats as i saw well bear it hawkmoon said stoically weve borne worse and the voyage is only for two days he glanced at the mate who was reeling out of the wheel house though id be happier if i thought the ships officers and crew were a trifle more capable he smiled if the mate drinks any more and the captain lies snoring much longer we may find ourselves with a command rather than go below the two men stood together in the rain looking to the north and wondering what might befall them on their long journey to the ka marg the miserable ship sailed on through the miserable day tossed on the rough sea blown by a treacherous wind that ever threatened to become a storm but al ways stopped just short the captain stumbled onto the bridge from time to time to shout at his men to curse them and beat them into the rigging to reef that sail or loose another to hawkmoon and oladahn captain mousos orders seemed entirely arbitrary toward evening hawkmoon went to join the cap tain on the bridge mouso looked up at him with a shifty expression good evening sir he said sniffing and wiping his long nose with his sleeve i hope the voyages to your satisfaction reasonably thank you what time have we made good or bad good enough sir replied the skipper turning so that he did not have to look at hawkmoon directly good enough shall i have the galley prepare you some supper hawkmoon nodded aye the mate appeared from below the bridge singing softly to himself and evidently blind drunk now a sudden squall hit the ship side on and the ship wallowed over alarmingly hawkmoon clung to the rail feeling that at any moment it would crumble away in his hand captain mouso seemed oblivious of any danger and the mate was flat on his face bottle falling from his hand as his body slid nearer and nearer to the side better help him hawkmoon said captain mouso laughed hes all righthes got a drunkards luck but now the mates body was against the starboard rail his head and one shoulder already through hawkmoon leaped down the companionway to grab the man and haul him back to safety as the ship heaved again this time in the other direction and salt waves washed the deck hawkmoon looked down at the man he had res cued the mate lay on his back eyes closed lips mov ing in the words of the song hed been singing hawkmoon laughed shaking his head calling up to the skipper youre righthe has a drunkards luck then as he turned his head to port he thought he saw something in the water the light was fading fast but he was sure he had seen a vessel of some kind not too far away captaindo you see anything yonder he yelled going to the rail and peering into the mass of heaving water looks like a raft of some kind mouso called back hawkmoon was soon able too see the thing more closely as a wave swept it nearer it was a raft with three men clinging to it shipwrecked by the look of em mouso called casually poor bastards he shrugged his shoulders ah well not our affairs captain we must save them hawkmoon said well never do it in this light besides were wast ing time im carrying no cargo save yourself on this trip and have to be in simferopol on time to pick up my cargo before someone else does we must save them hawkmoon said firmly ol adhana rope the bulgar beastman found a coil of rope in the wheelhouse and came hurrying down with it the raft was still in sight its burden flat on their faces clinging to it for dear life sometimes it vanished in a great trough of water reappearing after several sec onds a fair distance from the boat the gap between them was widening all the time and hawkmoon knew that there was very little time before the raft would be too far away for them to reach it lashing one end of the rope to the rail and looping the other about his waist he stripped off cloak and sword and dived into the foaming ocean at once hawkmoon realized the danger he was in the great waves were almost impossible to swim against and there was every chance of his being dashed against the side of the ship stunned and drowned but he struggled on through the water fighting to keep it out of his mouth and eyes as he searched about for the raft there it was and now its occupants had seen the ship and were standing up waving and shouting they had not seen hawkmoon swimming toward them as he swam hawkmoon caught glimpses of the men from time to time but he could not distinguish them clearly two now seemed to be struggling while the third seemed to be sitting upright watching them hold on hawkmoon called above the crash of the sea and the moan of the wind exerting all his strength he swam even harder and was soon nearly upon the raft as it was tossed on a wild chaos of black and white water then hawkmoon caught the edge of the raft and saw that indeed two of the men were fighting in earn est he saw too that they wore the snouted masks of the order of the boar the men were warriors of granbretan for an instant hawkmoon debated leaving them to their fate but if he did that he reasoned he would be no better than they he must do his best to save them then decide what to do with them he called up to the fighting pair but they did not seem to hear him they grunted and cursed in their struggle and hawkmoon wondered if they had not been demented by their ordeal hawkmoon tried to heave himself onto the raft but the water and the rope around his body dragged him down he saw the seated figure look up and sign to him almost casually help me hawkmoon gasped or ill not be able to help you the figure rose and swayed across the raft until his way was blocked by the fighting men with a shrug he seized their necks paused for an instant until the raft dipped in the water then pushed them into the sea hawkmoon my dear friend came a voice from within the boar mask how happy i am to see you thereive helped you ive lightened our load hawkmoon made a grab at one of the drowning men who still struggled with his companion in the heavy masks and armor they were bound to be dragged down in seconds but he could not reach them he watched in fascination as with seeming gradualness the masks sank below the waves he glared up at the survivor who was leaning down to offer him a hand you have murdered your friends daverc ive a good mind to let you go down with them friends my dear hawkmoon they were no such thing servants aye but not friends daverc braced himself as another wave tossed the raft nearly forcing hawkmoon to lose his grasp not friends they were loyal enoughbut dreadfully boring and they made fools of themselves i cannot tolerate that come along let me help you aboard my little vessel it is not much but hawkmoon allowed daverc to help him onto the raft then turned and waved toward the ship just vis ible through the darkness he felt the rope tighten as oladahn began to haul on it it was fortunate that you were passing daverc said coolly as slowly they were drawn toward the ship i had thought myself as good as drowned and all my glorious promise barely fulfilledand then who should come by in his splendid ship but the noble duke of koln fate flings us together once again duke aye but ill readily fling you away again as you flung your friends if you do not hold tongue and help me with this rope growled hawkmoon the raft plunged through the sea and at last bumped against smiling girls halfrotten side a rope ladder sanked down and hawkmoon began to climb finally hauling himself with relief over the rail gasping for breath when oladahn saw the next mans head emerge over the side he cursed and made to draw his sword but hawkmoon stopped him hes our prisoner and we might as well keep him alive for he could be a useful bargaining counter if we are in trouble later how sensible daverc exclaimed admiringly then began coughing forgive memy ordeal has desperately weakened me i fear a change of clothes some hot grog a good nights rest and ill be myself again youll be lucky if we let you rot in the bilges hawkmoon said take him below to our cabin oladahn huddled in the tiny cabin that was dimly lit by a small lantern hanging from the roof hawkmoon and oladahn watched daverc strip himself of his mask armor and sodden undergarments how did you come to be on the raft daverc hawkmoon asked as the frenchman fussily dried himself even he was slightly nonplussed by the mans apparent coolness he admired the quality and even wondered if he did not actually like daverc in some strange way perhaps it was davercs honesty in ad mitting his ambition his unwillingness to justify his actions even if as recently they involved casual mur der a long story my dear friend the three of us ecardo peter and ileft the men to deal with that blind monster you released upon us and managed to reach the safety of the hills a little later the ornithop ter we had sent to collect you arrived and began to circle evidently puzzled by the disappearance of an entire cityas we were i must admit you must explain that to me later well we signaled to the pilot and he came down we had already realized the somewhat difficult position we found ourselves in dav erc paused is there any food to be had the skipper has ordered some supper from the galley oladahn said continue we were three men without horses in a rather barren part of the world as well we had failed to keep you when we had captured you and as far as we knew the pilot was the only living man left who knew that we had done that you killed the pilot hawkmoon said just so it was necessary then we boarded his machine with the intention of reaching the nearest base what happened hawkmoon asked did you know how to control the ornithopter daverc smiled you have guessed correctly my knowledge of the things is limited we managed to gain the air but then the wretched thing would not be steered before we knew it it was carrying us off to the runestaff knows where i feared for my safety i must admit the monster behaved increasingly er ratically until at last it began to fall i managed to guide it so that it landed on a soft riverbank and we were barely hurt ecardo and peter had become hys terical quarreling among themselves becoming un bearable in their manners and most hard to control however we somehow managed to build a raft with the intention of floating down the river until we came to a town that same raft hawkmoon asked the same aye then how did you come to be at sea tides my good friend daverc said with an airy wave of his hand currents i had not realized we were so close to an estuary we were swept along at a most appalling rate carried far beyond land on that raftthat damnable raftwe spent the next sev eral days with peter and ecardo whining at one an other blaming one another for their predicament when they should have blamed me oh i cannot tell you what an ordeal it was duke dorian you deserved worse hawkmoon said there came a knock on the cabin door oladahn answered it and admitted a scruffy cabin boy carrying a tray on which were three bowls containing some kind of gray stew hawkmoon accepted the tray and handed daverc a bowl and a spoon for a moment daverc hesitated then he took a mouthful he seemed to eat with great control he finished the dish and replaced the empty bowl on the tray delicious he said quite perfect for ships cooking hawkmoon who had been nauseated by the mess handed daverc his own bowl and oladahn too preferred his i thank you said daverc i believe in modera tion enough is as good as a feast hawkmoon smiled slightly once again admiring the frenchmans coolness evidently the food had tasted as foul to him as it had to them but his hunger had been so great that he had eaten the stuff anyway and with panache now daverc stretched his rippling muscles be lying his claim to invalidism ah he yawned if you will forgive me gentlemen i will sleep now i have had a trying and tiring few days take my bed hawkmoon said indicating his cramped bunk he did not mention that earlier he had noticed what had seemed to be a whole tribe of bugs nesting in it ill see if the skipper has a hammock i am grateful daverc said and there seemed to be a surprising seriousness about his tone that made hawkmoon wheel away from the door for what daverc began to cough ostentatiously then looked up and said in his old mocking tone why my dear duke for saving my life of course in the morning the storm had died down and though the sea was still rough it was much calmer than the previous day hawkmoon met daverc on deck the man was dressed in coat and britches of green velvet but was without his armor he bowed when he saw hawk moon you slept well asked hawkmoon excellently davercs eyes were full of humor and hawkmoon guessed that he had been bitten a good many times tonight we should make port hawkmoon told him you will be my prisonermy hostage if you like hostage do you think the dark empire cares if i live or die once i have lost my usefulness we shall see said hawkmoon fingering the jewel in his skull if you attempt to escape i shall certainly kill youas coolly as you killed your men daverc coughed into the handkerchief he carried i owe you my life he said so it is yours to take if you would hawkmoon frowned daverc was far too devious for him to understand properly he was beginning to regret his decision the frenchman might prove more of a liability than he had bargained for oladahn came hurrying along the deck duke dorian he panted pointing forward a sailand its heading directly toward us were in little danger hawkmoon smiled were no prize for a pirate but moments later hawkmoon noticed signs of panic among the crew and as the captain stumbled past he caught his arm captain mousowhat is it danger sir rasped the skipper great danger did you not read the sail hawkmoon peered toward the horizon and saw that the ship carried a single black sail on it was painted an emblem of some kind but he could not make out what it was surely theyll not trouble us he said why should they risk a fight for a tub like thisand you said yourself were carrying no cargo they care not what we carry or dont carry sir they attack anything on the ocean on sight theyre like killer whales duke doriantheir pleasure is not in taking treasure but in destruction who are they not a granbretanian ship by the look of it daverc said even one of those would probably not bother to attack us stuttered captain mouso nothat is a ship crewed by those belonging to the cult of the mad god they are from muskovia and in recent months have begun to terrorize these waters they definitely seem to have the intention of at tacking daverc said lightly with your permis sion duke dorian ill go below and don my sword and armor ill get my weapons too oladahn said ill bring your sword for you no point in fighting it was the mate gesticulat ing with his bottle best throw ourselves in the sea now aye captain mouso nodded looking after daverc and oladahn as they went to fetch their weapons hes right well be outnumbered and theyll tear us to pieces if were captured theyll torture us for days hawkmoon started to say something to the captain then turned as he heard a splash the mate had gone as good as his word hawkmoon rushed to the side but could see nothing dont bother to help himfollow him the skip per said for hes the wisest of us all the ship was bearing down on them now its black sail painted with a pair of great red wings and in the center of them was a huge bestial face howling as if in the throes of maniacal laughter crowding the decks were scores of naked men wearing nothing but sword belts and metalstudded collars drifting across the water came a weird sound that hawkmoon could not at first make out then he glanced at the sail again and knew what it was it was the sound of wild insane laughter a sound as if the damned of hell were moved to merriment the mad gods ship said captain mouso his eyes beginning to fill with tears now we die chapter seven the ring on the finger hawkmoon oladahn and daverc stood shoulder to shoulder by the port rail of the ship as the weird vessel sped closer and closer the members of the crew had all clustered around their captain as far as possible away from the attack ers looking at the rolling eyes and foaming mouths of the madmen in the ship hawkmoon decided that their chances were all but hopeless grappling irons snaked out from the mad gods ship and bit into the soft wood of smiling girls rail instantly the three men began to hack at the ropes severing most of them hawkmoon yelled to the captain get your men alofttry to turn the ship but the frightened men did not move youll be safer in the rigging hawk moon shouted they began to stir but still did nothing hawkmoon was forced to return his attention to the attacking ship and was horrified to see it looming over them its insane crew clustering against the rail some already beginning to climb over ready to leap onto smiling girls deck cutlasses drawn their laughter filled the air and bloodlust shone on their twisted faces the first came flying down on hawkmoon naked body gleaming sword raised hawkmoons own blade came up to skewer the man as he fell another twist of the sword and the corpse dropped down through the narrow gap between the ships into the sea within moments the air was full of naked warriors swinging on ropes jumping wildly clambering hand over hand across the grappling lines the three men stopped the first wave hacking about them until everything seemed bloodred but gradually they were forced away from the rail as the madmen swarmed onto the deck fighting without skill but with a chilling dis regard for their own lives hawkmoon became separated from his comrades did not know if they lived or had been killed the prancing warriors flung themselves at him but he clutched his battle blade in both hands and swung it about him in a great arc this way and that surround ing himself with a blur of bright steel he was covered in blood from head to foot only his eyes gleamed blue and steady from the visor of his helmet and all the while the mad gods men laughed laughed even as their heads were chopped from their necks their limbs from their bodies hawkmoon knew that eventually weariness would overcome him already the sword felt heavy in his hands and his knees shook his back against a bulk head he hacked and stabbed at the seemingly cease less wave of giggling madmen whose swords sought to slash the life from him here a man was decapitated there another dis membered but every blow drained more energy from hawkmoon then as he blocked two swords that struck at him at once his leg buckled and he went down to one knee the laughter grew louder triumphant as the mad gods men moved in for the kill he hacked upward desperately gripping the wrist of one of his attackers and wrenching the sword away from him so that now he had two blades using the madmans sword to thrust and his own to swing he managed to regain his footing kicked out at another man and scrambled away to rush up the com panionway to the bridge at the top of the compan ionway he turned to fight again this time with an increased advantage over the howling madmen who crowded up the steps toward him he saw now that both daverc and oladahn were in the rigging man aging to keep their attackers at bay he glanced to ward the man gods ship it was still held fast by grappling ropes but it was deserted its entire crew was on board the smiling girl hawkmoon at once had an idea he wheeled about running from the warriors leaped to the rail and grabbed a rope that trailed from the crosstrees then he flung himself into space he prayed that the rope would be long enough as he hurtled through the air then let go diving it ap peared over the side of the ship his grasping hands just managed to catch the rail of the enemy ship as he fell he hauled himself onto the deck and began slashing at the grappling ropes yelling oladahn daverc quicklyfollow me from the rigging of the other ship the two men saw him and began climbing higher to walk pre cariously along the mainmasts yardarm while the men of the mad god swarmed behind them the mad gods ship was already beginning to slide away the gap between it and smiling girl widening rapidly daverc jumped first diving for the blacksailed ships rigging arid clutching a rope onehanded to swing for an instant threatening to drop to his death oladahn followed him cutting loose a rope and swinging across the gap to slide down the rope and land on the deck where he fell spreadeagled on his face several of the insane warriors tried to follow and a number actually managed to reach the deck of their own ship still laughing they came at hawkmoon in a bunch doubtless judging oladahn dead hawkmoon was hard put to defend himself a blade slashed his arm another caught his face below the visor then suddenly from above a body dropped into the center of the naked warriors and began hew ing around him almost as much a maniac as they it was daverc in his boarheaded armor streaming with the blood of those he had slain and now at the back of their attackers came oladahn evidently only winded by his fall yelling a wild mountain battle cry soon every one of the madmen who had managed to reach the ship was dead the others were leaping from the deck of smiling girl into the water still laughing weirdly trying to swim after the ship looking back at smiling girl hawkmoon saw that miraculously most of her crew had apparently sur vivedat the last minute they had climbed to the safety of the mizzen mast daverc raced forward and took the wheel of the mad gods ship cutting the lashings and steering from the vainly swimming men well breathed oladahn sheathing his sword and inspecting his cuts we seem to have escaped lightlyand with a better ship with luck well beat smiling girl into port hawkmoon grinned i hope shes still bound for crimia for she has all our possessions on board skillfully daverc was turning the ship about toward the north the single sail bulged as it caught the wind and the boat left the swimming madmen be hind even as they drowned they continued to laugh after they had helped daverc relash the wheel so that the ship continued roughly on course they began to explore the ship it was crammed with treasure evidently pillaged from a score of ships but also there were all kinds of useless thingsbroken weapons and ships instruments bundles of clothingand here and there a rotting corpse or a dismembered body all piled together in the holds the three men decided to get rid of the corpses first wrapping them in cloaks or bundling up the various limbs in rags and tossing them overboard it was disgusting work and took a long time for some of the remains were hidden under mounds of other things suddenly oladahn paused as he worked his eyes fixed on a severed human hand that had become mum mified in some way reluctantly he picked it up in specting a ring on the little finger he glanced at hawkmoon duke dorian what is it do not bother to save the ring just get rid of the thing noit is the ring itself lookit has a peculiar design impatiently hawkmoon crossed the dimly lit hold and peered at the thing gasping as he recognized it no it cannot be the ring was yisseldas it was the ring count brass had placed on her finger to mark her betrothal to dorian hawkmoon numbed with horror hawkmoon took the mum mified hand a look of incomprehension on his face what is it oladahn whispered what is it that so disturbs you it is hers it is yisseldas but how could she have come to be sailing this ocean so many hundreds of miles from the kamarg it is not possible duke dorian the ring is hers hawkmoon gazed at the hand inspecting it eagerly as realization struck him but the hand is not see the ring barely fits the little fin ger count brass placed it on the middle finger and even then it was a loose fit this is the hand of some thief he wrenched the precious ring from the finger and threw the hand down someone who was in the kamarg perhaps and stole the ring he shook his head its unlikely but what is the explanation perhaps she journeyed this wayseeking you maybe oladahn suggested shed be foolish if she did but it is just possible however if thats the case where is yisselda now oladahn was about to speak when there came a low terrifying chuckling sound from above they looked up at the entrance to the hold a mad grinning face looked down at them some how one of the insane warriors had managed to catch the ship now he prepared to leap down on them hawkmoon just managed to draw his sword as the madman attacked sword slashing metal hit metal oladahn drew his own blade and daverc came rushing up but hawkmoon shouted take him alive we must take him alive as hawkmoon engaged the madman daverc and oladahn resheathed their swords and fell on the war riors back grasping his arms twice he shook them off but then he went down kicking as they wound length after length of rope around him and then he lay still chuckling up at them his eyes unseeing his mouth foamflecked what use is he alive daverc asked with polite curiosity why not cut his throat and have done with him this hawkmoon said is a ring i found just now he held it up it belongs to yisselda count brasss daughter i want to know how these men got it strange daverc said frowning i believe the girl still in the kamarg nursing her father so count brass is wounded daverc smiled aye but the kamarg still holds against us id sought to disturb you duke dorian i do not know how badly count brass is hurt but he still lives and that wise man of his bowgentle helps him command his troops the last i heard it was stale mate between the dark empire and the kamarg and you heard nothing of yisselda nothing of her leaving the kamarg no said daverc frowning but i seem to re member as yesa man serving in count brasss army i believe he was approached and persuaded to try to kidnap the girl but the attempt was unsuc cessful how do you know juan zhinagathe mandisappeared presumably count brass discovered his perfidy and slew him i find it hard to believe that zhinaga should be a traitor i knew the man slightlya captain of cavalry he was captured by us in the second battle against the kamarg daverc smiled i believe he was a ger man and we had some of his family in our safekeep ing you blackmailed him he was blackmailed though do not give me the credit i merely heard of the plan during a conference in londra between the various commanders who had been summoned by king huon to inform him of developments in the campaigns we are waging in europe hawkmoons brow furrowed but suppose zhin aga was successfulsomehow not managing to reach your people with yisselda being stopped on the way by the mad gods men daverc shook his head they would never range as far as southern france we should have heard of them if they had then what is the explanation let us ask this gentleman daverc suggested prodding at the madman whose chuckles had died down now so that they were almost inaudible let us hope we can get sense from him oladahn said dubiously would pain do the trick do you thing daverc asked i doubt it hawkmoon said they know no fear we must try another method he looked in disgust at the madman well leave him for a while and hope he calms a little they went up on deck closing the hatch cover the sun was beginning to set and the coastline of crimia was now in sightblack crags sharp against the purple sky the water was calm and dappled with the fading sunlight and the wind blew steadily north ward id best correct our course daverc suggested we seem to be sailing a little too far to the north he moved along the deck to unbind the wheel and spin it several points south hawkmoon nodded absently watching daverc his great mask flung back from his head expertly con trolling the course of the ship well have to anchor offshore tonight oladahn said and sail in in the morning hawkmoon did not reply his head was full of un answered questions the exertions of the past twenty four hours had brought him close to exhaustion and the fear in his mind threatened to drive him to a mad ness fully as dreadful as that of the man in the hold later that night by the light of lamps suspended from the ceiling they studied the sleeping face of the man they had captured the lamps swung as the ship rocked at anchor casting shifting shadows on the sides of the hold and over the great piles of booty heaped everywhere a rat chittered but the men ignored the sound they had all slept a little and felt more relaxed hawkmoon knelt down beside the bound man and touched his face instantly the eyes opened staring around dully no longer mad they even seemed a little puzzled what is your name hawkmoon asked coryanthum of kerchwho are you where am i you should know oladahn said on board your own ship do you not remember you and your fel lows attacked our vessel there was a fight we es caped from you and you swam after us and tried to kill us i remember setting sail coryanthum said his voice bewildered but nothing else then he tried to struggle up why am i bound because you are dangerous daverc said lightly you are mad coryanthum laughed a purely natural laugh i mad nonsense the three looked at one another puzzled it was true that the man seemed to have no hint of madness about him now understanding began to dawn on hawkmoons face what is the very last thing you remember the captain addressing us what did he say that we were to take part in a ceremonydrink ing a special drink nothing much more cory anthum frowned we drank the drink describe your sail hawkmoon said our sail why is there anything special about it not that i remember its canvasa dark blue thats all you are a merchant seaman hawkmoon asked aye and this is your first voyage on this ship aye when did you sign on coryanthum looked impatient last night my friendon the day of the horse by kerch reckon ing and in universal reckoning the sailor wrinkled his brow ohthe eleventh of the third month three months ago said daverc eh coryanthum peered through the gloom at the frenchman three months what dyou mean you were drugged hawkmoon explained drugged and then used to commit the foulest acts of piracy ever heard of do you know anything of the cult of the mad god a little i heard that it is situated somewhere in ukrania and that its adherents have been venturing out latelyeven onto the high seas did you know that your sail now bears the sign of the mad god that a few hours ago you raved and giggled in mad bloodlust look at your body hawkmoon bent down to cut the bonds feel your neck coryanthum of kerch stood up slowly wondering at his own nakedness his fingers going slowly to his neck and touching the collar there ii dont under stand is this a trick an evil trick and one we did not commit ola dahn said you were drugged until you went insane then ordered to kill and collect all the loot you could doubtless your merchant captain was the only man who knew what would happen to you and its almost certain hes not aboard now do you remember any thing any instructions about where you should go none without doubt the captain meant to rejoin the ship later and guide it to whatever port he uses daverc said maybe there is a ship in regular con tact with the others if they are all full of such fools as this one there must be a large supply of the drug some where aboard oladahn said doubtless they fed off it regularly it was only because we bound this fellow that he did not get the chance to replenish himself how do you feel hawkmoon asked the sailor weakdrained of all life and feeling understandable said oladahn its sure that drug kills you in the end a monstrous plan take innocent men feed them a drug that turns them mad and ultimately destroys them use them to murder and loot then collect the proceeds ive heard of nothing like it before id thought the cult of the mad god to be comprised of honest fanatics but it seems a cooler intelligence controls it on the seas at any rate hawkmoon said how ever id like to find the man responsible for all this he alone may know where yisselda is first id suggest we take up the sail daverc said well drift into the harbor on the tide our reception would not be pleasant if they saw our sail also we can make use of this treasure why we are rich men you are still my prisoner daverc hawkmoon reminded him but it is true we could dispose of some of the treasure since the poor souls who owned it are all dead now and give the rest into the safekeep ing of some honest man to compensate those who have lost relatives and fortunes at the hands of the mad sailors then what asked oladahn then we set sail againand wait for this ships master to seek her out can we be sure he will what if he hears of our visit to simferopol oladahn asked hawkmoon smiled grimly then doubtless he will still wish to seek us out chapter eight mad gods man and so the loot was sold in simferopol some of it used to provision the craft and buy new equipment and horses and the rest given into the safekeeping of a merchant whom all recommended as the most honest in the whole of crimia not much behind the cap tured ship smiling girl limped in and hawkmoon hastily bought the captains silence regarding the na ture of the blacksailed ship he recovered his posses sions including the saddlebag containing rinals gift and with oladahn and daverc reboarded the ship sailing on the evening tide they left coryanthum with the merchant to recover for more than a week the black ship drifted usually becalmed for the wind had dropped to almost noth ing by hawkmoons reckoning they were drifting close to the channel that separated the black sea from the azov sea near to kerch where coryanthum had been recruited daverc lounged in a hammock he had hung for himself amidships occasionally coughing theatrically and remarking on his boredom oladahn sat often in the crownest scanning the sea while hawkmoon paced the decks beginning to wonder if his plan had had any substance to it other than his need to know what had become of yisselda he was even beginning to doubt that the ring had been hers deciding that perhaps several such rings had been made in the ka marg over the years then one morning a sail appeared on the horizon coming from the northwest oladahn saw it first and called to hawkmoon to come on deck hawkmoon rushed up and peered ahead it might be the ship they awaited get below he called everybody get below oladahn scrambled down the rigging while dav erc suddenly active swung out of his hammock and strolled to the ladder that led belowdecks they met in the darkness of the central hold and waited an hour seemed to pass before they heard timber bump against timber and knew that the other ship had drawn alongside it might still be an innocent vessel curious about a ship drifting apparently unmanned not much later hawkmoon heard the sound of booted feet on the deck above a slow measured tread that went the length of the whole deck and back again then there was silence as the man above either entered a cabin or climbed to the bridge tension grew as the sound of the footsteps came again this time walking directly toward the central hold hawkmoon saw a silhouette above peering down into the darkness where they crouched the figure paused then began to descend the ladder as he did so hawkmoon crept forward when the newcomer had reached the bottom hawkmoon sprang his arm encircling the mans throat he was a giant more than six and a half feet tall with a huge black bushy beard and plaited hair wearing a brass breastplate over his shirt of black silk he growled in surprise and swung around carrying hawkmoon with him the giant was incredibly strong his huge fingers went up to hawkmoons arm and began to prise it loose quickhelp me hold him hawkmoon cried and his friends rushed forward to fling themselves on the giant and bear him down daverc drew his sword wearing his boar mask and the metal finery of granbretan he looked danger ous and terrible as he delicately placed the tip of his sword against the giants throat your name daverc demanded his voice boom ing in his helmet captain shagarov where is my crew the blackbearded giant glared up at them un abashed by his capture where is my crew you mean the madmen you sent akilling olad ahn said they are drowned all but one and he told us of your evil treachery fools shagarov cursed you are three men did you think to trap mewhen i have a shipful of fighters aboard my other ship we have disposed of one shipload as youll note daverc told him with a chuckle now that we are used to the work doubtless we can dispose of an other for a moment fear crept into shagarovs eyes then his expression hardened i do not believe you those who sailed this ship lived only to kill how could you well we did daverc said he turned his great helmeted head toward hawkmoon shall we go on deck and put the rest of our plan into operation a moment hawkmoon bent close to shagarov i want to question him shagarovdid your men cap ture a girl at any time they had orders not to kill any girl but to bring them to me why i know noti was ordered to send girls to him and girls i sent him shagarov laughed youll not keep me for long you know youll all three be dead within an hour the men will get suspicious why didnt you bring any of them aboard with you perhaps because they are not madmenbecause even they might be disgusted by what they found shagarov shrugged theyll come when i yell possibly said daverc rise please these girls hawkmoon continued where did you send themand to whom inland of course to my masterthe mad god so you do serve the mad godyou are not de ceiving people into believing these acts of piracy are committed by his followers ayei serve him though im no cult member his agents pay me well to raid the seas and send the booty to him why this way shagarov sneered the cult has no sailing men some one of them hit this plan to raise moneythough i know not the purpose for the lootand approached me he rose to his feet towering over them come lets go up it will amuse me to see what you do daverc nodded to the other two who went back into the shadows and produced long unlit brands one for each of them daverc prodded at shagarov to follow oladahn up the companionway slowly they climbed to the deck to emerge at last in the sunlight and see a big handsome threemaster anchored beside them the men on board the other ship understood at once what had happened and made to move forward but hawkmoon dug his sword into shagarovs ribs and called do not move or we will kill your cap tain kill meand they kill you shagarov rumbled who gains silence said hawkmoon oladahn light the brands oladahn applied flint and tinder to the first brand it flared into life he lit the others off it and handed one each to his companions now hawkmoon said this ship is covered in oil once we touch our brands to it the whole vessel goes up in flamesand most likely your ship too so we advise you to make no move toward rescuing your captain so we all burn shagarov said youre as mad as the ones you slew hawkmoon shook his head oladahn ready the skiff oladahn went aft to the furthermost hatch swing ing a derrick over it hauling back the hatch cover and then disappearing below taking the cable with him hawkmoon saw the men on the other ship begin to stir and he moved the brand menacingly the heat from it turned his face dark red and the flames re flected fiercely in his eyes now oladahn reemerged and began to work the specially geared winch with one hand while holding his brand with the other slowly something began to appear in the hatch something that barely cleared the wide opening shagarov grunted in surprise as he saw that it was a large skiff in which three horses were harnessed looking frightened and bewildered as the were hauled to the deck and then swung out over the sea oladahn stopped his work and leaned back on the winch panting and sweating but made sure to keep the brand well away from the timber of the deck shagarov scowled an elaborate planbut you are still only three men what do you intend to do now hang you said hawkmoon before the eyes of your crew two things motivated me in laying this trap for you onei needed information twoi de termined to give you justice whose justice shagarov bellowed his eyes full of fear why involve yourselves in the affairs of others we did no harm to you whose justice hawkmoons justice said the palefaced duke of koln caught by the rays of the sun the sinister black jewel in his forehead seemed to glow with life men shagarov screamed across the water men rescue me attack them daverc called back if you move toward him we kill him and set the ship ablaze you gain nothing if youd save your own lives and your ship youll shove off and leave us our quarrel is with shagarov as they had expected the crew commanded by the pirate did not feel any great loyalty to him and when their own skins were threatened felt no great com pulsion to come to his help yet they did not cast off the grappling irons but waited to see what the three men would do next now hawkmoon swung up into the crosstrees he carried a rope with a noose already knotted when he reached the top he flung the rope over the arm so that it hung over the water tied it firmly and came down again to the deck now there was silence as shagarov slowly realized that he could expect no assistance from his men up aft the skiff with its burden of horses and pro visions swung slightly in the still air the davits creak ing the brands flared and sputtered in the hands of the three companions shagarov shouted and tried to break away but three swords stopped him points at his throat chest and belly you cannot shagarov began but then trailed off as he saw the determination on the faces of the three oladahn reached out and hooked the dangling rope with is sword bringing it to the rail daverc pushed shagarov forward hawkmoon took the noose and widened it to place it over shagarovs neck then as the noose settled around his neck shagarov bellowed and struck out at oladahn who was perched on the rail with a shout of surprise the little man toppled and plunged into the water hawkmoon gasped and rushed to see how oladahn fared shagarov turned on daverc knocking the brand from his hand but daverc stepped back and flourished his sword under shagarovs nose the pirate captain spat in his face and leaped to the rail kicked out at hawkmoon who tried to stop him then the captain leaped into space the noose tightened the yardarm bent then straightened and captain shagarovs body danced wildly up and down his neck snapped and he died daverc dashed for the fallen brand but it had al ready ignited the oilsoaked deck he began stamping on the flames hawkmoon rushed to fling a rope to oladahn who dripping began to climb up the side of the ship look ing none the worse for his swim now the crew on the other boat began to mutter and move about and hawkmoon wondered why they did not cast off shove off he called as oladahn regained the deck you cannot save your captain nowand youre in danger from the fire but they did not move the fire you fools oladahn pointed to where daverc was retreating from the flames which were now leaping high touching the mast and superstruc ture daverc laughed lets to our little boat hawkmoon flung his own brand after davercs and turned but why dont they get away the treasure said daverc as they lowered the skiff to the water the frightened horses snorting as they sniffed the fire they think the treasures still aboard as soon as the skiff was afloat they clambered down the lines into the boat and cut themselves adrift now the black ship was a mass of flame and oily smoke outlined against the fire the body of shagarov swung twisting this way and that as if trying to avoid the hellish heat they let loose the skiffs sail and the breeze filled it bearing them away from the blazing vessel now beyond it they could see the pirates ship a sail smold ering as sparks from the other ship caught it some of the crew were busy putting it out while others were reluctantly casting off the grappling lines but now it was touch and go whether the fire would spread through their own ship soon the skiff was too far away for them to see whether the pirate ship was safe or not and in the other direction land was in sight the land of crimia and beyond it ukrania and somewhere in ukrania they would find the mad god his followers and possibly yisselda book two now while dorian hawkmoon and his companions sailed for crimias mountainous shore the armies of the dark empire pressed in upon the little land of the kamarg ordered by huon the kingemperor to spare no life energy and inspiration in the effort to crush and utterly destroy those upstarts who dared re sist granbretan across the silver bridge that spanned thirty miles of sea came the hordes of the dark em pire pigs and wolves vultures and dogs mantises and frogs with armor of strange design and weapons of bright metal and in his throne globe curled fetus like in the fluid that preserved his immortality king huon burned with hatred for hawkmoon count brass and the rest who somehow he could not con trive to manipulate as he manipulated the rest of the world it was as if some counterforce aided them perhaps manipulated them as he could notand this thought the kingemperor could not tolerate but much depended on those few beyond the pow er of king huons influence those few free souls hawkmoon oladahn perhaps daverc the mysteri ous warrior in jet and gold yisselda count brass and a handful of others for on these the runestaff re lied to work its own pattern of destiny the high history of the runestaff chapter one the waiting warrior as they neared the bleak crags that marked the shore hawkmoon glanced curiously at daverc who had flung back his boarmasked helm and was staring out to sea a slight smile on his lips daverc seemed to sense hawkmoons attention and glanced at him you seem puzzled duke dorian he said are you not a little pleased by the outcome of our plan aye hawkmoon nodded but i wonder about you daverc you joined in this venture spontane ously yet there is no gain in it for you i am sure you felt no great interest in bringing shagarov his deserts and you certainly do not share my desperation in wanting to know yisseldas fate also you have not to my knowledge made any attempt to escape davercs smile broadened a little why should i you do not threaten my life in fact you saved my life at this point my fortunes seem linked closer to yours than the dark empires but your loyalty is not to me and my cause my loyalty my dear duke as i have already ex plained is to the cause most likely to further my own ambition i must admit ive changed my views about the hopelessness of your causeyou seem endowed with such monstrous good luck i am sometimes even inclined to think you might win against the dark em pire if that seems possible i might well join you and with great enthusiasm you do not bide your time perhaps hoping to re verse our roles again and capture me for your mas ters no denial would convince you daverc smiled so i will not offer you one the enigmatic answer set hawkmoon to frowning again as if to change the topic of conversation daverc suddenly doubled up with a coughing fit and lay down panting in the boat oladahn called out now from the prow duke dorian lookon the beach hawkmoon peered ahead now under the looming cliffs he could make out a narrow strip of shingle a horseman could be seen on the beach motionless looking towards them as if he awaited them with some particular message the keel of the skiff scraped the shingle of the beach and hawkmoon recognized the horseman who waited in the shadow of the cliff hawkmoon sprang from the boat and approached him he was clad from head to foot in plate armor his helmeted head bowed as if in brooding thought did you know i would be here hawkmoon asked it seemed that you might beach in this particular place replied the warrior in jet and gold so i waited i see hawkmoon looked up at him uncertain what to do or say next i see daverc and oladahn came crunching up the beach towards them you know this gentleman daverc asked lightly an old acquaintance hawkmoon said you are sir huillam daverc said the warrior in jet and gold sonorously i see you still wear the garb of granbretan it suits my taste daverc replied i did not hear you introduce yourself the warrior in jet and gold ignored daverc raising a heavy gauntleted hand to point at hawk moon this is the one i must speak with you seek your betrothed yisselda duke dorian and you quest for the mad god is yisselda a prisoner of the mad god in a manner of speaking yes but you must seek the mad god for another reason yisselda lives does she live hawkmoon said in sistently she lives the warrior in jet and gold shifted in his saddle but you must destroy the mad god before she can be yours again you must destroy the mad god and rip the red amulet from his throatfor the red am ulet is rightfully yours two things the mad god has stolen and both those things are yoursthe girl and the amulet yisselda is mine certainlybut i know of no am ulet i have never owned one this is the red amulet and it is yours the mad god has no right to wear it and thus it turned him mad hawkmoon smiled if that is the red amulets property then the mad god is welcome to it this is not a matter for humor duke dorian the red amulet has turned the mad god mad because he stole it from a servant of the runestaff but if the runestaffs servant wears the red amulet then he is able to derive great power transmitted from the rune staff through the amulet only a wrongful wearer is turned madonly the rightful wearer may regain it once another wears it therefore i could not take it from him nor could any man save dorian hawkmoon von koln servant of the runestaff again you call me servant of the runestaff yet i know of no duties i must perform do not even know if this is all a fabric of imaginings and you are some madman yourself think what you wish however there is no doubt is there that you seek the mad godthat you desire nothing greater than to find him to find yisselda his prisoner if you like well then i need not convince you of your mission hawkmoon frowned there has been a strange series of coincidences since i embarked on the journey from hamadan barely credible there are no coincidences where the runestaff is concerned sometimes the pattern is noticed some times it is not the warrior in jet and gold turned in his saddle and pointed to a winding path cut into the cliff side we can ascend there camp and rest above in the morning we shall begin the journey to the the mad gods castle you know where it lies hawkmoon asked ea gerly forgetting his other doubts aye then another thought occurred to hawkmoon you did not did not engineer yisseldas cap ture to force me to seek the mad god yisselda was captured by a traitor in her fathers armyjuan zhinaga who planned to take her to granbretan but he was diverted on the way by war riors of the dark empire who wished to claim the credit for kidnapping her while they fought yis selda escaped and fled joining at length a refugee caravan through italia managing to get passage some time later on a ship sailing the adriatic sea bound she was told ultimately for provence but the ship was a slaver running girls to arabia and in the gulf of sidra was attacked by a pirate vessel from karp athos it is a hard story to believe what then then the karpathians decided to ransom her not knowing that the kamarg was under siege but learn ing only later of the impossibility of getting money from that quarter they decided to take her to istan bul to sell her but arrived to find the harbor full of dark empire ships fearing these they sailed on into the black sea where the ship was attacked by the one you have just burned i know the rest that hand i found must have be longed to a pirate who stole yisseldas ring but it is a wild tale warrior and barely has the sound of truth coincidence i told youthere are no coincidences where the runestaff is involved sometimes the pattern seems simpler than at other times hawkmoon sighed she is unharmed relatively what do you mean wait until you come to the mad gods castle hawkmoon tried to question the warrior in jet and gold further but the enigmatic man remained entirely silent he sat on his horse apparently deep in thought while hawkmoon went to help daverc and oladahn get the nervous horses out of the boat and unload the rest of the provisions they had brought hawkmoon found his battered saddlebag still safe and marveled at his being able to hold on to it through all their adventures when they were ready the warrior in jet and gold silently turned his horse and led the way to the steep cliff path beginning to climb it without pause the three companions however were forced to dismount and follow after him at a much slower pace several times both men and horses stumbled and seemed about to fall loose stones dropping away beneath their feet to hurtle to the shingle that was now far below them but at last they gained the top of the cliff and looked over a hilly plain that seemed to stretch away forever the warrior in jet and gold pointed to the west in the morning we go that way to the throbbing bridge beyond that lies ukrania and the mad gods castle lies many days journey into the interior be wary for dark empire troops roam thereabouts he watched as they made camp daverc looked up at him wont you join us in our meal sir he said almost sardonically but the great helmeted head remained bowed and both warrior and horse stood stock still like a statue remaining thus all night as if watching over them or possibly watching them to make sure they did not leave on their own hawkmoon lay in his tent looking out at the sil houette of the warrior in jet and gold wondering if the creature were in any way human wondering if his interest in hawkmoon was ultimately friendly or malign he sighed he wanted only to find yisselda save her and take her back to the kamarg there to satisfy himself that the province still stood against the dark empire but his life was complicated by this strange mystery of the runestaff and some destiny he must work out that fitted with the runestaffs scheme yet the runestaff was a thing not an intel ligence or was it an intelligence it was the greatest power one could call upon when oath making it was believed to control all human history why then he wondered should it need servants if in effect all men served it but perhaps not all men did perhaps there emerged forces from time to timelike the dark empirethat were opposed to the runestaffs scheme for human destiny then perhaps the runestaff needed servants hawkmoon became confused his was not the head for profundity of that sort nor speculative philoso phy not much later he fell asleep chapter two the mad gods castle for two days they rode until they came to the throbbing bridge which spanned a stretch of sea that ran between two high cliffs some miles apart the throbbing bridge was an astonishing sight for it did not seem made of any kind of solid sub stance at all but of a vast number of crisscrossed beams of colored light that seemed somehow to have been plaited gold and shining blue were there and bright gleaming scarlet and green and pulsing yellow all the bridge throbbed like some living organ and below the sea foamed on sharp rocks what is it hawkmoon asked the warrior in jet and gold surely no natural thing an ancient artifact said the warrior wrought by a forgotten science and a forgotten race who sprang up sometime between the fall of the death rain and the rise of the princedoms who they were and how they were brought into being and died we do not know surely you know daverc said cheerfully you disappoint me i had judged you omniscient the warrior in jet and gold made no reply the light from the throbbing bridge was reflected on their skins and armor staining them a variety of hues the horses began to prance and became difficult to control as they directed them closer to the great bridge of light hawkmoons horse bucked and snorted and he tightened its reins forcing it forward at last its hooves touched the throbbing light of the bridge and it became calmer as it realized that the bridge would actually bear its weight the warrior in jet and gold was already crossing the bridge his whole body seeming to be ablaze with a multicolored aura and hawkmoon too saw the strange light creep around the body of his horse and then immerse him in a weird radiance looking back he saw daverc and oladahn shining like beings from another star as they moved slowly over the bridge of throbbing light below faintly seen through the crisscross of beams were the gray sea and the foamencircled rocks and in hawkmoons ears there grew a hum ming sound that was musical and pleasant yet seemed to set his whole frame vibrating gently in time with the bridge itself at length they were across and hawkmoon felt fresh as if he had had several days rest he mentioned this to the warrior in jet and gold who said aye thats another property of the throbbing bridge im told then they rode on with only land now between them and the mad gods lair on the third day of their journey it had begun to rain a fine drizzle that chilled them and lowered their spirits their horses plodded across the vast sodden ukranian plains and it seemed that there was no end to the gray world on the sixth day of their journey the warrior in jet and gold raised his head and brought his horse to a halt signaling for the other three to stop he ap peared to be listening soon hawkmoon heard the sound toothe drum ming of horses hooves then breasting a slight rise to their left came some score of riders in sheepskin hats and cloaks long spears and sabers on their backs they seemed in a panic and not noticing the four onlookers they rode past at fantastic speed lashing the rumps of their steeds until blood flew in the air what is it hawkmoon called what do you flee from one of the riders turned in his saddle not lessening his speed dark empire army he called and dashed on hawkmoon frowned should we continue in this direction he asked the warrior or should we find another route no route is safe replied the warrior in jet and gold we might just as well take this one within half an hour they saw smoke in the distance it was thick oily smoke that crept close to the ground and it stank hawkmoon knew what the smoke signified but said nothing until later they came to the town that was burning and saw piled in the square a huge pyramid of corpses every one naked men women children and animals heaped indiscrim inately upon one another and burning it was this pyre of flesh that gave off the evil smelling smoke and there was only one race hawk moon knew of who would indulge in such an act as this the riders had been right dark empire soldiers were nearby there were signs that a whole battalion of troops had taken the town and razed it they skirted around the town for there was noth ing they could do and in even more sober spirits con tinued on their journey wary now for any sign of granbretanian troops oladahn who had not witnessed so many of the dark empires atrocities was the one most visibly moved by the sight they had witnessed surely he said ordinary mortals could not could not they do not regard themselves as ordinary mor tals daverc said they regard themselves as demi gods and their rulers as gods it excuses their every immoral action in their eyes hawkmoon said and besides they love to wreak destruction spread terror torture and kill just as in some beasts like the wolverine the urge to kill is stronger even than the urge to live so it is with those of the dark empire the island has bred a race of madmen whose every thought and action is alien to those not born on granbretan the depressing drizzle continued to fall as they left the town and its blazing pyramid behind it is not far now to the mad gods castle said the warrior in jet and gold by the next morning they had come to a wide shallow valley and a small lake on which a gray mist moved beyond the lake they saw a black gloomy shape a building of roughhewn stone that lay on the far side of the water about midway between the castle and themselves they could see a collection of rotting hovels clustered on the shore and a few boats drawn up nearby nets had been hung out to dry but there was no sign of the fishers who used them the whole day was dark cold and oppressive and there was an ominous atmosphere about lake village and castle the three men followed reluctantly behind the warrior in jet and gold as he made his way around the shore toward the castle what of this mad gods cult oladahn whis pered how many men does he command and are they as ferocious as those we fought on the ship does the warrior underestimate their strength or overesti mate our prowess hawkmoon shrugged his only thought for yis selda he scanned the great black castle wondering where she was imprisoned as they came to the fisherfolks village they saw why it was so silent every last villager had been slain hacked down by swords or axes some of the blades were still buried in skulls of men and women alike the dark empire said hawkmoon but the warrior in jet and gold shook his head not their work not their weapons not their way then what murmured oladahn shivering the cult the warrior did not answer instead he reined in his horse and dismounted walking heavily toward the nearest corpse the others dismounted also looking warily about them the mist from the lake curled around them like some malign force that sought to trap them the warrior pointed at the corpse all these were members of the cult some served by fishing to pro vide the castle with its food others lived in the castle itself some of these are from the castle they have been fighting among themselves daverc suggested in a sense perhaps replied the warrior how do you mean hawkmoon began but then whirled as a chilling shriek came from behind the hovels all drew their weapons standing in a hollow circle prepared for an attack from any side but when the attack did come the nature of the attackers caused hawkmoon to lower his sword mo mentarily in astonishment they came running between the houses swords and axes raised they were dressed in breastplates and kilts of leather and a ferocious light burned in their eyes their lips were drawn back in bestial snarls their white teeth gleamed and foam flecked their mouths but this was not what astonished hawkmoon and his companions it was their sex that caught them by surprise for all the maniacally shrieking warriors rush ing at them were women of incredible beauty as he slowly recovered his defensive stance hawk moon desperately sought among the faces for that of yisselda and was relieved that he did not find it so this is why the mad god demanded women be sent to him daverc gasped but why he is a perverse god i understand said the war rior in jet and gold as he brought up his blade to meet the attack of the first warrior woman though he defended himself desperately against the blades of the madfaced women hawkmoon found it impossible to counterattack they left many openings for his sword and he could have slain several but every time he had the opportunity to strike he held back and it seemed to be the same with his com panions in a moments respite he glanced around him and an idea came retreat slowly he said to his friends follow me ive a plan to make this our victoryand a blood less one gradually the four fell back until they were stopped by the poles on which the stout nets of the fishermen had been hung out to dry hawkmoon stepped around the first and seized one end of the net still battling oladahn guessed his scheme and grabbed the other end then hawkmoon cried now and they flung the thing out over the heads of the women the net settled over most of them entangling them but some slashed free and came on now daverc and the warrior in jet and gold had understood hawkmoons intention and they too flung a net to trap those who had escaped hawkmoon and oladahn hurled a third net over the group they had originally ensnared eventually the women were completely trapped in the folds of several strong nets and the companions were able to approach them gin gerly grabbing at their weapons and gradually dis arming them hawkmoon panted as he raised a sword and flung it into the lake perhaps the mad god is not so insane train women to fight and theyll always have a certain momentary advantage over male soldiers doubtless this was part of some larger scheme you mean his raising money by piracy was to finance a conquering army of women oladahn said joining him in hurling weapons into the water while the struggles of the women subsided behind them it seems likely daverc agreed watching them work but why did the women kill the others that we may find out when we reach the castle said the warrior in jet and gold we he broke off as part of one of the nets burst and a howling warrior woman came rushing at them fingers out stretched like claws daverc seized her encircling her waist with his arms as she kicked and shrieked oladahn stepped up reversed his sword and struck her on the base of the skull with the pommel much as it offends my sense of chivalry daverc said lowering the prone girl to the ground i think that you have presented the best scheme for dealing with these pretty murderesses oladahn and he crossed to the nets to begin languidly and system atically knocking out the struggling women fighters at least he said we have not killed themand they have not killed us an excellent equilibrium i wonder if they are the only ones hawkmoon said broodingly you are thinking of yisselda oladahn asked aye im thinking of yisselda come hawkmoon swung into his saddle lets to the mad gods castle he began to gallop rapidly along the beach toward the great black pile the others were slower in follow ing straggling behind him first came oladahn then the warrior in jet and gold and finally huillam daverc at a leisurely canter looking for all the world like a carefree youth out for a morning ride the castle came closer and hawkmoon slowed his mad dash hauling on his horses reins and bringing it to a skidding halt as they reached the drawbridge within the castle all was quiet a little mist curled about its towers the drawbridge was down and on it lay the corpses of the guards somewhere from the tops of one of the highest towers a raven squawked and flapped away over the water of the lake no sun shone through those gray clouds it was as if no sun had ever shone here as if no sun ever would shine it was as if they had left the world for some other plane where hopelessness and death prevailed throughout eternity the dark entrance to the castle courtyard gaped at hawkmoon the mist formed grotesque shapes and there was an oppressive silence everywhere hawkmoon took a deep breath of the chill damp air drew his blade kicked at the flanks of his horse and charged across the drawbridge leaping the corpses to enter the mad gods lair chapter three hawkmoons dilemma the great courtyard of the castle was clogged with bodies some were of the warrior women but most were of men wearing the collar of the mad god dried blood caked the cobbles not occupied by corpses in the grotesque attitudes of death hawkmoons horse snorted in fear as the stench of decaying flesh filled its nostrils but he urged it on dreading that he would see yisseldas face among the dead he dismounted turning over stiff bodies of women peering at them closely but none was yisselda the warrior in jet and gold entered the court yard oladahn and daverc behind him she is not here said the warrior she is alivewithin hawkmoons bleak face rose his hand trembled as it took the bridle of his horse hashas he done ought to her warrior that you must see for yourself duke dorian the warrior in jet and gold pointed at the castles main doorway through there lies the court of the mad god a short passage leads to the main hall and there he sits awaiting you he knows of me he knows that one day the red amulets rightful wearer must arrive to claim what is his i care nothing for the amulet only for yisselda where is she warrior within she is within go claim both your rights your woman and your amulet both are important in the runestaffs scheme hawkmoon turned and ran for the doorway dis appearing into the darkness of the castle the interior of the castle was incredibly chill cold water dripped from the roof of the passage and moss grew on the walls blade in hand hawkmoon crept along it halfexpecting an attack but none came he reached a large wooden door stretching twenty feet above his head and paused from behind the door came a strange rumbling sound a deepvoiced murmuring that seemed to fill the hall beyond cautiously hawkmoon pushed against the door and it yielded he put his head through the gap and peered in upon a bizarre scene the hall was of strangely distorted proportions in some parts the ceilings were very low in others they soared upward for fifty feet there were no windows and the light came from brands stuck at random in the walls in the center of the hall on a floor on which one or two corpses lay as they had been cut down earlier was a great chair of black wood studded with inlaid plaques of brass in front of this swinging from a part of the ceiling that was relatively low was a large cage such as would be used for a tame bird save that this was much bigger in it hawkmoon saw huddled a human figure otherwise the weird hall was deserted and hawk moon entered creeping across the floor toward the cage it was from this he realized that the distressed muttering sound was coming yet it seemed impossible for the noise was so great hawkmoon decided that it was because the sound was amplified by the peculiar acoustics of the hall he reached the cage and could see the huddled figure only dimly for the light was poor who are you hawkmoon asked a prisoner of the mad god the moaning ceased and the figure stirred from it then came a deep echoing melancholy voice aye you could say so the unhappiest prisoner of all now hawkmoon could make out the creature better it had a long stringy neck and its body was tall and very thin its head was covered in long straggling gray hair that was matted with filth and it had a pointed beard also filthy that jutted from its chin for about a foot its nose was large and aquiline and its deepset eyes held the light of a melancholy madness can i save you hawkmoon said can i prise apart the bars the figure shrugged the door of the cage is not locked bars are not my prison i have been trapped within my groaning skull ah pity me who are you i was once known as stalnikov of the great family of stalnikov and the mad god usurped you aye usurped me aye exactly the prisoner in the unlocked cage turned his huge sad head to stare at hawkmoon who are you i am dorian hawkmoon duke of koln a german koln was once part of the country called ger mania i have a fear of germans stalnikov slid back in the cage farther away from hawkmoon you need not fear me no stalnikov chuckled and the mad sound filled the hall no he reached into his jerkin and pulled something forth that was attached to a thong about his neck the thing glowed with a deep red light like a huge ruby illuminated from within and hawkmoon saw that it bore the sign of the runestaff no then you are not the german who has come to steal my power hawkmoon gasped the red amulet how did you obtain it why said stalnikov rising and grinning horribly at hawkmoon i obtained it thirty years ago from the corpse of a warrior my retainers set upon and slew as he rode this way he fondled the amulet and its light struck hawkmoon in the eyes so that he could barely see this is the mad god this is the source of my madness and my power this is what imprisons me you are the mad god where is my yisselda yisselda the girl the new girl with the blonde hair and the white soft skin why do you ask she is mine you do not want the amulet i want yisselda the mad god laughed and his laughter filled the hall and reverberated through every cranny of the distorted place then you shall have her german he clapped his clawlike hands his whole body moving like a looselimbed puppets the cage swing ing wildly yisselda my girl yisselda come forth to serve your master from the depths of one part of the hall where the ceiling almost touched the floor a girl emerged hawkmoon saw her outlined but could not be fully sure it was yisselda he sheathed his sword and moved forward yes the movements the stancethey were yisseldas a smile of relief began to form on his lips as he stretched out his arms to embrace her then there came a wild animal shriek and the girl rushed at him metaltaloned fingers reaching for his eyes face distorted with bloodlust every part of her body enclosed on a garment studded with outward jutting spikes kill him pretty yisselda chuckled the mad god kill him my flower and we shall reward you with his offal hawkmoon put up his hands to fend off the claws and the back of one of them was slashed badly he backed away hastily yisselda noit is your be trothed dorian but the mad eyes showed no sign of recognition and the mouth slavered as the girl slashed again with the talons of metal hawkmoon leaped away plead ing with his eyes that she might recognize him yisselda the mad god chuckled grasping the bars of his cage and looking on eagerly slay him my chicken rip his throat hawkmoon was almost weeping now as he leaped this way and that to avoid yisseldas gleaming talons he called to stalnikov what power is it she obeys that conquers her love for me she obeys the power of the mad god as i obey it stalnikov answered the red amulet makes all its slaves only in the hands of an evil creature hawkmoon flung himself aside as yisseldas talons ripped at him he scrambled up and darted toward the cage it turns all who wear it evil stalnikov replied chuckling as yisseldas claws ripped at hawkmoons sleeve all all but a servant of the runestaff the voice came from the entrance to the hall and it belonged to the warrior in jet and gold it was sonorous and grave help me said hawkmoon i cannot said the warrior in jet and gold stand ing motionless his huge blade point down on the floor before him his gauntleted hands resting on the pommel now hawkmoon stumbled and felt yisseldas claws digging into his back he lifted his hands to grab her wrists and yelled in pain as the spikes sank into his palms but he managed to free himself of the talons and fling her away and dash for the cage where the mad god gibbered in delight hawkmoon leaped for the bars kicking at stalnikov as he did so the cage swung erratically and began to spin yisselda danced below trying to reach him with her talons stalnikov had withdrawn to the opposite side of the cage his mad eyes now full of terror and hawkmoon managed to drag open the door and fling himself in pulling it shut behind him outside yisselda howled in frustrated bloodlust the light from the amulet turning her eyes scarlet now hawkmoon wept openly as he darted a glance at the woman he loved then he turned his hatefilled face on the mad god stalnikovs deep voice still mournful reverberated through the hall he fingered the amulet directing its light into hawkmoons eyes back mortal obey meobey the power of the amulet hawkmoon blinked feeling suddenly weak his eyes became fixed on the glowing amulet and he paused feeling the power of the thing engulf him now said stalnikov now you will deliver yourself up to your destroyer but hawkmoon rallied all his determination and took a step forward the mad gods bearded chin dropped in astonishment i command you in the name of the red amulet from the doorway came the sonorous voice of the warrior in jet and gold he is the one whom the amulet cannot control the only one he is the right ful wearer stalnikov trembled and began to edge around the cage as hawkmoon still weak moved determinedly on back screamed the mad god leave the cage below yisseldas taloned fingers had grasped the bars and she was hauling her metal studded body up her eyes still fixed murderously on hawkmoons throat back this time stalnikovs voice lost some of its force and confidence he reached the door of the cage and kicked it open yisselda her white teeth bared her beautiful face twisted in terrifying madness had hauled herself up now so that she clung to the outside of the cage the mad gods back was toward her the red amulet directed still into hawkmoons eyes yisseldas claw darted out slashing at the back of stalnikovs head he screamed and leaped to the floor now yisselda saw hawkmoon again and made to enter the cage hawkmoon knew there was no time to try to reason with his maddened betrothed he gathered all his strength and dived past her slashing claw to land on the uneven flagstones of the floor and lie there for a moment winded painfully he picked himself up as yisselda too leaped groundward the mad god had scrambled to the great seat opposite the cage climbing up its back to perch there the red amulet dangling from his neck casting its strange light again on hawkmoons face blood streamed down his shoulders from the wound yissel das clawed hands had inflicted stalnikov gibbered in terror as hawkmoon reached the seat and climbed up onto its arm i beg you leave me ill do you no harm youve done me much harm already hawkmoon said grimly drawing his blade much harm enough to make revenge taste very sweet mad god stalnikov crept as high as he could he shouted at the girl yisseldastop resume your former char acter i command you by the power of the red amulet hawkmoon turned and saw that yisselda had paused looking bemused her lips parted in horror as she stared at the things on her hands the metal spikes that covered her body what has happened what has been done to me you were hypnotized by this monster here hawkmoon rasped waving his sword in the cringing stalnikovs direction but i will avenge the wrongs he has done you no stalnikov screamed it is not fair yisselda burst into tears stalnikov looked this way and that where are my minionswhere my warriors you made them destroy one another for your own perverted sport hawkmoon told him and those not slain we captured my army of women i wanted beauty to conquer all ukrania get me back the stalnikov inherit ance that inheritance is here said hawkmoon rais ing his sword stalnikov leaped from the back of the chair and began to run toward the door but swerved aside as he saw that it was blocked by the warrior in jet and gold he scuttled into the darkness of the hall into a cranny where he disappeared from sight hawkmoon got down from the chair and turned to look at yisselda who lay in a heap on the floor weep ing he went to her and gently removed the blood stained talons from her slim soft fingers she looked up oh dorian how did you find me oh my love thank the runestaff said the voice of the war rior in jet and gold hawkmoon turned laughing in relief you are persistent in your claims at least warrior the warrior in jet and gold said nothing but stood like a statue faceless and tall by the doorway hawkmoon found the fastenings of the grim spiked suit and began to strip it off the girl find the mad god said the warrior remem ber the red amulet is yours it will give you power hawkmoon frowned and turn me mad per haps no fool it is yours by right hawkmoon paused impressed by the warriors tone yisselda touched his hand i can do the rest she said hawkmoon hefted his sword and peered into the darkness wherein stalnikov the mad god had dis appeared stalnikov somewhere in the deepest recesses of the hall a tiny spot of red light gleamed hawkmoon ducked his head and entered the alcove he heard a sobbing sound it filled his ears closer and closer crept hawkmoon to the source of the red brilliance greater and greater became the sound of the strange weeping then at last the red glow burned very bright and by its light he saw the wearer of the amulet standing against a wall of rough hewn stone a sword in his hand for thirty years i have waited for you german stalnikov said suddenly his voice calming i knew you must come to ruin my plans to destroy my ideals to demolish all i have worked for yet i hoped to avert the threat perhaps i still can with a great scream he raised the sword and swung it at hawkmoon hawkmoon blocked the blow easily turned the blade so that it spun from the mad gods grasp brought his own sword forward so that it was pre sented at stalnikovs heart for a moment hawkmoon looked gravely and broodingly at the frightened madman the light from the red amulet stained both their faces scarlet stalnikov cleared his throat as if to plead then his shoulders sagged hawkmoon drove the point of his blade into the mad gods heart then he turned on his heel and left both corpse and red amulet where they lay chapter four the power of the amulet hawkmoon drew his cloak about yisseldas naked shoulders the girl was shivering sobbing with re action mixed with joy at seeing hawkmoon nearby stood the warrior in jet and gold still motionless while hawkmoon embraced yisselda the warrior began to move his huge body crossing the hall and entering the darkness where lay the body of stalnikov the mad god oh dorian i cannot tell you the horrors i have been through these past months captured by this group and that traveling for hundreds of miles i do not even know where this hellish place is i have no memory of recent days save for a faint remembrance of some nightmare where i struggled with myself against a desire to slay you hawkmoon hugged her to him a nightmare was all it was come we will leave we will return to the kamarg and safety tell me what has become of your father and the others her eyes widened did you not know i had thought you returned there first before coming to seek me i have heard nothing but rumors how are bow gentle von villach count brass she lowered her gaze von villach was killed by a flamelance in a battle with dark empire troops on the northern borders count brass what is it when i last saw him my father lay on a sickbed and even bowgentles healing powers seemed incap able of raising him to health it is as if he had lost all feelingsas if he no longer wished to live he said the kamarg must soon fallhe believed you dead when you did not return in the time necessary to have told him you were safe hawkmoons eyes blazed i must get back to the kamarg posthasteif only to give count brass the will again to live with you gone he can barely have sustained any kind of energy if he lives at all she said softly not wanting to admit the possibility he must live if the kamarg still stands then count brass lives from the passage beyond the hall came the sound of running booted feet hawkmoon pushed yisselda behind him and again drew his great battle blade the door was flung open and oladahn stood there panting daverc not far behind dark empire warriors oladahn said more of them than we could fight they must be exploring the castle and surrounds for survivors and booty daverc pushed past the little beastman i tried to reason with themclaimed that i had the right to command them being of greater rank than their leader buthe shruggedit seems daverc has no rank in the legions of granbretan any more the damned pilot of the ornithopter lived long enough to tell a search party of my clumsiness in letting you escape i am as much an outlaw now as you hawkmoon frowned come in both and bar that great door it should hold them if they attack is it the only exit daverc asked appraising the door i think so hawkmoon said but we must worry about that score later from the shadows the warrior in jet and gold reemerged in one gloved hand the red amulet dangled from its cord the cord was stained with blood the warrior handled it gingerly not touching the stone itself and stretched it out toward hawkmoon as daverc and oladahn hurried to swing the door shut and bar it here said the warrior in jet and gold it is yours hawkmoon recoiled i do not want itwill not have it it is an evil thing it has caused many to die others to go madeven that poor creature stalnikov was its victim keep it find another fool enough to wear it you must wear it came the voice from the helm only you may wear it i will not hawkmoon swept out his hand to point to yisselda that thing drove this gentle girl to become a slavering killing beast all those we saw in the fisherfolks villageall slain by the power of the red amulet all those who came against usturned insane by its power all those who died in the court yarddestroyed by the red amulet he struck the thing from the warriors hand i will not take it if that is what the runestaff creates i will have no part of it it is what menfools like yourselfdo with it that makes it corrupt in its influence the warrior in jet and gold said his voice still grave and impassive it is your dutyas the runestaffs chosen servantto take the gift it will not harm you it will bring you nothing but power power to destroy and turn men mad power to do goodpower to fight the hordes of the dark empire hawkmoon sneered there came a great crash on the door and he knew that the warriors of gran bretan had found them we are outnumbered said hawkmoon will the red amulet give us the power to escape them when there is only one way out through yonder door it will help you said the warrior in jet and gold leaning down to retrieve the fallen amulet again picking it up by its string the door creaked under the pressure of the blows from those on the other side if the red amulet can do so much good hawk moon said why do you not touch it yourself it is not mine to touch it could do to me what it did to the miserable stalnikov the warrior moved forward here take it it is why you came here it is because of yisselda i came hereto rescue her i have done that it is why she came here so it was a trick to lure me no it was part of the pattern but you say you came to save her and yet you refuse the means of escaping with her safely from this castle once those warriors break in a score or more of fierce fighters they will destroy you all and yisseldas fate might be worse than yours now the door was splitting oladahn and daverc backed away swords ready a look of quiet despera tion in their eyes another moment and they will be in here said daverc farewell oladahnand you too hawk moon you were less boring companions than some hawkmoon eyed the amulet i do not know trust my word said the warrior in jet and gold i have saved you in the past would i have done so merely to destroy you now destroy me nobut this will put me in some evil power how do i know you are a messenger for the runestaff i have only your word that i serve it and not some darker cause the door is breaking down oladahn yelled duke dorian well need your aid let the warrior escape with yisselda if he can quick said the warrior extending the amulet again to hawkmoon take it and save the maid at least for an instant hawkmoon hesitated then he ac cepted the thing it settled into his hand like a pet in the hand of its masterbut an exceedingly powerful pet its red light seemed to grow in intensity until it appeared to flood the great grotesquely proportioned chamber hawkmoon felt the power flood into him his whole body became full of a great sense of well being when he moved it was with great speed his brain seemed no longer clouded by the events of the past day he smiled and placed the bloodstained thong about his neck bent to kiss yisselda once and felt a delicious sensation rush through him turned sword ready to face the howling horde that had by now all but demolished the great door then the door fell inward and there stood crouched the panting dogs of granbretan tiger masks gleaming with enameled metal and semiprecious jewels weapons poised to butcher the patheticseem ing little group that awaited them the leader stepped forward so much exercise for so few brothers well make them pay for our efforts and then the killing began chapter five the slaughter in the hall oh by the runestaff murmured hawkmoon thickly the power in me then he sprang forward great battle blade howling through the air to snap the enmetaled neck of the leading warrior slash backhanded at the man to his left and send him reeling swing around and cut through the armor of the man to his right suddenly there were blood and twisted metal every where the light from the amulet spread scarlet shadows across the masked faces of the warriors as hawkmoon led his comrades forward in an attack the last thing the dark empire soldiers had expected but the amulets light dazzled them and they lifted armorclumsy arms to shield their eyes weapons held defensively bewildered by the speed with which hawkmoon oladahn and daverc moved against them following the other three came the warrior in jet and gold his own huge broadsword whistling in a circle of steel death all his movements apparently effortless there were a clattering and a shouting from the men of granbretan as with yisselda behind them at all times the four drove them into the hall hawkmoon was attacked by some six swearing axmen who tried to press in against him and stop him from wielding his deadly sword but the young duke of koln kicked out at one elbowed another aside and brought his blade straight down into the mask helmet of another splitting both helm and skull so that brains oozed through the fissure when hed tugged his sword free the sword became rapidly blunted with so much work until at last he was using it more as an ax than anything else he wrenched a fresh sword from the hand of one of his attackers but kept his own with the new sword he thrust with the old he hacked ah whispered hawkmoon the red amulet is worth its price it swung at his neck turning his sweating vengeful face into a red demons mask now the last of the warriors tried to flee for the door but the warrior in jet and gold and daverc blocked them hacking them down as they tried to burst past somewhere hawkmoon caught a glimpse of yis selda her face was buried in her hands as she refused to witness the red ruin hawkmoon and his friends had created oh it is sweet to slay these carrion hawkmoon said do not refuse to look yisselda this is our triumph but the girl did not look up in many parts of the hall the floors were heaped with the twisted corpses of the slaughtered hawk moon panted seeking more to slay but there were none left he dropped the borrowed blade sheathed his own the battle lust leaving him completely he frowned down at the red amulet raising it up to regard it more closely studying the simple motif of a runecarved staff that had been cut from it so he murmured your first help is in aiding me to kill im grateful but i wonder still if youre not a force more for evil than for good the light from the runestaff flickered and began to fade hawkmoon looked up at the warrior in jet and gold the amulets dulledwhat means that nothing said the warrior it draws its power from a great distance off and cannot sustain it at all times it will grow bright again eventually he paused cocking his head toward the passage i hear more footstepsthe warriors were not the whole force then let us go to meet them daverc said with a low bow waving hawkmoon before him after you my friend you seem best equipped to be first no said the warrior i will go the amulets power has faded for the while come warily they passed through the smashed door hawkmoon last with yisselda she looked up at him then her eyes steady i am glad you killed them she said though i hate to see death come so grace lessly they live without grace hawkmoon said softly and they deserve to die without grace it is the only way to treat those who serve the dark empire now we must face more of them be brave my love for we face now our greatest danger ahead the warrior in jet and gold had already engaged the first of the fresh force of fighters and was flinging the weight of his great metalencased body against them so that they stumbled back in the nar row confines of the passage unnerved as much as anything because not one of their opponents seemed hurt by them and because some five and twenty of their comrades appeared to have met their death within the dark empire soldiers broke out into the corpsestrewn courtyard shouting and trying to rally themselves all four who came against them were covered in partly dried blood and brains and made a terrifying sight as they entered the daylight the gray rain was still falling and the air was still chill but it revived hawkmoon and the others and their recent victory had made them feel invincible hawkmoon daverc and oladahn grinned like wolves at their foesgrinned with such complacency too that the dark empire warriors hesitated before attacking though they greatly outnumbered hawk moon and his companions the warrior in jet and gold raised a pointing finger to the drawbridge be gone he said in deep grave tones or we shall destroy you as we destroyed your brothers hawkmoon wondered if the warrior were bluffing or if that mysterious entity honestly believed they could beat so many without the power of the red amulet to aid them but before he could decide another group of war riors came rushing over the drawbridge they had retrieved weapons from the hands and bodies of corpses and they were enraged the mad gods warrior women had escaped from the nets show them the amulet the warrior in jet and gold whispered to hawkmoon that is what they are used to obeying it is that which bemused them in the first place not the mad god but its light has faded hawkmoon protested no matter show them the amulet hawkmoon swept the red amulet from his neck and held it up before the howling women stay in the name of the red amulet i command you to attack not usbut these and he pointed at the wavering dark empire warriors come i will lead you hawkmoon sprang forward his blunted sword sweeping out to slash the foremost warrior and slay him before he realized it the women easily outnumbered the dark empire force and they worked with a will at their destruc tion so well that daverc called let them finish we can escape now hawkmoon shrugged this is surely but one pack of dark empire hounds there must be many more about for its not their way to spread too far from the mass of their brothers follow me said the warrior in jet and gold time i think to unloose the mad gods beasts chapter six the mad gods beasts the warrior in jet and gold led them to a section of the courtyard where a pair of great iron trapdoors had been let into the cobblestones they were forced to drag aside corpses before they could grasp the huge brass rings and heave the doors back the doors clanged on the stones to reveal a long stone ramp that led down into gloom from within came a warm smell that was at once familiar and unfamiliar to hawkmoon and made him hesitate at the top of the ramp for he was sure that the scent meant danger do not be afraid said the warrior firmly pro ceed there lies your method of escaping this place slowly hawkmoon began to descend the others following him the light that came thinly from above showed him a long room with a large object at the far end he could not decide what it was and was about to investi gate it when the warrior in jet and gold said from behind him not now first the beasts they are in their stalls hawkmoon realized that the long room was in fact some sort of stable with stalls on either side now from some of them came stirring sounds and animal grunts and all at once a door shuddered as a huge bulk was flung against it not horses said oladahn nor bullocks to me duke dorian they have the smell of cats aye thats so hawkmoon nodded fingering the pommel of his sword catsthats the scent how can cats aid our escape daverc had taken a brand from the wall and was striking a flint to ignite his tinder shortly the brand flamed and hawkmoon saw that the object at the far end of the stable was a vast chariot large enough to accommodate more than their number its double shafts had space for four animals open the stalls said the warrior in jet and gold and harness the cats to the yokes hawkmoon wheeled harness cats to the chariot certainly a whim fit for a mad godbut we are sane mortals warrior besides those cats are wild by the sound of their movements if we open the stalls theyre bound to fall upon us as if in confirmation there came a great yowling roar from one of the stalls and this was taken up by the other beasts until the stables echoed with the bestial din and it was impossible to make oneself heard over it when it had begun to subside hawkmoon shrugged and stepped toward the ramp well find horses above and take our chances with more familiar steeds than these have you not yet learned to trust my wisdom said the warrior did i not speak truth about the red amulet and the rest i have still to test that truth fully hawkmoon said those mad women obeyed the power of the amulet did they not they did hawkmoon agreed the mad gods beasts are trained likewise to obey he who is master of the red amulet what would i gain dorian hawkmoon from lying to you hawkmoon shrugged i have grown suspicious of all since i first encountered the dark empire i do not know if you have anything to gain or not how everhe walked towards the nearest stall and laid his hands on the heavy wooden barim tired of bicker ing and will test your assurances as he flung off the bar the stable door was swept back from within by a giant paw then a head emerged larger than an oxens fiercer than a tigers a snarling cats head with slanting yellow eyes and long yellow fangs as it padded out a deep growling sound coming from its belly its glaring eyes regarding them calculatingly they saw that its back was lined with a row of foothigh spines of the same color and appearance as its fangs running down to the base of its tail which unlike that of an ordinary cat was tipped with barbs a legend come to life gasped daverc losing his detached manner for a moment one of the mutant war jaguars of asiacommunista an old bestiary i saw pictured them said that if they had existed at all then it was a thousand years ago that because they were the products of some perverted biological experiment they could not breed so they cannot said the warrior in jet and gold but their lifespan is all but infinite the huge head now swung toward hawkmoon and the barbed tail swished back and forth the eyes fixing on the amulet at hawkmoons throat tell it to lie down said the warrior lie down commanded hawkmoon and almost at once the beast settled to the floor its mouth closing its eyes losing some of their fierceness hawkmoon smiled i apologize warrior very well lets loose the other three oladahn daverc his friends went forward to take out the bars of the remaining stalls and hawkmoon put his arm around yisseldas shoulders that chariot he said will bear us home my love then he remembered something warrior my saddlebagsstill on my horse unless those dogs have stolen them wait here said the warrior turning and begin ning to ascend the ramp i will look i will look myself hawkmoon said i know the no said the warrior i will go hawkmoon felt a vague suspicion why only you with the amulet have the power of controlling the mad gods beasts if you were not here they could turn on the others and destroy them reluctantly hawkmoon stepped back and watched the warrior in jet and gold move with heavy pur posefulness to the top of the ramp and disappear out of their stalls now prowled three more horned cats similar to the first oladahn cleared his throat nervously best remind them that it is you they obey he said to hawkmoon lie down hawkmoon commanded and slowly the beasts obeyed he went up to the nearest and laid a hand on its thick neck feeling the wiry bristling fur the hard muscle beneath it the beasts were the height of horses but considerably bulkier and infinitely more deadly they had not been bred to pull car riages that was plain but to kill in battle move that chariot up he said and lets harness these creatures daverc and oladahn dragged the chariot forward it was of black brass and green gold and smelled of antiquity only the leather of the yokes was relatively new they slipped the harness over the heads and shoulders of the beasts and the mutant jaguars hardly moved save for flattening their ears occasionally when the men tightened the straps too rapidly when all was ready hawkmoon signed to yis selda to enter the chariot we must wait for the warrior to return he said then we may set off where is he daverc asked gone to find my gear hawkmoon explained daverc shrugged and lowered his great helm over his face it is taking him long enough i for one will be glad when we leave this place behind it stinks of death and evil oladahn pointed upward at the same time drawing his sword is that what you smelled daverc at the top of the ramp stood six or seven more dark empire warriors of the order of the weasel their longsnouted masks almost seeming to tremble in anticipation of killing the men below into the chariot quick hawkmoon ordered as the weasels began to descend in the front of the chariot was a raised block on which the driver could stand and beside it in a rack once used for javelins a longhandled whip hawk moon sprang onto the block seized the whip and cracked it over the heads of the beasts up beauties up the cats climbed to their feet and now forward the chariot jumped forward with a great lurch as the powerful animals dragged it forward up the ramp the weaselmasked warriors screamed as the gigantic horned cats raced toward them some leaped from the ramp but most were too late and went down scream ing crushed by clawed feet and ironrimmed wheels out into the gray daylight the bizarre chariot broke scattering more weasel warriors coming to investigate the open trapdoors where is the warrior hawkmoon cried above the din of howling men where are my saddlebags but the warrior in jet and gold was nowhere to be seen and neither could they locate hawkmoons horse now dark empire swordsmen hurled themselves against the chariot and hawkmoon lashed out at them with his whip while behind him oladahn and daverc held them back with their own blades drive through the gate daverc cried hurry at any moment theyll overwhelm us where is the warrior hawkmoon looked wildly about him doubtless he awaits us outside daverc shouted desperately drive duke dorian or were doomed suddenly hawkmoon saw his horse over the heads of the milling warriors it had been stripped of its saddlebags and he had no way of knowing who had taken them in panic he shouted again where is the warrior in jet and gold i must find him the contents of those saddlebags could mean life or death for the kamarg oladahn gripped his shoulder and said urgently and if you do not drive out of here it means our deathsand maybe worse for yisselda hawkmoon was nearly out of his mind with inde cision but then as oladahns words at last entered his consciousness he gave a great yell and whipped up the beasts sending them springing through the gate and across the drawbridge to gallop along the lake side with what seemed like all the hordes of gran bretan behind them moving far more rapidly than horses could move the mad gods beasts dragged the bouncing chariot over the ground and away from the dark castle and the mistcovered lake away from the village of hovels and the place of corpses into the foothills beyond the lake down a muddy road that led between gloomy cliffs and out onto the wide plains again where the road petered out and the ground became soft but the mutant jaguars had no effort in crossing it if i have a complaint remarked daverc as he clung for dear life to the side of the chariot and was bounced about horribly it is that we are moving a trifle too rapidly oladahn tried to grin through gritted teeth he was crouched in the bottom of the vehicle holding yis selda and trying to protect her from the worst of the bumps hawkmoon made no response he clenched the reins tight in his hands and did not reduce the speed of their flight his face was pale and his eyes blazed with anger for he was sure he had been duped by the man who claimed to be his chief ally against the dark empireduped by the apparently incorruptible war rior in jet and gold chapter seven encounter in a tavern hawkmoon stop for the runestaffs sake stop man are you possessed daverc more troubled than anyone had ever seen him tugged at hawk moons sleeve as the man lashed at the panting beasts the chariot had been moving for hours now had splashed across two rivers without stopping and was now tearing through a forest as night fell at any moment it might strike a tree and kill them all even the powerful horned cats were tiring but hawk moon mercilessly lashed them on hawkmoon you are mad i am betrayed answered hawkmoon betrayed i had the salvation of the kamarg in those saddlebags and the warrior in jet and gold stole them he tricked me gave me a trinket with limited powers in exchange for a machine with powers that were un limited for my purposes on beasts on dorian listen to him you will kill us all yisselda spoke tearfully you will kill yourselfand then how will you aid count brass and the kamarg the chariot leaped into the air and came down with a crash no normal vehicle could have stood such a shock and it jarred the passengers to their bones dorian you have gone mad the warrior would not betray us he has helped us perhaps he was over whelmed by dark empire menthe saddlebags stolen from him noi sensed some betrayal when he left the stables he has gonemy gift from rinal with him but hawkmoons rage and bafflement were begin ning to pass and he no longer whipped at the flanks of the straining beasts gradually the pace of the chariot slowed as the tired beasts no longer goaded by the whip gave in to their instinct to rest daverc took the reins from hawkmoons hands and the young warrior did not resist merely sank to the bottom of the chariot and buried his head in his hands daverc brought the beasts to a halt and they sank at once to the ground panting noisily yisselda stroked hawkmoons hair dorianall the kamarg needs is you to save it i do not know what this other thing was but i am sure we have no use for it and you have the red amulet that will be of some use surely it was night now and moonlight fell through a lattice of tree branches daverc and oladahn dis mounted from the chariot rubbing their bruised bodies and went off to look for wood for a fire hawkmoon looked up the light from the moon struck his pale face and the black jewel imbedded in his forehead he regarded yisselda with melancholy eyes though his lips tried to smile i thank you yisselda for your faith in me but i fear it will need more than dorian hawkmoon to win the fight against all granbretan and the warriors perfidy has made me despair the more there is no proof of perfidy my dear nobut i knew instinctively that he planned to leave us taking the machine with him he sensed my knowledge too i do not doubt he has it and is far away by now i do not necessarily suspect that he takes it for an ignoble purpose possibly his purpose is of greater importance than mine but yet i cannot excuse his actions for that he deceived me he be trayed me if he serves the runestaff he may know more than you may wish to preserve this thing may think it dangerous to you i have no proof he serves the runestaff for all i know he may serve the dark empire and i am their tool you have become oversuspicious my love i have been forced to become so hawkmoon sighed i will be so until granbretan is defeated or i am destroyed and he held her close to him bury ing his weary head in her bosom and slept that way all night in the morning the sun was bright though the air cold hawkmoons gloomy spirits had departed with the deep sleep and they all appeared in a better mood all were ravenous including the mutant beasts whose tongues lolled and whose eyes were greedy and fierce oladahn had fashioned himself a bow and some arrows early and had gone off into the deeper reaches of the forest to seek game daverc coughed theatrically as he polished his huge boarhelm with a piece of cloth he had found in the bottom of the chariot this western air does not do my weak lungs any good he said i would rather be in the east again perhaps in asiacommunista where i have heard a noble civilization exists perhaps such a civilization would appreciate my talents elevate me to some high estate you have given up hope of any reward from the kingemperor hawkmoon asked with a grin the reward ill get is the same hes promised you daverc said mournfully if that damned pilot had not lived and then my being seen fighting with you at the castle no friend hawkmoon i am afraid my ambitions as far as granbretan go are now seen to be somewhat unrealistic oladahn appeared staggering under the weight of two deer one on each shoulder they jumped up to help him two with two shots he said proudly and the arrows were hastily made at that we cannot eat all of one let alone two daverc said the beasts oladahn said they need feeding or ill warrant red amulet or no red amulet theyll feed on us before the days done they quartered the larger deer and flung it to the mutant cats who gulped the meat down swiftly growling softly then they set about making a spit on which to roast the second animal when they were eating at last hawkmoon sighed and smiled they say that good food banishes all care he said but i had not believed it until now i feel a new man that is the first good meal i have eaten in months freshkilled venison eaten in the woods ah the pleasure of it daverc who was wiping his fingers fastidiously and had apparently eaten delicately an enormous amount of meat said i admire health such as yours hawkmoon i wish i had your hearty appetite and i wish i had yours said oladahn laughing for youve eaten enough to last you a week daverc looked at him reproachfully yisselda who was still wrapped only in hawk moons cloak shivered a little and put down the bone on which she had been chewing i wonder said she if we could seek out a town as soon as possible there are things i would purchase hawkmoon looked embarrassed of course yis selda my dear though it will be difficult if dark empire warriors are thick in these parts it would be better to drive on farther south and west toward the kamarg perhaps in carpathia a town can be found we must be almost upon her borders now daverc pointed his thumb to the chariot and the beasts wed get a poor reception arriving at a town in that unearthly thing he said perhaps if one of us went into the nearest settlement but then what would we use for money i have the red amulet hawkmoon said it could be traded fool said daverc suddenly deadly serious and glaring at him that amulet is your lifeand ours our only protection the only means of controlling our beasts there it seems to me that it is not the amu let you hate but the responsibility it implies hawkmoon shrugged maybe perhaps i was a fool to suggest it still i like not the thing i saw what you did noti saw what it had done to a man who had worn it thirty years oladahn interrupted there is no need for this dispute friends for i anticipated our need and while you with great ferocity were finishing off our foes in the mad gods hall duke dorian i dug a few eyes from the dark empire men eyes hawkmoon said in revulsion then re laxed and smiled as he saw oladahn holding up a handful of jewels he had prised from the granbretan ians masks well said daverc we need provisions des perately and the lady yisselda needs some clothing wholl stand least chance of attracting attention if he goes into a town when we get to carpathia hawkmoon gave him a sardonic glance why you of course sir huillam without your dark em pire accessories for i as i am sure you would have pointed out have this damned black jewel to label me and oladahn has his furry face but you are still my prisoner i am aggrieved duke dorian i thought us allies united against a common enemy united by blood by saving each others lives you have not saved mine as i recall not specifically i suppose still and i am not disposed to give you a handful of jewels and set you free hawkmoon continued adding in a more somber tone besides im not in a trusting mood today you would have my word duke dorian daverc said lightly though his eyes seemed to harden slightly hawkmoon frowned he has proved himself our friend in several fights oladahn said softly hawkmoon sighed forgive me daverc very well when we reach carpathia you will buy us what we need daverc began to cough this damnable air it will be the death of me they rode on the horned cats loping at a more gentle pace than the previous days but still making faster speed than any horse they left the great forest by midday and by evening saw in the distance the mountains of carpathia at the same time as yisselda pointed north indicating the tiny figures of riders approaching them theyve seen us oladahn said and seem to be planning to ride at an angle to cut us off hawkmoon flicked his whip over the flanks of the huge beasts drawing the chariot faster he shouted and almost at once the chariot began to gather speed a little later daverc called above the rumble and rattle of the wheels theyre dark empire riders no doubt of that order of the walrus if im not mistaken the kingemperor must be planning a serious invasion of ukrania hawkmoon said theres no other reason for so many bands of dark empire warriors here that means he has almost certainly consolidated all conquests farther west and south save for the kamarg i hope said yisselda the race continued with the horsemen gradually drawing nearer riding as they were at an angle to the chariots course hawkmoon smiled grimly letting the riders think they were catching them ready with your bow oladahn he said heres an opportunity for target practice as the horsemen in grotesque grinning walrus masks of ebony and ivory drew close oladahn nocked arrow to string and let fly a rider fell and a few javelins hurtled toward the chariot but dropped short three more members of the walrus order died from oladahns arrows before they were outdistanced and the jaguars were hauling their burden into the first foothills of the carpathian mountains within two hours it was dark and they decided it was safe to camp three days later they contemplated the rocky side of a mountain and knew that they would have to abandon both beasts and chariot if they were to cross the range at all they would have to travel on foot there was no alternative the terrain had become increasingly difficult for the mutant jaguars and the mountainside ahead was impossible for them to climb dragging the chariot they had tried to find a pass had wasted two days looking for one but there was none meanwhile if they were pursued their pursuers would be almost upon them by now there was no doubt in their minds that hawkmoon had been recog nized as the man whom the kingemperor huon had sworn to destroy therefore dark empire warriors interested in elevating themselves in the eyes of their master would be eager to seek him out so they began to climb stumbling up the steep face of the mountain leaving the unharnessed beasts behind them when they were nearing a ledge that seemed to extend for some distance around the mountain and offer a relatively easy path they heard the rattle of weapons and hooves and saw the same walrusmasked riders who had pursued them on the plain come riding from behind some rocks below their javelins are bound to get us at this range daverc said grimly and theres no cover but hawkmoon smiled thinly there is still one thing he said and raised his voice at them my beastskill them my cats obey me in the name of the amulet the mutant cats turned their baleful eyes on the newcomers who were so jubilant at seeing their victims exposed that they hardly noticed the horned jaguars the leader raised his javelin and the cats leaped yisselda did not look back as the terrified screams filled the air and the bloodcurdling snarls echoed through the quiet mountains as the mad gods beasts first killed and then fed by the next day they had crossed the mountains and come to a green valley with a little red town that was very peaceful daverc looked down at the town and held out his hand to oladahn the jewels if you please friend oladahn by the runestaff i feel naked in just shirt and britches he took the jewels tossed them in his palm winked at hawkmoon and set off for the village they lay in the grass and watched him walk down whistling and enter the street then he disappeared they waited for four hours hawkmoons face began to grow grim and he glanced resentfully at oladahn who pursed his lips and shrugged and then daverc reappeared but he had others with him with a shock hawkmoon realized they were dark empire troops men of the feared order of the wolf baron meliaduss old order had they recognized daverc and captured him but noon the contrary daverc seemed quite friendly with them he waved turned on his heel and began to walk up the hill to where they were hidden a large bundle on his back hawkmoon was puzzled for the wolf masks had gone back into the village allowing daverc to go free he can talk can daverc grinned oladahn he must have convinced them he was an innocent traveler doubtless the dark empire is still using the soft approach in carpathia perhaps said hawkmoon not entirely convinced when daverc came back he flung down his bundle and pulled it open displaying several shirts and a pair of britches as well as a number of dif ferent foodstuffscheeses bread sausages cold meat and the like he handed back most of oladahns jewels to him i purchased them relatively cheaply he said then frowned as he saw hawkmoons expression what is it duke dorian not satisfied i could not get the lady yisselda a gown i regret but the britches and shirt should fit her dark empire men said hawkmoon jerking his thumb at the village you seemed very friendly with them i was worried ill admit daverc said but they seem to be cautious of violence are in carpathia to tell the folk of the benefits of dark empire rule ap parently the king of carpathia is entertaining one of their nobles the usual techniquegold before violence they asked me a few questions but were not unduly suspicious they say theyre warring in shekia have almost subdued that nation but for a key city or two you did not mention us hawkmoon said of course not halfsatisfied hawkmoon relaxed a little daverc picked up the cloth in which hed wrapped his bundle lookfour cloaks with hoods such as the holy men in these parts wear theyll hide our faces well enough i heard theres a larger town about a days walk further south its a town where they trade horses we can get there by tomorrow and buy steeds is it a good idea hawkmoon nodded slowly aye we need horses the town was called zorvanemi and it bustled with folk of all sorts come to sell and to buy horses just outside the main town were the stockyards and here were many kinds of horseflesh from thoroughbreds to plow horses they arrived too late in the evening to buy and they put up at an inn on the edge of town close to the stockyards so that they could buy what they wanted and be away early in the morning here and there they saw small groups of dark empire soldiers but the soldiers paid no attention to the cowled holy men who mingled with the crowd there were several deputations from different monasteries in the area and one more went unnoticed in the warmth of the inns public room they or dered hot wine and food and consulted a map they had bought speaking softly discussing their best route through to southern france a little later the door of the inn was pushed open and the cold night air swept in over the sounds of conversation and occasional laughter they heard the coarse tones of a man yelling for wine for himself and his comrades and suggesting to the landlord that girls should be found for them as well hawkmoon glanced up and was instantly on his guard the men who had entered were soldiers in the order of the boar the order that daverc had be longed to with their squat armored bodies and heavy helmet masks they looked in the halflight exactly like the animals they represented as if so many boars had learned to talk and walk on their hind legs the landlord was plainly nervous clearing his throat several times and asking them what wine they preferred strong wine plentiful wine shouted the leader and the same goes for the women where are your women i hope theyre lovelier than your horses come man be quick weve spent all day buying horseflesh and helping this towns prosperitynow youll do us a favor the boar warriors were evidently here to buy steeds for the dark empire troopsprobably those bent on conquering shekia which lay just across the border hawkmoon yisselda oladahn and daverc drew their cowls surreptitiously about their heads and sipped at their wine without looking up there were three serving wenches in the public room as well as two men and the landlord himself as one passed the boar warrior grabbed her and pressed the snout of his mask against her cheek give an old pig a kiss little girl he roared she wriggled and tried to get free but he held her tight now there was silence everywhere else in the tavern and tension come outside with me the boar leader continued im in a rutting mood oh no please let me go the girl sobbed im to be married next week married eh guffawed the warrior well let me teach you a thing or two for you to teach your hus band the girl screamed and continued to resist no one else in the tavern moved come on the warrior said hoarsely outside i wont wept the girl i wont until im mar ried is that all the boarmasked man laughed well thenill marry you if thats what you want he turned suddenly and glared at the four who sat in the shadows youre holy men arent you one of you can marry us and before hawkmoon and the rest had realized what was happening he had grabbed yisselda who sat on the outside of the bench and hauled her to her feet marry us holy man or by the runestaff what sort of holy man are you yisseldas cowl had fallen back revealing her lovely hair hawkmoon stood up there was nothing for it now but to fight oladahn and daverc stood up as one they drew the swords hidden under their robes as one they launched themselves at the arm ored warriors yelling for the women to flee the boar warriors were drunk and surprised and the three companions were neither it was their only advantage hawkmoons blade slipped between breast plate and gorget of the leader and killed him before he could draw his own sword while oladahns swipe to anothers barely protected legs hamstrung him daverc managed to slice off the hand of one who had stripped off his gauntlets now they fought back and forth across the tavern floor as men and women made hastily for the stairs and doors many to crowd to the gallery above to watch oladahn forsaking normal swordplay in the nar row room had leaped onto the back of a huge op ponent and dirk in hand was trying to stab him through the eyeholes of his mask while the man clum sily tried to dislodge him staggering about halfblind daverc was fencing with a swordsman of some skill who was driving him back steadily toward the stairs while hawkmoon was desperately defending himself against a man with a huge ax that every time it missed him chopped huge chunks out of the wood work hawkmoon hampered by his cloak was trying to get out of it and at the same time duck the blows from the ax he stepped to one side tripped in the folds of the cloak and fell above the axman snorted and raised the ax for the final blow hawkmoon rolled just in time as the ax came down and sheared through the cloth of his gown he leaped up as the man tugged the ax from the hard wood of the floor and swung his sword round to clang against the back of the axmans neck the man groaned and fell dazed to his knees hawkmoon kicked back the mask revealing a red twisted face and stabbed into the gaping mouth driving the sword deep into the throat so that the jugular was cut and blood shot from the helm hawkmoon withdrew his blade and the helm clanged shut nearby oladahn was struggling halfoff his man who had now got a grip on his arm and was tugging him away from his neck hawkmoon jumped forward and with both hands drove his sword into the mans belly piercing armor leather underjerkin and flesh the man screamed and crumpled to the floor to lie there writhing then together oladahn and hawkmoon took davercs man from behind both swords slashing at him until he too lay dead on the floor there was nothing left but to finish off the hand less man who lay propped against a bench weeping and trying to stick his hand back on panting hawkmoon looked about the tavern room at the carnage they had wrought not a bad nights work for holy men he said daverc looked thoughtful maybe he said softly it is time to change our disguise to a more useful one what do you mean there are enough pieces of boar armor here to furnish all four of us particularly since i still have mine i speak the secret language of the order of the boar with luck we could travel disguised as those we fear mostas dark empire men we have been wondering how to get through the countries where granbretan has consolidated her gains wellheres our way hawkmoon thought deeply davercs suggestion was a wild one but it had possibilities particularly since daverc himself knew all the rituals of the or der aye said hawkmoon perhaps youre right daverc we could then travel where the dark em pire forces are thickest and stand a chance of getting to the kamarg faster very well well do it they began stripping the armor from the corpses we can be sure of the landlords and townspeo ples silence said daverc for theyll not want it known that six dark empire warriors were killed here oladahn watched them work nursing his twisted arm a pity he said with a sigh it was an exploit that should be recorded chapter eight the dark empire camp brood of the mountain giants ill stifle to death before weve gone a mile the muffled voice of oladahn came from within the grotesque helmet as he tried to tug himself free of its engulfing weight they sat all four in their room above the tavern try ing on the captured armor hawkmoon too was finding the stuff uncomfort able apart from the fact that it did not fit him prop erly it made him feel distinctly claustrophobic he had worn something like it some time before when disguised in the wolf armor of baron meliaduss order but if anything the boar armor was even heav ier and far less comfortable it must be that much worse for yisselda only daverc was used to it and had donned his own to look with some relish and amusement at their first encounter with the uniform of his order no wonder you claim ill health hawkmoon told him i know of nothing less healthy im tempted to forget the whole plan youll become more used to it as we ride daverc assured him a little chaffing a little stuff iness then youll find youll feel naked without it id rather be naked oladahn protested yanking off the leering boar mask at last it fell with a clatter to the floor careful with it daverc said wagging a finger we dont want to damage any more oladahn gave the helmet an extra kick a day and a night later they were riding deep into shekia there was no doubt that the dark empire had conquered the province for towns and villages were everywhere laid waste crucified corpses hung along every road carrion birds were thick in the air and even thicker on the ground where they feasted the night had been as light as if the sun were per manently on the horizon lit by the funeral pyres of villages farms towns villas and cities and the black hordes of the island empire of granbretan brands in one hand swords in the other rode like demons from hell howling and shrieking across the broken land survivors hid cringing from the four as they rode in disguise through this world of terror galloping as fast as they could for none suspected them they were just one small pack of murderers and looters among many and neither friend nor foe had any suspicion of their real identities now it was morning a morning overcast with black smoke warmed by distant fires a morning of ash covered fields and trampled crops of broken flowers and bloody corpses a morning like any other morning in a land under the heel of granbretan along the churned mud of the road a group of riders came toward them swathed in great canvas night cloaks that covered their bemasked heads as well as their bodies they rode powerful black horses and were hunched in their saddles as if they had been riding for many days as they drew close hawkmoon murmured dark empire men for certain and they seem to be taking an interest in us the leader pushed back his canvas cowl and re vealed a huge boar mask larger and more ornate than even davercs he reined in his black stallion and his men came to a halt behind him silence all three murmured daverc leading them up to the waiting warriors ill speak now from the leader of the boar warriors came a peculiar snorting snuffling and whining voice that must be speaking thought hawkmoon the secret language of the order of the boar he was surprised to hear similar sounds begin to issue from davercs throat the conversation con tinued for some rime daverc pointing back down the road the boar leader jerking his helm mask in the other direction then the leader urged his horse on and he and his men filed past the nervous three and continued on up the road what did he want hawkmoon asked wanted to know if wed seen any livestock theyre a foraging party of some sort out to locate provisions for the camp ahead what camps that a big one he said about four miles further on theyre getting ready to attack one of the last cities still standing against thembradichla i know the place it had beautiful architecture then we are close to osterland yisselda said and beyond osterland lies italia and beyond italia provence home true said daverc your geography is excel lent but we are not home yet and the most dangerous part of the journey has still to be encountered what shall we do about this camp oladahn said skirt it or try to ride through it its a vast camp daverc told him our best chance would be to go through the middle possibly even spend the night in it and try to learn something of the dark empires planswhether they have heard we are nearby for instance hawkmoons muffled voice came from the helmet i am not sure it is not too dangerous he said doubt fully yet if we try to skirt the camp we might arouse suspicion very well we go through it will we not have to remove our masks dorian yisselda asked him no fear of that daverc said the native gran bretanian often sleeps in his mask hates to reveal his face hawkmoon had noticed the weariness in yisseldas voice and knew that they must rest soon it would have to be in the granbretanian camp they had expected the camp to be huge but not as vast as this in the distance beyond it was the walled city of bradichla its spires and facades visible even from here they are remarkably beautiful said daverc with a sigh he shook his head what a pity they must fall tomorrow they were fools to resist this army it is of incredible size said oladahn surely un necessary to defeat that town the dark empire aims at speed of conquest hawkmoon told him i have seen larger armies than this used on smaller cities but the camp covers a great distance and organization will not be perfect i think we can hide here there were canopies tents even huts built here and there cooking fires of all descriptions on which food of all descriptions was being prepared and corrals for horses bullocks and mules slaves hauled great war machines through the mud of the camp goaded on by men of the order of the ant banners fluttered in the breeze and the standards of a score of military orders were stuck here and there in the ground from a distance it seemed like some primeval concourse of beasts as a line of wolves tramped across a rained field or a gathering of moles one of the engineering or ders grouped about a cooking fire while elsewhere could be seen wasps ravens ferrets rats foxes tigers boars flies hounds badgers goats wolverines otters and even a few mantises select guards whose grand constable was king huon himself hawkmoon himself recognized several of the ban nersthat of adaz promp fat grand constable of the order of the hound brenal farnus ornate flag showing him to be a baron of granbretan and the rats grand constable the fluttering standard of shenegar trott count of sussex hawkmoon guessed that this city must be the last to fall in a sustained cam paign and that was why the army was so large and attended by so many highranking warlords he made out shenegar trott himself being borne in a horse litter toward his tent his robes covered in jewels his pale silver mask wrought in the parody of a human face shenegar trott seemed like a softliving soft brained aristocrat ruined by rich living but hawk moon had seen shenegar trott do battle at the ford of weizna on the rhine had seen him deliberately sink himself and horse under water and ride along the river bottom to emerge on the enemys bank it was the puzzling thing about all dark empire noblemen they seemed soft lazy and selfindulgent yet they were as strong as the beasts they pretended to be and were often braver shenegar trott was also the man who had hacked off the limb of a screaming child and eaten a bite from it while its mother was forced to watch well said hawkmoon taking a deep breath lets ride through and camp as near to the far side as we can i hope well be able to slip away in the morning they rode slowly through the camp from time to time a boar would greet them and daverc would answer for them eventually they came to the farthest edge of the camp and dismounted they had brought the gear stolen from the men they had killed in the tavern and now they set it up without suspicion for it bore no special insignia daverc watched the others work it would not do he had told them for one of his obvious rank to be seen helping his men a group of engineers of the badger order came tramping around with a cartload of spare axheads sword pommels arrowheads spear tips and the like they also had a sharpening machine any work for us brother boars they grunted pausing beside the little camp hawkmoon boldly drew his blunted blade this needs sharpening aye and ive lost a bow and a quiver of arrows oladahn said eyeing a batch of bows in the bottom of the cart what about your mate said the man in the bad ger mask hes got no sword at all he indicated yisselda then give him one fool barked daverc in his most lordly tone and the badger hastily obeyed when they had been reequipped and had their wea pons freshly sharpened hawkmoon felt his confi dence come back he was pleased at the coolness of his deception only yisselda seemed downhearted she hefted the great sword she had been forced to strap around her waist much more weight she said and ill fall to my knees best get inside the tent hawkmoon said there youll be able to take off some of the gear at least daverc seemed unsettled watching hawkmoon and oladahn prepare a cooking fire what ails you daverc hawkmoon asked looking up and peering through the eyeslits of his hel met sit down the food will not be long i smell something wrong daverc murmured i am not altogether happy that we are in no danger why do you think the badgers suspected us not at all daverc looked across the camp evening darkened the sky and the warriors were beginning to settle down there was less movement now on the walls of the distant city soldiers lined the battlements ready to resist an army that none had resisted to date save for the kamarg not at all daverc repeated half to himself but i would feel relieved if if what i think i will walk about the camp a little see what gossip i can hear is that wise besides if we are approached by others of the boar order well not be able to speak the language ill not be gone long get into your tents as soon as you can hawkmoon wanted to stop daverc but he did not know how to without attracting unwanted atten tion he watched daverc stride off through the camp just then a voice said from behind them a nice looking piece of sausage you have there brothers hawkmoon turned it was a warrior in the mask of the order of the wolf aye said oladahn quickly ayewill you have a piece brother he cut a slice of sausage and handed it to the man in the wolf mask the warrior turned lifted his mask popped the food into his mouth lowered his mask quickly and turned back again thanks he said ive been traveling for days on next to nothing our commander drives you hard we just came in riding faster than a flying french man he laughed all the way from provence from provence hawkmoon said involuntarily aye been there once or twice have we won the kamarg yet as good as commander thinks its a matter of days theyre virtually leaderless running out of pro visions those weapons theyve got have killed a mil lion of us but they wont kill many more before we ride over them what happened to count brass their leader dead i heardor as good as their morales get ting worse every day by the time we get back i should think itll be all over there ill be glad ive been pitched there for months this is the first change of scenery since we began the damned campaign thanks for the sausage brothers good killing to morrow hawkmoon watched the wolf warrior stamp away into the night that was now lit by a thousand camp fires he sighed and entered the tent you heard that he asked yisselda i heard she had removed her helmet and greaves and was combing her hair it seems my father still lives she spoke in an overcontrolled tone and hawkmoon even in the darkness of the tent could see tears in her eyes he took her face in his hands and said do not fear yisselda a few days more and we shall be at his side if he lives that long he awaits us he will live later hawkmoon went outside oladahn sat by the dying fire arms around his knees daverc has been gone too long said oladahn aye said hawkmoon distantly staring at the faraway walls of the city has he come to harm i wonder deserted us more likely oladahn broke off as several figures emerged from the shadows hawkmoon saw with sinking heart that they were boarmasked warriors into your tent quickly he murmured to oladahn but it was too late one of the boars was already talking to hawkmoon addressing him in the guttural secret tongue of the order hawkmoon nodded and raised a hand as if acknowledging a greeting hoping that that was all it was but the boars tone became more insistent hawkmoon tried to enter his tent but an arm restrained him again the boar spoke to him hawkmoon coughed pretending illness pointing at his throat but then the board said i asked you brother if you drink with us take off that mask hawkmoon knew that no member of any order would demand of another that he remove his mask unless he suspected him of wearing it illicitly he stepped back and drew his sword i regret i should not like to drink with you brother but ill happily fight with you oladahn sprang up beside him his own sword ready who are you growled the boar why wear the armor of another order what sense does that make hawkmoon flung back his helm revealing his pale face and the black jewel that shone there i am hawkmoon he said simply and leaped forward into the mass of astonished warriors the pair took the lives of five of the dark empire men before the noise of the fight brought others run ning from all over the camp riders galloped up all around him hawkmoon was aware of shouts and the babble of voices his arm rose and fell in the darkness of the press but soon it was gripped by a dozen hands and he felt himself borne down a spear haft caught him a buffet in the back of his neck and he fell into the mud of the field dazed he was dragged upright and hauled before a tall blackarmored figure seated on a horse some distance away from the main mass his mask was lifted back and he peered up at the horseman ah this is pleasant duke of koln came the deep musical voice from within the horsemans helm a voice edged with evil and with malice a voice hawk moon recognized dimly but could not believe in his recognition my long journey has not been wasted said the horseman turning to his mounted companion i am glad my lord was the reply i trust i am now reinstated in the eyes of the kingemperor hawkmoons head jerked up to look at the other man his eyes blazed as he recognized the elaborate maskhelm of daverc thickly hawkmoon cried so you have betrayed us another betrayal are all men traitors to hawk moons cause he tried to break free to grab with his hands at daverc but the warriors held him back daverc laughed you are naive duke dor ian he began to cough weakly have you got the others the horseman asked the girl and the little beastman aye your excellency answered one of the men then bring them to my camp i want to inspect them all closely this is a very satisfying day for me chapter nine the journey south a storm had begun to rumble over the camp as hawkmoon oladahn and yisselda were dragged through the mud and the filth past the bright curious eyes of the warriors through the noise and confusion to where a great banner fluttered in the newly come wind lightning suddenly split a jagged gulf in the sky and thunder growled then exploded more lightning came fast on the thunders heels illuminating the scene before them hawkmoon gasped as he recog nized the banner tried to speak to oladahn or yis selda but was then bundled into a large pavilion where a masked man sat on a carved chair daverc standing beside him the man in the chair wore the mask of the order of the wolf the banner had proclaimed him grand constable of that order one of the greatest nobles in all granbretan first chief tain of the armies of the dark empire under the kingemperor huon a baron of kroidena man hawkmoon thought dead was sure he had slain him himself baron meliadus he grunted you did not die at hamadan no i did not die hawkmoon though you woun ded me sorely i escaped that battlefield hawkmoon smiled thinly few of your men did we defeated yourouted you meliadus turned his ornate wolf mask and spoke to a captain who stood nearby bring chains bring many chains strong and of great weight heap them on these dogs and rivet them i want no locks that might be picked this time i will be sure they are brought to granbretan he left his chair and descended to peer through the eyeslits in his mask at hawkmoons face they have discussed you often at king huons court have de vised such exquisite such elaborate such splendid punishments for you traitor your dying will take a year or two and each moment will be agony of mind spirit and body all our ingenuity hawkmoon we have squandered on you he stepped back and reached out a black gauntlet to cup yisseldas hatetwisted face she turned her head eyes filled with anger and despair and as for youi offered you all honors to become my wife now you will have no honor but a husband i shall be to you until i tire of you or your body breaks the wolf head moved slowly to regard oladahn and as for this creature unhuman yet upstart enough to walk on two legs he shall crawl and whine like the animal he is be trained to behave like a proper beast oladahn spat at the jeweled mask ill have an ex cellent model in you he said meliadus whirled cloak swirling and limped heav ily back to his chair ill save all until weve presented ourselves at the throne globe meliadus said his voice slightly un steady ive been patient and will remain so for a few more days we move off at first light returning to granbretan but we shall take a slight detour in order that you may witness the final destruction of the ka marg i have been there for a month you know and watched its men die daily watched the towers fall one by onethere are not many left i have told them to hold off the last assault until i return i thought you would like to see your homeland raped he laughed putting his grotesquely masked head on one side to look at them again ah here are the chains members of the order of the badger were coming in bearing huge iron chains a brazier hammers and rivets hawkmoon yisselda and oladahn struggled as the badgers bound them but soon they were forced down to the floor by the weight of the iron links then the redhot rivet nails were hammered home and hawkmoon knew that no human being could possibly hope to escape such bonds baron meliadus came to look down at him when the work was done well journey by land to the ka marg and from there to bordeaux where a ship will be waiting for us i regret i cannot offer you a flying ma chinewe are using most of them to level the kamarg hawkmoon closed his eyes the only gesture he could make to display his contempt for his captor bundled into an open wagon the next morning the three were given no food before baron meliaduss heavily guarded caravan set off from time to time hawkmoon caught a glimpse of his enemy riding near the head of the column with sir huillam daverc by his side the weather was still stormy and oppressive and a few heavy drops of rain splashed on hawkmoons face and fell into his eyes he was so heavily bound that he could barely shake his head to rid it of the moisture the wagon bumped and jerked away and in the distance the dark empire troops were marching against the city it seemed to hawkmoon that he had been betrayed on all sides he had trusted the warrior in jet and gold and had had his saddlebags stolen he had trusted daverc and found himself delivered into the hands of baron meliadus now he sighed not sure that even oladahn would not betray him given the opportun ity he found himself slipping almost comfortably into the mood that had possessed him months before after his defeat and capture by granbretan when he had led an army against baron meliadus in germany his face became frozen his eyes dull and he ceased to think sometimes yisselda would speak and he would answer with an effort having no words of comfort be cause he knew that there were none that would con vince her sometimes oladahn would try to make a cheerful comment but the others did not reply and eventually he too lapsed into silence only when from time to time food was pushed into their mouths did they show any signs of life so the days passed as the caravan trundled south ward towards the kamarg they had all anticipated this homecoming for months but now they looked forward to it without joy hawkmoon knew he had failed in his chosen mission failed to save the kamarg and he was full of selfcontempt soon they were passing through italia and baron meliadus called out one day the kamarg well reach before a couple of nights have passed we are just crossing the border into france and he laughed chapter ten the fall of the kamarg sit them up said baron meliadus so they can see on horseback he leaned over to look into the wagon get them up straight he told his sweating me who were wrestling with the three bodies still clad in armor and made heavier by the great weight of chains about them they do not look well he added and i thought them such hardy spirits daverc rode up beside baron meliadus coughing hunched a little in his saddle and youre still in poor condition daverc did not my apothecary mix you the medicine you asked for he did my lord baron daverc said weakly but it does me little good it should have done the mixture of herbs you had him put in it meliadus returned his attention to the three prisoners see we have stopped on this hill so that you could look at your homeland hawkmoon blinked in the midday sunlight recog nizing the marshlands of his beloved kamarg stretch ing and shining away to the horizon but closer he saw the great somber watchtowers of the kamarg the strength of the kamarg with their strange weapons of incredible power whose secrets were known only to count brass and camped near them a black mass of men like so many million ants ready to sweep in were the gathered forces of the dark empire oh sobbed yisselda they can never withstand so many an intelligent estimate my dear said baron mel iadus you are quite right he and his party had come to a rest on the slopes of a hill that led gradually down to the plain where the troops of granbretan massed hawkmoon could see infantry cavalry engineers rank upon rank of them he saw war engines of enormous size huge flame can non ornithopters flapping through the skies in such numbers that their shapes blotted out the sun as they passed over the heads of the onlookers all manner of metals had been brought against the peaceful kamarg brass and iron and bronze and steel tough alloys that could resist the bite of a flamelance gold and silver and platinum and lead vultures marched beside frogs and horses beside moles there were wolves and boars and stags and wildcats eagles and ravens and badgers and weasels silk banners fluttered in the moist warm air bright with the colors of two score of nobles from all corners of granbretan there were yellows and purples and blacks and reds blue and greens and flash ing pinks and the sun caught the jewels of a hundred thousand eyes and made them flash malevolent and grim aha laughed baron meliadus that army i command if count brass had not refused to aid us that day you would all be honored allies of the dark empire of granbretan but because you resisted us you will be punished you thought your weapons and your towers and the stoic bravery of your men was enough to stand against the might of granbretan not enough dorian hawkmoon not enough seemy army raised by me to commit my vengeance see hawkmoon and know what a fool you and the rest were he flung back his head and laughed for a long time tremble hawkmoonand you too yisselda tremble as your fellows are trembling now within their towers for they know those towers must fall they know the kamarg will be ashes and mud before tomorrows sunset i will destroy the kamarg if it means sacrificing my entire army and hawkmoon and yisselda did tremble though it was with grief at the threat of the destruction foreseen by mad baron meliadus count brass is dead said baron meliadus turning his horse to ride to the head of his company and now dies the kamarg he waved his arm forward let them see the carnage the wagon began to move again bumping down the hill road to the plain its prisoners propped in it with stricken faces and miserable eyes daverc continued to ride beside the wagon coughing ostentatiously the barons medicines not bad he said at length it should cure the ills of all his men and with that enigmatic pronouncement he urged his horse into a gallop to reach the head of the column and ride beside his master hawkmoon saw strange rays flash from the towers of the kamarg and strike into the gathered ranks that came against them leaving scars of smoking ground where men had been he saw the cavalry of the kamarg begin to move up to take its positions a thin line of battered guardians riding their horned horses flamelances on their shoulders he saw ordinary townsfolk from the settlements armed with swords and axes coming in the wake of the cavalry but he did not see count brass he did not seen von villach and he did not see the philosopher bowgentle the men of the kamarg marched leaderless to this last battle he heard the faint sounds of their battle shouts coming over the howls and roars of the attackers the crack of cannon and the shriek of flamelances heard the clatter of armor and the creak of metal smelled beast and man and weapon marching through the mud and then he saw the black hordes pause as a wall of fire rose into the air before them and scarlet flamingoes flew over it riders aiming flamelances at the clanking ornithopters hawkmoon ached to be free to have the feel of a sword in his hand and a horse between his legs to rally the men of the kamarg who even leaderless could still resist the dark empire though their num bers were a fraction of the enemys he writhed in his chains and he cursed in his fury and frustration evening came and the battle went on hawkmoon saw an ancient black tower struck by a million flames from the dark empire cannon saw it sway topple and fall crashing down to become rubble suddenly and the black hordes cheered night fell and the battle went on the heat of it reached even to the three in the wagon and brought sweat to their faces around them the wolf guards sat laughing and talking certain of victory their master had ridden his horse into the thick of his troops the better to see how the battle went and they brought out a skin of wine with long straws jutting from it so that they could suck the stuff through their masks as the night grew longer their talk and their laughter subsided until strangely they all slept oladahn remarked on it not like the vigilant wolves to sleep so hard they must be confident hawkmoon sighed aye but it does us no good these damned chains are riveted so fast that we have no hope of escaping whats this the voice was davercs no longer optimistic hawkmoon i find it hard to believe away with you daverc hawkmoon said as the man emerged from the darkness to stand beside the wagon back to lick the boots of your master i had brought this daverc said in a mock aggrieved tone to see if it would serve you he dis played a bulky object in his hand after all it was my medicine that drugged the guards hawkmoons eyes narrowed whats that in your hand a rarity i found on the battleground some great commanders id judge for there are few of them to be found these days its a kind of flamelance though small enough to be carried in one hand ive heard of them hawkmoon nodded but what use is it to me im in chains as you see aye i noted that if youd take a risk however it might be that i could release you is this a new trap daverc that you and meli adus have concocted between you im hurt hawkmoon why should you think that because you betrayed us into meliaduss hands you must have prepared the trap well ahead when you spoke to those wolf warriors in that carpathian village you sent them to find their master and ar ranged to lead us to that camp where we could be most easily captured why it sounds possible agreed daverc though you could see it another waythe wolf war riors recognized me then and followed us going later to warn their master i heard the rumor at the camp that meliadus had come to find you decided to tell meliadus i had led you into this trap so that one of us would be free at least daverc paused how does that sound glib well yes it does sound glib now hawkmoon there is not much time shall i see if i can burn your chains without burning you or would you rather keep your seats for fear of missing a development in the battle burn the damned chains hawkmoon said for at least with my hands free ill have a chance to choke you if you lie daverc brought the little flamelance up and di rected it at an angle to hawkmoons fettered arms then he touched a stud and a beam of intense heat sprang from the muzzle hawkmoon felt pain sear his arm but he gritted his teeth the pain got worse until he felt he must cry out and then there was a clatter as one of the links fell to the bottom of the wagon and he felt some of the weight leave him an arm was free his right arm he rubbed it and almost yelled as he touched a part where the armor had been burned clean through hurry murmured daverc here hold up an other length of chain it will be easier now at last hawkmoon was free of the chain and they set about releasing yisselda and then oladahn daverc was becoming noticeably more nervous by the time they had finished i have your swords here he said and new masks and horses you must follow me and hurry before meliadus comes back i had to tell you the truth ex pected him before now they crept through the darkness to where the horses were tethered donned the masks strapped the swords to their waists and climbed into their saddles then they heard other steeds galloping up the hill road toward them heard confused shouts and an an gry bellow that could only be meliaduss quick daverc hissed we must rideride for the kamarg they kicked their horses into a wild gallop and be gan to career down the hill toward the main battlefield make way daverc screamed make way the force must move through reinforcements for the front men leaped aside for their horses as they thundered through the thick of the camp cursing the four fig ures who rode so heedlessly make way daverc yelled a message for the grand commander he found time to turn his head and call to hawkmoon it bores me to sustain the same lie he yelled again make way the potion for the plaguestruck behind them they heard other horses as meliadus and his men came in pursuit ahead they could now see that the fighting still continued but not with the intensity it had had earlier make way bellowed daverc make way for baron meliadus the horses leaped knots of men swept around war engines galloped through fires drawing nearer and nearer to the kamargs towers while behind them they could hear meliadus yelling now they reached a point where the horses gal loped over corpses the fallen of granbretan and the main force was now behind them get the masks off daverc called its our only chance if the kamargians recognize you and yisselda in time theyll hold their fire if not from out of the darkness came the bright beam of a flamelance narrowly missing daverc behind them other flamelances shot their searing death aimed doubtless by meliaduss men hawkmoon grappled with the straps of his mask helm managed at last to unloose it and fling it behind him stop the voice was meliaduss gaining on them now youll perish by your own forces fools more flamelances had opened up from the kamarg side illuminating the night with ruddy light the horses rode over the dead finding it hard going daverc had his head down over his horses neck and yisselda and oladahn were crouching low too but hawkmoon drew his sword and yelled men of the kamarg it is hawkmoon hawkmoon has returned the flamelances did not cease but they were get ing closer and closer to one of the towers now daverc straightened in his saddle kamargians i bring you hawkmoon who will and fire splashed him he flung up his arms cried out and began to topple from his saddle hawkmoon hastily drew alongside steadying the body the armor was redhot melted in places but daverc seemed not wholly dead a faint laugh came from the blistered lips a piece of serious misjudgement linking my for tunes with yours hawkmoon the other two came to a halt their horses stamping in confusion behind them baron meliadus and his men came closer take the reins of his horse oladahn hawkmoon said ill steady him in his saddle and well see if we can get closer to the tower flame shot out again this time from the granbret anian side stop hawkmoon hawkmoon ignored the command and moved on slowly picking his way through the mud and death all around him trying to support daverc hawkmoon shouted as a great beam of light sprang from the tower men of the kamarg it is hawk moonand yisselda count brasss daughter the light faded closer now came the horses of meliadus yisselda too was swaying in her saddle from exhaustion hawkmoon prepared to meet the wolves of meliadus then bursting down an incline came about a score of armored guardians the white horned horses of the kamarg under them and they surrounded the four one of the guardians peered closely into hawk moons face then his eyes lit with joy it is my lord hawkmoon it is yisselda ahnow our luck will change some distance away meliadus and his men had paused when they saw the kamargians then they turned and rode into the darkness they came to castle brass in the morning when the pale sunlight fell on the lagoons and wild bulls looked up from where they drank and watched them pass a wind stirred the reeds making them roll like the sea and the hill overlooking the town was rich with grapes and other fruits just beginning to ripen on top of the hill stood castle brass solid and old and seemingly unchanged by the wars that had raged on the borders of the province it protected they road up the curling white road to the castle crossed into the courtyard where joyous stewards rushed out to take their horses then entered the hall which was full of count brasss trophies it was strangely cold and silent and a single figure stood by the great fireplace waiting for them although he smiled his eyes were fearful and his face had aged much since hawkmoon had last seen himwise sir bowgentle the philosopherpoet bowgentle embraced yisselda then gripped hawk moons hand how is count brass hawkmoon asked physically well but he has lost the will to live bowgentle signed for stewards to help daverc take him to the room in the northern towerthe sickroom ill attend to him as soon as i can come he said see for yourselves they left oladahn to stay with daverc and climbed the old stone staircase to the landing where count brasss apartments still were bowgentle opened a door and they entered the bedroom there was a simple soldiers bed big and square with white sheets and plain pillows on the pillows lay a great head that seemed carved from metal the red hair had a little more gray the bronzed face was a trifle paler but the red mustache was the same and the heavy brow that hung like a ledge of rock over the cave of the deepset golden brown eyes that too was the same but the eyes stared at the ceiling with out blinking and the lips did not move were set in a hard line count brass murmured bowgentle look but the eyes remained fixed hawkmoon had to come forward peer straight into the face and make yisselda do likewise count brass your daughter yisselda has returned and dorian hawkmoon too from the lips now came a rumbling murmur more illusions id thought the fever past bowgentle so it is my lordthese are not phantoms the eyes moved now to look at them am i dead at last and joined with you my children you are on earth count brass hawkmoon said yisselda bent and kissed her father on the lips there fatheran earthly kiss gradually the hard line of the lips began to melt until a smile was there then a wide grin then the body heaved under the clothes and suddenly count brass was sitting upright ah its true id lost hope fool that i am id lost hope he laughed now sud denly alive with vitality bowgentle was astonished count brassi thought you but a pace from the door of death so i was bowgentlebut ive leaped back from it as you see leaped a long way how goes the siege hawkmoon badly for us count brass but better ill wager now we three are together again aye bowgentle have my armor brought and where is my sword count brassyou must still be weak then bring me fooda great deal of foodand ill fortify myself while we talk and count brass sprang from his bed to embrace his daughter and her betrothed in the hall they ate while dorian hawkmoon told count brass all that had befallen him since leaving the castle so many months before count brass in turn told of his tribulations with it had seemed the entire might of the dark empire to contend with he told of von villachs last battle and how the old man had died bravely at the cost of a score of dark empire lives how he himself had been wounded how he had learned of yisseldas disappearance and lost the will to live oladahn came down then and was introduced he said that daverc was badly hurt but that bowgentle thought he would recover on the whole it was a cheerful homecoming but marred by the knowledge that on the borders the guardians were fighting for their lives almost cer tainly fighting a losing battle count brass had by this time donned his armor of brass and strapped on his huge broadsword he tow ered above the others as he stood up and said come hawkmoon sir oladahn we must to the battlefield and lead our men to victory bowgentle sighed two hours ago i thought you all but deadnow you ride to battle you are not well enough sir my sickness was of the spirit not the flesh and thats cured now roared count brass horses tell them to bring our horses sir bowgentle though himself weary hawkmoon found renewed vigor as he followed the old man from the castle he blew a kiss to yisselda and then they were in the courtyard mounting the horses that would bear them to the battlefield they rode hard the three of them through the secret pathways of the marshlands with huge clouds of giant flamingoes passing through the air over their heads herds of wild horned horses galloping away from them count brass waved a gloved hand such a land is worth defending with all we have such peace is worth protecting soon they heard the sounds of warfare and came to where the dark empire drove against the towers they reined in when they saw the worst count brass spoke in a stricken whisper impossi ble he said but it was true the towers had fallen each lay broken a pile of smoking masonry the survivors were even now being pressed back though they battled bravely this is the fall of the kamarg said count brass in the voice of an old man chapter eleven return of the warrior now one of the captains saw them and came riding up his armor was in tatters and his sword broken but there was joy in his face count brass at last come sir we must rally the mendrive the dark empire dogs back hawkmoon saw count brass force himself to smile draw his great broadsword and say aye captain see if you can find a herald or two to tell all that count brass is back a cheer went up from the hardpressed kamar gians as count brass and hawkmoon appeared and they held their ground even drove the granbretan ians back in places count brass with hawkmoon and oladahn following rode into the thick of his men once again the invincible man of metal aside lads he called aside and let me get at the enemy count brass grabbed his own battered standard from a nearby rider and with this balanced in the crook of his arm his sword waving he drove forward at the mass of beast masks ahead hawkmoon rode up beside him and they made a menacing almost supernatural pair the one in his flaming armor of brass and the other with the black jewel imbedded in his forehead their swords rising and falling on the heads of the tightly packed gran bretan infantry and when another figure joined them a stocky man with fur covering his face and a flashing saber striking here and there like lightning they seemed a trio out of mythology unnerving the beast warriors of granbretan so that they fell back hawkmoon searched about for meliadus swearing that he would certainly kill him this time but he could not see him for the moment gauntleted hands tried to drag him from his saddle but his sword slipped through eyeholes split helms and sliced heads from their shoulders the day wore and the fighting continued without respite hawkmoon swayed in his saddle now battle weary and halfdazed with pain from a dozen minor cuts and a great many bruises his horse was killed but the weight of men surrounding him was so great that he sat it for half an hour before he realized it was dead then he sprang off it and continued fighting on foot he knew that no matter how many he and the others killed they were outnumbered and illequip ped gradually they were being driven farther and farther back ah he murmured to himself if only we had a few hundred fresh troops we might win the day by the runestaff we need aid suddenly a strange electric sensation ran through his body and he gasped recognizing what was hap pening to him realizing that he had unconsciously in voked the runestaff the red amulet which now glowed at his neck spreading red light on the armor of his enemies was now transmitting power into his body he laughed and began to hew around him with fantastic strength cutting back the circle of warriors attacking him his sword snapped but he grabbed a lance from a horseman riding at him dragged its owner from his saddle and swinging the lance like a sword jumped onto the horse and resumed the attack hawkmoon hawkmoon he cried using the old battlecry of his ancestors haioladahncount brass he gouged his way through the beastmasked warriors between himself and his friends count brasss standard still swayed in its owners hand drive them back hawkmoon yelled drive them back to our borders then hawkmoon was everywhere a whirling bringer of death he raced through the ranks of granbretan and where he passed there were only corpses a great muttering went up from the enemy then and they began to falter soon they were falling back some actually running from the field and then the figure of baron meliadus appeared crying out to them to turn to stand and to fight back he cried you cannot fear so few but the tide was completely on the turn now and he him self was caught by it borne back by his retreating men they fled in terror from the palefaced knight whose sword fell everywhere in whose skull a black jewel shone and at whose throat hung an amulet of scarlet fire whose fierce horse reared over their heads they had heard too that he shouted the name of a dead manthat he himself was a dead man dorian hawkmoon who had fought against them at koln and almost defeated them there who had defied the kingemperor himself who had nearly slain baron meliadus and had in fact defeated him more than once hawkmoon it was the only name the dark empire feared hawkmoon hawkmoon the figure held its sword high as its horse reared again hawkmoon possessed of the power of the red amulet hawk moon chased the fleeing army and he laughed wildly with a mad triumph behind him rode count brass terrible in his redgold armor his huge blade dripping with the blood of his foes oladahn grinning through his fur bright eyes gleaming saber slick with gore and behind them the jubilant forces of the kamarg a handful of men jeering at the mighty army they had routed now the power of the amulet began to fade from hawkmoon and he felt his pains return felt the weariness again but now it did not matter for they had come to the border marked by the ruined towers and watched their enemies in flight oladahn laughed our victory hawkmoon count brass frowned ayebut not one we can sustain we must withdraw regroup find some safer ground to stand for we will not beat them again in the open field you are right nodded hawkmoon now that the towers have fallen we need to find another spot well defendedand there is only one i can think of he glanced at the count ayecastle brass agreed the old man we must send word to all the towns and villages of the kamarg to tell the people to bring their goods and stock to aiguesmortes under the protection of the castle will we be able sustain so many for a long siege hawkmoon asked we shall see count brass replied watching the distant army beginning to regroup but at least they will have some protection when the dark empire troops flood over our kamarg there were tears in his eyes as he turned his horse and began to ride back to the castle from the balcony of his rooms in the eastern tower hawkmoon watched the people driving their live stock into the protection of the old town of aigues mortes most of them were corralled in the amphi theater at one end of the town soldiers brought in provisions and helped folk with their loaded carts by evening all but a few had entered the safety of the walls crowding into houses or camping in the streets hawkmoon prayed that plague or panic might not set in for such a crowd might be hard to control oladahn joined him on the balcony pointing to the northeast look he said flying machines and hawkmoon saw the ominous shapes of dark empire ornithopters flapping over the horizon a certain sign that the army of granbretan was on the move by nightfall they could see the cooking fires of the nearest troops tomorrow said hawkmoon it could be our last battle they went down to the hall where bowgentle talked to count brass food had been prepared as lav ishly as ever the two men turned as hawkmoon and oladahn entered the hall how is daverc hawkmoon asked stronger bowgentle said he has an excellent constitution says he would like to get up to eat to night i said he might yisselda came through the outer door ive spoken to the women she said and they say all are now within the walls we have enough provisions to last as much as a year if we slaughter the stock count brass smiled sadly it will take less than a year to decide this battle and how is the spirit in the town good she said now that they have heard of your victory today and know you both to be alive it is as well count brass said heavily that they do not know that tomorrow they die or if not to morrow the next day we cannot stand against such a weight of soldiers for long my dear most of our flamingoes are dead so we have virtually no protec tion in the air most of our guardians are dead and the troops we have left are all but untrained bowgentle sighed and we thought the kamarg could never fall you are too certain that it will said a voice from the stairs and there was daverc pale and dressed in a loose fawncolored gown limping down to the hall in such spirits you are bound to lose you could try to talk of victory at least you are right sir huillam count brass changed his mood with an effort of will and we could eat some of this good food here to give us energy for to morrows struggle how are you daverc hawkmoon asked as they seated themselves at the board well enough said daverc lightly i think i can manage some small refreshments and he began to heap his plate with meat they ate in silence for the most part relishing the meal that many felt would be their last when hawkmoon looked from his window the next morning it was to see the marshlands overlaid with men in the night the dark empire had crept up close to their walls and now it was readying itself to the assault quickly hawkmoon donned clothes and armor and went down to the hall where he found daverc al ready encased in his patched armor oladahn cleaning his blade and count brass discussing some feature of the coming campaign with two of his remaining captains there was an atmosphere of tension in the hall and the men spoke to one another in murmurs yisselda appeared and called to him softly dori an he turned and ran up the stairs to the landing on which she stood taking her in his arms and holding her close kissing her gently on the forehead dori an she said let us be married before aye he said quietly let us find bowgentle they found the philosopher in his quarters reading a book he looked up as they entered and smiled at them they told him what they wanted and he laid down his book i had hoped for the grand cere mony he said but i understand and he made them join hands and kneel before him while he spoke the words of his own composition that had always been used in marriages since he and his friend the count had come to castle brass when it was done hawkmoon stood up and kissed yisselda again then he said look after her bow gentle and left the room to join his friends who were already leaving the hall for the courtyard as they mounted their horses a great shadow sud denly darkened the courtyard and they heard the creaking and clattering overhead that could only be a dark empire ornithopter a bolt of flame leapt from it and splashed on the cobbles narrowly missing hawkmoon and causing his horse to rear nostrils flar ing and eyes rolling count brass brought up the flamelance with which he had already equipped himself and touched the stud and red fire struck upwards at the flying machine they heard the pilot scream and saw the things wings cease to work it glided out of sight and they heard it crash at last on the side of the hill i must station flamelancers in the towers count brass said theyll have the best chance of striking back at the ornithopters come gentlemenlets to the battle and as they left the castle walls and rode down to the town they saw the huge tide of men was already washing at the walls of the town where kamarg war riors fought desperately to drive it back ornithopters fashioned like grotesque metal birds wheeled over the town pouring down flame into the streets and the air became filled with the screams of the townsfolk the roar of flamelances and the clash of metal against metal black smoke hung over aiguesmortes and in places houses were already burning hawkmoon led the charge down to the town and pushed through frightened women and children to gain the walls and join in the fight elsewhere were count brass daverc and oladahn helping to resist the force that tried to crush the town there came a desperate roar from one portion of the wall and an echoing cheer of triumph and hawk moon began to run in that direction seeing that a hole had been breached in the defenses and dark em pire warriors in helms of wolf and bear were gush ing through hawkmoon met them and they wavered instantly remembering his earlier exploits he was no longer equipped with superhuman strength but he used the pause to cry his ancestral battleshout hawkmoon hawkmoon and leap at them sword meeting metal flesh and bone and driving them back through the breach so they fought all day holding the town even as their numbers rapidly dropped and when the night fell and the dark empire troops withdrew hawk moon knew as they all knew that the next morning must bring defeat wearily hawkmoon count brass and the others led their horses back up the winding road to the castle their hearts heavy as they thought of all the in nocents slaughtered that day and of all the innocents who would be slaughtered tomorrowif they were lucky enough to die then they heard a galloping horse behind them and turned on the slope swords ready to see the strange figure of a tall rider coming up the hill toward the castle he had a long helm that completely encased his face and his armor was wrought all in jet and gold hawkmoon scowled what does that traitorous thief want he said the warrior in jet and gold pulled up his big horse nearby his deep vibrant voice came from within his helmet then greetings defenders of the kamarg i see the day goes badly for you baron meli adus will defeat you tomorrow hawkmoon wiped his forehead with a rag no need to make so much of the obvious warrior what have you come to steal this time nothing said the warrior i have come to de liver something he reached behind him and pro duced hawkmoons battered saddlebags hawkmoons spirits rose and he leaned forward to take the saddlebags opening one to look inside there wrapped in a cloak was the object he had been given so long ago by rinal it was safe he pulled back the cloak and saw the crystal unshattered but why did you take it in the first place he asked let us go to castle brass and there i will explain all to you said the warrior in the hall the warrior stood up by the fireplace while the others sat in various positions around him listening at the mad gods castle began the warrior i left you because i knew that with the aid of the mad gods beasts you could soon be safely away from there but i knew other hazards lay ahead for you and suspected that you might be captured therefore i decided to take the object rinal gave you and keep it safe until you should return to the kamarg and i had thought you a thief hawkmoon said i am sorry warrior but what is the object count brass asked an ancient machine the warrior said produced by one of the most sophisticated sciences ever to emerge on this earth a weapon count brass asked no it is a device which can warp whole areas of rime and space and shift them into other dimensions while the machine exists it can exert this power but should it by mischance be destroyed then the area it has warped falls immediately back into the time and space original to it and how is it operated hawkmoon asked re membering suddenly that he had no such knowledge it is difficult to explain since you would recognize none of the words i would use said the warrior in jet and gold but rinal has taught me its use among other things and i can work it but for what purpose daverc asked to shift the troublesome baron and his men to some limbo where they will not trouble us again no said the warrior i will explain the doors burst open and a battered soldier rushed into the hall master he cried to count brass it is baron meliadus under a flag of truce he would parley with you at the town walls i have nothing to say to him count brass said he says that he intends to attack at night that he can have the walls down within an hour for he has fresh troops held back for the purpose he says that if you deliver your daughter hawkmoon daverc and yourself into his hands he will be lenient with the rest count brass thought for a moment but hawkmoon broke in it is useless to consider such a bargain count brass we both know of meliaduss penchant for treachery he seeks only to demoralize the folks to make his victory easier count brass sighed but if what he says is true and i cannot doubt that it is he will have the walls down shortly and we all perish with honor at least said daverc aye said count brass with a somewhat sardonic smile with honor at least he turned to the cou rier tell baron meliadus that we still do not wish to speak with him the warrior bowed i will my lord he left the hall we had best return to the walls said count brass rising wearily just as yisselda entered the room ah father dorianyou are both safe hawkmoon embraced her but now we must go back he said softly meliadus is about to launch an other attack wait said the warrior in jet and gold i have yet to describe my plan to you chapter twelve escape to limbo baron meliadus smiled when he heard the cou riers message very well he said to his stewards let the whole town be destroyed and as many of its inhabitants taken alive to give us sport on our victory day he turned his horse back to where his fresh troops awaited him move forward he said and watched as they be gan to flow towards the doomed town and the castle beyond he saw the fires on the town walls the few soldiers waiting knowing with certainty that they would die now he saw the graceful outlines of the castle that had once protected the town so well and he chuck led there was a warmth inside him for he had longed for this victory ever since he had been ejected from the castle some two years earlier now his troops had nearly reached the walls and he kicked his horses flanks to make it move down so that he could see the battle better then he frowned there seemed something wrong with the light for the outline of town and castle had apparently wavered in a most alarming fashion he opened his mask and rubbed at his eyes then looked again the silhouette of castle brass and aiguesmortes seemed to glow first pink then pale red then scarlet and baron meliadus felt lightheaded he licked his dry lips and feared for his sanity the troops had paused in their attack and mutter ing to themselves and backing away from the place the entire town and the hillside and castle it sur rounded were now a flaming blue the blue began to fade and fading with it went castle brass and aigues mortes a wild wind blew knocking baron meliadus back in his saddle he cried out guards what has happened the place hashas vanished my lord came a nervous voice vanished impossible how can a whole town and a hill vanish it is still there they have erected some kind of screen around the place baron meliadus rode wildly down to where the town walls had been expecting to meet a barrier but none blocked him and his horse trampled over only mud that looked as if it had been recently plowed they have escaped me he howled but how what science aids them what power can they have that is greater than mine the troops had begun to turn back some were running but baron meliadus dismounted from his horse hands outstretched trying to feel for the van ished town he screamed with fury and wept with impotent rage falling at last to his knees in the mud and shaking his fist at where castle brass had been i will find you hawkmoonand your friends i will bring all the scientific knowledge of granbretan to bear on this search and i will follow you if needs be to whatever place you have escaped to whether it be on this earth or beyond it and you will know my vengeance by the runestaff i swear this and then he looked up as he heard the thump of a horses hooves riding past him thought he saw a figure flash by in armor of jet and gold thought he heard ghostly ironic laughter and then the rider too had vanished baron meliadus rose up from his knees and looked around him for his horse oh hawkmoon he said through clenched teeth oh hawkmoon i will catch thee again he had sworn by the runestaff as on that fateful morning two years before and his action had set in motion a new pattern of history his second oath strengthened that pattern whether it favored meliadus or hawkmoon and hardened all their des tinies a little more strongly baron meliadus found his horse and returned to his camp tomorrow he would leave for granbretan and the labyrinth laboratories of the order of the snake sooner or later he would be bound to find a way through to the vanished castle brass he told himself yisselda looked through the window in wonder ment her face alight with joy hawkmoon smiled down at her and hugged her to him behind them count brass coughed and said to tell you the truth my children im a little disturbed by all thisthis science where did that fellow say we were in some other kamarg father said yisselda the view from the window was misty though the town and the hillside were solid enough the rest was not beyond it they could see as if through a blue radiance shining lagoons and waving reeds but they were of transformed colors no longer of simple greens and yellows but of all the colors of the rainbow and without the substance of the castle and its surrounds he said we might explore it said hawkmoon so it must be more tangible than it looks daverc cleared his throat ill stay here and in the town i think what say you oladahn oladahn grinned i think sountil im more used to it at least well im with you said count brass he laughed still were safe eh and all the folk too weve that to be grateful for aye said bowgentle thoughtfully but we must not underestimate the scientific prowess of gran bretan if there is a way of following us here they will find itbe sure of that hawkmoon nodded you are right bowgentle he pointed to rinals gift which lay now in the cen ter of the empty dining table outlined in the strange pale blue light that flooded through the windows we must keep that in our safest vault remember what the warrior saidif it is destroyed we find our selves back again in our own space and time bowgentle went over to the machine and gently picked it up i will see that it is safe he said when he had left hawkmoon turned again to look through the window fingering the red amulet the warrior said that he would come again with a message and a mission for me he said i am in no doubt now that i serve the runestaff and when the warrior comes i shall have to leave castle brass leave this sanctuary and return again to the world you must be prepared for that yisselda let us not speak of it now she said but cele brate instead our marriage aye let us do that he said with a smile but he could not shut entirely from his mind the knowledge that somewhere separated from him by subtle bar riers the world still existed and was still in danger from the dark empire though he appreciated the respite the time to spend with the woman he loved he knew that soon he must return to that world and do battle once more with the forces of granbretan but for the moment he would be happy
