 charon by lord dunsany charon leaned forward and rowed all things were one with his weariness it was not with him a matter of years or of centuries but of wide floods of time and an old heaviness and a pain in the arms that had become for him part of the scheme that the gods had made and was of a piece with eternity if the gods had even sent him a contrary wind it would have divided all time in his memory into two equal slabs so grey were all things always where he was that if any radiance lingered a moment among the dead on the face of such a queen perhaps as cleopatra his eyes could not have perceived it it was strange that the dead nowadays were coming in such numbers they were coming in thousands where they used to come in fifties it was neither charons duty nor his wont to ponder in his grey soul why these things might be charon leaned forward and rowed then no one came for a while it was not unusual for the gods to send no one down from earth for such a space but the gods knew best then one man came alone and the little shade sat shivering on a lonely bench and the great boat pushed off only one passenger the gods knew best and great and weary charon rowed on and on beside the little silent shivering ghost and the sound of the river was like a mighty sigh that grief in the beginning had sighed among her sisters and that could not die like the echoes of human sorrow failing on earthly hills but was as old as time and the pain in charons arms then the boat from the slow grey river loomed up to the coast of dis and the little silent shade still shivering stepped ashore and charon turned the boat to go wearily back to the world then the little shadow spoke that had been a man i am the last he said no one had ever made charon smile before no one before had ever made him weep
