st clares claudine at st clares blyton enid pat and isabel osullivan walked into the fourth formroom at st clares and looked round fourth form said pat golly were getting on arent we isabel yesfourth form seems a long way from the first form said isabel i saydo you remember when we were in the first formages ago we were called the stuckup twins then because we hated st clares and didnt want to belong to it the twins thought back to the days when they had been firstformers they remembered how they had settled down at st clares their first dislike of it turning to pride and admiration and now here they were fourthformers at the beginning of the summer term t dont the firstformers seem babies now said pat we thought we were quite big when we first came but when i see the firstformers now they seem very young to me i shall enjoy being in the fourth form wont you isabel i shall said isabel i hope we shall stay on at st clares until we are in the top formand i hope our friends do too well some of them have left already said pat pam isnt coming back nor is sheila lucy oriell has gone tooto an art school she was going to stay on here but shes too brilliant at her art and shes won a scholarship to the best art school in the country good for lucy i said isabel we shall miss her though i wonder if there are any new girls this term sure to be said pat she looked round the big formroom i say this is a fine room isnt itthe nicest classroom weve had so far theres a wonderful view out of the window so there was the twins could see miles of beautiful country it was country they knew well now and loved very much down below in the school grounds were the tenniscourts the games fields and the big swimmingpool the girls could see the school gardens too and the big kitchen garden full of fresh vegetables bags i sit by the window said pat hallo theres bobby and janet roberta and janet walked into the classroom grinning bobbys freckled face had a very boyish look and she was very like a boy in her ways full of fun and tricks hallo she said come to look at our new home nice room isnt it whats our new formmistress like said pat miss ellisshes supposed to be quite nice isnt she oh yesvery calm and unruffled and dignified said bobby shell be all right got any new tricks to play janet asked isabel janet always had a stock of tricks each term most of them from her schoolboy brother who seemed to be a real scamp janet grinned wait and see she said anyway i suppose id better go carefully now im a fourthformer cant rag about so much when you get high up the school and im going to work for my matric exam too so i guess i wont have much time for tricks i guess you will all the same said pat any new girls do you know two or three said bobby hallo hilary had good hols hilary wentworth came into the room dark and smiling she had been at st clares even longer than the twins hallo she said yes i had fine hols i rode every day and i played tennis on our hard court every day too i say whos the angel what do you mean asked the twins and bobby oh havent you seen her said hilary shes just arrived complete with posh new trunk three tennis rackets and a handbag with gold initials on what do you bet your cousin alison will think shes one of the worlds seven wonders shes got pale golden hair bobbed like angels in pictures and a pointed face like a pixie and a voice like a princess golly where is she said the others with interest will she be in our form shes down in the hall said hilary she arrived in the biggest car ive ever seen with a crest on the panels and two chauffeurs lets go and see her said pat so the five of them went into the corridor and hung over the stair banisters to see the newcomer she was still thereand it was quite true she did look a bit like an angel if an angel could be imagined dressed in school uniform carrying three beautiful tennis rackets shes lovely isnt she said bobby who not being at all lovely herself always admired beauty in others yes i bet alison will follow her round like a dog alison isnt happy unless shes thinking some one is just too wonderful for words alison came up at that moment she was the twins cousin a pretty featherheaded little thing with not many brains hallo she said did i hear you talking about me yes said hilary we were just saying that youd be sure to like that schoolgirl angel down there did you ever see anything like her alison leaned over the banistersand just as the others had guessed she immediately lost her heart to the new girl o she looks like a princess from a fairytale said alison ill go down and ask her if she wants to be shown round a bit alison sped downstairs the others grinned at one another alison has lost her heart already said pat poor old alisonthe wonderful friends shes made and lost i do you remember sadie the american girl and how alison was for ever saying well sadie says so and so and we made a song about it and sang it wasnt alison cross yes and when she was in the second form she thought the drama mistress was simply wonderful and when she was in the third form she lost her heart to the headgirl and made herself a perfect nuisance to her said janet really the times alison has lost her heart to people and they never think anything of her for it funny old featherhead said pat look at her taking the angels arm and going off with her all over her already theres another new girl down there too said bobby she looks rather forlorn well i do think alison might take her round as well hie alison but alison had disappeared with the goldenhaired angel the twins went down the stairs and spoke to the other new girl hallo i youre new arent you youd better come and see matron well take you whats your name said pat looking at the new girl who was trying not to show that she felt new and lost pauline binghamjones said the new girl in rather an affected voice yes id be glad if youd tell me what to do well matron is usually here to see to all the new girls said hilary a little puzzled i wonder where she is i havent seen her at all said pat she wasnt here when we came either funny said isabel lets go to her room and find her weve got to see her anyway they went to matrons room taking pauline with them they banged on the door they liked matron though they were very much in awe of her she had been at st clares for years and years and some of the girls mothers who had also been at st clares had known her too a voice called out come in thats not matrons voice said pat puzzled she opened the door and went in the others following a woman in matrons uniform sat sewing by the window it wasnt the matron they knew so well the girls stared at her in surprise oh said pat we were looking for matron i am matron this term said the new matron your old matron fell ill during the holidays so i have come to take her place i am sure we shall all get on very well together the girls stared at her they didnt feel so sure about that their old matron was fat and round and jolly with a strong and comforting kind of face this matron was thin and sourlooking she had very thin lips that met together in a straight line she smiled at the girls but her smile stayed at her mouth and did not reach her eyes we came to find you said bobby usually matron meets the new girls this is one of them she has to give you her list of clothes and towels and things i know that thank you said matron biting off the thread she was using send all the new girls to me will you how many have arrived the girls didnt know they thought it was matrons business to find out not theirs they thought of their old matron bustling about looking after the newcomers making them welcome taking them to their formmistresses or finding girls to take care of them wellthis is pauline binghamjones said pat at last theres another new girl somewhere we saw her our cousin alison seems to be looking after her the girls disappeared from the room leaving pauline to the new matron they looked at one another and screwed up their noses dont like her said isabel looks like a bottle of vinegar the others laughed i hope our old matron will come back said bobby st clares will seem funny without her i wonder where alison has gone with the angel alison appeared at that moment looking flushed and radiant it was quite plain that she had made a friend already with her was the angel oh said alison pat isabel bobby hilarythis is the honourable angela favorleigh the honourable angela bent her head a little as if she was bowing to her subjects bobby grinned i had a doll called angela once she said she was a bit like you welli hope youll like st clares alison take her to matron where is matron said alison ive been looking for her theres a new matron this term said bobby you wont like her the honourable angela favorleigh didnt like bobby she gazed at her as if she was something that smelt rather nasty she turned to alison and spoke in a pretty high little voice welllets go to matron i want to take my things off they went off together hilary laughed well we shall all know where alison will be most of this term she said in the honourables pocket look said bobby theres another new girl shes got her things off too she looks as if shed be a fourthformer i should think the new girl came up walking quickly as if she had somewhere to go hallo said bobby youre new arent you what form will you be in do you know fourth said the girl my names eileen paterson were fourth form too said pat and she introduced herself and the others do you want to be shown round a bit usually matron is here to welcome people but there is a new one this term who doesnt know the ropes yet the girl looked suddenly annoyed i know my way about thank you she said stiffly ive been here a week already without saying any more she swung off the others stared after her whats bitten her said bobby no need to be rude like that and what did she mean that shes been here a week nobody comes back before the first day of term mirabel came up with her friend gladys hallo hallo said the others nice to see you again i say have you spoken to that girl whos just gonenew girl called eileen paterson seems to think the whole school belongs to her no i havent spoken to her yet said mirabel but i know her mother is the matron nowour old one is ill you know eileen is the new matrons daughter and shes going to be educated here she came with her mother a week ago when her mother came to take over the job and see to the linen and things bobby whistled oh no wonder she was annoyed when we said the new matron ought to be welcoming the new girls and didnt know the ropes yet she said and no wonder she knows her way about if shes already been here a week i didnt like her much give her a chance said hilary you know how you feel sort of on the defensive when you come to anywhere new and meet girls whove been here ages you feel a kind of outsider at first there were new girls in the other lower forms but these did not interest the fourthformers much they were glad to see one another againthe twins bobby hilary kathleen doris carlotta and the rest they had all come up together into the fourth form there were a few old girls left in the fourth form most of whom the twins liked susan howes was head of the form a pleasant kindly girl with a good sense of responsibility and fairness the fourth form settled down under miss ellis she was firm and calm seldom raised her voice expected good work and saw that she got it she was interested in the girls and fond of them and they in return liked her very much the honourable angela favorleigh looked more like an angel than ever in class with her bobbed golden hair falling to her shoulders the ends curling underneath most beautifully all her school clothes though cut to the same pattern as those of the others were really beautiful do you know she has every single pair of shoes especially made for her said alison in a hushed voice to the twins and she has a handbag to match every single frock she wears all with gold initials on shut up said pat who cares about things like that your darling angela is a snob well why shouldnt she be said alison ready to defend her new friend at once her family is one of the oldest in the country shes got a third cousin who is a prince and goodness knows how many titled relations youre a snob too alison said isabel in disgust why must you always suck up to people like that dont you know that its what you are that matters not what you have im not a snob said alison im pleased that angela has chosen me for her friend of course i think shes lovely pity she hasnt got more brains said bobby honestly i dont believe she really knows her twelve times table angela favorleigh certainly was a snob she was intensely proud of her family of its wealth its cars and her own wellbred looks she was very particular about making friends she liked alison because the girl was pretty and dainty had beautiful manners and quite plainly adored the lovely angela from the bottom of her foolish little heart angela liked very few of her form bobby she detested because she had said she was like a doll carlotta she would have nothing to do with at all carlotta didnt mind in the least the darkeyed darkhaired girl had once been a little circusgirl and she was not at all ashamed of it her mother had been a circusrider but her father was a gentleman and now carlotta lived with her father and grandmother in the holidays for her mother was dead she had learnt to be ladylike to have good manners and was very popular indeedbut she had never forgotten the exciting days of the circus and she often amused the others by turning cartwheels or going completely mad in a foreign spanish way that the girls enjoyed very much alison had told angela the histories of all the girls carlotta included and angela had turned up her delicate little nose when she heard that carlotta had actually ridden horses in a circus how can they have her here in a school like this she said i am sure my people wouldnt have sent me here if they had known that why did you come to st clares asked alison curiously its supposed to be a sensible nononsense school you knownot a swanky one i didnt want to come said angela my mother wanted to send me to a much nicer school but my father has funny ideas he said i wanted my comers rubbed off oh angela you havent any corners said alison honestly i dont think youve any faults at all this was the kind of thing that angela loved hearing and was one reason why she liked alison for a friend she looked at alison out of innocent blue eyes and smiled an angelic smile you do say nice things alison she said you are far and away the nicest girl in the form i cant bear that common eileen nor that awful carlotta nor that dreadful pauline binghamjones pauline certainly wasnt much of a success in her way she seemed as much of a snob as angela but she could not carry it off so well because her clothes were not beautifully made and she had no marvellous possessions such as angela had but she too turned up her nose at carlotta and disliked the readywitted bobby as for eileen she would hardly speak to her at all i dont see why eileen should be allowed to join the school just because her mother is here as matron said pauline in her rather affected voice good gracious mewe shall have the cooks daughter here next and the gardeners too i its bad enough to have carlotta she always looks so wild and dontcarish carlotta always did look a little wild at the beginning of term partly because she was no longer under the rather strict eye of her grandmother but nobody minded carlottas untidiness and wildness it was all part of the vivacious amusing girl carlotta knew that angela and pauline didnt like her and she took a real pleasure in talking slang making rude faces and unexpectedly walking on her hands in front of them miss ellis however did not encourage things of this sort in the fourth form her form was a kind of halfway house where girls had to learn to shed their irresponsible ways and to become more serious reliable members of the school as soon as they moved up into the fifth and sixth they had studies of their own instead of common rooms and were expected to take a good deal of responsibility so carlotta was often called to order by miss ellis in her low firm voice and then angela and pauline looked down their noses at the onetime circusgirl and whispered mocking things to the girl next to them pauline and angela vied with each other in their boasting the girls sometimes giggled to hear them my third cousinthe one who is a prince angela would say he has an aeroplane of his own and has promised to take me up in it havent you been up in an aeroplane yet pauline would say with affected surprise good gracious ive been up three times already that was when i was staying with the lacywrights fancy they had sixteen bathrooms in their housewell it was really a mansion of course i bet you havent more than one bathroom in your own home said angela spitefully weve got seven weve got nine if you count the two in the servants quarters said pauline at once the other girls stared at her in surprise they could well believe that angela had scores of bathrooms for wealth was written all over the little snobbut somehow pauline didnt fit in with a number of bathrooms a fleet of expensive cars and things like that well said bobby let me count my bathrooms three for myselffour for motherfive for daddytwo for visitorser how manys that idiot said pat giggling angela and pauline scowled i cant remember whether weve got a bathroom at home or not said hilary entering into the fun let me think hard but no amount of teasing would make either angela or pauline stop their vieing with each other if it wasnt bathrooms it was cars if it wasnt cars it was their beautiful expensivelydressed mothers if it wasnt mothers it was clothes the others really got very tired of it eileen paterson did not seem to mind very much being coldshouldered by angela and pauline she only spoke with eagerness of one thingher elder brother he was at work somewhere in the next big town and it was quite plain that eileen adored him his name is edgar she said we call him eddie you would said angela cattily and if he was called alfred youd call him alf and if he was called herbert youd call him herbor erb perhaps eileen flushed youre a beast angela she said you wait till you see eddieedgar i mean hes marvellous his hairs curly and hes got the loveliest smile hes the best brother in the world hes working terribly hard at his job you see mother lost a lot of money so thats why she had to take a job as matron and why eddieedgarhad to go to work your family history doesnt interest me eileen said angela coldly and went off with alison eileen shrugged her shoulders little snob she said loudly she wants a good spanking carlotta agreed with her yessometimes my hand tingles because it wants to slap angela hard she said but now im a fourthformerwhat a pity i i shall quite forget how to give a slap to any one who needs it oh no you wont said bobby laughing at the solemn carlotta when you fly into a temper youll forget all about being a fourthformeryoull just be the same wild carlotta youve always been the arrival of claudine before a week had gone by a fourth new girl arrived mamzelle herself announced her coming i have a surprise for you she beamed one morning coming in to give a french lesson we shall soon have another companion in the fourth form she arrives today why is she so late in coming asked pat in surprise she has just recovered from the measle said mamzelle who always spoke of this illness in the singular and not in the plural the measle is a most tiresome disease claudine had a very bad measle and she could not come back any sooner claudine said isabel what a pretty name i like it ah and you will like the little claudine too said mamzelle for she is french she is my niece this was news to the girls they hadnt even known that mamzelle had a niece one coming to st clares too i hope she will be happy at st clares said hilary feeling that some one ought to say the right thing ah she will be very happy said mamzelle she would be happy anywhere the little claudine there never was such a child for happiness always she smiles and laughs and always she plays the trick and the joke this sounded good the girls began to look forward to claudines coming they looked at mamzelle expectantly hoping to hear more then mamzelles face grew solemn she pinched her glasses more firmly on her nose and gazed at the listening girls with her shortsighted muchmagnified eyes i have especially asked for claudine to come here she said before she has been to a convent school but it was too strict for her and always they found fault with the poor little claudine they said she cared nothing for any one nor for any rules or customs and i thought to myself ah the good hardworking bobby was once like thatand see what st clares has done for her now she works for her matric and she is as good as gold maybe the same thing will happen to my little claudine bobby looked uncomfortable as mamzelle made this speech she wasnt at all sure that she wanted to be referred to as good as gold but mamzelle was so much in earnest that bobby made no protest it wouldnt have been any good anyway i mamzelle swept on with her speech and so the little claudine comes today wellrecovered from the measle and you will all give her a grand welcome will you not for your old mamzelles sake of course well make her welcome said susan howes and most of the others murmured the same except angela alison and pauline who all put on a bored look as if a niece belonging to mamzelle wasnt worth giving a thought to ah you are good kind girls said mamzelle i will introduce claudine to you as soon as she comes she will love you all she is a good girl though she seems to care nothing for what is good and proper but you will change all that nestce pas the girls thought that claudine sounded distinctly amusing it would be fun to have a french girl in the class they glanced at one another thinking that of all the new girls this latest one sounded the most promising about five minutes before the lesson finished the door was opened and a strange girl appeared she was small dark and smart she had a very cheeky look and she gave a quick sidelong glance at the girls before advancing to mamzelle mamzelle gave a shriek and then flung herself on the new girl she kissed her several times on both cheeks she stroked her dark hair and poured out such a torrent of french that no one could follow it the girl replied in smooth polite french and kissed mamzelle on each cheek she did not seem to mind her aunts outburst in the least ah ma petite claudine here you are at last cried mamzelle she swung the girl round to face the class now see here is the httle ckudine said mamzelle her glasses falling off her nose in her violent delight greet your new friends claudine hallo buddies said claudine amiably the girls stared in surprise and then giggled it was funny to hear such an american expression from the little french girl what did you say said mamzelle who was not well up in american slang did you say hello bodies that is not correct claudine you should say hallo everybody the class roared ckudine grinned mamzelle beamed she was plainly very proud of ckudine and very fond of her the bell rang for the end of class mamzelle picked out hilary hilary you will take the little claudine with you please and show her everything she will feel strange and shy poor little one mamzelle was quite mistaken about that however claudine didnt feel shy and certainly didnt seem to feel strange in fact she acted as if she had known the girls all her life she spoke easily and naturally to them her english was good though like mamzelle she sometimes put things in an unusual way she had been to school in france and then had spent a term or two at a convent school in england it seemed that claudine did not want to remain at her last school and they did not want to keep her you seeit was most unfortunatethe science mistress went up a ladder into a tree to collect some curious fungus that grew there explained claudine in her little french voice and i came along and borrowed the ladder so we did not have a science lesson that day gollyi do you mean to say that you left the teacher stranded up the tree said bobby well you have got a nerve i no wonder mamzelle thinks st clares will be good for you you cant do that sort of thing here no said claudine what a pity still maybe you have good fun i am sorry i did not come back to school on the first day but i had caught a measle the girls giggled every one liked claudine except angela even pauline listened to the new girl and alison was much amused by her but angela as usual looked down her nose what did i tell you she said to alison first we have to have matrons daughter and now we have to have mamzelles niece i cant see what you find to be amused at in claudine alison im surprised at you well i like her voice and her manners said alison i like the way she uses her hands when she talksjust like mamzelle does shes really quite amusing angela angela did not like alison to disagree with her about anything she looked coldly at her friend and then turned away sulkily that was always the way she punished any oneby withdrawing from them and sulking alison couldnt bear it alison tried to make it up she went after angela and took her hand she praised her and flattered her and at last angela condescended to smile again on her willing slave then alison was happy you neednt think i shall bother about claudine at all she said to angela shes a common little thing really not so common as carlotta said angela spitefully alison looked uncomfortable she sincerely liked carlotta who was absolutely honest truthful and straight besides being amusing company even her hot temper was likeable alison thought that carlotta was more completely herself more natural than any of the other girls and to be natural was to be very likeable claudine settled in at once she took a desk at the back of the room and bagged a locker in the common room she arranged her belongings in the locker and put a photograph of her mother on top she had brought a fine big cake with her and shared it generously all round though angela refused a slice alison did too after hesitating she was afraid that angela might go into a sulk again if she saw her sharing the cake at first the girls were very much amused with claudine but they soon discovered that she had very unenglish ways for instance she thought nothing of copying from some one elses book she had a quick brain but she was often lazyand then she would simply copy the answers set down by the girl next to her this was mirabel whose brains were not of the highest order so more often than not claudine copied down mistakes but she did not seem to mind at all look herewe oughtnt to let claudine cheat like this said pat she keeps on copying from mirabel mirabel says claudine didnt bother to do a single sum she copied the answers of all hers the funny thing is she does it so openly said isabel i meani really dont believe she thinks its wrong claudine was very astonished when susan howes the head girl of the form spoke to her about the copying its cheating claudine surely you can see that said susan her honest face glowing scarlet for she did not like accusing any one of cheating no i do not see it at all said claudine you all see me do it cheating is a secret thing no it isnt said susan cheating is cheating whether you do it in front of any one or on the sly besides its so silly of you to copy from mirabel she gets so many answers wrong miss ellis will find out and then youll get into a row you think then it would be better to copy from hilary asked claudine seriously susan sighed claudine you mustnt copy from any one i know french people have different ideas from oursmamzelle has for instancebut youll have to try and get into our ways if youre going to be happy here i am happy anywhere said claudine at once well susan i will perhaps not copy againonly if i have not done any of my prep at all another thing that the girls found irritating about claudine was the way she borrowed things she borrowed pencils rubbers rulers booksanything she happened to want at the moment and nine times out of ten she didnt give them back i forget she explained i borrow a pencil and i use it and i am most grateful for itand then i forget about it and poor hilary she says where is my pencil i have lost my penciland there it is on my desk all the time not at all lost well you might try and remember to give back things you borrow said hilary after all it was a silver pencil of mine you borrowed one i like very much and you might ask permission before you borrow things oh you english sighed claudine well i will be good and always i will say dear hilary please please lend me your sobeautiful silver pencil hilary laughed no one could help being amused by claudine she rolled her expressive black eyes round and used her hands in the same way that mamzelle did after all she hadnt been in england very longshe would learn english ways before the term was over beware of matron the first few weeks passed and soon the fourthformers those who had come up from the third form felt as if they had always been in the fourth form they looked down on the thirdformers and as for the second and firstform girls well they were very small fry indeed no fourthformer would have dreamed of taking any notice of them the summer term was always a nice one there was tennis and there was swimming angela proved to be an unexpectedly good swimmer deft and swift alison who disliked the water did her best to shine in it in order to try and keep up with her beloved angela claudine frankly hated the water she entirely refused to go in much to the gamesmistresss annoyance claudine i what is the use of coming to an english school if you do not learn the good things in it she said swimming is not a good thing said claudine it is a horrible thing wet and cold and shivery and i do not like your habit of playing so many games tennis is also silly as no one could undress claudine by force she did not go into the water the others teased her by splashing her as much as they could the gamesmistress saw that sooner or later claudine would be pushed in fullydressed and she sent her back to the school claudines tennis was even worse than carlottas carlotta had never managed to play properly she was still very wild and uncontrolled in games and the tennis ball was quite as likely to drop into the middle of the distant swimmingpool as over the tennis net i but claudine did not even attempt to hit the ball this is a sosilly game she would say and put down her racket and go off by herself but claudine its your tennispractice time you must come hilary would say i must not was claudines reply and that was that angela played a neat and deft game she always brought her three beautiful rackets out with her in spite of every ones teasing pauline was jealous of them she tried to pay angela out by being spiteful ive two or three more rackets at home she said in a loud voice but it isnt good manners to bring more than one to school my mother says that would be showing off no wellbred person shows off nobody liked angelas conceit but nobody liked paulines spite either in fact few people liked pauline for rich and grand as she made out her people and her home to be she was a plain and unattractive girlunlike angela who was really lovely nobody could help looking at the angelfaced angela without admiration and pleasure alison thought she was the prettiest girl she bad ever seen eileen was moderately good at both tennis and swimming she was moderately good at her lessons too she look a liking to alison for some reason or other and was very upset when alison showed her far too plainly that she had no time for her why cant you sometimes walk with me when we go out in the afternoons eileen said to alison you cant always walk with angela and why do you always refuse when i offer you sweets they wont poison you i know said alison coldly i just dont want them thats all and i dont particularly want to walk with you either i suppose angela told you not to said eileen angrily you havent got any mind of your own have you whatever angela thinks you think i whatever angela does you do youre even trying to grow your hair the way she grows hersdown to your shoulders and curled under well you look a perfect fright like that alison was very offended she looked coldly at eileen well if you want to know angela doesnt approve of you and as she is my friend i respect her wishes anyway i dont approve of you either youre a telltale eileen walked away her face scarlet with rage alisons last hit had gone home eileen ran to her mother with tales and there was nothing the fourth form did that the new matron did not know about worse than that if eileen told her mother that some one had been horrid to her the matron soon saw to it that that some one was called to her room and shown a huge rent in one of her bedsheets to mend or holes in her games stockings or buttons off vests i believe she makes the holes on purpose and pulls the buttons off herself raged angela who had been given three stockings to darn in her sparetime ive never darned a stocking in my life whats a matron for if she doesnt keep our things mended well it is the rule at st clares that we do some of our own mending said pat but i must say angela i cant think that you made all those enormous holes in your stockings i ive never seen you with a hole yet oh i know i didnt make them said angela trying in vain to thread a needle with wool how do you make the wool go through the needles eye ive been trying to thread this for ages the girls laughed angela had no idea how to double over the end of the wool and thread the darningneedle in the right way alison took the needle and stocking away from her ill do your darning angela she said dont worry i bet its that telltale eileen that ran to her mother about something you said or didand so matron gave you this work to do out of spite alison darned the three stockingsnot very well it is true because darning was not one of alisons gifts but angela was grateful and was so sweet to alison that the girl was in the seventh heaven of delight pauline was the next to get into trouble with matron she like angela turned up her nose at eileen and would have no more to do with her than she could help when she told bobby one morning that she had a sore throat eileen overheard she went off out of the room and in a short while pauline was sent for i hear you have a sore throat pauline said matron with a thinlipped smile you should report to me at once eileen felt worried about you and told me it was very kind of her i have a gargle for you here and some medicine oh my throat is much better now said pauline in alarm and it wasbut matron was not going to let her off she made poor pauline gargle for ten minutes with ј horrible concoction and then gave her some equally nasty medicine to drink pauline went back to the others angry and afraid she glanced round the room to make sure that eileen was not there eileens been telling tales again she said she told her mother id got a sore throatand ive just been having an awful time i feel quite sick i know eileen told matron she didnt like me and thats why matron gave me such a beastly time well have to be careful what we say and do to eileen said alison scared for she hated medicine of any sort perhaps wed better be friendlier i shall not be friendlier said claudine that is a girl i do not like and far from being friendlier claudine really seemed to go out of her way to be rude to eileen the result was that matron came down heavily on claudine and gave her a whole basketful of mending to do i you have torn the hem of both your sheets she told claudine and you have holes in all your stockings and you need a patch in one of your vests you are a very naughty careless girl you will do most of this mending yourself as a punishment claudine said nothing she took the basket of mending and put it on top of her locker at first the girls thought she would simply forget all about it and refuse to do it as she refused to do other things but to their surprise claudine took down the mending and settled herself in a comer of the common room to do it bobby watched her needle flying in and out i say you do sew beautifully she said you really do and your darning is as good as embroidery its beautiful i like sewing and darning said claudine we are always taught that well in france you english girls are clumsy with your needles you can bang all kinds of silly balls about but you cannot make a beautiful darn claudine put that mending away now and come out and swim said susan its such a nice sunny day but nice sunny days did not appeal to claudine at all i can see the sun out of the window she said sewing away hard leave me i like sewing bobby stared hard at the bent head of the little french girl then she gave a chuckle claudine you like sewing a whole lot better than you like swimming and games dont you she said yes said claudine sewing is very okay i think the others laughed claudine always sounded funny when she brought american slang into her speech i believe this is all a little trick of claudines said bobby she wants to have a real excuse for getting out of games we all know we have to give up games time if we have mending to doand claudine has made matron give her a punishment that will get her out of games and give her something to do instead that she really likes miss ellis came into the room hurry up and go out girls she said dont waste a minute of this nice fine day claudine put away your sewing im sorry miss ellis but matron said i was to do my darning and mending before i could go to play with the others said claudine looking up with big innocent dark eyes it is very sadbut i suppose i must do this miss ellis hmm said miss ellis not at all taken in by the wideopen eyes ill have a word with matron but matron was quite insistent that claudine had been careless and must mend her things so miss ellis left the girl to her sewing and claudine had a very nice time sewing away happily in a corner of the sunny room hearing the shouts of the girls in the swimmingpool she had no wish whatever to join them horrible wet cold water she thought to herself and then looked up as she heard footsteps coming into the room it was her aunt mamzelle ah ma petite said mamzelle beaming so you are here let me see your sewing it is beautiful why cannot these english girls sew where are the others in the water said claudine in french always they are in the water or hitting a ball these english girls me i prefer to sew ma tante quite right little claudine said mamzelle who for all her years in england had never been able to understand why english girls liked cold water hitting balls and running madly about you are happy my little one yes thank you ma tante answered claudine demurely but i am a little dull does nothing ever happen in these english schools nothing said mamzelle but she was wrong things did happenand they were just about to i angela gets a surprise about the third week of the term when every one had settled down and got into their work angela had a surprise she had been playing tennis and one of the balls had been lost dont lets bother to look for it now said bobby who hated to stop in the middle of a game its sure to turn up tennis balls always do if it doesnt well look for it afterwards the ball hadnt turned up and angela had offered to look for it the others had musiclessons to go to or elocution practice angela was the only one free all right said hilary thanks angela you look for the ball and pop it back into the box with the others if you find it the other three girls ran back to the school and angela began to look for the lost ball it was nowhere to be seen the court they had been playing on backed on to a high wall and angela wondered if the ball could possibly have gone over it i remember bobby sending a pretty high ball once she thought to herself well it doesnt seem to be this side of the wallso ill just slip out of the garden gate here and look in the lane the girl opened the gate and went out into the narrow green lane she looked about for the ball and at last saw it as she went to get it she gave a start of surprise a tall rather thin youth was behind the bush near the ball angela picked up the ball and was about to go back into the school grounds when the boy spoke to her i saydo you belong to st clares angela looked at him and didnt like him he had hair that was curly and much too long his eyes were small and puffy underneath and he was very pale what business is it of yours whether i belong to st clares or not said angela in her haughtiest voice now look heredont go all stuffy and stupid said the boy coming out from behind the bush i just want a word with you well i dont want a word with you said angela and she opened the garden gate the boy tried to stop her going through wait a bit he said and his voice sounded so urgent that angela turned round in surprise i want you to take a message to one of the girls for me he said of course i shant do that said angela let me pass please you deserve to be reported for this listen you tell eileen that eddie wants to see her said the boy waitive got a note for her will you give it to her ohso youre eileens brother are you said angela all rightill give her the note but i cant think why you dont come right in and see your mother and eileen too if you want to your mother is matron here isnt she yes said eddie but for goodness sake dont go and tell my mother youve seen me she doesnt know im here id get into an awful row with her if she knew i was your mother gets lots of people into rows besides you i said angela taking the note the girl went through the gate and shut it then she stuffed the note into the pocket of her blazer meaning to give it to eileen when she saw her eileen was not about when angela went back to the cloakroom to change her shoes the girl saw alison there and began to tell her what had happened i say alison she said a funny thing happened just now i went out into the lane to look for a tennis ball and there was a boy there hiding graciousi said alison startled what did you do he was an awful creature said angela beginning to exaggerate as she usually did when she had a tale to tell honestly he looked like the boy who brings the fish here every dayyou know that awful boy with the toolong hair and the piercing whistle i half expected him to say ive brought the addock and ake and alibut miss like the fishboy said to matron the other day thinking she was the cook alison laughed so did one or two other girls in tne cloakroom angela loved an admiring audience she went on with her tale not seeing that eileen had come in to put away gym shoes well he asked me if i belonged to st clares and i put him properly in his place you may be sure t and then he told me who he was youll never guess the girls crowded round her in interest who said alison how should we know who it was well it was dear darling wonderful eddie eileens big brother said angela as common as could be i nearly asked him why he didnt get his hair cut some one elbowed her way roughly through the group round angela it was eileen her cheeks scarlet she glared at angela you frightful fibber she said my brothers nowhere near st clares i how dare you make up a story like that i shall go and tell my mother at onceyou hateful horrid little snob she burst into tears and went out of the door the girls stared after her i say said alison she really will go to matron and theres sure to be a row you didnt make it up did you angela angela raised her voice and shouted after eileen well go and tell if you likebut your darling eddie begged and begged me not to let your mother know he was here so you are just as likely to get him into a row as me eileen turned round looking scared it was plain that she now believed what angela said it had been eddie what did he say to you she asked angela in a strangled voice did he want to see me shant tell you said angela in an irritating voice i was going to do you a good turn and give you his message but if you behave like this im jolly well not going to be a gobetween for yon and dear darling eddie just at that very thrilling moment miss ellis put her head in at the door looking most annoyed girls didnt you hear the bell what in the world are you doing chattering here in the cloakroom you know that isnt allowed really i do wish you fourthformers would realize that you are halfway up the school and not in the first form i i am most annoyed at having to come and fetch you sorry miss ellis said every one and hurried to go out of the cloakroom back to the classroom where they had prep to do certainly they had heard the bellbut who could tear themselves away when a firstclass quarrel was going on between the angelic angela and the unpopular eileen angela felt delighted when she sat down at her desk now she had eileen exactly where she wanted herunder her thumb i and if eileen ever told tales of her again and got matron to give her heaps of mending to do she angela would threaten to tell matron about dear eddie i angela smiled a secret smile to herself which made her look more like an angel than ever it was extraordinary how angela could look so innocently beautiful when she was thinking spiteful thoughts i eileen saw the secret smile she pursed her lips together and ground her teeth she hated angela bitterly in that moment with as deep a hatred as the love she had for eddie how dared angela call eddie common how dared she say he was like that horrid little fishmongers boy with his long greasy hair and shrill whistle to eileen her brother edgar was the most wonderful being in the world their father had died when they were both very young and their mother was a hard and stern woman the little girl had turned to her big brother for love and companionship and the boy had guarded and cherished his sister tenderly as soon as i grow up ill get a fine job and make heaps of money for you and mother he told eileen then mother wont need to work so hard and be so tired and cross and you shall have lots of nice presents youll see what wonderful things ill do and now angela had poured scorn on to darling kind eddie eileen felt as if she must burst with anger and tears she was very anxious too why had eddie left woolaton where he worked and come to see her secretly what had happened oh if only that beast of an angela would tell her eileen thought of eddie out there in the lane she had not seen him for some weeks and she was longing to talk to him and tell him everything perhaps he felt the same and had got some time off to slip along and see her perhaps he didnt want to come up to the school because then he would have to see mother too and that would spoil the hearttoheart talk they might have together eileen looked at angela the girl was studying her french book looking serene and lovely eileen gritted her teeth again knowing that she would soon have to do something very difficult something she would hate and which yet would have to be done gracefully ill have to go and beg angelas pardon and ask her to tell me what eddie said thought eileen beast i do hate her she gave a loud sigh miss ellis looked up she had already seen that eileen was making no attempt at all to do her prep eileen dont you feel well she inquired as far as i can see you havent done any work at all im all right thank you miss ellis said eileen hurriedly thisthis french is a bit difficult today thats all i should think it must be very difficult to learn your french out of your geography book said miss ellis in her calm voice eileen looked hurriedly down at her bookdashit was her geography book she was holding i trust the sharp eyes of miss ellis to spot that i she said nothing but got out her french book angela looked round and gave a scornful little smile she knew quite well why it was that eileen muddled her books just thenshe was worried about dear darling eddie well let her worry alison sat next to eileen and she couldnt help feeling a little sorry for her although she was such a little scatterbrain alison was sensitive to the feelings of others and she knew that eileen was desperately longing to know about eddie so after prep was over she went to angela and spoke to her i say angelahadnt you better tell eileen her brothers message shes in an awful state she sighed so hard in prep that she almost blew my papers off the desk angela was not amused at alisons feeble little joke neither did she like her giving her advice of any sort she turned away and alisons heart sank now angela was going to go all cold and sulky again the beautiful little face was hard and haughty and alison knew it would be ages before she could get a smile out of her again she was just going after her when eileen came up a forced smile on her face angela can i speak to you for a minute alone please angela and eileen im busy said angela curtly no youre not said eileen trying to speak calmly and smilingly its important angela ou i hope youre going to apologize for your rudeness to me said angela haughtily i certainly shant speak to you unless you do im not going to let peoplelikeyou call me a hateful horrid snob eileen swallowed hard and forced herself to speak though the words almost choked her i beg your pardon angela ii just lost my temper carlotta overheard this conversation and unexpectedly came to eileens help well if yon ask my opinion i think angela ought to apologize to you eileen for some of her remarks said carlotta in her fresh candid voice im jolly certain i wouldnt apologize to herlittle cat angela turned on carlotta in a fury her blue eyes earning with spite you dont suppose we care what circusfolk think do you she said but instead of being crushed carlotta gave one of her hearty laughs if i wasnt in the fourth form id give you the hardest ip youve ever had in your life angelashe said amiably a good spanking would be the best thing you could have nobody has ever laid a finger on me in my life said angek feeling an intense desire to smack carlottas vivid little face i can tell that said carlotta youd be a lot nicer if they had come on eileen leave angek to her haughty ways and come and play cards with me in the common room eileen felt very grateful to carlotta for her unexpected help but she shook her head she had simply got to find out about eddie how unfortunate it was that it should be angek of all people that he had spoken to any of the others would have been decent about itexcept pauline perhaps carlotta shrugged her shoulders and went off to find bobby and the twins she didnt like eileen very much because she thought as the others did that she was a telltalebut all the same angela was behaving like a little cat to her putting out those claws of hers and giving as deep a scratch as she could angela turned to eileen well she said youve apologized and i accept your apology what do you want to say to me angela please tell me what eddie said begged eileen did he give you a message for me yes he gave me a letter said angela eileen went red with excitement and stared at angela eagerly please give it to me she said i dont see why i should said angela i dont think i ought to take notes and deliver them like this eileen knew that angela was saying this to irritate her she felt intensely angry but she kept her temper youll never have to do it again she said ill tell edgar he mustnt send in notes this way he must post a letter please give me the note now listen said angela suddenly getting down to business if i give you this note and dont tell your mother i saw her precious eddie youve got to promise me something what asked eileen in surprise ill promise you anything all right said angela youve jolly well got to promise me that youll never run sneaking to your mother about me see im not going to have shoals of mending to do any morei hate sewing and darning i know you complained to matron about me before and thats why she presented me with stockings that had holes in i never made youre not to say things like that about my mother said eileen well i shall said angela we all know you sneak to her about us sneak about the others all you likebut dont you sneak about me any more youll be sorry if you do there was nothing for it but to promise so eileen promised i wont sneak about you she said in a trembling voice i dont sneak if mother hands out sewing and mending its not my fault hmm said angela disbelievingly well all i canrsay isits a funny thing that as soon as any one dares to say anything about you matron heaps a beastly lot of mending on to them so that they have to miss games and swimming anyway eileen i warn youyouve got to tell your mother nice things about me or ill tell tales of you and say ive seen eddie and he didnt want his mother to know eileen bit her lip it was very hard to keep her temper during this long speech but she knew she had to for eddies sake ive apologized to you angela and ive promised you what you want she said in a low voice please give me the note now angela fished in her pocket for the note she was a long time about it pretending she had lost it feeling in her blouse for it as well as in her pockets eileen hated her for this petty meanness but she stood waiting patiently whilst angela looked at last angela produced the note eileen snatched it from her and without another word went off by herself to read it it was very short darling sis said the note i must see you dont say a word to mother we simply must have a talk can you meet me outside the gardendoor in the wall any time this evening ill wait behind a bush till you come your loving brother eddtk eileen read the note three times and then tore it up she was afraid her mother might find it and then she would be angry with eddie mother wasnt very sympathetic somehow she didnt seem to think much of eddie and was always telling him what a fine man his father had been and how curious it was that eddie hadnt done much good at school or won any scholarships or made her really proud of him ill slip down to the gardendoor and see eddie as soon as all the others are safely in the common room thought eileen poor old eddiehe must have been waiting a long time he couldnt send a letter through the post because mother would have been sure to see it and would have asked to read it the girl waited until she saw that all the fourthformers were in their common room she sat by the door and watched them doris and carlotta were fooling about and the others were watching them laughing claudine got up to join the two who were clowning and eileen saw that now was her chance she slipped out but one person saw her go that was angela who had been expecting eileen to slip away down to the lane it was forbidden for the girls to go out of the school grounds without permission after evening prep and angela smiled spitefully to herself if eileen makes a habit of meeting dear brother eddie out of hours i shall be able to hold that over her too thought angela she went out of the room and walked into a little musicroom that overlooked the school grounds it was difficult to see any one in the trees and bushes but because she knew exactly where to look angela was able to catch a glimpse of eileen now and again hurrying through the trees to the little gate in the wall she went back to the common room doris carlotta and claudine were still fooling about keeping every one in fits of laughter doris was a wonderful mimic car lotta coud do extraordinary tricks and claudine could imitate mamzelle her aunt to perfection angela could not see anything to laugh at at all do they really think its funny to pull faces and make themselves ugly and stupidlooking she thought to herself as she watched doris imitating an old charwoman and claudine playing up to her as a french maid she patted her beautiful pale gold hair comparing it with carlottas wild mop a smug little smile came on her lovely face she knew she was more beautiful than any other girl in the school what did brains and gifts matter every one stared at her in the street every one thought she must be a princess at least and perhaps one day she would marry a prince and be a real princess i angela dreamed away not listening to the chatter around her at all two people watched her one with envy and the other with devoted admiration the first was pauline who plain and unattractive envied angela her beauty and longed with all her heart to look like her but her own perfectly straight hair wellbrushed as it was would never shine like angelas nor would it curl under at the ends as angelas did so prettily angelas eyes were a brilliant startling bluepaulines were pale angelas cheeks were a beautiful rosy pink paulines seldom had any colour it was too bad that angela had so much and she pauline had so little in the way of looks i the other person watching angela was of course her devoted slave alison she wondered if angela had forgiven her for offering advice about eileen she tried to catch angelas eye but angela was lost in beautiful daydreams you do look so lovely angela whispered alison at last angela heard and smiled prettily she had forgotten that she was offended with alison she spoke to her in a low voice boasting of her conquest of eileen i ticked eileen off properly for being a sneak she said to alison i forbade her ever to sneak again and she promised she wouldnt oh angeladid you really make her promise that said alison youre wonderful you really are she looked round the common room i saywhere is eileen would you like to know said angela looking at the expensive gold watch on her wrist and seeing that there were only five minutes to go before bedtime well come with me and ill see if i can show you where our dear eileen is she took alison into the little musicroom see the school wall right down there she said you know the little door let into it there behind the tenniscourts well i think eileen has gone through there into the lane to talk to dear darling eddie i lookis that eileen coming back said alison golly shell get into a row if shes caught i yesits eileen all right said angela as a figure came into view between the trees and then disappeared again lets wait outside the commonroom door and catch her as she comes in so the two waited there eileen came quickly up the passage to the room and angela spoke to her wellhows dear darling eddie eileen stared at her hardly seeming to see her she looked pale and worried she pushed at the shut door of the common room meaning to go and fetch her nightdress which she had been mending but angela stopped her you didnt answer my question she said in a smooth little voice hows dear darling eddie eileen faced the spiteful girl eddies all right she said in a trembling voice eddies fine he had lots of good news to tell me hes getting on well she went into the common room alison felt uncomfortable again she didnt like this teasing there was something spiteful in itbut how could she dare to find fault with the honourable angela claudine gets her own way this is a jolly nice term said pat to isabel as they dried themselves after swimming in the big bathingpool i simply adore all this openair lifetennis and swimming and riding and gardeningand today we even had lessons outofdoors it was so hot isabel grinned poor old claudine doesnt like the open air as much as we do she said wasnt she funny in maths claudine had indeed been funny to begin with she had been quite horrified to hear that miss ellis proposed to take lessons outofdoors under the trees apparently no school she had ever been to had ever thought of doing such a thing lessons outofdoors said the little french girl but why what is the matter with indoors i do not like this outofdoorsthe sun is too hot it burns me pity it doesnt burn you a bit more grinned bobby who was as brown as an acorn look at us all brown and tannedand you are like a lily pale and white claudine looked down at her lilywhite hands with great satisfaction that is another thing i do not understand about you sojolly english girls she said it is not pretty to get burnt it is ugly to grow frecklesand yet you try to grow as brown as you can all day long i me i like to be whiteskinned it is more natural more becoming and nowwhat can miss ellis be thinking of to say lessons outofdoors i i shall take a sunshade with me for i will not grow one single freckle but miss ellis did not approve of sunshades being brought out in a maths lesson she looked at claudine with disapproval i dont know if you are merely being funny claudine or if you seriously think that you need a sunshade under the trees where there is no sunbut whatever your reason the sunshade must go back to the school at once i cant imagine where you got it the sunshade had been used in a play and was simply enormous claudine was quite lost under it she looked at miss ellis pathetically please chere miss ellis i am not making a joke it is because i do not wish to grow a freckle on my nose she said beseechingly a freckle is not for a french girl freckles are english miss ellis and i do not want to grow them oh freckles can be french as much as english said miss ellis it will do your pale face good to have a few nice brown freckles here and there claudine take the sunshade back please and dont bring it out again oh please miss ellis couldnt claudine and i share the sunshade said angela who also had a fear of freckles her face was tanned a rosybrown and she had no freckles at allshe was careful not to get too sunburnt for she knew that would spoil her delicate beauty she gave bobbys face a scornful glance it was absolutely covered with little brown freckles right to the tip of the upturned nose i couldnt bear to get freckled like poor bobby went on angela no spite showing in her smooth little voice this sun is so hot miss ellisjust see how it has treated bobby dont you believe it said bobby not standing any nonsense of that sort my face is freckled winter and summer alike nothing to do with the summer sun i was born with freckles the class giggled and bobby opened her mouth to continue but miss ellis knew bobbys speeches and spoke first that will do bobby i dont want any more of the maths lesson wasted on freckles claudine take the sunshade back angela dont look as if you are going to faint awayit would do both you and claudine good to get a few frecklesclaudine because she sits too much and you because you think too much of your it would be better if you thought a little more about your work you may think it is amusing to be bottom each week as you have been so far but i must i cant see the joke angela flushed how horrid miss ellis could be i she caught a satisfied smile on paulines face pauline was than angelathat was one way in which she was better than angela anyhow angela scowled and glanced at alison for comfort alison gave it smiling adoringly and making a face at miss ellis lessons outofdoors were not a success at all with claudine in the class she screamed whenever an insect flew near and if a bird dared to fly suddenly out of a bush she made every one jump by her yells miss ellis got very tired of her now whats the matter claudine she said when a bee flew near the girl and hummed in her ear claudine had squealed jumped up and run to the other end of the long table on which every one was working it is an animal that goes zzzz and carries a sting miss ellis said claudine looking genuinely frightened a bee said miss ellis in disgust it wont sting i you sit down you are disturbing all the others the next thing that upset claudine was an ant it crawled up her leg and she suddenly felt it she gave such an agonized yell that every one jumped violently claudine i shall send you indoors if you squeal again said miss ellis in exasperation whats the matter now claudine was undoing her suspender with trembling hands giving little squeals and french exclamations all the time the ant had explored the inside of the top of her stocking the girls went into fits of laughter and miss ellis rapped angrily on her table claudine what are you doing surely you are not taking off your stockings claudine was deaf to anything that miss ellis said when she at last saw the ant inside her stocking she did not dare to touch it and gazed round with such an agonized expression on her face that bobby took pity on her and flicked the ant deftly on to the grass ah said claudine merci bien bobbee i what a terrible thing to happen to me much more terrible things will happen to you if i have any more disturbance said miss ellis hi such a grim tone that claudine was much astonished she sat down again doing up her suspender one more squeal from you and you go indoors said miss ellis claudine gazed at her thoughtfully if there was one thing more than another that claudine wanted at that moment it was to go indoors where creatures that flew and crawled did not molest her she waited until miss ellis had bent her head to correct hilarys book and then she let out a piercing yell that made her neighbour pauline jump so violently that she upset the ink over the table miss ellis leapt to her feet her usual calmness quite deserting her claudine this behaviour is intolerable go indoors at once and find the mistress in the teachers common room who is free at the moment tell her i sent you in in disgrace and ask her to let her sit with you whilst you do your maths and if there is a single mistake in your paper i shall have a great deal to say about it i am thoroughly displeased with you with the greatest cheerfulness and alacrity claudine obeyed miss ellis scurrying indoors with her books before the mistress could change her mind doris exploded into one of her giggles miss ellis glanced at her sharply and doris subsided it then occurred to miss ellis that claudine as usual had got exactly what she wanted in her usual unscrupulous way miss ellis wondered who the mistress was who would be in the teachers common room just then she thought it would be miss rollins that was good miss rollins was very strict and would make claudine feel very small and humble before she had done with her but it was not miss rollins much to claudines delight when she knocked timidly on the mistresss commonroom door she ran over in her mind what mistress was likely to be there she hoped it would be the art mistress she had a sense of fun and was very jolly she opened the door and went inand she saw that it was mamzelle mamzelle was having a cosy time by herself she had taken off her big flatheeled shoes and had opened the collar of her highnecked blouse it was such a hot day she was halfasleep over her exercise books when the small neat figure of claudine appeared they stared at each other why are you here claudine asked mamzelle severely in french claudine at once poured out a voluble and heartrending explanationhow all the insects and winged beasts of that horrible english outofdoors had molested her yes and bitten her and stung her and altogether made life not worth living and the sun had burnt her and she was sure she had dozens of those sougly freckles coming and what would her dear mother say to that ah life was very very hard at this sosporting english school with its love for the cold cold water and for striking at balls so many times a week and for its detestable naturewalks and mamzelle sympathized wholeheartedly she too detested too much sun and insects and reptiles of any kind filled her with fear and disgust she forgot to inquire whether claudine had come in of her own accord or had been sent in in disgrace soon the two were talking nineteen to the dozen going back in their thoughts to their beloved france where girls were proper girls and studied and did sewing and embroidery and did not rush about in the mad way that all english girls did so later on when miss ellis asked mamzelle if she had scolded claudine properly for being sent indoors in disgrace mamzelle got a shock she stared at miss ellis in dismay ah the poor little claudine she said at last you must not be too hard on her miss ellis it is so difficult for a poor little foreign girl to learn your english ways miss ellis snorted i suppose that means that you and claudine patted each other on the back and that you believed everything the naughty little girl saidand i should think it is very likely that you helped her to do her maths too she has never got all her sums right before mamzelle felt extremely uncomfortable she had helped claudine with her workand certainly she had believed every word she said would claudine deceive her own good aunt no noimpossible but when mamzellethought things over she knew that the clever little claudine could and would deceive her if she felt inclined to mamzelle loved claudine very much and thought the world of herbut all the same sometimes a doubt came into her mindwasnt claudine just a little too clever didnt she get her own way just a little too often the trouble wasyou never knew what claudine wanted until she had got it and then it was too late to do anything about it my word said bobby when the maths lesson came to an end and the girls packed up their books that little monkey of a claudine can do anything she likes and get away with it i bet shes had a perfectly lovely time indoors so she had she came beaming to meet miss ellis at the end of the morning with a prettilyworded apology ah miss ellis i am so so ashamed of myself you english you are not frightened of anything you keep the hairs on your head always always you are calmbut me i am a silly little french girl so please excuse me and i will do better in future my aunt was veiy very angry with me she caused me to cry bitterly see how red my eyes are miss ellis saw no signs of red eyes and felt quite certain that mamzelle had not been angry at all all the same she found it difficult to hide a smile claudine was so very very earnest and apologetic ill forgive you this time claudine she said but you be careful next time the term goes on although the girls knew quite well that claudine told fibs when it suited her borrowed without asking and still copied answers from other peoples books if she wanted to they couldnt help liking her she was very funny generous in her own way and never took offence whatever was said to her she might easily have taken offence at things that angela said or pauline angela looked down on her in the same way that she looked down on eileenbecause she was a pupil who was probably not paying the school fees charitygirls both of them she said to alison scornfully i must say i didnt think wed get them at schools like this if bobby hilary or the twins overheard things like this they ticked angela off unmercifully look here pat said once we dont like eileen any more than you dobut youve got to realize angela that if eileens mother gets eileen here for nothing its because of the work she does herself as matron and it doesnt matter tuppence if you pay for things in work or in money its good payment just the same and eileen isnt kept by charity as you call it youre a disgusting little snob angela hated to be called a snob she shut her book with a bang snob she said thats a favourite word of yours for some one who happens to be out of the top drawer think of something more original to say right said bobby at once you think that claudine is a charitygirl toowell instead of saying that to us what about saying it to mamzelleor even to claudine herself youre too cowardly to do that youll hit at eileen because youve got some hold over her and she cant hit backbut you darent hit at claudine openly because shes quite likely to fly at you and scratch your angelic face or put mamzelle on the warpath after you oh youre impossible said angela angrily i shall ask my mother to take me away at halfterm in fact when she comes here and sees what kind of girls i have to live with im certain shell take me away with her then and there golly if only your mother would be sensible enough to do that sighed bobby but she wont i know mothers shell leave you here to be a pest to us for the rest of the term tears of anger came into angelas eyes in all her spoilt petted life she had never been spoken to like this she was angry hurt and miserable she blinked back her tears because a tearstained face spoilt her beauty she went to find alison alison could always put soothing ointment on to angelas wounds in her usual featherheaded way she made herself quite blind to angelas grave faults and saw only the loveliness of angelas face and the beauty of her clothes and possessions poor alison always seemed to attach herself to the wrong kind of people shell never learn said hilary i did think once when she was in the second form and was so keen on that awful drama mistress miss quentin that she had learnt a pretty sharp lessonyou remember how miss quentin let her down dont you she pretended to be awfully fond of alison and then laughed at her behind her back the twins nodded yes said pat its really a pity that alison isnt happy unless she is worshipping someone shes awfully bad for angela as soon as we get a bit of sense into angelas head alison gets it out by saying shes wonderful too lovely for words and all the rest of it i must say shes not a bit like you two said bobby youve got plenty of common sense its funny you should have a cousin like alison the weather went on being hot and sunny with blue skies every day the girls swam and played games to their hearts content they all got very brown except claudine who managed to remain pale as a lily in spite of everything she worried very much one week because she felt sure she had a freckle coming on her nose the girls teased her unmercifully golly isnt claudines freckle getting pronounced said hilary staring at claudines dainty little nose yes its going to be a real beautysaid pat big as a threepenny bit said isabel claudine gave a squeal of horror and fished out the little mirror she always carried with her she and angela and alison always carried small minors about with them and were for ever examining their faces for something or other i have no freckle she announced indignantly you talk under your hats the girls laughed claudine you talk through your hat not under it said bobby but if you want to keep a secret you keep it under your hat see claudine sighed ah your english sayings are so difficult i will rememberto talk through your hat means to be sillyto keep something under your hat means to keep a secret ahthere goes one who keeps something under her hat the girls turned to see who claudine meant it was eileen paterson yeseileen does seem to be all bottled up somehow said hilary rather worried as if shes got a secret and is afraid some one will get to know it shes been looking rather miserable sometimes well shes got her mother here to tell anything to said pat the others made scornful noises pooh said bobby would you tell matron anything if she were your mother i know i wouldnt shes as hard as nails i hope to goodness im never ill whilst shes here as matron i shouldnt fancy being looked after by her the girls were all rather careful in the way they treated eileen now because they felt certain that any slight intended or otherwise that they showed eileen was reported to matron and then matron landed them with all kinds of unexpected mending to do all except angela angela could say and do what she liked to eileen matron always seemed to look on angela with a favourable eye eileen did not dare to tell tales of her i think eileen misses that dear brother of hers said bobby you know what angela told ushow he came to see her but didnt want to see his mother i get hes in some kind of trouble and eileens worried about it poor eileen said hilary ill just pump her a bit and see so hilary kindly and tactfully pumped eileen but she learnt very little how old is your brother eileen she said is he like you at all eileen fetched a snapshot and showed it to hilary she seemed glad of the chance of talking about eddie eddies eighteen she said two years older than i am hes fine hilary but hes never had much chance you see my father died when we were so little eddie ought to be at college now but hes got to earn his living hilary looked at the snap of the rather weaklooking boy in the picture he looked kind but that was about all one could say what work is he doing she asked hes in engineering works she said hes doing awfully well hell make a lot of money one day youre not worried about him are you said hilary kindly looking at the flushed face of the girl beside her eileen answered at once worried about him of course not why should i be i wish i saw him more often thats all you see until this term when mother took this job we all lived together now hes in lodgings and i do miss him a lot hilary said no more she still thought that eileen looked worried and certainly she did not pay as much attention to her lessons as miss ellis expectedbut after all thought hilary it was enough to make any one look worried if they had to listen to matrons grumbles in their sparetime eileen had to help her mother with the school linen every week and sometimes when the girls passed matrons room they could hear her grumbling away at eileen true eileen answered back sometimes but usually she listened in silence some of the girls felt sorry for eileen others were glad because they knew she was a taleteller when it suited her to pass on things she had heard in the fourth form another week or two went by and halfterm began to come near three or four fourthform birthdays came along too and there was a good deal of presentbuying angela had unlimited pocketmoney and bought most extravagant presents pauline tried to vie with her and to buy marvellous gifts too but it was impossible to spend as much as angela did t she thought nothing of spending ten shillings on a bottle of bath salts or a laceedged handkerchief eileen gave no presents at all sorry she said to hilary whose birthday it was id like to give you somethingbut ive no money at the moment many happy returns of the day anyway thanks said hilary thinking that eileen could be very straightforward and honest and liking her at that moment for being courageous enough to own up to having no money at all angela presented hilary with a magnificent blotter made of real leather and decorated very beautifully at the comers hilary liked it very much then pauline presented her with a purse on which were hilarys initials hww oh paulinehow beautiful said hilary but i wish you wouldnt spend so much money on me im sure you cant afford it this was an unfortunate remark to make to pauline who was very touchy about money and was always trying to compete with angela she flushed and answered stiffly you know that my family the binghamjoneses are wealthy she said putting on the affected voice that hilary detested i have as much money as i wish its true i dont splash it about in the vulgar way that angela doesi hope i am betterbred than that but i have all i ask for hilary so please accept this purse with my best wishes and dont think it cost any more than i could afford what with the binghamjoneses and the honourable favorleighs were just overwhelmed with highandmightiness said pat to isabel with a giggle well i think i prefer pauline of the twoangela is really too spiteful for words sometimesand she says the cattiest things with the most angelic smile on her face i cant say i think a great deal of any of the four new girls considering everything said isabel wrinkling her forehead and thinking angelas a spiteful snob pauline is an envious snob claudine is amusing but quite unscrupuloushasnt any sense of honour at all as far as i can seeand eileen is a sneak and a bit of a bore gollyyou sound pretty catty yourself isabel said pat no im not said isabel earnestly im only just sizing them all up im not like alison unable to see beyond a pretty face and though i dont think much of any of those four you know jolly well id help every one of them if they were in trouble and if youre really catty you dont feel like that do you no you dont said pat youre quite right old thingit doesnt matter seeing people for what they are and even disliking themso long as youre willing to help if necessary preparing for halfterm halfterm came along very shortly and the girls were excited because their parents were coming to see them there were to be tennismatches and swimmingmatches for the parents to watch hilary bobby the twins and one or two others were excited about these because they hoped to be in the teams id like my mother to see me swim under water for the whole length of the bath said bobby she was a very good swimmer herself when she was young hope im chosen for the swimmingcompetitions the twins hoped to be in one of the tennismatches they were both good at tennis and it would be lovely for their mother to see them play together and win a match both girls were intensely proud of st clares and badly wanted to show off their school and their own prowess to the best advantage hilary was to play in a singles match with one of the fifthformers she had been chosen for her very graceful style and it was to be an exhibition match more than a battle both girls had a beautiful natural style and the gamesmistress was proud of them mirabel was hoping to win the onelength race in the swimmingbath she was very fast and very strong her smaller friend the mouselike gladys was also in the swimming competitions for although she was small she was a beautiful little swimmer she was longing for her mother to see her she had no father and no brother or sister so her mother was everything to her halfterm will be fun said hilary is your mother coming angela of course said angela and daddy too im longing to see their new car its a rollsbentley black with a green line and i bet youre looking forward to seeing the new car more than to seeing your people said bobby with a chuckle you never talk of your parents except in terms of the wealth they own angela did you know that angela looked sulky i dont know what you mean she said i guess youd talk about cars and things if your parents had the same as mine and you just see my mother when she comes she will stand out above every one else shes absolutely beautifulgolden hair like mineand the bluest eyesand she wears the most marvellous clothes and even the safetypins she uses are made of pure gold set with diamonds finished pat thats not funny said angela as the others shouted with laughter i tell you you just wait and see my mother i shes the most beautiful person youll ever see what a pity you dont take after her angela said bobby sorrowfully isnt your mother sorry to have a daughter like you you must be a terrible disappointment angela flushed with anger she could never bear this kind of teasing all right she said in a bitter voice all right but just wait till you see my motherand then tell me if she isnt the most wonderful person you ever saw in your lives i hope she wears her doublestring of pearls they are worth five thousand pounds well said the soft voice of gladys who rarely butted in on any conversation of this sort well i dont care if my mother wears her very oldest clothes i dont care if shes got a ladder in her stockings i dont care if she hasnt even powdered her noseso long as my mother comes to see me and i can be with her for a few hours she can be the untidiest ugliest poorestdressed there but i shall still be proud of her and think shes the best of all this was a long speech for the timid gladys to make every one was silent when she stopped pat found that she suddenly had tears in her eyes there was such love in gladyss voiceand what she said was fine that was the way to love some onenot to care how they looked or what they didbut just to welcome them all the same i even angela was taken aback she stared at gladys in surprise she was about to make a sneering remark but bobby stopped her now you shut up said bobby in a warning voice gladys has said the last word about mothers and shes right good for you gladys after that angela said no more but privately she rejoiced when she thought of her own beautifullydressed mother and how the girls would have to admire her and her clothes when she came are your parents coming said hilary to pauline oh yes said pauline in a bright voice and she began to talk eagerly of them my father is such a goodlooking man and mother is sweet i do hope she wears the dress she bought in the holidaysits really beautiful it makes her look so young and pretty pauline chattered away about her parents in her way as much of a snob as angela though far more than angela she talked of them as real people generous kind amusing instead of people cluttered up with great possessions paulines people sound rather nice said pat i shall take a good look at angelas familyi sort of feel that her father will wear diamond buttons on his coat and her mother will wear five or six furs at once isabel giggled well im rather glad that our mother is just ordinary she said pretty and kind and sensible just an ordinary nice mother the girls all practised hard for halfterm swimming and playing tennis as much as they could so that their parents might be proud of them there was to be an exhibition of pictures too done by the girls themselves and a show of needlework here claudine expected to shine she had done a really beautiful cushioncover on which was embroidered a peacock spreading its lovely tail mamzelle was intensely proud of this she bored every one by talking about it it is exquisite she said ah the clever little claudine miss ellis do you not think that claudine has done the tail most perfectly i do said miss ellis much better than she does her maths or her history or her geography or her literature or her come come said mamzelle hurt it is not given to us to have great gifts at everything now the little claudine she i dont expect claudine to have great gifts at anything but needlework said miss ellis all i ask is a little attention in class and a little thought in prep time i you spoil claudine mamzelle i i i spoil claudine cried mamzelle her glasses falling off her nose in rage i have never spoilt any girl never always i am strict always i am fair always i am all right mamzelle said miss ellis hastily seeing that mamzelle was going to make one of her long and impassioned speeches all right i must go you can tell it all to me when you see me next mamzelle sought out claudine she fell upon her and hugged her much to claudines surprise but it had suddenly occurred to mamzelle that the poor little claudine would not have parents visiting her at halfterm for they were in france so immediately on this she had gone to comfort claudine who however was not in any need of comfort at all she liked her parents but as she was one of a very large family and had only got a small share of their love and attention she had not missed them very much ah my little claudine said mamzelle flinging her arms round the astonished claudine do not be sad do not be discouraged do not fret yourselfyou shall not be alone at halfterm claudine wondered if her aunt had gone mad i am not sad ma tante she said what is the matter has anything happened no no said mamzelle still full of tender thoughts for her little claudine nothing has happened it is only that i feel for you because your parents will not be with you at halfterm when every one else has their handsome fathers and their sobeautiful mothers you wfll have no oneno one but your loving aunt mathilde i well thats okay said claudine in english mamiclle wrinkled up her nose and her glasses fell off do not use these expressions t she said they are vulgar ah my little claudine you will not have any parents to admire your sofine cushioncase with its magnificent peacockbut i will be there my little one i will stand by your cushioncover all the time not one minute will i go away and i will say to every one i see see the beautiful cover made by the clever claudine ah it needs a french girl to do such work as this regard the tail regard each feather so finelydone in silk regard the priceless cushioncover the most beautiful thing in this school today oh aunt mathilde i wish you wouldnt think of saying anything like that said claudine in alarm the girls would laugh like anything they would tease me terribly please dont i shant be lonely i shant mind not having any one there ah the brave little one sighed mamzelle wiping away a tear from her eye i see your courage tou will not show others that you suffer i shant suffer said claudine getting impatient i shant really aunt mathilde please dont make a fuss like this it would be dreadful if you stood by my cushioncover all the afternoon and made remarks like that the idea of mamzelle standing like a bulldog on guard telling surprised parents of her poor lonely little claudine and praising to the skies the little cushioncover filled claudine with horror she began to wish that halfterm was safely over but it hadnt even come i four days awaythree daystwo daysthe night before ah now it really was near i the girls went to bed very excited that night and talked in whispers long after lights were out susan howes the headgirl of the form pretended to be asleep she could not bear to be a spoilsport on the night before halfterm strict as she was on all other nights angela was thinking of the wonderful impression her mother would make and how she would bask in her reflected glory she hoped her mother would wear her famous pearlsand that wonderful fox fur eileen was thinking about her own mother she would be there as matron not all dressed up and pretty as other peoples mothers would be she wished that eddie could be therenot because she was going to do anything in the swimming or tennis matches or had anything in the art or needle work exhibitionbut because it would have been lovely to have seen him looking for herher own darling big brother alison was looking forward to seeing her own pretty mother and also to seeing angelas mother too she hoped the two would be friends it would be lovely if they liked one another and what fun if angelas mother asked her alison to stay with them in the holidays that would be fine pauline was thinking of her parents too so was bobby it seemed a long time since the last holidays school was funbut your own home and people were something very solid and real and lovely it would be nice to get a bit of them tomorrow one by one the girls fell asleep bobby was the first to wake up she sat up and spoke loudly wake up you sleepyheads its halfterm halfterm at last halfterm saturday was a perfectly beautiful day the sun shone down from a blue sky that hadnt a single cloud in it gorgeous isnt it claudine said doris happily to the little french girl couldnt be better claudine groaned to think we shall all have to be outofdoors in this terrible sun she said i know i shall get a freckle i wish it had rained you spoilsport said bobby grinning you would like to huddle indoors even on a day like this come on cheer up and smileits really a heavenly day the art exhibition was all ready for the parents to admire there were some really good pictures there miss walker the art mistress was proud of them she had a watercolour class which went out regularly to paint country scenes with her and some of them were very good good enough to sell said claudine do we sell our work how much would you get for this sobeautiful picture hilary hilary laughed you have got funny ideas claudine she said of course we dont sell our work as if our proud parents would let us no they will take our pictures home and our pottery and place them in conspicuous places on the walls or mantelpiece so that all their friends can admire them and say how clever your daughter must be mrs soandso i i bet your mother will be pleased if you send her that lovely cushioncover of yours for her birthday said pat claudine laughed i have three sisters who do much more beautiful work than i do she said my mother would look at my cover and say ah the little claudine is improving this is not bad for a beginning mamzelle thinks its wonderful anyhow said bobby grinning theres one thing about you claudine youre not in the least conceited with all the fuss that every one has made of your embroidery you might quite well have begun to swank about it but you dont ah i know that it is good compared with thesewing of you english girls said claudine seriously but you see i know that it would be quite ordinary in france i have a different standard to compare that sobeautiful cover with and i cannot think it is as wonderful as you do claudine was a very funny mixture of honesty sincerity and deceitfulness even her deceitfulness was queer because she did not attempt to hide it she often tried to deceive miss ellis for instance and if miss ellis saw through it claudine would at once admit to her attempted deceit without any shame it was almost as if she were playing a game with the teachers trying to get the better of them but not trying to hide the fact that she was trying to get the better of them the girls could not quite make her out pat and isabel were playing together in a schoolmatch and they were delighted they looked out their white skirts and blouses their red socks and white shoes and took the clothes to matron for the schoolmaid to iron every one had to look their best when parents came pauline looked a little miserable at breakfasttime and the girls wondered why hilary spoke to her in her usual kindly way whats up pauline youre looking glum youre not upset because you havent been chosen to play in the schoolmatches are you oh no said pauline ive had a great disappointment thats all what asked hilary and the other girls came round to hear well you see said pauline its most unfortunate mother is ill and my father doesnt like to leave herso they wont be coming today and i was so looking forward to them being here and seeing everything bad luck pauline said the twins sympathetically a disappointment of that kind was awful at the last minute every one was very sorry i hope your mother isnt really ill said susan howes no not seriously said pauline but she cant possibly come oh dearand i did so badly want you all to see my goodlooking father and my pretty mother i even wrote to ask her if she would wear the pretty new frock i liked so much and she said she would well never mind said isabel feeling very sorry indeed you can come out with us and our people if you like pauline then you wont feel so lonely oh thank you said pauline and after that she teemed to cheer up a good deal and entered into everything with enthusiasm mamzelle had displayed claudines beautiful cushioncover in a very prominent place she still seemed inclined to fall on claudines neck and tell her she must not feel lonely and the little french girl kept out of her way as much as possible slipping deftly round the corner whenever she saw her aunt approaching sort of hideandseek youre playing claudine said bobby youll have to have a word with mamzelle soon or shell burst shes longing to show you how beautifully she has arranged your somarvellous cushioncover lunch was a very scrappy affair that day because the maids were concerned with the strawberry tea that the parents were to have in the afternoon and scores of pounds of strawberries were being prepared in big glass dishes the cooks had made the most lovely cakes and biscuits and there were sandwiches of every kind the girls kept peeping into the big diningroom where the dishes were all set out claudine slipped in and sampled some of the strawberries she was the only one who dared to do this youll get into a row if any one catches you said bobby you go and taste them said claudine running her little pink tongue round her crimson lips they are so sweet and juicy no said bobby weve been put on our honour not to sample this afternoons tea and i wouldnt dream of breaking my honour this honour of yours it is a funny thing said claudine it is a most uncomfortable thing it stops you from doing what you want to do i have no honour to worry me i will never have this honour of yours i do not like it youre awful claudine said angela screwing up her nose you do exactly as you like im glad im not as dishonourable as you are the tone was very unpleasant but claudine only laughed she hardly ever took offence ah angela she said you think it is worse to take a few strawberries than to tell untruths about another girl behind her back me i think it is really dishonourable to speak lies against another girl as you do to me you are dishonourable a worthnothing girl not because of a few strawberries but because of your evil tongue the listening girls laughed at this it was said in a pleasant voice but there was such truth in it and the tables had been turned so cleverly on angela that the girls couldnt help being amused only angela was angry but there was little time to quarrel on halfterm day there were so many jobs to do and every one had her own allotted task some had to do the flowers all over the school and this took a long time the vases had to be washed old flowers thrown away new ones picked and then arranged i to the best advantage in all kinds of bowls jars and vases the twins were especially good at this and were very busy all the morning after lunch every one changed into either sports frocks or school uniform the summer uniform was a brightlycoloured tunic the girls could choose any colour they liked so every girl was able to wear the one that suited her best dark girls like carlotta chose reds and oranges fair girls like angela chose pale colours blues and pinks they looked like flowers moving about against the green lawns of the school grounds on that hot summer day the parents are arriving squealed alison as she heard the sound of wheels coming up the drive the first lot are here who are they the fourthformers looked out of their windows but nobody knew the people in the car they must belong to some of the lower school said bobby here come some more theyre mine cried janet oh goodygoody i hoped theyd come early i say doesnt my mother look nice and brown im going to greet them she sped off happily more and more cars drove up the drive and soon the lawns were crowded with fathers and mothers and aunts and with younger or older brothers and sisters how eileen wished that eddie could be there eileens mother was very trim and starched in her matrons uniform and white apron some of the parents went to talk to her about the health of their children eileen was glad that her mother was sought out by so many parentsbut she could not help wishing that she had on a pretty frock and looked as sweet and attractive as many of the other girls mothers mother ought to smile more thought eileen she looks so strict and hard look at the twins mother over thereshes really sweet and i do like the way shes got her arm round both pat and isabel mother never puts her arm round me or eddie an enormous car rolled up the drive with a smartlyuniformed chauffeur in front it was a beautiful new rollsbentley black with a small green line it came to a stop and the chauffeur got out angela gave a loud squeal thats our new car look every one isnt it a beauty i and do you like the chauffeurs uniform black with green piping to match the car the cushions are black too with green edges and green monograms i should have thought you would have been so excited to see your parents that you wouldnt even have noticed the car said janets cool voice but angela took no notice she was very pleased indeed that so many of the fourthformers were near when her grand new car drove up the chauffeur opened the cardoor angelas mother stepped out certainly she was a vision of beauty she looked very young was extraordinarily like angela and she was dressed in a most exquisite fashion the girls stared at her she looked round with brilliant blue eyes also very like angelas after her came her husband a tall soldierlylooking man with rather a serious face angela gave another squeal she ran to her parents and flung her arms round her mother as she had seen the others do purposely exaggerating everything because she knew they were watching angela dear be careful of my dress said her mother let me see how you are looking her father gave angela a good hug and then pushed her a little way away so that he could have a good look at her she looks very well indeed said her father but this awful school uniform spoils her said her mother i do think it is most unbecoming and i cant bear those terrible school shoes with their flat heels well all the girls wear the same said angelas father reasonably i think angela looks very nice if only the school had a prettier uniform said angelas mother in a complaining voice that was one reason why i didnt want to send her herethe dress was so ugly angelas wonderful mother the complaining voice of angelas mother could be heard very often indeed that afternoon beautiful as she was attractive and exquisite in her dress and looks the lovely face was spoilt by an expression of discontent and boredom she complained of so many things and her voice was umortunately harsh and too loud i she complained of the hard bench that she had to sit on to watch the tennismatches she found fault with the cup of tea that angela brought her what terrible tea they might at least provide china tea you know i cant drink indian tea angela she complained of the cake she took awfully dry she said i can hardly eat it leave it then said angelas father and to angelas horror her mother dropped the cake on the ground where it could be trodden underfoot the sharp eyes of the other girls noted all these things and angela began to feel rather uncomfortable isnt my mother lovely she whispered to alison dont you think those pearls are marvellous hasnt she got beautiful hair alison agreed privately she thought that angelas mother acted like a spoilt child complaining and grumbling all the time she did not praise the pictures in the art exhibition neither did she show any enthusiasm for the pottery work she was forced to express a good opinion on claudines cushioncover because mamzelle stood there like a dragon looking so fierce that every one felt they must praise her nieces handiwork ah so this is your mother angela said mamzelle in a most amiable voice we will show her the work of the little claudine is it not beautiful see the exquisite stitches regard the fine tail spreading so well over the cover angelas mother looked as if she was going to pass the cover by without saying anything but mamzelle was certainly not going to let that happen she took hold of the visitors arm and almost forced her to bend over claudines cushioncover you have not seen it it is a work of art it is the finest thing in the exhibition said mamzelle getting excited very nice said angelas mother in a tone that seemed to say very nasty she took her arm away from mamzelles hand brushed her sleeve as if it had rsome dust left on it and turned away impatiently who is that awful old woman she asked angela in much too loud a voice surely she doesnt teach you my dear did you ever see any one look so dowdy the girls were very fond of mamzelle and they were angry to hear this remark bobby felt certain that mamzelle herself had caught some of it the frenchwoman was standing looking after angela and her parents with a puzzled and hurt expression in her eyes welli always thought angela was pretty beastly said bobby to pat in a low tone and now i see where she gets her cattiness from how ashamed id be of my mother if she walked round like that criticizing things and people at the top of her voice poor old mamzelle its a shame to hurt her claudine had overheard the remarks made by angelas mother and she too was hurt and angry she was fond of her aunt mathilde and though she was cross with her for standing by her cushioncover and behaving in such an exaggerated way about it she saw that it was the intense love and pride she had for claudine herself that made her do it she looked at angelas beautiful mother she noted her discontented face and the petulant droop of the mouth that at times quite spoilt its loveliness she thought of all the hurts and insults that that beautiful mouth must have uttered through the years and claudine longed to punish angelas mother in some dramatic way for the cruel words she had spoken about her aunt mathilde angela took her parents to the swimmingpool st clares was proud of this for it was one of the finest and biggest swimmingpools owned by any school in the kingdom the water lapped against the sides a beautiful bluegreen colour but even here angelas mother had fault to find i suppose they change the water every day angela she said no mother twice a week sometimes three times said angela her mother gave a little disgusted squeal good gracious to think they cant even change the water every day what a school i i really must make a complaint about it angela you are not to bathe in the pool unless the water has just been changed i forbid it but mother began angela uncomfortably i have to do what the others doand really the water is quite clean even when its two days old or three i shall complain said angelas mother i never did like the idea of sending you here its a secondrate school i think i wanted to send you to high towers school such a nice school i cant think why your father wanted to send you here perhaps now he has seen it he will think again pamela dont talk so loudly said angelas father people here dont like to listen to what you are saying you are in a minorityit is plain that all the other parents here think as i dothat st clares is splendid in every way oh you said angelas mother as if what her husband thought was of simply no account at all she shut up her scarlet lips and looked just as sulky as angela always did when anybody ticked her off noangelas mother was certainly not a success beautiful she might be expensive she certainly wasbut she had none of the graciousness of the twins mother or the common sense of bobbys jollylooking mother or the affection of gladyss plainlydressed but sweetfaced mother imjolly glad i havent got a mother like angelasi said janet to alison isnt she perfectly awful loyal though alison wanted to be to angela she couldnt help nodding her head she had overheard many of angelas mothers rude remarks and she had not liked them because even featherheaded alison felt a deep sense of loyalty to st clares and all it stood for she was not at all eager to be introduced to angelas mother nowbut the time came when she had to be for angela sought her out and took her off mother this is alison the friend i told you about in my letters said angela her mother looked at the pretty dainty girl with approval alison was like angela and could wear the school uniform well oh so this is alison said angelas mother how do you do i must say you look a little more attractive than some of the girls here one or two that angel has introduced me to have been perfect frights bobby had been introduced to angelas mother and was presumably one of the frights her frank freckled face was not at all attractive to any one as exquisite as angelas mother where is your mother asked angela we must introduce her to mine mother wants to ask if you can spend some of the summer hols with me but rather to alisons relief when the introduction had been made and the two mothers had greeted one another the invitation was quite firmly declined by alisons own mother thank you she said but i am afraid i have other plans for alison she did not explain what these were she did not say that she had watched angelas mother and had heard some of her insolent remarks and detested them she did not say that angelas mother was the sort of person the would hate alison to spend even a day with but alison knew what her mother was thinking and silly girl as she was she knew that her mother was right angelas mother sensed that the other mother was snubbing her and she was surprised and annoyed she was about to say something more when a bell rang loudly oh i must they ring bells like that said angelas mother putting her hands to her ears how crude but sensible dont you think so said alisons mother drily and left her thats the bell to tell us to go and watch the swimming said alison slipping her hand into her mothers arm come on mummy youll see bobby swimming thereyou know the freckled girl you liked and mirabel tooshes awfully fast the hot son blazed down as the company took its place round the swimmingpool the parents sat at the edge of the baths but the girls were in the big gallery above watching eagerly many of them were not taking part in the swimming but they were all keen to see the performers diving somersaulting and swimming it was fun to hear the continual splashes and to see the rippling of the blue water isnt it a gorgeous afternoon said janet happily i am enjoying myself i feel so glad that its a fine day so that we can show off st clares at its very best all our parents seem to think its a great success said bobby wellexcept one parent she meant angelas mother angela heard this remark and flushed she had been so pleased to show off her beautiful motherbut somehow everything had been spoilt now she couldnt help wishing that her mother had made nice remarks like the others had made but then mother wasnt usually very pleased with things no matter what they were claudine alison angela and many others not in the swimming got front places in the big gallery above the water claudine leaned over rather far not so much to look at the swimmers in their navyblue swimsuits but to see the rows of parents look out claudine youll fall in said alison in alarm trying to pull her back i shall not fall said claudine i am just looking at that sodiscontented person below with the voice that makes loud and rude remarks sh said alison angela will hear you i do not care said claudine why should angela expect us to praise a mother who is beautiful only in appearance and whose character is ugly do be quiet said alison afraid that angela would hear im sorry angelas mother said that about your aunt claudine i heard it and im sure poor mamzelle was hurt the swimming began angelas mother looked disgusted when a drop of water splashed on to her beautiful frock she shook it daintily and tried to move backwards a littlebut other people were behind her and she couldnt it was an exciting hour for the swimmers were fast and good and the divers graceful and plucky but the most exciting bit of the whole afternoon was not the swimming or the diving or the backward somersaulting done so cleverly by bobby it was an unexpected and highly dramatic performance quite unrehearsed given by claudine she was leaning well over the gallery balcony she suddenly gave a piercing shriek that made every one jump in alarmand then to the horror of all the lookerson the little french girl fell headlong from the gallery into the water below a happy time she made a most terrific splash the water rose up and fell all over angelas mother soaking her from head to foot good gracious said miss theobald the head mistress startled out of her usual calm dignity who has fallen into the water get her out quickly claudine could not swim she sank under the water and then rose to the surface gasping bobby and mirabel who were in the water too at once swam over to her they got hold of her and helped her to the steps claudine whatever happened said bobby you are an idiot claudine was gasping and spluttering she cast an eye towards angelas mother and saw to her delight that she was drenched miss theobald was by her apologizing and saying that she must come at once to the school and allow her miss theobald to lend her some clothes whilst hers were drying angrily angelas mother followed the head mistress from the swimmingpool she looked a dreadful sight with her dress soaked and clinging tightly to her and her beautiful hat dripping with water angela looked very distressed you too claudine you must go with matron and get into dry clothes said miss ellis to the soaking wet fourthformer get into another tunic quickly or youll catch cold hurry now claudine out of the tail of her eye saw mamzelle bearing down upon her alarm and anxiety written all over her the little french girl at once fled off up to the school she felt she could not bear to be enwrapped in mamzelles overwhelming affection just then wait wait claudine called matron who was annoyed that claudine had caused her to leave the company and go back to the school but claudine did not wait better to face matrons annoyance rather than mamzelles loud exclamations of dismay and sympathy how exactly like claudine to cause such a disturbance said pat to isabel oh isabeli cant help feeling delighted that the person who got soaked was angelas tiresome mother i suppose claudine couldnt possibly have done it on purpose could she said isabel doubtfully you know she doesnt care in the least what she does if she wants to get a result she has set her heart on i bet she wanted to punish angelas mother for her rudeness to mamzelle but claudine simply hates and detests the water said pat nothing will make her undress and have a swim and to let herself fall from the gallery into the water would be a very brave thing to do considering she cant swim claudine soon returned in dry clothes looking demure and innocent she could look just as innocent as angela when she likedand now that the girls knew her better they were certain that the more innocent claudine looked the worse mischief she had done or was about to do t angelas mother also returned after a whiledressed in miss theobalds clothes i miss theobald was about the same size as angelas mother but a little taller and although she always looked nice her clothes were very simple plain and dignified they did not suit angelas mother at all in fact she looked very extraordinary in them and she knew it she was angry and she showed it it was bad enough to be drenched like that by some silly careless girl but much worse to be made to wear clothes too long tor her ana so dowdy and frumpish after her own but somehow angelas mother could not be rude to theobald the head mistress was extremely kind and apologetic but she was also calm and dignified and she acted as if she expected angelas mother to be calm and dignified also and much to her surprise the spoilt woman found herself guarding her tongue and behaving quite well whilst she changed into miss theobalds clothes the rest of the time went quickly the matches and competitions were all over parents went off with their children taking them out to dinner in the various hotels round about for a treat pauline went with mrs osullivan the twins mother the twins had told their mother about the girls great disappointment and she had at once said that pauline must come with them alisons mother spoke to alison is there any one you would like to bring with you this evening i hope you dont want to go with angela and her people because your father and i would rather be on our own with you alison understood that her mother had no wish to become at all friendly with angelas mother if she could choose some one to go with her it would be easy to refuse angela if she asked for the two families to have dinner together alison wondered whom she could ask she took a look round at the girls most of them were clustered around their parents chattering gaily waiting for the various cars to come along eileen stood alone watching her mother had disappearedgone to see to some of the younger children probably the girl had such a forlorn look on her face that alison was touched ill ask eileen mother she said i dont like her muchor her mother who is matronbut she would so enjoy coming i and oh mother could i ask some one else too who said her mother in surprise could i ask claudine the little french girl who fell into the water said alison her parents are in france shes only got her aunt here mamzelle i know she would simply love to come she adores going out all right dear ask them both said her mother pleased anything rather than having that spoilt little angela and her equally spoilt mother with them alison tore off to eileen eileen go and ask your mother if you can come out to dinner with my people hurry up oh said eileen her eyes suddenly shining like stars oh alisondo you really mean it you are decent she rushed off to find her mother alison went up to claudine claudine will you come out with me and my people mother said i could ask you eileen is coming too thank you said claudine all her pretty manners coming into play it is indeed very kind of you alison and of your mother too i will go to ask my aunt mamzelle was delighted she liked alison although she despaired over her french yes you go my little claudine she beamed you need a treat after your soterrible shock this afternoon poor little oneto fall into the water like that to be nearly drowned to well i wasnt nearly drowned really you know said claudine a twinkle coming into her eye i knew i shouldnt be drowned aunt mathilde because bobby and mirabel were both in the waterand oh wasnt it grand when i splashed that hateful woman from head to foot i never guessed i would drench her like that mamzelles mouth fell open and she stared at claudine as if she could not believe what she heard claudine claudine what is this that you are saying surely no it is not possibleyou could not have fallen on purpose t you would not be such a bad girl poor mamzelle could hardly get the words out claudine answered demurely on purpose aunt mathilde why how could you think of such a thing do you suppose that your niece could do a soshocking thing as that but how wonderful that it should happen just by angelas mother i ah truly that was a miracle with a wicked twinkle in her eye the unscrupulous claudine walked off to get herself ready for going out mamzelle stared after her ah this claudineshe was a bad bad girland yet what a good good girl she was loo to throw herself into the water in order to splash and punish an unkind woman some one who had hurt and puzzled her aunt i mamzelle sat down on a hallseat feeling quite breathless which was claudinea bad girl or a good one for the life of her mamzelle could not decide meanwhile all the girls and their parents had gone off in their different cars angela had rolled away in her magnificent carbut a very quiet and subdued angela somehow things had not turned out quite as she had planned she hadnt shone in the reflected glory of her beautiful mother she had only felt the scorn of the other girls because her mother had criticized their school in loud and complaining tones angela looked out of the carwindow and saw the happy faces of the twins and saw pauline walking with mr and mrs osullivan they were all going off together chattering gaily you all did marvellously she heard mrs osullivan say in clear happy tones then she saw her friend alisonand to angelas enormous surprise eileen and claudine were with her all getting into a car together oh how mean of alison why hadnt she asked angela to join up with her and her people fancy asking that common little sneak eileen and that awful outspoken niece of mamzelles claudine how could alison do such a thing angela did not think of what the real reason might bea real feeling of kindness on alisons part she was angry and annoyed she would show alison exactly what she thought of her when she saw her next if alison wanted to make friends with charitygirls let herbut she wouldnt have angela favorleigh the honourable angela favorleigh for her friend too there were two or three fairly big towns within easy reach of the school by car and the different families chose their own town and hotel and drove off to eileens intense joy alisons mother chose to go to the town where eddie lived oh she said as the car slid into the town this is where my brother lives i wonder if i shall see him would you like to ask him to come and have dinner with us said alisons mother eileen shook her head oh no thank you its kind enough of you to ask me without asking him as well butif you wouldnt mindi would love to slip along and see him after weve had dinner his lodgings arent very far from the hotel hed love to see me just as you like dear said alisons mother so they had their dinner and a very good one it was and then eileen slipped off to see edgar claudine proved a great success with alisons people the french girl had naturally good manners she was vivacious and amusing and she was extremely pleased to have such a treat alisons parents really enjoyed the girls company alison i wish that french girl was your friend and not angela said her mother she really is nice dont you like her yes mother i do said alison shes quite different from us english girls thoughi mean she hasnt our sense of honourand honestly she simply doesnt care what she does but shes fun quite sincere and awfully kind here comes eileen back again said alisons mother she must be very fond of her brother she really looks happy now eileen did eddie had been delighted to see her she beamed at alison and claudine in an unusually friendly manner what a lovely day it had been janet and the stinkballs after the excitements of halfterm the girls felt flat and dull there didnt seem anything to look forward to now lessons were boring the weather was too hot it seemed a long time till the summer holidays janet bobby cant you think up some trick or other said pat with a yawn i wish you would i shall die of boredom this week if something doesnt happen janet grinned ive got rather an awful trick from my brother she said i dont really know if we ought to play it now were fourthformers oh dont be an idiot said doris why cant we have a few jokes even if we are fourthformers whats the trick wellits a perfectly frightful smell said janet wait a bitill get the things she went up to her dormitory rummaged about in one of her drawers and then came down again with a small box the others crowded round her the box was full of what looked like tiny round glass balls full of some sort of clear liquid what are they said pat puzzled ive never seen them before they are smellballs said janet stinkballs my brother calls them when you break one and let out the liquid it dries up at oncebut leaves the most frightful smell behind what sort of smell asked doris with great interest like drains or something welllike very bad eggs said janet my brother hes simply awful you knowhe broke one of these balls at a very solemn meeting once in our drawingroom at homeand in less than a minute the room was empty you simply cant imagine what it was like bobby chuckled lets break one in french class tomorrow she said its going to be terribly dull translating pages and pages of that book mamzelle is so keen onthat french play this trick is absolutely sent for things like that will you break one of these balls tomorrow janet or shall i well you take one and ill take one said janet then if mine doesnt workmy brother says they art sometimes disappointingyou can use yours see the whole class were thrilled about the stinkballs every one but eileen knew about them the girls were afraid of telling eileen in case she sneaked to matron and the secret was found out so eileen was not told a word she was astonished to find that so many of the girls hurriedly stopped talking when she came up and then began chattering very loudly about quite silly things she was sure they had been talking about her and she felt hurt if theyre going to be beastly to me i shall tell mother and theyll all get dozens of stockings to mend bought eileen spitefully janet and bobby went into the french dass the next day with the little stinkballs in their pockets the lesson was just before break wed better not choose any lesson except one just before break janet had said because if the smell goes on too long it might still be there in miss elliss class and i bet shed smell a rat shed smell much worse than a rat once she sniffs one of your stinkballs said bobby with a grin you see we can open all the windows and doors and let the smell out well during break said pat there wont be anything of it left by the time maths lesson comes afterwards with miss ellis the class were standing politely and silently when mamzelle came in she beamed at the girls sit now today we will go on with this play of ours i will allot the parts you janet can take the part of the old servant you alison the girls opened their books hiding their grins as best they could a trick performed by janet or bobby was always fun great fun the girls remembered the many other tricks the two had played and chuckled this would liven up a dull french lesson very considerably janet will you please begin said mamzelle aimiably she liked this fourth form they were good hardworking girlsand her dear little claudine was there too her face buried in her bookthe good good little girl i janet began reading in french her hand stole to her pocket the girls behind her saw it and tried to choke back their giggles that was the worst of playing a trick you always wanted to begin giggling far too soon and it was terribly difficult to stop real giggles doris gave one of her sudden snorts and mamzelle looked up in surprise doris turned it into a long cough which set mirabel off into giggles too mamzelle glared at mirabel is it so funny that the poor doris has a bad cough she inquired this seemed funnier still to mirabel and she went off into more helpless giggles which began to infect the others janet turned round and frowned she didnt want mamzelle to suspect too soon that she was playing a trick the others caught her warning look and became as serious as they could again the lesson went on janet slid the little glass ball out of her pocket her hand was behind her and the girls saw her press firmly on the tiny glass ball the thin glass covering broke and the liquid ran out drying almost as soon as the air touched it the liquid disappeared and the tiny fragments of thin glass dropped unheeded to the floor after a few moments a curious smell drifted all round doris coughed alison sniffed loudly and said pooh it was a horrid smell there was no doubt about that it smelt of bad eggs drains dead rats old cats meat all that was horrid mamzelle did not smell the smell at first she was astonished at the sudden outburst of sniffing and coughing she looked up she saw expressions of disgust on every ones face mixed with the desire to giggle what is the matter demanded mamzelle suspiciously why do you pull these faces alison stop saying pooh janet why do you look so disgusted oh mamzellecant you smell it said janet an agonized expression on her face smell what said mamzelle exasperated the smell had not drifted her way as yet oh mamzellethe smell chorused half a dozen voices mamzelle looked puzzled and angry she took a few enormous sniffs of the air which made doris explode into laughter i smell no smell said mamzelle this is a silly trick yes stop sniffing janet if you say pooh again alison i will send you out of the room claudine do not look like a duck that is dying but aunt mathilda the smell the smellf cest abominable i cried claudine who detested bad smells and looked as if she was about to faint claudine you too i rapped out mamzelle who safely away at the end of the room had not even got so much as a sniff of the evil smell yet now listen mes enfantsone more mention of a smell and i fetch miss theobald herself here to smell it i it is all pretence you are bad children this was a truly terrible threat i miss theobald would certainly be able to smell the smell as soon as she got into the room and then there would be a big row the girls looked at one another in dismay they put their handkerchiefs to their noses and tried not to sniff up the ghustly odour mamzelle began to read out loud from the french play after a few lines she stopped strange i she felt as if she too now could smell something she took a cautious sniff was it a smell or was it not nonsense i strange and horrible smells do not invade classrooms all of a sudden mamzelle took another breath and went on reading the smell stole round her mamzelle could smell it quite distinctly now she stopped reading again and sniffed wildly yes there was no doubt about it a perfectly horrible smell was in the room i the poor poor girlsthey had smelt it firstand she had not believed them mamzellp gave a gulp and a choke as the smell really took hold of her she fished about for her handkerchief the girls divided between disgust at the smell and an intense desire to giggle at mamzeues horrified face stuffed their hankies into their mouths making all kinds of most peculiar noises girls said mamzelle in a choking kind of voice girls you are right there is a terrible smell in here what can it be a dead rat under the floorboards said doris obligingly removing her hanky from her mouth for a moment mamzelle gave a small shriek rats dead or alive gave her shivers all down her back perhaps a drain has burst outside the window said pat speaking in a muffled voice ill look she went to the open window and leaned out taking in deep breaths of the pure air there one or two others joined her thinking it was a very good idea perhaps it will go away said mamzelle hopefully open the door janet and maybe it will help to clear the room of this evil odour janet thankfully opened the door this was an amusing trick to playbut it had its drawbacks the draught of air took a good strong dose of the smell over to mamzelles desk she gave a loud exclamation tiens this is terrible we shall all be ill pick up your books quickly and we will finish our lesson in the garden i will tell miss theobald and maybe she will have the boards up to seek for a rat that is quite dead all but claudine were delighted to go out into the garden claudine did not know which was worsethe smell in the classroom or the insects outofdoors she thought there was very little to choose between them soon the girls were sitting in a nice shady part of the garden giggling whenever they thought of the awful smell drifting round their classroom the lesson was no longer boring or dull the smell had made it a great success mamzelle kept her word and reported the smell to miss theobald ah miss theobald she said it is a smell truly unbelievable of dead rats and mice of eggs that are bad of drains that are broken it came into our classroom whilst the girls were reciting their french lesson and it spoilt the whole hour we had to leave the room and go into the garden miss theobald was surprised to hear of such a very strong and disgusting smell in all her experience of schools she had never yet come across a smell that had driven a class from the room i will go and smell it she said to mamzelle if it is a dead rat or bad drains then of course we must have the smell seen to at once this very afternoon the smell will remain there if those are the causes but to mamzelles great astonishment and to miss theobalds mild astonishment not a trace of the smell remained the two of them sniffed all round the room but it smelt fresh and clean extraordinary said miss theobald gazing at mamzelle you are quite sure mamzelle that it was a strong smell a really bad one mamzelle was most indignant what the head mistress was doubting her word mamzelle at once began to describe the smell all over again this time making it a smell ten times worse than before miss theobald smiled to herself she knew mamzelles indignant exaggerations by this time well she said i wont have the floorboards up or the drains inspected todaymaybe the smell will not return if it does mamzelle kindly report it to me at once please so that i may smell it myself before it goes away yes miss theobald said mamzelle and went to the mistresss common room full of the smell and of its power in sending her class into the garden every one listened in astonishment it didnt occur to any one but the first form mistress miss roberts that it might be a trick but miss roberts had had much experience of janets jokes and it did cross her mind to wonder if this could be one of them let me see mamzelle she said thoughtfully janet is in the fourth form isnt she yes said mamzelle but what has that got to do with my smell ohnothing i expect said miss roberts butif were you mamzelle if that smell appears again you trot down to miss theobald at once i think she may be able to find the cause of it without taking up any floorboards and examining any drains of course i shall report to the head at once said mamzelle with dignity and the time came when she did miss ellis plays a trick too the girls had been really delighted with the success of janets stinkball whenever eileen had not been in the room they had chattered and laughed about mamzelles disgust and astonishment all the same wed better not do it again said janet i have a sort of feeling that once would be a success but that twice would be a failure you can pull mamzelles leg beautifully once in a while but not all the time if you do the smell again i shall be sick and go out of the room said claudine it is the worst smell i have ever sniffed we wont do the smell again promised bobby but i tell you what we will dowell pretend there is a smell shall weand get old mamzelle all hot and bothered expecting one shell sniff and snufi and we shall die of laughing oh yes thats a good idea said janet doris you can start ofi about the smell again in tomorrows french grammar class doris grinned she could act that kind of thing very well so the next day when mamzelle was ensconced safely in her desk at the end of the room doris began her act there was a very nice smell in the room for alison the girl doing the flowers for the classroom that week had filled a big vase with white pinks and they scented the room beautifully the girls could smell them as they worked doris began to sniff at first she gave very little sniffs then she gave two or three bigger ones doris i have you a cold said mamzelle impatiently are you a firstformer come to class without a handkerchief ive got a hanky thank you mamzelle said doris humbly and took it out then janet began to sniff she screwed up her nose sniffed and looked all round bobby gave a chuckle and turned it into a long cough mamzelle frowned she did not like behaviour of this sort it made her angry then pat began to sniff and pulled out her hanky too soon the whole class all except eileen who was not in the joke were sniffing as if they had bad colds mamzelle gazed at the sniffing girls exasperated what is all this noise sniffsniffsniff i cannot bear it doris an expression of disgust mamzelle saw it and an alarming thought came into her head could it be that terrible smell again doris she said urgently what is the matter i can smell something murmured doris distinctly its very strong just here cant you smell anything mamzelle mamzelle couldnt which was not at ail surprising but she remembered that before she could not smell the smell until after the girls she looked anxiously at the class they all seemed to be smelling it i will report it at once said mamzelle and she left the room in a hurry crumbs said bobby i dont know that we wanted her to go to the head about it i sayshe shot off so quickly we couldnt stop her unluckily for mamzelle the head was out mamzelle was annoyed and upset here was the smell again and no miss theobald to smell it and to know that she mamzelle had not exaggerated last tune mamzelle popped her head in at the mistresss common room as she hurried back to the classroom miss ellis was there correcting exercise books belonging to the fourth form miss ellisi regret to say that that terrible smell is back again said mamzelle it is abominable i do not think you will be able to take the fourth form in your room next lesson she withdrew her head and hurried back to the fourth form she went in expecting to be greeted by a wave of the terrible smell but there seemed to be no smell at all very strange miss theobald is out said mamzelle alas she cannot smell our smell neither do i smell it yet it was good news that miss theobald was out the girls felt cheerful about that doris spoke up at once dont worry mamzelle we know what the smell was this timequite different from last time it was only these pinks doris picked up the big bowl of pinks walked jauntily to mamzelle and thrust them under her big nose mamzelle took a sniff and the strong and delicious scent went up her nose so she said to doris it was the pinks you smelt well it is a good thing miss theobald was not in she would have come to smell for nothing there were a few gigglesand then as the door opened the girls fell silent and looked to see if it was miss theobald coming in after all but it wasnt it was miss ellis who curious to smell this extraordinary smell that mamzelle seemed continually to get excited about had come to smell it herself she stood at the door sniffing i cant smell anything mamzelle she said surprised mamzelle hastened to explain i smelt nothing either miss ellis it was the pinks the girls smelt doris has just told me miss ellis was surprised and most disbelieving i dont see how the girls could mistake a smell of pinks for the kind of awful smell you described to me last time she said i am not at all sure i believe in that smell at all she gave her form a glare and went out mamzelle was indignant had she not smelt the smell herself last time for the rest of the lesson the class had a very peaceful time discussing smells past and present with their indignant french mistress after break came geography taught by miss ellis she came into the room looking rather stern i just want to say she said that i shall regard any mention of smells bad or good as a sign that you want a little extra work given to you the class knew what that meant a little extra work from miss ellis meant a good two hours extra prep so every one immediately made up their minds not to mention the word smell at all but a terrible thing happened in ten minutes time bobby had quite forgotten that she still had her stinkball in her pocket left over from the day before and in sitting down rather violently after going with her book to miss ellis she broke the thin glass surrounding the liquid then in a trice the perfectly awful smell came creeping round the classroom once more doris smelt it janet smelt it bobby smelt it and put her hand at once into her pocket desperately feeling about to see if she had accidentally broken the little stinkball when she found she had she gazed round winking and nodding at the others to tell them of the awful accident miss elliss sharp eyes caught bobbys signs so she was not really very surprised when she smelt the smell coming towards her what a terrible smell it was miss ellis thought things out quietly evidently yesterdays smell had been this same horrible oneand the one mamzelle had reported today and which doris had said was pinks after all was nothing to do with the real smelljust a silly joke played on mamzelle but this awful smell is the real thing again thought miss ellis and judging by bobbys signs to the others was a mistake i dont think the girls would dare to play a trick like this on me welli will just play a little trick on them quietly miss ellis wrote a few directions on the board then she turned and left the room closing the door after her the girls stared at the board page write down the answers page read the first two paragraphs and then rewrite them in your own words page copy the map there i say exploded doris shes goneand weve got to stay here in this awful smell and do that work bobby you absolute idiot why did you break that stinkball it was an accident said bobby most apologetically i sat on it i quite forgot it was there isnt this frightful miss ellis has smelt it of course guesses its a trick and for punishment weve got to sit through the smell and work at our geographyand we simply darent complaini i am not going to sit in the smell announced claudine emphatically she got up i feel sick i go to be sick she went off and she made such wonderful sicknoises as she passed miss ellis in the passage outside that miss ellis said nothing but let her go to the bathroom trust claudine for doing what she wanted not one of the others dared to leave the room they sat there choking into their handkerchiefs moaning over their fate but not daring to scamp their work at the end of the hour when the smell had somewhat lessened miss ellis opened the door she left it open you may go for a short run round the garden and back she said bobby remain behind please with a wry face bobby remained behind whilst the others fled out gladly into the fresh air i was the one who caused that terrible smell this time said bobby at once it was never any good beating round the bush with miss ellisnot that bobby was given to that anyway she was a straightforward and truthful girl but it was an accident miss ellis really it was please believe me i do said miss ellis but it is an accident that is on no account to happen again you have all had your punishment so i shall say no more about it but i want you to warn the fourthformers that any future smells will result in quite a lot of punishment a birthdayand a grand idea isnt it gorgeous weather said isabel to pat day after day we get nothing but sun and blue sky i wish we could have lessons sitting in the swimmingpool the coolest part of the day is the night i said doris i should like to sleep all day and work all night in the cool night breeze last night i woke up and saw the moon shining in at the window said hilary i got up and looked outi simply cant tell you how beautiful the country looked all lit up by moonlight i wished i could go for a walk have a moonlight picnic all by myself i i say said bobby at once a moonlight picnic what an absolutely marvellous idea lets oooh said the others staring at bobby really impressed by the unusual idea gollywhat fun yes it would be said hilary butnow that were fourthformers do you think we ought to oh hilarydont be so pious said janet im not said hilary indignantly thats a thing ive never been wellperhaps it wouldnt matter we could picnic in the school grounds oh i saylets picnic by the swimmingpool and have a moonlight swim better and better i said bobby giving a whoop of delight gollythat would be super look here lets wait till fullmoon nightthats two nights from nowand have it then the pool would be brilliantly lit and we could have a gorgeous time its my birthday then said mirabel that very day oh lets make it then and id feel it was a birthday treat too right said janet now wed better make plans quickly because we havent much time to get anything she turned to the quiet and responsible headgirl of the form susan howes susan youll come wont you susan nodded she was a good and trustworthy girl but she loved a bit of fun and she could not see that there was any harm in a moonlight picnic ill go down to the town today with hilary and buy a few things she said ill leave word at the grocers and the bakers that you will all go in at different times and fetch one or two things then no one will suspect anythingwe shall just quietly return to school with small parcels i shall we tell eileen or not said janet no of course not said bobby i bet shed split on us and tell her motherand then wed all get caught and everything would be spoilt wellits a pity to leave eileen out of everything like this really said pat but we cant risk being found out and these midnight affairs are such fun i mirabel was thrilled that it was her birthday that day i it would make it all the nicer she and gladys her quiet little friend talked and talked about it ill take my birthday cake of course said mirabel ill save it up till then mother said she would send sixteen candles separately and well stick them on the cake in their holders and light them in the moonlight i eileen was by now used to the others planning things without her she knew that the tricks they whispered about together were not told her beforehand because she was known as a sneak so she did not prick up her ears at all when she saw the girls talking together in low tones what do i care for their silly tricks she thought if they want to act like that let them so she did not try to overhear or find out their fresh secret she went her own way looking rather pale and unhappy she rarely smiled now kept herself quite to herself and did not try to make friends with any one she had been nice to alison after the halfterm treat and alison had benefited by her kindness by having no mending of her own at all to do ever since but she still struggled with angelas darning though angela was never very grateful mirabels birthday came as usual her form gave presents some were small presents if the girls had little money left some were extravagant like angelas angela gave mirabel a book of very expensive music that she wanted it cost twentyone shillings and mirabel was really quite overcome you shouldnt spend so much money on a birthday why not said angela my grandfather sent me five pounds last week whats the good of having money if you dont spend it pauline not to be outdone gave mirabel a musiccase of fine leather mirabel was amazed it was not usual to have such beautiful presents for a school birthday she had not even known that pauline had noticed that her own old musiccase had a broken strap and was almost worn out oh paulinethis is beautiful said mirabel red with surprise and delight but you shouldnt do it its bad enough for angela to do itand for you to give me something so extravagant too well really i feel quite overwhelmed if angela can do it i can as well said pauline a little stiffly that took the pleasure out of the gift somehow thought mirabel if pauline only gave her something fine just because she didnt want to be outdone by angela well there wasnt much kindness or affection behind the gift claudine surprisingly gave mirabel a very pretty bag claudine was one of the girls who had very little money and said soso mirabel was really touched to have such nice gift from her oh thank you claudine she said it is really lovely but its too extravagant of you i know you dont have much pocketmoney but claudine seemed to have plenty that week she bought eight pounds of cherries as her share of the picnics goodies and they came to ten shillings every one thought it was decent of her ah when i have a little money i like to spend it said claudine it is nice to spend i wish i could spend always that would be fine to be like angela and to say i will have this i will have that yesbut it does mean you dont have many treats real treats said gladys i meanif mother and i save up for ages to go a good holiday together it means much more to us and is a greater treat than any holiday could possibly be to angelawho can have expensive holidays whenever she likes to have a lot of money doesnt mean that you get more enjoyment than those who havent much quite right as usual said isabel giving the quiet gladys a little pat well i wish i and pat could buy more for this picnic but it was our grannys birthday last week and we spent most of our money on that mauve silk scarf we sent her so were cleaned out for a bit i hope you wont turn up your nose at our birthday offering mirabelits only two drawing pencils with your name on thats very decent of you said mirabel who really did not mind whether gifts cost ten shillings or ten pence i think youre all decent to me every one of you everybody has given me a present even eileen had though with many apologies for the poorness of her gift its only a little hanky she said to mirabel and im afraid its not even new its one of my own but please take it mirabel with my birthday wishes i dont want to be the only one not giving you anything i you know i have hardly any pocketmoney and its eddies birthday soon and im saving every penny for that every one knew that eileen had less money than any girl in the school her mother was mean over pocketmoney certainly she had to work hard for her own money but she seemed to think that the sixteenyearold eileen could manage on a penny or two a week just as she had managed when she was a small sixyearold i wish we could ask eileen to go with us tonight said mirabel she was usually a thickskinned girl who had little feeling for any one else except for her friend gladysbut she had been touched by eileens little gift and her honest confession of having no money well we cant said bobby decidedly i know she told her mother that janet said that there seemed to be more torn sheets in the fourthform dormitories than in the whole of the rest of the school put togetherand poor janet has done oceans of mending this week but who can help thinking our sheets are torn on purpose on purpose to give us work to do they were never torn like this before why i could go a whole term without having to mend a pillowcase or sheet at all when our old matron was here all right we wont ask eileen said mirabel i dont really care she is a dreadful sneak i suppose everything was prepared in readiness for the moonlight picnic and swim the sky was clear when the girls went to bed that night they went to bed in the daylight for the evenings were very long just then there wont be any darkness at all i should think said bobby looking out of the window when daylight begins to go the full moon will come swimming up the sky and then everything will be almost as bright as day again golly isnt it hot i shall adore being in the water at midnight i luckily for the girls eileen was a very sound sleeper once she was asleep nothing ever seemed to wake her and even when the firepractice alarm had gone once in the middle of the night she had not awakened so the girls felt sure she would know nothing it was too hot to sleep some of the girls dozed off and eileen and mirabel slept soundly but the others tossed and turned halfasleep and halfawake so when the big dock in one of the towers struck halfpast eleven there was only mirabel to wake i eileen slept in a bed by the door of one of the fourthform dormitories and the girls had to tiptoe past her but she did not stir she had looked rather pale and tired lately and now she slept very deeply the girls had on bathingsuits under their dressinggowns and rubber shoes on their feet they made no sound as they stole down the corridors went down the stairs and came to the big cupboard where they had hidden their food and drink with giggles and whispers they loaded themselves with the goodies and then undid the garden door as quietly as they could they left it a little open so that they could get in easily when they returned there was no wind to bang it shut keeping in the cover of the trees the line of excited girls made its way towards the swimmingpool how gorgeous the still water looked lying calm and deep in the brilliant moonlight the moon was now up and was flooding the grounds with cold silver light everything could be plainly seen only the warm colours of daylight were missing we mustnt make too much noise said janet our voices would carry a good way on a still night like this i only hope no one will hear the splashing of the water when we go in lets go in first before we eat im so hot off came the dressinggowns bare long legs gleamed in the moonlight one after another the girls dived in or jumped inall but claudine who had steadfastly refused to come in a bathingsuit but had on her nightgown under her dressinggown the little french girl liked the excitement of the midnight picnic but hot though it was nothing would persuade her to go into the water she would throw herself in to punish a spitefultongued womanbut she certainly would not go in for pleasure i she stood and watched the girls laughing she glanced away from the pooland suddenly saw a figure slipping silently between the trees whoever could it be claudine deals with matron claudine ran quietly in her rubber shoes to see who was out in the grounds that night besides the fourthformers it was eileenl eileen whom the girls had left sound asleep in bed the sneak said claudine to herself she comes to peep and pry at us and then she goes back to her sosevere mother to tell a tale i will follow her back but somehow she missed eileen and could not see where she had gone claudine rushed back to the pool and almost fell into the water in her excitement at telling the others what she had seen oh blow said bobby climbing out the moonlight shining on the silvery drops running down her legs i suppose that sneak of an eileen will go straight off to matronand before we can have anything to eat shell be here scolding us and rowing us and sending us back in disgrace i will go back to the school and keep watch said claudine eagerly i know where matron sleeps i will go outside her door and stand there till i know for certain that either she is coming here or that eileen has not told tales after all right said bobby hurry i and be sure to race back and warn us if you hear matron dressing or wandering about we simply mustnt be caught but oh what a shame if we cant have the moonlight picnic and i bet matron will confiscate mirabels lovely cake i claudine sped off in her rubber shoes she did not see eileen at all she went in at the open garden door and ran quietly up the stairs to the corridor at the end of which matron slept she stood outside matrons door and listened there was not a single sound from inside she could not hear either eileens voice or matrons on the other hand she could not hear slight snores or heavy breathing claudine stood there wondering what to do had eileen seen the picnickers did she mean to tell tales where had she gone then claudines quick ears caught a sound from inside matrons room the bed was creaking i plainly matron was awake the bed creaked a little more and then there came the sound of some one shuffling into slippers now she puts on a dressinggown thought claudine now she ties the girdle but why is she getting up just now if eileen has not been to tell her the little french girl squeezed herself into a dark corner as matrons door suddenly opened the thin narrowshouldered figure appeared framed in the doorway full in the moonlight matron looked rather grim she set off silently down the passage and turned off in the direction of the dormitory belonging to the fourthformers claudine followed her like a moving black shadow keeping cleverly in the dark corners matron went into the dormitory where eileen always slept eileen said matron in a whisper but there was no answer then matron evidently patted the bed and found no one there there came an exclamation and matron switched on the light in a moment she saw the empty beds she went into the next dormitory where the fourthformers also slept and again switched on the light no girls there where are they said matron angrily i will not have this sort of thing i why didnt eileen warn me of this she ought to know better than to join in tricks of this sort claudine heard these muttered words and was surprised so eileen hadnt warned her mother she had followed the others out and must be hiding somewhere in the grounds watching the fun and now matron was going to spoil everything why should she claudine felt a sudden and intense dislike for the severe and spiteful matron there was no harm in a moonlight swim and picnic quite likely if the girls had asked miss theobalds permission she would have laughed and granted it just for once and now matron was going to interfere matron went down the stairs she came to the cupboard where the girls had stored their picnic food and drink they had left the door open matron gave an angry exclamation and went to shut it and it was then that the great idea came to claudine it was an idea that might have occurred to any angry girl but only claudine would have carried it out matron suddenly got the shock of her life some one gave her a violent push so that she landed inside the cupboard among old lacrosse sticks and tennisrackets then the door was shutand locked matron was a prisoner claudine took the key out of the cupboard and put it into her dressinggown pocket choking with laughter she ran out of the garden door and made her way to the swimmingpool she could hear matron hammering on the door but the little backhall beyond the gardendoor near the cupboard was seldom used and far from any sleepingquarters it was quite likely that no one would hear matron at all now we are safe thought claudine triumphantly what a fine joke but will these english girls think it is a joke for the first time a doubt came into her mind she claudine knew it to be a grand grand joke to lock that sodetestable matron up in a dark cupboard to stop her from spoiling the funbut would the others think like claudine might not this curious honour they were always talking about prevent them from thinking it a joke might not susan howes fourthform headgirl think it her duty to go and rescue matron one could never tell what the english would think to be right or wrong then i shall not tell them what i have done thought claudine as she sped along to the pool if they do not know they cannot worry now i will only tell them that it is all right eileen has not told tales and that matron is quite quite safe the girls climbed out of the pool and surrounded claudine when she came running back its all right said claudine very much okay eileen has not told tales she is not back at the school and matron is quite quite safe oh good said all the girls and shook the water from themselves what about some eats now wheres eileen then if she isnt in bed and didnt go back to school said bobby puzzled but nobody knew and nobody cared let eileen wander where she liked so long as she didnt spoil their fun and how good that matron was safe too the girls were very hungry after their swim they sat down to enjoy the food there was bread butter potted meat tins of sardines marmalade apricot jam cherries biscuits and mirabels big birthday cake the candles did not show up very well in the bright moonlight but still it was fun to light them the girls had their picnic by the edge of the water dangling their legs in the pool the water was lukewarm for the sun had wanned it thoroughly it was simply lovely there had never been such midnight fun as this i this cake is gorgeous said bobby eating an enormous slice my wordi dont ever remember feeling so hungry are those sardine sandwiches pass them along susan claudine enjoyed her meal more than any one true she was not so hungry as the others for she had not been in for a swimbut she could not help thinking of matron shut up in the dark cupboard quite unable to spoil the fun of the fourthformers and that gave a very keen edge to her enjoyment of the picnic she felt no anxiety as to what would happen when matron was let out claudine never let things like that worry her at all the meal was over at last every scrap was finished even angela said she had enjoyed it alison had not enjoyed it quite so much as the others because she had fallen into the water in her dressinggown and was worried as to how to dry it before matron saw it mirabel said she had never enjoyed a birthday so much in all her life its been a great success said janet pleased now wed better go back harktheres one oclock striking dong golly im tired now every one was tired the swim had been rather strenuous for there had been a lot of goodhumoured racing and teasing the girls cleared up crumbs cartons and paperbags and put empty gingerbeer bottles into a locker up in the gallery meaning to collect them when it was safe thats all i think said susan looking round isnt the water lovely gleaming in the moonlight i just hate to leave it but they had to leave the gleaming pool they made their way back through the trees whispering together they came to the garden door which was still open and then they heard a most peculiar noise bang bang bang knock knock knock crumbs whats that said susan startled let me out let me out cried a muffled voice and somebody kicked against a wooden door alison and angela were terrified its a burglar said alison and tore up the stairs as fast as ever she could angela followed her trembling claudine pushed the others towards the stairs quickly dont stop she whispered get back to the dormitories as quickly as you can dont stop i will explain everything in the greatest astonishment the girls went upstairs to their dormitories they crowded into the one in which claudine slept and demanded to know what the explanation of the curious noises was its matron said claudine shes locked la that cupboard there was an amazed silence who locked her in said bobby at last i did said claudine she came into our dormitories and saw we werent there i did not want her to spoil your funso i pushed her into the cupboard and locked her in was i not quick and clever an infuriated matron for a minute or two no one said anything at all the girls found it simply unbelievable that claudine should have done such a thing locked matron into a games cupboard left her there shouting and hammering really the french girl must be completely mad no i am not mad said claudine reading their thoughts it was the only thing to do wasnt it she would have spoilt your fun and i could stop her so i stopped her but claudineyoull get into the most fearful row said janet at last that matters nothing replied claudine and certainly she acted as if she did not mind what happened she was not in the least excited or upset the girls went on staring at her hardly able to take in the fact that matron had been and still was a prisoner downstairs then an awful thought came to bobby whos going to let her out nobody said anything not even claudine wanted to set free a woman who would be sure to be violently and spitefully angry but certainly she could not be left in the cupboard till the morning wheres the key said janet claudine produced it from her dressinggown pocket it was a large key claudine put her finger in the hole at the top of it and swung it thoughtfully to and fro as i was the one who locked her in i will also be the one to let her out she said at last but i shall unlock the door very very quietly then open it a tiny way and then i shall fly up the stairs taking my heels with me the girls couldnt help smiling you mean you will take to your heels and fly upstairs said bobby you do say ridiculous things claudine honestly i cant imagine how you dared to do such a thinglocking matron into a cupboardgolly its unheard of i why didnt you tell us what you had done when you came back to the pool and joined the picnic i thought you would say ah it is not honourable to do such a thing explained claudine i thought maybe susan would feel she ought to go and set matron free so i said nothing i never met any one quite like you before said pat you do the most awful things for perfectly good reasons i meanyou throw yourself into the pool when you hate the water just to punish some one whos been unkind to your auntand you go and lock matron up into a cupboard just so that we shant have our picnic spoilt i must say you do the most dramatic thingswe never know what youre going to do next wellwhat are we going to do about matron demanded susan who was getting worried shall we let claudine let her out i go said claudine and got up with much dignity she loved moments like this when she took the stage and every one looked at her she was not at all conceited but there was to her a very satisfying feeling in doing something unusual and dramatic she went the girls scrambled into bed feeling that very shortly matron would come bursting into the dormitories like an angry bull claudine crept downstairs to the little backhall by the gardendoor matron was still shouting and hammering claudine slipped along to the door and put the key quietly into the keyholebut just as she was about to turn it and unlock the door she heard the sound of quiet footsteps on the gravel path outside she darted up the stairs at once without turning the key let whoever it was coming by unlock the door they would be sure to hear matron and set her free then she claudine could get away in safety the footsteps came to the gardendoor and then some one slipped inside it was eileen she stood still the greatest astonishment as she heard the muffled cries and the banging on the door of the games cupboard whyits mothers voice said eileen out loud in the very greatest amazement where is she she cant be in that cupboard but she was as eileen very soon realized the girl turned the key at once and opened the door matron stumbled out almost beside herself with rage she caught hold of eileen in a fierce grip not seeing what girl it was eileen cried out in pain mother dont its me eileen however did you get into that cupboard you cried matron and let go eileens am what are you doing here where have you been how dare you go out at night like this tell me what you have been doing at once eileen said nothing at all her mother gave her a shake youve been out somewhere with the fourth form they are all out of their beds what have you been doing i shall report you all to miss theobald why didnt you tell me what was happening i cant say anything mother said eileen in a frightened voice it was news to her that the fourth form had been out that night she had not noticed any empty beds when she had slipped out herself she had not heard any noise from the swimmingpool either she had been out to meet eddie her brother in the lane and she was not going to tell her mother this she no longer dared to meet him in the daytime for she felt that any one might see her and report her so she had been meeting him once a week in the middle of the night when all her dormitory was sound asleep nobody knew this and certainly she must not let her mother know or eddie would get into trouble too what had the fourthformers been doing how mean of them to go off on a spree at night and leave her out i somehow or other she must make her mother think she had been with them you wont say anything said her mother in a threatening voice well tell me thiswho locked me in here i cant imagine that you would dare to of course i didnt said eileen and i dont know who did either carlotta might have its the kind of thing she would do i really dont know mother please let me go back to bed but matron was far too angry and humiliated to let the matter drop she swept up the stairs to the fourthform dormitories and switched on the lights the girls all pretended to be asleep matron walked into the dormitory where eileen slept and spoke in a loud and angry voice its no good your pretending to be asleep i know youre not ive come to find out who locked me into that cupboard i i insist on knowing here and now that girl will be expelled from st clares susan howes sat up and looked at the angry matron we all take the blame for that she said quietly we are very sorry matron and we hope you will accept our apologies matron made a fierce explosive noise accept your apologies of course i dont you wont get out of this as easily as that i insist on knowing who locked me in otherwise i shall go straight to miss theobald here and now in the middle of the night claudine sat up in bed ready to speak she did not in the least mind owning up but bobby laid a warning hand on her shoulder and pulled her over towards her to whisper into her ear dont own up to matron she will go to your aunt too and make a fearful fuss and theres no reason why mamzelle should be brought into this you can tell miss theobald yourself tomorrow if you want to bien said claudine snuggling down into bed again very good i do as you say bobbee matron stood glaring round the room then she stamped heavily with her foot and almost shouted all right i shall go to miss theobald you will all have to explain what you were doing in the middle of the night leaving your beds like thatand i warn you i shall show no mercy on the person who has not owned up to locking me in eileen get into bed i am absolutely ashamed to think that a daughter of mine should have joined in midnight wrongdoing and should refuse to tell me anything about it she went off down the corridor walking angrily the girls sat up whew said bobby what a volcano i say eileen where were you does your mother really think you were with us yes said eileen in a low voice please dont give me away i was only meeting eddie my brother i was afraid to tell my mother that so i let her think i was with you i didnt know what you had been doing so i couldnt possibly tell her of course and that has made her very wild with me were all going to get into a most fearful row i bet miss theobald wont be too pleased at being wakened up at this time of night said janet looking at her watch its halfpast one wed better try and get some sleepthough i expect the next thing will be miss theobald coming in and demanding explanationa too the girls tried to settle down and go to sleep mirabel fell asleep first and then one by one the others did all except eileen who lay awake staring into the dark worried and unhappy everything was going wrong i everything was getting worse oh dear she did hope the girls wouldnt give her away and say she had not been with them that night they might quite well sneak about her she had done plenty of sneaking that term and it would not be at all surprising if they got a bit of their own back i matron walked down the corridor and made her way to the separate wing in which the head mistress miss theobald had her set of rooms she knocked loudly on the bedroom door come in said a startled voice and there was the sound of a light being switched on matron opened the door miss theobald was sitting up in bed eyes heavy with sleep what is the matter she said anxiously is some one ill matron no said matron her thin face still purple with rage something much worse than that good gracious what asked miss theobald hurriedly getting out of bed and reaching for her dressinggown quick tell me its the fourth form said matron in a grim voice all out of their beds every one even my eileen goodness knows what they were doing miss theobald sat down on her bed in relief oh she said a midnight feast i suppose i thought you had come to report something really serious couldnt this have waited till the morning matron indeed it couldnt said matron and for a very good reason too somebody locked me for hours into the games cupboard in the backhall by the gardendoor miss theobald stared at matron as if she really could not believe her ears locked you into the cupboard she said at last are you quite sure i meani really cannot imagine any of the fourthformers doing that you dont know half that goes on in the school answered matron in a grim and righteous tone not half my eileen tells me most things and youd be surprised if i told you some of them i dont think i want to hear said miss theobald and i cant help thinking it is a mistake matron to encourage eileen to tell tales to you also i think you need not worry whether i know all that goes on or not that is my concern matron sensed the rebuke in miss theobalds words and she began to feel angry that the head had not expressed more anger and concern over her imprisonment in the cupboard she looked grimmer than ever eileen set me free she said otherwise i might have been in the cupboard till the morning a fine thing to happen to the matron of a school like this i went up to the fourthform dormitories at once and there were all the girls pretending to be asleep little hypocrites oh matron dont be quite so vindictive said miss theobald feeling rather shocked at the matrons tone you have never been matron in a girls school before and you are not yet used to the mischievous ways of the various forms but as a rule there is little harm in them who locked you in the girls wont say said matron angrily but i demand that whoever locked me in should be expelled miss theobald a girl that does a thing like that is a very bad influence on the others well i expect they were all in it said miss theobald i should never expel a girl without a much stronger reason than mere mischief matron i am certain that the whole fonn shared in the fun and you would not expect me to expel the whole lot would you do try and see things in a reasonable light you are angry and annoyed nowyou will not be so inclined to want girls expelled in the morning arent you coming back to the dormitories with me to demand who it was that locked me in demanded matron furiously as she saw miss theobald taking off her dressinggown and slippers the girls will i hope be asleep by now said the head getting into bed i see no reason for waking them all up again this can easily wait till the morning matron was infuriated she had planned a most dramatic return to the dormitories with miss theobald and had gone so far as to hope that the head would demand to know the culprit and announce her expulsion there and then she bit her thin lips and glared at miss theobald so angrily that the headmistress began to feel annoyed please go now matron she said we will continue this rather complicated conversation in the morning matron took a step forward and her face took on a malicious look well she said i wasnt going to tell you till id found out the thiefbut theres somebody in the fourth form whos been stealing miss theobald i ive missed moneyyes and stamps tooand all kinds of things like notepaper and envelopes youve got a nasty little thief in the fourth form and i shall want that matter cleared up too i otherwise i am afraidi shall go to the police claudine scores again miss theobald disliked matron intensely at that moment it was quite plain that she took a real pleasure in saying these poisonous things i think all these things must wait till the morning matron said the head i will go into them thoroughly then we can do nothing satisfactory tonight good night matron walked out of the room without answering she hoped she had given miss theobald a shock she had not meant to talk about her missing money for she was taking a great pleasure in trying to track down the thief herselfand then she had meant to take her by the shoulder and lead her triumphantly to miss theobald matron hoped that the thief and the one who had locked her into the cupboard were one and the same she felt certain they were surely only a very bad character could lock her into a cupboard we shall perhaps get to the bottom of things tomorrow she thought as she got into bed ill make eileen tell me all that the fourth form did i shant say anything about my missing money to her though in case she warns the fourth form and the thief isnt caught the fourthform girls woke up tired and sleepy and rather fearful the next morning had matron been to miss theobald what was going to happen matron appeared at breakfast grim and stem eileen had tearstained eyes her mother had scolded her and demanded to know what the fourth form had been doing the night before but eileen had not told bobby had spoken seriously to her look here eileenwe didnt ask you to our picnic last night because we were afraid youd sneak to your mother as you often do but well make a bargain with you we will say nothing at all about your not being with usmatron can go on thinking you were with usbut you in your turn arent to give us away any more at all see and if you do the bargain is automatically broken and we shall tell of you its the only way to teach you that sneaking doesnt pay eileen looking pale and unhappy had nodded thank you she said i couldnt bear mother to know i go and meet eddie she would be so angry with him i wont split on any of you any more ive sneaked i knowbut its so difficult not to answer mothers questions sometimes bobby guessed it was eileen had her own problems but they wouldnt be solved by being weak and tellingtales i she had to find that out sooner or later but this morning eileen had been determined and strong for once and had not answered matrons insistent questions her mother had been very angry and had even boxed her ears hard matron had a fierce temper when she let herself go and poor eileen had had to bear the brunt of it claudine said susan in a low voice at breakfasttime if you want to own up to miss theobald about locking matron up youd better go immediately after breakfast but it you dont want to own up you neednt well all stick by you and ask miss theobald to hand out a punishment to the whole form after all we had a good time because of you and we none of us want you to be punished for something we would all dearly like to have done ourselves thank you susan said claudine thinking that these english girls could be very nice and fair and generous but i shall go to miss theobald i am not ashamed of what i did she is a nasty woman the matron and i shall tell miss theobald that it filled me with pleasure to punish her for some of the unkind things she has done this term welldo and say what you like said susan thinking that claudine would all her life quite probably do and say exactly what she liked i and good luck to you so claudine went to the head knocked firmly at the door and went in she began without any beating about the bush please miss theobald i have come to say that it was i who locked matron in last night i suppose it is not a thing that any english girl would have done with their sofine sense of honour but i am french and i did not like matron and i wanted the fourth form to have a good time we went for a moonlight picnic miss theobald and swam in the pool at least i did not swim but the others did and they said it was magnificent miss theobald found it difficult not to smile at the frank confession claudine always had such a very disarming and innocent air even when she was doing or owning up to the most extraordinary things the head looked keenly at the intelligent french girl why do you dislike matron you wish me to say the truth to you asked claudine well then i will say this matron can find out through eileen all the little stupidities and mischiefs of the fourthformers and then see what happens i miraculously our sheets get torn and we spend hours mending them suddenly stockings are full of holes vests are without buttons alas misstheobald we do not all like eileen and if we show it then these unhappy things happen and we sit indoors mending whilst others play games i see said miss theobald she had suspected this claudine you cannot go about locking people into cup boards i am certain that even french schoolgirls do not do this ah miss theobald i do not go about always locking people up said claudine beginning to launch herself on to one of her long and involved speeches no noonly those people who deserve it should be imprisoned into cupboards me i would never miss theobald thought that claudine had many of mamzelles own ways she smiled to herself and stopped the voluble explanation that will do claudine you will please apologize to matron this morning and you will accept what punishment she gives you there is one thing more she stopped and looked keenly at claudine the little french girl listened intently for she had a great liking and respect for the wise and kindly head mistress that one thing more is about the english sense of honour said miss theobald you speak lightly of it even mockinglybut i think claudine in your heart of hearts you see it for the good and fine thing it really is when you go back to france claudine take one thing with youthe english sense of honour claudine looked solemn she was very much moved miss theobald she said believe me when i say that i do not really mock at it first i did not understand it then i thought it was tiresome in others and even more tiresome to have oneself but now i begin to learn it and it is good very good there came a knock at the door and matron came in looking grimmer than ever she meant to have things out with miss theobald at once claudine was simply delighted to see her now thought the clever girl now i will apologize to matron in front of miss theobald and she will not dare to be too spiteful to me nor to give me too great a punishment so claudine went meekly up to matron cast her eyes down to the ground and spoke in a very timid voice matron it was i who locked you in last night i apologize to you and beg your forgiveness i will gladly bear what punishment you give me miss theobald looked on with much amusement she knew that claudine was acting a part and had cleverly taken advantage of matrons coming to apologize at once in front of the headmistress herself matron went purple in the face she glared at claudine and scolded her severely youre a very naughty girl you deserve to be expelled and what is more i would have you expelled if it was not that your aunt is the french mistress here and it would break her heart to have a thing like that happen actually matron was afraid of mamzelle who was apt to fly off into even more violent tempers than matron herself matron even felt that mamzelle might come and scratch her face and pull her hair out if she dared to try and get claudine expelled it is good of you to consider my kind aunt replied claudine still in a very meek voice what is my punishment to be you will spend every hour of your sparetime this week helping me to mend the school linen said matron she did not see the flash of joy in claudines downcast eyes ah now she would be able to get out of games and walks for a whole week i very well matron she said putting on a most miserable voice that did not deceive the listening miss theobald in the least she turned to the head i will return now to my class she said and gave miss theobald a brilliant and grateful smile she went out of the room shutting the door quietly miss theobald thought that no one could help liking the naughty little girl clever as she was at always getting her own way well miss theobald said matron in a warlike tone can we get down to this business of stealing i cant have it happening any longer its got beyond me day after day it happens and whats more some more of my money has gone since last night only two shillings it is truebut stealing two shillings is as bad as stealing two pounds its thieving right down bad thieving and i think the girl who does it ought to be expelled you wouldnt agree to expelling the girl who locked me in last nightbut maybe youll have to miss theobald yes maybe youll have to what do you mean asked miss theobald in surprise i mean this said matron i think its that little french girl whos taking things shes always in and out of my room with mendingand i hear shes been throwing a lot of money about latelyand i know she hasnt much because mamzelle herself told me so maybe miss theobald you will find that its best to get rid of a girl of that sort and will agree with me that it would be a good thing to expel her paulines mother before miss theobald could make up her mind that day what would be the best way to tackle the matron and her accusations a nasty accident happened in the gym it happened to pauline she was climbing one of the ropes and somehow slipped and fell to the ground she fell with one leg doubled up under her and there was a sickening crack pauline crumpled up on the floor went very white and then quietly fainted the gamesmistress hurried to her in alarm and matron was at once called and the doctor telephoned for broken her leg he said clean break nothing to worry about he set it and pauline was put to bed still white from the shock miss theobald went to see her and pauline looked beseechingly up at her dont tell my mother she said i dont want to worry her please dont tell her my dear child i have already telephoned to her said miss theobald in surprise why shouldnt she be told i dont want to worry her said pauline faintly please ring her up again miss theobald and say she is not to worry and of course she is not to bother to come and see me say i will write to her today you cant write today said miss theobald gently you must keep absolutely quiet today i will ring your mother up again this evening and tell her not to bother to come and see you if she cannot do so tell her not to said pauline sheshe hasnt been well you see i dont want her to be worried every one was sorry about pauline the girls were not allowed to go and see her that day but they sent her in little gifts of flowers and fruit and books everything seems to be happening at once said bobby i saywasnt that a perfectly awful talk that miss theobald had with us this morning it had been a very serious and solemn talk indeed and had happened just before dinner that morning all the fourthformers except pauline who was in the sanatorium under matrons care had been called to miss theobalds drawingroom the head had lightly touched on the night before apologized to matron and received a punishment for ner extraordinary behaviour she said that she would have given permission herself for a moonlight picnic and swim if she had been asked but she realized that girls as young as the fourth still thought it was more fun to do things without permission than with this made the more responsible ones squirm a bit they did not like being considered young and silly then miss theobald passed on to matrons other complaint this was very much more serious of course and the fourth form listened in great discomfort as the head told them that a thief was in their midst and must be found out or must come and confess you must realize that what would be a small thing comparatively speaking in the lower school among the younger children is a much more serious thing among you older girls said the head and matron is quite rightly concerned about the matter whoever is taking things from her room is doing it deliberately and continuallyit is not something done in a moment of urgency and perhaps regretted bitterly afterwardsit is apparently quite coldblooded frequent and deliberate the girls talked about it all afterwards the affair of matron being locked up in the cupboard taking secondplace to this much more serious accusation who in the wide world could it be matron is certain its some one in the fourth form because our common room is the only one near to her room said bobby it would be easy for some one to slip out now and then see if the coast was clear and then pop into matrons room and sneak something such queer things have been stolen besides money said janet puzzled stampsand notepaper and envelopes why those matron says that biscuits and sweets have been taken too it almost looks as if some body has been taking anything they could just out of spite well we none of us love matron said bobby grinning if it was just a question of paying her out for her meannesses any one of us might be the culprit i am glad such things happen to her said claudine she deserves to have unhappiness because she gives so much sadness to others the poor eileen has red eyes all day long today yes i cant help feeling sorry for her said doris its bad enough to have matron as matron but to have her as mother as well must be pretty awful pat isabel janet bobby and hilary discussed the matter between themselves on the tenniscourt that day who could it be said bobby has any one suddenly been having more money than usual wondered pat the same thought at once came into every ones mind yesclaudine has shes been splashing it about like anything and she has plenty of chance of going into matrons room because she is always taking mending there but it cant be claudine its true she hasnt our sense of honourbut she wouldnt do a thing like that you know she doesnt care what she does when she dislikes somebody or wants to get even with them she wouldnt think it was wrong even the five looked at one another suddenly feeling extremely uncomfortable they knew claudine had very little money indeedand yet she had given angela that lovely bagand had spent ten whole shillings on cherries for the picnic it did really seem as if it might be claudine the bell rang for teatime and the girls sped into the school after tea angela and alison went off together down to the town to get something they wanted on the way back they overtook an elderly woman dressed in sober black clothes sensible flatheeled shoes and a plain hat she wore glasses and her face was thin and worn but kindly i bet thats a cook come after the job at st clares said angela to alison the girls passed her and she turned and spoke to them could you tell me if i am on the right road for st clares you are st clare girls arent you yes said alison keep straight on the girls made as if to go on but the woman stopped them with a question that astonished them very much how is my girl pauline now the head mistress telephoned me to say she had broken her leg this morning and i caught the first train i could im mrs jones angela and alison stopped dead in the road and stared openmouthed at the little elderly woman they remembered paulines wonderful stories of mrs binghamjones her beautiful and wealthy mother they simply could not understand this plain tiredlooking woman almost old being paulines supposedly wonderful mother scorn welled up at once in angelas heart so pauline who was always trying to outdo and outboast angela herself had for a mother a woman who looked like a wornout cook she tried to pull alison up the road quickly but something in mrs joness tired face had touched alison alison had many faults but she was sensitive to other peoples feelings and she could sense mrs joness worry and anxiety she shook her arm away from angelas pauline is all right she said kindly we couldnt see her today but weve all sent her somethingyou know flowers and books and thingsjust to cheer her up are you better now pauline was to disappointed that you and her father couldnt come and see her at halfterm because you were ill mrs jones looked extremely surprised i havent been ill she said i wanted to come at halfterm but pauline wrote to say there was a case of scarlet fever at the school and the halfterm matches had been put off so would i not come alison was horrified in a flash she saw that pauline afraid that her mother would not shine among the other mothers knowing that she had told all kinds of lies that would be found out when the girls saw her elderly tired mother had actually made up the lie about scarlet fever to stop her people from coming at halftermand had pretended to be bitterly disappointed because they werent coming angela of course heard what was said and an expression of scorn and contempt came over her face well she said there was no case of but alison was not going to let angela interfere in the matter she gave her friend a sharp nudge that made her squeal in surprise then she gave her such a fierce look that angela said no more but thought in surprise that alison must be mad to treat her angela like that i hope pauline is happy at st clares said mrs jones she has always wanted to go there ever since she heard about it i didnt see that i could afford to send her but i managed to scrape enough together her poor father is an invalid you knowhas been for years but i expect shes told you all that we havent a lot of money but i did want pauline to have a good time at a nice school i said to her well my dear you wont have as much pocketmoney as the others and you wont have as many treats but there you are if you like to go under those conditions i wont stop you mrs jones talked to alison not to angela she liked alisons pretty kindly little face and was glad to have some one to talk to angela gave a snort of contempt and went quickly on up the hill towards st clares its quite a way isnt it said mrs jones beginning to pant i didnt take a taxi because taxis are expensive and i thought i could easily walk poor little paulineit is terribly bad luck to have broken her leg like this i thought she would be so pleased to see me if i can hurry along at once alison didnt feel so certain she thought that if pauline had kept her mother away by lies at halfterm she would certainly not want her at st clares now with all her lies exposed for what they were pauline is disgusting thought alison she really is she takes everything from this poor little mother of hers who probably goes without a lot of things she wants in order to pay for pauline hereand then keeps her away from the school because she is ashamed of her beast alison took mrs jones to the school door and left her there in charge of a maid she went to take off her hat and blazer and joined the rest of her form in the common room i hope angela doesnt go and hold forth about paulines poor old mother thought alison uncomfortably i feel sorry for the old thing she looked so tired and worn she heard angelas voice as she opened the commonroom door and my dear i know who it was that took matrons beastly money and everythingtheres not a doubt of it it was pauline pauline what do you mean why do you say that came janets voice at once ill tell you why said angela and paused dramatically i and alison walked up the road with paulines mother todayand from what she said to us its pretty certain that our dear pauline is a frightful storyteller and quite likely a horrid little thief angelaand claudine youll have to tell us why you say all this said bobby the whole of the fourth form crowded round to hear only claudine was not there and neither of course was pauline well listen said angela spitefully i and alison were walking up the road and we saw an ugly little elderly woman awfully plain dressed in black in front of us i thought she must be a cook coming to try for the job going here and it turned out to be mrs jones paulines mothernot mrs binghamjones if you please but just plain mrs jones shes a nice little woman said alison not liking the contempt in angelas voice nice little woman said angela rounding on alison scornfully common as dirt you mean and when i think of paulines airs and gracestrying to make out her mother was as good as minetrying to pretend that her family were as grand as mine really areswanking about her cars and thingsand theyre as poor as church mice and can only just afford to send pauline here i golly wont i tell pauline what i think of her when i see her ill tell her what i think of dear mrs jones dressed up like a cook moaning about her poor little pauline before any one else could speak alison stood up she was rather white and there was a queer look on her face you wont tell pauline anything of the sort she said you wont tell pauline anything thats going to make her ashamed of that poor old mother of hers dont you realize how youll make her hate her mother if she knows you saw her and are saying this kind of thing about her i think pauline has behaved disgustingly about things but im not going to have you making matters worse for mrs jones by saying horrible things about her to pauline angela was amazed could this be her friend alison talking to her like this she stared at her unable to say a word then she found her tongue well if you stick up for people like paulines awful mother im jolly glad youre not coming to stay with me for the holidays she said spitefully im going i shant stay here to be insulted by somebody i thought was my best friend poor alison was now trembling for she hated rows angela moved towards the door but to her intense surprise and annoyance two girls caught firmly hold of her arms and sat her down violently almost jerking the breath out of her body you may not want to listen to alison but youre jolly well going to listen to us said carlotta her gypsy eyes flashing fire now we will say a few things let me go you beasts said angela between her teeth you seem to be talking a lot about mothers said carlotta bending over the angry angela and talking in such a fierce tone that angela drew back afraid well we will talk about mothersyour mother we would not talk about her if it was not necessarybut it is very necessary now in order to get some sense into your thick head ill scream if you dont let me go said angela in a rage every time you scream i shall slap you hard like that said carlotta and gave angela such a smack on her plump shoulder that she squealed in pain shut up carlotta said bobby you cant act like that yes i can said carlotta coolly and angela knew she could so she made no further sound paulines mother may be tired and old and plain and poor said carlotta but thats no reason to despise her now there is reason to despise your mother angela she is a spoilt rude discontented horrible little snob just like you are i and will you please tell her on no account to come here again turning up her nose at everything because we dont want to see her we dislike her and despise her and we want her to take you away as soon as ever she will hear hear said bobby janet and the twins angela went very pale these were terrible things to hear but she had brought them on herself she too had been ashamed of her spoilt mother when she had come at halftermbut she had not guessed how bitterly the girls had resented her contemptuous attitude towards the school and all it stood for thats enough carlotta said susan howes uncomfortably and it was enough angela looked as if she was about to faint she wanted to sink through the floor she who had boasted and bragged of herself and her family who had set herself up as better than any of them was being spoken to as if she were dirt she gave an enormous sob and fled from the room well thank goodness shes gone said pat cheer up alison i was proud of you when you spoke up like that perhaps now you will see angela as clearly as we see her yesi do said poor alison really distressed i think shes awful i did feel so sorry for that poor mrs jonesand angela had nothing but scorn for her theres no kindness in her none at all said janet wellshes got to learn that kindness breeds kindness and spite breeds spite shell have an awful time if she doesnt do you think its right what angela said that pauline might be the thief said doris she has splashed money about very much latelyand if shes really poor where did it come from we half thought it might be claudine said isabe you know shes poor toohardly ever has a penny and then quite suddenly she had lots of money and you know how unscrupulous claudine is i like herbut she simply has no sense of honour at all i we did wonder if it could be her sh sh said some one but too latefor claudine who had come in unnoticed had heard what isabel had said the little french girl at once pushed her way to the front of the crowd of girls isabel saw her coming and was horrified not for the world would she have had claudine hear what she had said claudine she said im sorry you heard dont be angry we only thought it because you seem so different from us in your ideas of honour and it did seem to us that if you disliked matron you might pay her out in that way claudine looked round the little group intense anger in her small face she saw isabels earnest face pats scared one bobbys watchful oneand then to the enormous astonishment of the listening girls the anger in her face melted awayand claudine threw back her head and laughed the girls stared at her in surprise honestly thought doris you simply never know what claudine will do bobby thought how like mamzelle she was in her swift changes from anger to laughter but what a blessing that claudine could see any humour in isabels words i am not angry said claudine at last wiping away the tears of laughter no i am not angry you english girls you are so serious and solemn and so very very honourable i too have my own honour and although it is not quite like yours yet perhaps one day it will be the good miss theobald she said to me this morning that one thing i must take back to france with me one onlythe english sense of honour just like miss theobald to say a thing like that said janet but why did you laugh just now claudine i laugh because i was thinking so suddenly of the reason why i have so much money now to spend said claudine smiling her infectious smile but first if i tell you you must promise on your english honour that never never will you tell my aunt mathilde what i have done oh claudinewhat have you done said pat imagining the most awful things you remember my sobeautiful cushioncover that my aunt loved so much said claudine well i sold it to one of your mothers for quite a lot of money you see i needed moneythere were birthdays coming and i do not like to have so little and one of your mothers she was so nice to me and she bought my sobeautiful cover and i sent it to her by post i explained to her that it was my own and i lacked for money and she was so so kind to me was that my mother asked alison suspiciously i saw you talking nineteen to the dozen to her at halfterm mother would do a nice thing like that and never say a word about it i hope she puts the cushioncover in my bedroom thats all well said claudine grinning all over her little monkeyface it might have been your sonice mother alison my sense of honour forbids me to say and now i appeal to your sense of honour also not to tell my aunt what has happened to my cushioncover i told her i had sent it to my mother you are an awful storyteller claudine said gladys shocked you deceive people right and left i i just cant understand you why couldnt you tell mamzelle you had sold the cover instead of telling lies and keeping it a secret ah me i adore secrets said claudine her eyes dancing and aunt mathilde would have written to the sokind mother and got the cover back and repaid the money and i should have been so so sad for it is nice to earn money do you not think so i think youre a puzzle said janet ill never make you out claudine you go and tell lies in order to sell your cushioncover and get money for somebodys birthdayyou shut matron up to give us a good time you ah say no more of my badness said claudine earnestly one day i may become good yes certainly i shall become good if i stay at this sofine school for another term i well youre jolly decent not to have taken offence at what i said said isabel warmly im glad you told us where you got the money from im afraid now it means that pauline must have taken it shes had such a lot of money lately blow i i wish beastly things like this wouldnt happen what do you think we ought to do about it hilary and i will go to miss theobald and tell her everything said susan we cant tackle pauline now she wont be fit enough but miss theobald ought to know what we think and why come on hilary lets get it over alison is a good friend hilary and susan went to miss theobalds room and knocked on the door she called out to them to come in fortunately she was alone she looked up with a pleasant smile as the two girls came in well she said what do yon fourthformers want you havent been getting into any more trouble i hope no miss theobald said susan but we are rather worried about this stealing businessand we have an idea who it is why doesnt the girl herself come to me then said miss theobald looking very serious wellshe cant said susan you seewe think its paulineand you know shes in the san with a broken leg pauline said miss theobald astonishment showing in her face i cant think it is pauline she isnt the type nosurely it cannot be pauline we thought it might be claudine at first said hilary but it isnt ah i am glad of that said miss theobald i still cannot think it is pauline she is not altogether sensible in some waysbut she did not seem to be at all a dishonest girl well miss theobald we have something else to tell yon about pauline which will show you that she is really peculiar in some ways and not at all truthful said susan gravely we are not of course telling tales to you but we know we cant deal with this ourselves so we have come to you quite rightly said miss theobald also very gravely wellwhat is there to say about pauline her mother is with her now and possibly i might be able to have a talk with her about pauline before she goes hilary and susan together told miss theobald of paulines ridiculous boasting and lyingof how she had put off her mother coming at halfterm by telling an absurd story about a scarletfever casehow she had pretended to be bitterly disappointedhow she had always seemed to have plenty of money and yet her mother had told alison she was afraid that pauline would always be short of pocketmoney so you see said hilary putting everything together and knowing what an awful fibber pauline was we felt it was probably she who stole from matron i see said miss theobald curiously enough people who tell lies for the reason that pauline tells them are rarely dishonest in other ways you see pauline lies because she longs to be thought better than she isthat is the only reason she lies now if she stole she would know herself to be despicable and that others would despise her too so she would not steal but from all you tell me i am afraid that she does steal having so much money when it is clear that her mother cannot supply her with much is very curious yes it is said susan well miss theobald we have told you all we know and think we would all like this stealing business to be cleared upthe fourth form hate it as you can imagineand we are glad to leave it in your hands to settle there came a knock at the door miss theobald called come in before any one entered she nodded to the two fourthformers to dismiss them i will see to everything she said i will talk to paulinepossibly tomorrow or the day afteras soon as she has recovered from the shock of her broken leg the doctor is to put it into plaster and then she will return to school to do lessons whilst it is healing it is essential that i should have this matter cleared up before she returns to the fourth form a maid had entered the room and waited until miss theobald had finished speaking please madam she said mrs jones would like a word with you before she goes tell her to come in said miss theobald mrs jones came in hilary and susan glanced at her curiously as they went out so this poor tired worriedlooking little woman so plainly dressed was paulines marvellous pretty beautifully dressed wealthy mother what an idiot pauline was mrs jones plunged into her worries as soon as the door shut oh miss theobald im really bothered about pauline she didnt seem at all pleased to see me she cried her heart out when i told her id met some of her schoolfellows on the way up and had talked to them i just cant understand her i thought shed be so pleased to see me she even blamed me for coming said i was making a fussand after all shes my only child and very precious to me miss theobald looked at the distressed woman and was very sorry for her she wondered whether or not to say anything about paulines stupid boasting and to explain that paulines unkindness was because she was ashamed of having her lies exposed for what they wereshe was ashamed of her mother ashamed of not having enough money ashamed of everything so that she had forced herself to make up a whole new family and home of her own then she decided not to say anything it would only hurt and worry the poor little woman even more she must have a serious talk with pauline first and perhaps she could persuade pauline herself to put matters right so she listened and tried to comfort mrs jones as best she could dont worry she said pauline has had a shock through falling like that dont take any notice of what she says mrs jones went at last only halfcomforted feeling puzzled and hurt miss theobald sighed there suddenly seemed to be quite a lot of difficult problems to solve how upset poor mrs jones would be if she had to be told that her only child was a thief as well as a stupid boaster i will have a talk to pauline tomorrow or the next day thought miss theobald i only hope matron does not make any more fussreally she is a most unpleasant woman matron did make plenty more fuss she went storming into miss theobalds room the next morning with another complaint ten shillings gone this time a tenshilling note i out of my purse too and i had hidden it for safety in my workbasket but its gone all the same miss theobald that girl has got to be found and expelled miss theobald listened in astonishment how could pauline be the thief if she was in the san with a broken leg but as matron went on complaining it appeared that her workbasket had been in the san she had taken it there to do her mending as she had to sit with pauline so pauline might have been able to take the note from the purse other girls had popped in and out too as pauline was allowed to see her form that day it was all very tiresome miss theobald got rid of matron as soon as she could thinking that a lot of trouble was coming out of the fourth form that term the fourthformers had been very cool towards angela since the row angela looked pinched and unhappy but nobody felt sorry for her not even alison at halfpast twelve alison saw angela putting on her hat to go out where are you going she asked you know we mustnt go down to the town alonedo you want me to come with you no said angela sulkily if you want to know what im going to do ill tell you im going down to the nearest telephone box to telephone to my mother and tell her all the beastly things youve said about her and ask her to come today and take me away no dont do that said alison distressed we only said those things because you were so horrid about poor old mrs jones angela but angelas mind was made up and oft she went alison waited about miserably not liking to tell the others she pictured angelas mother sweeping down in her rollsbentley spiteful and malicious ready to say all kinds of horrible things about st clares and its girls it was not a pleasant thought presently about five minutes before the dinnerbell she saw angela coming back but what a miserable tearstained angela i alison went to meet her unexpectedly liking this humble unhappy angela far more than she had liked the bright and boastful one whats the matter she said angela turned to alison and began to weep bitterly oh alison i mothers awayand i got on to daddy instead but instead of listening to me and comforting me he was very angry and oh he said mother hadnt any right to talk as she did at halftermand he was going to see i didnt grow up thinking i could say hurtful things to peopleand hes coming today to see miss theobald about me oh angela said alison in dismay how simply awful he must have been angry miss theobald wont be at all pleased when she hears youve been telephoning to your people oh i know i know wept angela i dont know what to do oh alison i know ive been beastly but please dont desert me now i was awful yesterday about paulines mother im ashamed of it now do do be my friend again angela said alison looking very serious all of a sudden ive been a very bad sort of friend to yon ive praised you and flattered you and thought the world of you when all the time it would have been better to have laughed at you and teased you like the others do bobby would have made you a much better friend or the twins they would have been sensible with you ive spoilt you and been silly well never mind go on being my friend begged angela who now that things were looking black felt that she simply must have some one who liked her please do alison ill try and be nicer i really will but oh what shall i say to daddy when he comes this afternoon im so afraid of him when he gets really angry listen said alison immediately after lunch well go down to the telephone box again you get on to your father and then say that youve been thinking things over and youve come to the conclusion youve been an idiot but youd like another chance then let me have a word with him and maybe between us we can stop him coming oh alison youre a brick said angela drying her eyes and sniffing daddy liked you hell listen to you oh thank you for your help the dinnerbell had long since gone the two girls were late miss ellis taking a look at angelas swollen eyes contented herself with a few sharp words and then said no more immediately after dinner the girls went off to the telephone box angela got through to her annoyed father and made her little speech ive been an idiot i see it now dont come down daddy im going to try and do better heres my friend alison to talk to you the telephone receiver was passed to alison who rather nervous spoke the little speech she herself had prepared good afternoon this is alison speaking angelas friend angela is all right now she was upset before and rather silly but i am sure she is going to settle down now and be a sport so i dont think you need to leave your work and come to st clares oh said angelas father in a grim voice well as im very busy i wont today but any more nonsense from angela and i shall come down and make a big row i put angela into st clares because its the finest school i know and there she is going to stay until she too thinks its the finest school she knows if you really are her friend youll help her to realize this youve been there some time i know yes i have said alison earnestly and it is the very finest school in the kingdom i ill teach angela that really i will and so will the others well dont spoil her said the faroff voice not sounding quite so grim shake her up a bit she may look like a golden princess or an angel but shes not a bit like one inside and id like her to be tell her to speak to me again angela took the receiver what she heard comforted her thank you daddy she said ill try i really will goodbye she put the receiver back looking much happier daddy said that although he is often angry with me he will always love me she said to alison and he said if i loved him id try to be a bit more like he wants me to be so i shall try now thanks alison for your advice she squeezed her friends arm alison took angelas arm in hers and they walked back to the school alison was talking sternly to herself as they went now no more telling angela she is lovely i no more flattering her no more praising her up to the skies because she looks like an angel i its no good looking like one if youre just the opposite inside tease her and laugh at her and scold her and point out her faultsthats what ive got to do if im to be a real friend to angela and to the astonishment of all the fourth form things between the two friends appeared now to be quite changed angela was now the docile one accepting teasing criticism and alison was the leader good for both of them said bobby with a grin this will make angela a nicer person altogether and will end in giving alison quite a lot of common sense matron has a shock i wonder whether miss theobald has tackled pauline about taking matrons money and other things yet said hilary to susan after tea that day eileen looked up startled she had not been there the day before when the matter had been discussed and hilary and susan had gone off to see miss theobald she had been crossexamined continually by her mother who had tried to find out exactly what the fourthformers had done on mirabels birthday nightbut eileen had kept her word and had not told her anything paulinetaking mothers money said eileen amazed whats all this i havent heard a word about it havent you said janet surprised oh noyou were with matron when we discussed it yesterdayand today we havent had a minute to say anything about it not that theres anything much to say really except that we all think its pauline who has taken the things belonging to your mother you see we know now that her people can hardly afford to send her here and that she hasnt much pocketmoneyso as she has been splashing money about lately we felt sure she was the thief shes such a fibber she could quite well go a bit further and be a thief as well and miss theobald is going to tackle her about it said susan hilary and i went and told her everything yesterday im sorry pauline broke her legbut really if shes a thief as well as a storyteller i think its a good punishment for her eileen sat and stared at the chattering girls bobby thought she looked rather strange do you feel all right she asked you look a bit funny of course im all right said eileen she got up and went out to the girls astonishment they saw her a minute later flying down the drive at top speed whats up with eileen said hilary in amazement has she forgotten weve got prep to do tonight she apparently had she did not turn up for prep at all and miss ellis sent to ask matron if she had kept eileen with her for any reason matron appeared at the classroom door looking annoyed i cant imagine where eileen is she said i hope yon will punish her miss ellis she has been such an obstinate stubborn girl lately eileen did not even return for supper and it was only when the fourthformers were getting undressed that they saw her again doris looked out of her dormitory window and saw eileen coming up one of the schoolpaths with her was somebody its eddie said alison gracious wont eileen get mto a row she must have shot off to see eddie and now hes come back with her eileen looked strungup and tearful eddie looked much the same they disappeared into the school instead of going up to their mothers room they went straight to miss theobalds room cheer up whispered eddie im here ill take care of you eileen the two went into miss theobalds room the head mistress looked surprised to see eileen with a boy eileen told her who eddie was this is my brother edgar she said and then she broke down and began to sob bitterly and piteously miss theobald was distressed eddie put his arm protectingly round his sister dont cry he said ill tell about everything then he turned to miss theobald miss theobald he said today eileen heard that another girl pauline was going to be accused of stealing from matron our mother wellit was eileen that tookatt the money and other things not pauline or any one else i well said miss theobald thinking that surprises were coming thick and fast in the last few days but why what made her do such an extraordinary thing it was because of me said eddie you see i got a job in an engineering works at the beginning of this term and mother was very pleased well i hadnt been there long before i had an accident with a car and they sacked me ii didnt dare to tell my mother miss theobald miss theobald looked at the weak thin face of the lad in front of her and was not surprised that he feared his badtempered spitefultongued mother how she would tear him and rend him with her tongue if she knew he had failed in his job well went on eddie swallowing hard and still holding his arm round eileen well i thought maybe id be able to get another job fairly soon and then mother need only be told that id changed jobs but you see id no money and i had my lodgings and food to pay forso i managed to hitchhike over here one day and see eileen without mother knowing and i asked her to give me what money she had i see said miss theobald very grave and eileen stole from her mother to give to you i didnt know she was taking mothers money said eddie i thought it was her ownout of her moneybox or out of the post office savings i knew shed got a little and she brought me biscuits too and some notepaper and stamps to apply for other jobs shes shes been such a brick to me miss theobald oh eddie id do anything for you you know that sobbed poor eileen but miss theobald when i knew pauline was going to be accused of something id done then i rushed out and went to eddie and told him everything and he came back with me to tell you oh miss theobald we dont dare to tell mother what a mixup said miss theobald looking at the two scared unhappy young faces before her she could not help in her heart blaming matron very much for all this if she had been a kindly loving mother helping her children instead of expecting far too much of them this would never have happened they would have gone running to her for comfort and help instead of hiding things from her and stealing from her too frightened to do anything else you see said eileen drying her eyes as eddie is mothers son i didnt really think it was wrong to take her money and other things to help him i see said miss theobald but it was wrong all the same eileen i am glad to think that you had the courage to realize that you could not let another girl bear the blame for your own wrongdoing that is a great point in your favour there was a pause then eddie spoke rather nervously miss theobalddo you think you could see mother for us please do she might not be so terribly angry if you spoke to her first miss theobald felt a little grim yes she said i will see her you two can wait in the next room until i have spoken to her eddie and eileen retired to the next room looking forlorn and frightened miss theobald rang her bell and told the maid who answered it to ask matron to come and speak to her matron soon appeared crackling in starched apron and uniform sit down matron said miss theobald i have found out who has taken your money and i wanted to tell you about it i hope you will expel the girl said matron in a severe voice after all miss theobald ive got a girl here myself in the fourth form its not a very good influence for her is it to have a thief living side by side with her well matron said miss theobald i have made up my mind that i myself will not decide whether to expel this poor little thief or not you shall decide and you alone matrons eyes sparkled thank you she said you may consider that my decision is taken the girl will goand go tomorrow very well said miss theobald now listen to my story please this girl did not steal for herself but for some one she loved who was in trouble stealing is always stealing said matron in a righteous voice she was afraid to go to her mother for help afraid to go to her for advice continued miss theobald then the mother is as much to blame as the girl said matron mothers who have children so scared of them that they will steal have done a very bad job as mothers i thoroughly agree with you said miss theobald nevertheless this girl had the courage to come and tell me and she asked me to tell you where is the little thief said matron fiercely i shall have a few words to say to her i promise you i out she goes tomorrow miss theobald stood up and opened the door connecting her drawingroom with her study you will find the little thief in here she said with her brother matron walked firmly into the study ready to lash out at the thief she saw there her two children eileen and eddie they stared at her nervously whats this said matron in a faint voice why is eileen hereand eddie eileen is the thief matronand eddie is the one she stole forand you are the hard mother they were too scared to come to for advice and help said miss theobald in a grave and serious voice and i think knowing you as i dothat eileen is not the one who should leave st claresbut you matrons face suddenly crumpled up and her mouth began to tremble she stared unbelievingly at eileen and eddie eileen was crying again you are a hard and spiteful woman went on miss theobalds solemn voice this boy and girl need help and comfort but they would never get it from you ive got another job got it today mother said eddie i shall pay back every penny eileen took youre not to scold her she did it for me because she loved me soon i shall earn enough money to let her live with me and keep house for me then you wont be bothered by either of us weve always disappointed you we werent clever or gifted though we did our best but ill look after eileen now dont eddie dont said his mother in a choking voice dont talk like that what have i done oh what have i done to have this punishment on my shoulders miss theobald shut the door they must sort things out for themselves matron had made her own bed and must lie on it those two children would probably be all right because they loved each other and would always stick together they were weakwilled and not very attractive charactersbut their love for each other would give them strength and courage miss theobald took up the telephone receiver she got through to the old matron who was now almost recovered from her illness matron said miss theobald can you come back tomorrow you can have as easy a time as you want tobut we cant do without you any longer yesi have a feeling that the present matron will be gone by tomorrow goodwe shall be pleased to see you back things settle down at last and now still one more thing remained to be done pauline must be seen and her affairs put right too so accordingly next day pauline was astonished to see miss theobald coming into the san looking much more serious than usual it was the second surprise pauline had had that day the first was when quite a new matron had appeared plump and jolly and twinkling pauline had stared at her in astonishment delighted not to see the other matron hallo said this new matron so youve broken your leg very careless of you dont make a habit of it will you wheres the other matron asked pauline shes had to leave in a hurry said matron putting paulines bedclothes straight so ive come back and let me warn you im a real old bear i ive been here for years and years im probably a hundred years old and ive scolded most of the girls mothers as well as the girls themselves oh youre the old matron the girls have told me about said pauline pleased thats good why did matron leave in such a hurry has eileen gone too yes said matron they both had to leave in a hurry not our business why is it now thenwhat about those pillows pauline had hardly got over her astonishment at seeing a different matron when miss theobald came in as usual the head went straight to the point and soon the horrified pauline was realizing that miss theobald and the girls too all knew what a stupid untruthful boaster she had been she lay back in bed feeling ashamed and miserable miss theobald went relentlessly on and finished by telling her how unhappy and puzzled she had made her mother she came rushing to see you said miss theobald she panted up from the station because she could not afford a taxiand you know what sort of a welcome you gave her pauline turned her face to the wall and a tear trickled down her cheek and there is yet another thing said miss theobald remembering some one has stolen moneyand because you seemed to have plenty though the girls heard this week yon were supposed to have very little pocketmoney you were suspected of being the thief i so yon see pauline to what big and terrible suspicions bragging and storytelling can lead us oh i ive never stolen a thing in my life cried pauline i had some money in the savings bankand without mother knowing i took my savings book here with meand when i wanted money i took some out thats how i had plenty of pocketmoney miss theobald please believe me i do believe you said miss theobald but you must hand over your book to me and not withdraw any more money without your mothers permission and if you stay here at st clares you will have to do what some of the other girls do who have very little money say so quite honestly i nobody minds we should never judge people by the amount of money or possessions they have but by what they are you must learn that pauline or you will never know what real happiness is i feel very miserable muttered pauline anxious for a kind word ii dont know how i shall face all the girls after this tell susan or hilary or the twins that you have been foolish said miss theobald getting up they are all sorry you have broken your leg and i think they will see that you are treated kindlybut you will have to earn their kindness and friendship now paulinenot try to buy it with tales of wealth and great possessions i earn their friendship by being sincere and natural and kindly as for feeling very miserablewell that is part of the punishment you have brought on yourself isnt it and you will have to bear it as bravely as you can miss theobald turned to go she smiled down at pauline her smile kinder than her words and the girl felt a little comforted she did as miss theobald had advised and confided in hilary when she came to see her hilary was outspoken but helpful youre a frightful idiot reauy frightful and i shall only help yon and make the others decent to you on one condition pauline what asked pauline that you write to your mother and say you are sorry for being such a beast to her when she came to see you and tell her youll give her a great welcome next time she comes said hilary im not going round putting everything right for you my girl unless you first do a little puttingright yourself i and dont you dare to brag about a single thing more this term or well all sit on you good and hard and with that piece of advice hilary went off to tell the others that pauline had come to her senses at last and as she had broken her leg and was feeling pretty miserable what about giving her a chance when she came back to class well what with eileen gone and angela reforming herself fast and pauline getting a little sense knocked into her and matron disappeared for good we seem to be getting on nicely i said bobby with one of her grins it only remains for claudine to get the english sense of honour put in pat then we shall indeed be a form of saints alison had a letter from eileen the following week she read it to the others dear alison i dont know whether you were ever told but i was the thief you me eddie was out of a job and hadnt any money so he asked me to help him and i did bat i hadnt much money myself so i took mothers and some other things too well it was a most frightful shock to mother and she said he couldnt bear to stay at st clans another day so we packed and went miss theobald was frightfully decent to eddie and me i simply cant tell yon how decent she even offered to keep me on at st clares when mother went but i couldnt face you all and anyway i dont fit in there i know i dont so i ant going to study shorthand and typing and then i am going to get a job in the office where eddie works and we shall be together mother is quite different now i think it was an awful shock to her to find out how bad i wasbut it was for eddie and i couldnt help it mother has been kinder and gentler really yon would hardly know her eddie and i think that when we are both earning money mother wont need to work and then she can take a rest and perhaps feel happier i thought i had better let yon know what happened to me because i left so suddenly i left my silver thimble behind in the school workboxthe one in the fourthform cupboard will yon please have it yourself in gratitude for taking me out at halfterm as i can never repay that i hope paulines leg is better please alison dont always think unkindly of me will yon i know i was a sneak but you cant imagine how difficult things were for me sometimes yours with gratitude eileen paterson the girls were all rather touched by this letter alison at once found the thimble and said she would wear it and not think too badly of eileen it was mostly her mothers fault she was such a little sneak and beast said bobby golly were lucky to have decent mothers arent we angela went red at this remark but said nothing she had been so much nicer latelyand she had determined that when she went home for the holidays she was going to praise st clares night and day and not allow her mother to say a single word against it i mothers could make bad or good childrenbut thought angela maybe children could alter mothers sometimes too she was going to have a good try to make her mother change her mind about quite a lot of things hiss theobald would have been very delighted if she had known some of the thoughts that went through angelas golden head those days hols will soon be here now said pat to isabel its been an exciting term hasnt itand arent you glad our old matron is back hie bobbywhat about a really good trick to round off the term cant you and janet think of one i dare say we can grinned bobby her goodnatured face looking tanned and even more freckled than usual we could put a frog in claudines desk or fill her pencilbox with earwigs suggested janet with a wicked look at the horrified claudine if you do such a thing i take the train and the boat to france at once declared the french girl she would too said janet wellperhaps wed better not try out anything of that sort on claudine it would be a pity if she went back to france before she had had time to get that sense of honour she is always talking about claudine threw a cushion at janets head it knocked over doriss workbasket doris leapt up and threw a heap of mending at claudine it scattered itself over mirabel who was just coming into the room the girls shrieked with laughter to see mirabel standing in surprise with somebodys vest over her head in a trice there was a fine fight going on with squeals and yells arms legs and heads stuck out in all directions the door opened again and miss theobald looked in with a visitor and this she said is the fourthform common room girls girls what are you doing what will you be like as sixformers if you behave like kindergarten children now what will they be like not very different i expect well wait and see
