 once upon a time by richard harding davis illustrated charles scribners sons new york copyright by charles scribners sons to gouverneur morris contents a question of latitude the spy the messengers a wasted day a charmed life the amateur the makebelieve man peace manoeuvres illustrations then how did you suppose your sister was going to read it frontispiece facing page schnitzel was smiling to himself schnitzel you certainly are a magnificent liar i think said ainsley they have lost their way was it you demanded young andrews in a puzzled tone or your brother who tried to knife me mr thorndike stood irresolute and then sank back into his chair do i look as easy as that or are you just naturally foolish she was easily the prettiest and most strikinglooking woman in the room a question of latitude of the school of earnest young writers at whom the word muckraker had been thrown in opprobrium and by whom it had been caught up as a title of honor everett was among the younger and less conspicuous but if in his skirmishes with graft and corruption he had failed to correct the evils he attacked from the contests he himself had always emerged with credit his sincerity and his methods were above suspicion no one had caught him in misstatement or exaggeration even those whom he attacked admitted he fought fair for these reasons the editors of magazines with the fear of libel before their eyes regarded him as a safe man the public feeling that the evils he exposed were due to its own indifference with uncomfortable approval and those he attacked with impotent anger their anger was impotent because in the case of everett the weapons used by their class in striking back were denied them they could not say that for money he sold sensations because it was known that a proud and wealthy parent supplied him with all the money he wanted nor in his private life could they find anything to offset his attacks upon the misconduct of others men had been sent to spy upon him and women to lay traps but the men reported that his evenings were spent at his club and from the women those who sent them learned only that everett treats a lady just as though she is a lady accordingly when with much trumpeting he departed to investigate conditions in the congo there were some who rejoiced the standard of life to which everett was accustomed was high in his home in boston it had been set for him by a father and mother who though critics rather than workers in the world had taught him to despise what was mean and ungenerous to write the truth and abhor a compromise at harvard he had interested himself in municipal reform and when later he moved to new york he transferred his interest to the problems of that city his attack upon tammany hall did not utterly destroy that organization but at once brought him to the notice of the editors by them he was invited to tilt his lance at evils in other parts of the united states at systems trusts convict camps municipal misrule his work had met with a measure of success that seemed to justify lowells weekly in sending him further afield and he now was on his way to tell the truth about the congo personally everett was a healthy cleanminded enthusiast he possessed all of the advantages of youth and all of its intolerance he was supposed to be engaged to florence carey but he was not there was however between them an understanding which understanding as everett understood it meant that until she was ready to say i am ready he was to think of her dream of her write loveletters to her and keep himself only for her he loved her very dearly and having no choice was content to wait his content was fortunate as miss carey seemed inclined to keep him waiting indefinitely except in europe everett had never travelled outside the limits of his own country but the new land toward which he was advancing held no terrors as he understood it the congo was at the mercy of a corrupt ring in every part of the united states he had found a city in the clutch of a corrupt ring the conditions would be the same the methods he would use to get at the truth would be the same the result for reform would be the same the english steamer on which he sailed for southampton was one leased by the independent state of the congo and with a few exceptions her passengers were subjects of king leopold on board the language was french at table the men sat according to the rank they held in the administration of the jungle and each in his buttonhole wore the tiny silver star that showed that for three years to fill the storehouses of the king of the belgians he had gathered rubber and ivory in the smokingroom everett soon discovered that passengers not in the service of that king the english and german officers and traders held aloof from the belgians their attitude toward them seemed to be one partly of contempt partly of pity are your english protectorates on the coast then so much better administered everett asked the english coaster who for ten years in nigeria had escaped fever and sudden death laughed evasively i have never been in the congo he said only know what they tell one but youll see for yourself that is he added youll see what they want you to see they were leaning on the rail with their eyes turned toward the coast of liberia a gloomy green line against which the waves cast up fountains of foam as high as the cocoanut palms as a subject of discussion the coaster seemed anxious to avoid the congo it was there he said pointing the three castles struck on the rocks she was a total loss so were her passengers he added they ate them everett gazed suspiciously at the unmoved face of the veteran who ate them he asked guardedly sharks the natives that live back of that shoreline in the lagoons everett laughed with the assurance of one for whom a trap had been laid and who had cleverly avoided it cannibals he mocked cannibals went out of date with pirates but perhaps he added apologetically this happened some years ago happened last month said the trader but liberia is a perfectly good republic protested everett the blacks there may not be as far advanced as in your colonies but theyre not cannibals monrovia is a very small part of liberia said the trader dryly and none of these protectorates or crown colonies on this coast pretends to control much of the hinterland there is sierra leone for instance about the oldest of them last year the governor celebrated the hundredth anniversary of the year the british abolished slavery they had parades and teafights and all the blacks were in the street in straw hats with cricket ribbons thanking god they were not as other men are not slaves like their grandfathers well just at the height of the jubilation the tribes within twenty miles of the town sent in to say that they also were holding a palaver and it was to mark the fact that they never had been slaves and never would be and if the governor doubted it to send out his fighting men and theyd prove it it cast quite a gloom over the celebration do you mean that only twenty miles from the coast began everett ten miles said the coaster wait till you see calabar thats our exhibit a the cleanest best administered everything there is model hospitals barracks golf links last year ten miles from calabar dr stewart rode his bicycle into a native village the king tortured him six days cut him up and sent pieces of him to fifty villages with the message you eat each other we eat white chop that was ten miles from our model barracks for some moments the muckraker considered the statement thoughtfully you mean he inquired that the atrocities are not all on the side of the white men atrocities exclaimed the trader i wasnt talking of atrocities are you looking for them im not running away from them laughed everett lowells weekly is sending me to the congo to find out the truth and to try to help put an end to them in his turn the trader considered the statement carefully among the natives he explained painstakingly picking each word what you call atrocities are customs of warfare forms of punishment when they go to war they expect to be tortured they know if theyre killed theyll be eaten the white man comes here and finds these customs have existed for centuries he adopts them because one moment interrupted everett warmly that does not excuse him the point is that with him they have not existed to him they should be against his conscience indecent horrible he has a greater knowledge a much higher intelligence he should lift the native not sink to him the coaster took his pipe from his mouth and twice opened his lips to speak finally he blew the smoke into the air and shook his head whats the use he exclaimed try laughed everett maybe im not as unintelligent as i talk you must get this right protested the coaster it doesnt matter a damn what a man brings here what his training was what he is the thing is too strong for him what thing that said the coaster he threw out his arm at the brooding mountains the dark lagoons the glaring coastline against which the waves shot into the air with the shock and roar of twelveinch guns the first white man came to sierra leone five hundred years before christ said the coaster and in twentytwo hundred years hes got just twenty miles inland the native didnt need forts or a navy to stop him he had three allies those waves the fever and the sun especially the sun the black man goes bareheaded and the sun lets him pass the white man covers his head with an inch of cork and the sun strikes through it and kills him when jameson came down the river from yambuya the natives fired on his boat he waved his helmet at them for three minutes to show them there was a white man in the canoe three minutes was all the sun wanted jameson died in two days where you are going the sun does worse things to a man than kill him it drives him mad it keeps the fear of death in his heart and that takes away his nerve and his sense of proportion he flies into murderous fits over silly imaginary slights he grows morbid suspicious he becomes a coward and because he is a coward with authority he becomes a bully he is alone we will suppose at a station three hundred miles from any other white man one morning his houseboy spills a cup of coffee on him and in a rage he half kills the boy he broods over that until he discovers or his crazy mind makes him think he has discovered that in revenge the boy is plotting to poison him so he punishes him again only this time he punishes him as the black man has taught him to punish in the only way the black man seems to understand that is he tortures him from that moment the fall of that man is rapid the heat the loneliness the fever the fear of the black faces keep him on edge rob him of sleep rob him of his physical strength of his moral strength he loses shame loses reason becomes cruel weak degenerate he invents new bestial tortures commits new unspeakable atrocities until one day the natives turn and kill him or he sticks his gun in his mouth and blows the top of his head off the coaster smiled tolerantly at the wideeyed eager young man at his side and you he mocked think you can reform that man and that hell above ground called the congo with an article in lowells weekly undismayed everett grinned cheerfully thats what im here for he said by the time everett reached the mouth of the congo he had learned that in everything he must depend upon himself that he would be accepted only as the kind of man that at the moment he showed himself to be this attitude of independence was not chosen but forced on him by the men with whom he came in contact associations and traditions that in every part of the united states had served as letters of introduction and enabled strangers to identify and label him were to the white men on the steamer and at the ports of call without meaning or value that he was an everett of boston conveyed little to those who had not heard even of boston that he was the correspondent of lowells weekly meant less to those who did not know that lowells weekly existed and when in confusion he proffered his letter of credit the very fact that it called for a thousand pounds was in the eyes of a palm oil ruffian sufficient evidence that it had been forged or stolen he soon saw that solely as a white man was he accepted and made welcome that he was respectable few believed and no one cared to be taken at his face value to be refused at the start the benefit of the doubt was a novel sensation and yet not unpleasant it was a relief not to be accepted only as everett the muckraker as a professional reformer as one holier than others it afforded his soul the same relaxation that his body received when in his shirtsleeves in the sweltering smokingroom he drank beer with a chef de poste who had been thrice tried for murder not only to every one was he a stranger but to him everything was strange so strange as to appear unreal this did not prevent him from at once recognizing those things that were not strange such as corrupt officials incompetence mismanagement he did not need the missionaries to point out to him that the independent state of the congo was not a colony administered for the benefit of many but a vast rubber plantation worked by slaves to fill the pockets of one man it was not in his work that everett found himself confused it was in his attitude of mind toward almost every other question at first when he could not make everything fit his rule of thumb he excused the country tolerantly as a topsyturvy land he wished to move and act quickly to make others move quickly he did not understand that men who had sentenced themselves to exile for the official term of three years or for life measured time only by the date of their release when he learned that even a cablegram could not reach his home in less than eighteen days that the missionaries to whom he brought letters were a three months journey from the coast and from each other his impatience was chastened to wonder and later to awe his education began at matadi where he waited until the river steamer was ready to start for leopoldville of the two places he was assured matadi was the better for the reason that if you still were in favor with the steward of the ship that brought you south he might sell you a piece of ice matadi was a great rock blazing with heat its narrow perpendicular paths seemed to run with burning lava its top the main square of the settlement was of baked clay beaten hard by thousands of naked feet crossing it by day was an adventure the air that swept it was the breath of a blastfurnace everett found a room over the shop of a portuguese trader it was caked with dirt and smelled of unnamed diseases and chloride of lime in it was a canvas cot a roll of evillooking bedding a washbasin filled with the stumps of cigarettes in a corner was a tin chopbox which everett asked to have removed it belonged the landlord told him to the man who two nights before had occupied the cot and who had died in it everett was anxious to learn of what he had died apparently surprised at the question the portuguese shrugged his shoulders who knows he exclaimed the next morning the english trader across the street assured everett there was no occasion for alarm he didnt die of any disease he explained somebody got at him from the balcony while he was in his cot and knifed him the english trader was a young man a cockney named upsher at home he had been a steward on the channel steamers everett made him his most intimate friend he had a black wife who spent most of her day in a fourpost bed hung with lace curtains and blue ribbon in which she resembled a baby hippopotamus wallowing in a bank of white sand at first the black woman was a shock to everett but after upsher dismissed her indifferently as a good old sort and spent one evening blubbering over a photograph of his wife and kiddie at home everett accepted her his excuse for this was that men who knew they might die on the morrow must not be judged by what they do today the excuse did not ring sound but he dismissed the doubt by deciding that in such heat it was not possible to take serious questions seriously in the fact that to those about him the thought of death was ever present he found further excuse for much else that puzzled and shocked him at home death had been a contingency so remote that he had put it aside as something he need not consider until he was a grandfather at matadi at every moment of the day in each trifling act he found death must be faced conciliated conquered at home he might ask himself if i eat this will it give me indigestion at matadi he asked if i drink this will i die upsher told him of a feud then existing between the chief of police and an italian doctor in the state service interested in the outcome only as a sporting proposition upsher declared the odds were unfair because the belgian was using his black police to act as his bodyguard while for protection the italian could depend only upon his swordcane each night with the other white exiles of matadi the two adversaries met in the cafй francobelge there with puzzled interest everett watched them sitting at separate tables surrounded by mutual friends excitedly playing dominoes outside the cafй matadi lay smothered and sweltering in a black living darkness and save for the rush of the river in a silence that continued unbroken across a jungle as wide as europe inside the dominoes clicked the glasses rang on the iron tables the oil lamps glared upon the pallid sweating faces of clerks upon the tanned sweating skins of officers and the italian doctor and the belgian lieutenant each with murder in his heart laughed shrugged gesticulated waiting for the moment to strike but why doesnt some one do something demanded everett arrest them or reason with them everybody knows about it it seems a pity not to do something upsher nodded his head dimly he recognized a language with which he once had been familiar i know what you mean he agreed bind em over to keep the peace and a good job too but who he demanded vaguely thats what i say who from the confusion into which everetts appeal to forgotten memories had thrown it his mind suddenly emerged but whats the use he demanded dont you see he explained triumphantly if those two crazy men were fit to listen to sense theyd have sense enough not to kill each other each succeeding evening everett watched the two potential murderers with lessening interest he even made a bet with upsher of a bottle of fruit salt that the chief of police would be the one to die a few nights later a man groaning beneath his balcony disturbed his slumbers he cursed the man and turned his pillow to find the cooler side but all through the night the groans though fainter broke into his dreams at intervals some traditions of past conduct tugged at everetts sleeve and bade him rise and play the good samaritan but indignantly he repulsed them were there not many others within hearing were there not the police was it his place to bind the wounds of drunken stokers the groans were probably a trick to entice him unarmed into the night and so just before the dawn when the mists rose and the groans ceased everett still arguing sank with a contented sigh into forgetfulness when he woke there was beneath his window much monkeylike chattering and he looked down into the white face and glazed eyes of the italian doctor lying in the gutter and staring up at him below his shoulderblades a pool of blood shone evilly in the blatant sunlight across the street on his balcony upsher in pajamas and mosquito boots was shivering with fever and stifling a yawn you lose he called later in the day everett analyzed his conduct of the night previous at home he told upsher i would have been telephoning for an ambulance or been out in the street giving the man the firstaid drill but living as we do here so close to death we see things more clearly death loses its importance its a bromide he added but travel certainly broadens one every day i have been in the congo i have been assimilating new ideas upsher nodded vigorously in assent an older man could have told everett that he was assimilating just as much of the congo as the rabbit assimilates of the boaconstrictor that first smothers it with saliva and then swallows it everett started up the congo in a small steamer open on all sides to the sun and rain and with a paddlewheel astern that kicked her forward at the rate of four miles an hour once every day the boat tied up to a tree and took on wood to feed her furnace and everett talked to the white man in charge of the wood post or if as it generally happened the white man was on his back with fever dosed him with quinine on board except for her captain and a finn who acted as engineer everett was the only other white man the black crew and woodboys he soon disliked intensely at first when nansen the danish captain and the finn struck them because they were in the way or because they were not everett winced and made a note of it but later he decided the blacks were insolent sullen ungrateful that a blow did them no harm according to the unprejudiced testimony of those who before the war in his own country had owned slaves those of the southland were always content always happy when not singing close harmony in the cottonfields they danced upon the levee they twanged the old banjo but these slaves of the upper congo were not happy they did not dance they did not sing at times their eyes dull gloomy despairing lighted with a sudden sombre fire and searched the eyes of the white man they seemed to beg of him the answer to a terrible question it was always the same question it had been asked of pharaoh they asked it of leopold for hours squatting on the iron deckplates humped on their naked haunches crowding close together they muttered apparently interminable criticisms of everett their eyes never left him he resented this unceasing scrutiny it got upon his nerves he was sure they were evolving some scheme to rob him of his tinned sausages or possibly to kill him it was then he began to dislike them in reality they were discussing the watch strapped to his wrist they believed it was a powerful juju to ward off evil spirits they were afraid of it one day to pay the chief woodboy for a carved paddle everett was measuring a bras of cloth as he had been taught he held the cloth in his teeth and stretched it to the ends of his fingertips the woodboy thought the white man was giving him short measure white men always had given him short measure and at a glance he could not recognize that this one was an everett of boston so he opened everetts fingers all the blood in everetts body leaped to his head that he a white man an everett who had come so far to set these people free should be accused by one of them of petty theft he caught up a log of fire wood and laid open the scalp of the black boy from the eye to the crown of his head the boy dropped and everett seeing the blood creeping through his kinky wool turned ill with nausea drunkenly through a red cloud of mist he heard himself shouting the black nigger the black nigger he touched me i tell you he touched me captain nansen led everett to his cot and gave him fizzy salts but it was not until sundown that the trembling and nausea ceased then partly in shame partly as a bribe he sought out the injured boy and gave him the entire roll of cloth it had cost everett ten francs to the woodboy it meant a years wages the boy hugged it in his arms as he might a baby and crooned over it from under the bloodstained bandage humbly without resentment he lifted his tired eyes to those of the white man still dumbly they begged the answer to the same question during the five months everett spent up the river he stopped at many missions stations oneman wood posts he talked to jesuit fathers to inspecteurs to collectors for the state of rubber taxes elephant tusks in time even in bangalese to chiefs of the native villages according to the point of view he was told tales of oppression of avarice of hideous crimes of cruelties committed in the name of trade that were abnormal unthinkable the note never was of hope never of cheer never inspiring there was always the grievance the spirit of unrest of rebellion that ranged from dislike to a primitive hot hate of his own land and life he heard nothing not even when his face was again turned toward the east nor did he think of it as now he saw them the rules and principles and standards of his former existence were petty and credulous but he assured himself he had not abandoned those standards he had only temporarily laid them aside as he had left behind him in london his frockcoat and silk hat not because he would not use them again but because in the congo they were ridiculous for weeks with a missionary as a guide he walked through forests into which the sun never penetrated or on the river moved between banks where no white man had placed his foot where at night the elephants came trooping to the water and seeing the lights of the boat fled crashing through the jungle where the great hippos puffing and blowing rose so close to his elbow that he could have tossed his cigarette and hit them the vastness of the congo toward which he had so jauntily set forth now weighed upon his soul the immeasurable distances the slumbering disregard of time the brooding interminable silences the efforts to conquer the land that were so futile so puny and so cruel at first appalled and later left him unnerved rebellious childishly defiant what health was there he demanded hotly in holding in a dripping jungle to morals to etiquette to fashions of conduct was he the white man intelligent trained disciplined in mind and body to be judged by naked cannibals by chattering monkeys by mammoth primeval beasts his code of conduct was his own he was a law unto himself he came down the river on one of the larger steamers of the state and on this voyage with many fellowpassengers he was now on his way home but in the fact he felt no elation each day the fever ran tingling through his veins and left him listless frightened or choleric one night at dinner in one of these moods of irritation he took offence at the act of a lieutenant who in lack of vegetables drank from the vinegar bottle everett protested that such table manners were unbecoming an officer even an officer of the congo and on the lieutenant resenting his criticism everett drew his revolver the others at the table took it from him and locked him in his cabin in the morning when he tried to recall what had occurred he could remember only that for some excellent reason he had hated some one with a hatred that could be served only with death he knew it could not have been drink as each day the state allowed him but one halfbottle of claret that but for the interference of strangers he might have shot a man did not interest him in the outcome of what he regarded merely as an incident he saw cause neither for congratulation or selfreproach for his conduct he laid the blame upon the sun and doubled his dose of fruit salts everett was again at matadi waiting for the nigeria to take on cargo before returning to liverpool during the few days that must intervene before she sailed he lived on board although now actually bound north the thought afforded him no satisfaction his spirits were depressed his mind gloomy a feeling of rebellion of outlawry filled him with unrest while the ship lay at the wharf hardy her english captain cuthbert the purser and everett ate on deck under the awning assailed by electric fans each was clad in nothing more intricate than pajamas tonight announced hardy with a sigh we got to dress ship mr ducret and his wife are coming on board we carry his trade goods and i got to stand him a dinner and champagne you boys he commanded must wear whites and talk french ill dine on shore growled everett better meet them advised cuthbert the purser was a pinkcheeked cleareyed young man who spoke the many languages of the coast glibly and his own in the soft detached voice of a wellbred englishman he was in training to enter the consular service something in his poise in the assured manner in which he handled his white stewards and the black kroo boys seemed to everett a constant reproach and he resented him theyre a picturesque couple explained cuthbert ducret was originally a wrestler used to challenge all comers from the front of a booth he served his time in the army in senegal and when he was mustered out moved to the french congo and began to trade in a small way in ivory now hes the biggest merchant physically and every other way from stanley pool to lake chad he has a house at brazzaville built of mahogany and a grand piano and his own iceplant his wife was a suppergirl at maxims he brought her down here and married her every rainy season they go back to paris and run racehorses and they say the best table in every allnight restaurant is reserved for him in paris they call her the ivory queen shes killed seventeen elephants with her own rifle in the upper congo everett had seen four white women they were pallid washedout bloodless even the youngest looked past middleage for him women of any other type had ceased to exist he had come to think of every white woman as past middleage with a face wrinkled by the sun with hair bleached white by the sun with eyes from which through gazing at the sun all light and lustre had departed he thought of them as always wearing boots to protect their ankles from mosquitoes and army helmets when he came on deck for dinner he saw a woman who looked as though she was posing for a photograph by reutlinger she appeared to have stepped to the deck directly from her electric victoria and the rue de la paix she was tall lithe gracefully erect with eyes of great loveliness and her hair brilliantly black drawn а la merode across a broad fair forehead she wore a gown and long coat of white lace as delicate as a bridal veil and a hat with a flapping brim from which in a curtain hung more lace when she was pleased she lifted her head and the curtain rose unmasking her lovely eyes around the white bare throat was a string of pearls they had cost the lives of many elephants cuthbert only a month from home saw madame ducret just as she was a parisienne elegant smart soignй he knew that on any night at madrid or darmenonville he might look upon twenty women of the same charming type they might lack that something this girl from maxims possessed the spirit that had caused her to follow her husband into the depths of darkness but outwardly for show purposes they were even as she but to everett she was no messenger from another world she was unique to his famished eyes starved senses and feverdriven brain she was her entire sex personified she was the one woman for whom he had always sought alluring soothing maddening if need be to be fought for the one thing to be desired opposite across the table her husband the exwrestler chasseur dafrique elephant poacher bulked large as an ox men felt as well as saw his bigness captain hardy deferred to him on matters of trade the purser deferred to him on questions of administration he answered them in his big way with big thoughts in big figures he was fifty years ahead of his time he beheld the congo open to the world in the forests where he had hunted elephants he foresaw great factories mining camps railroads feeding gold and copper ore to the trunk line from the cape to cairo his ideas were the ideas of an empirebuilder but while the others listened fascinated hypnotized everett saw only the woman her eyes fixed on her husband her fingers turning and twisting her diamond rings every now and again she raised her eyes to everett almost reproachfully as though to say why do you not listen to him it is much better for you than to look at me when they had gone all through the sultry night until the sun drove him to his cabin like a caged animal everett paced and repaced the deck the woman possessed his mind and he could not drive her out he did not wish to drive her out what the consequences might be he did not care so long as he might see her again he jeered at the consequences of one thing he was positive he could not now leave the congo he would follow her to brazzaville if he were discreet ducret might invite him to make himself their guest once established in her home she must listen to him no man ever before had felt for any woman the need he felt for her it was too big for him to conquer it would be too big for her to resist in the morning a note from ducret invited everett and cuthbert to join him in an allday excursion to the waterfall beyond matadi everett answered the note in person the thought of seeing the woman calmed and steadied him like a dose of morphine so much more violent than the fever in his veins was the fever in his brain that when again he was with her he laughed happily and was grandly at peace so different was he from the man they had met the night before that the frenchman and his wife glanced at each other in surprise and approval they found him witty eager a most charming companion and when he announced his intention of visiting brazzaville they insisted he should make their home his own his admiration as outwardly it appeared to be for madame ducret was evident to the others but her husband accepted it it was her due and on the congo to grudge to another man the sight of a pretty woman was as cruel as to withhold the few grains of quinine that might save his reason but before the day passed madame ducret was aware that the american could not be lightly dismissed as an admirer the fact neither flattered nor offended for her it was no novel or disturbing experience other men whipped on by loneliness by fever by primitive savage instincts had told her what she meant to them she did not hold them responsible some worth curing she had nursed through the illness others who refused to be cured she had turned over with a shrug to her husband this one was more difficult of men of everetts traditions and education she had known but few but she recognized the type this young man was no failure in life no derelict no outcast flying the law or a scandal to hide in the jungle he was what in her maxim days she had laughed at as an aristocrat he knew her paris as she did not know it its history its art even her language he spoke more correctly than her husband or herself she knew that at his home there must be many women infinitely more attractive more suited to him than herself women of birth of position young girls and great ladies of the other world and she knew also that in his present state at a nod from her he would cast these behind him and carry her into the wilderness more quickly than she anticipated everett proved she did not overrate the forces that compelled him the excursion to the rapids was followed by a second dinner on board the nigeria but now as on the previous night everett fell into sullen silence he ate nothing drank continually and with his eyes devoured the woman when coffee had been served he left the others at table and with madame ducret slowly paced the deck as they passed out of the reach of the lights he drew her to the rail and stood in front of her i am not quite mad he said but you have got to come with me to everett all he added to this sounded sane and final he told her that this was one of those miracles when the one woman and the one man who were predestined to meet had met he told her he had wished to marry a girl at home but that he now saw that the desire was the fancy of a schoolboy he told her he was rich and offered her the choice of returning to the paris she loved or of going deeper into the jungle there he would set up for her a principality a state within the state he would defend her against all comers he would make her the queen of the congo i have waited for you thousands of years he told her his voice was hoarse shaken and thick i love you as men loved women in the stone age fiercely entirely i will not be denied down here we are cave people if you fight me i will club you and drag you to my cave if others fight for you i will kill them i love you he panted with all my soul my mind my body i love you i will not let you go madame ducret did not say she was insulted because she did not feel insulted she did not call to her husband for help because she did not need his help and because she knew that the exwrestler could break everett across his knee she did not even withdraw her hands although everett drove the diamonds deep into her fingers you frighten me she pleaded she was not in the least frightened she only was sorry that this one must be discarded among the incurables in apparent agitation she whispered tomorrow tomorrow i will give you your answer everett did not trust her did not release her he regarded her jealously with quick suspicion to warn her that he knew she could not escape from matadi or from him he said the train to leopoldville does not leave for two days i know whispered madame ducret soothingly i will give you your answer tomorrow at ten she emphasized the hour because she knew at sunrise a special train would carry her husband and herself to leopoldville and that there one of her husbands steamers would bear them across the pool to french congo tomorrow then whispered everett grudgingly but i must kiss you now only an instant did madame ducret hesitate then she turned her cheek yes she assented you must kiss me now everett did not rejoin the others he led her back into the circle of light and locked himself in his cabin at ten the next morning when ducret and his wife were well advanced toward stanley pool cuthbert handed everett a note having been told what it contained he did not move away but with his back turned leaned upon the rail everett his eyes on fire with triumph his fingers trembling tore open the envelope madame ducret wrote that her husband and herself felt that mr everett was suffering more severely from the climate than he knew with regret they cancelled their invitation to visit them and urged him for his healths sake to continue as he had planned to northern latitudes they hoped to meet in paris they extended assurances of their distinguished consideration slowly savagely as though wreaking his suffering on some human thing everett tore the note into minute fragments moving unsteadily to the ships side he flung them into the river and then hung limply upon the rail above him from a sky of brass the sun stabbed at his eyeballs below him the rush of the congo churning in muddy whirlpools echoed against the hills of naked rock that met the naked sky to everett the roar of the great river and the echoes from the land he had set out to reform carried the sound of gigantic hideous laughter the spy my going to valencia was entirely an accident but the more often i stated that fact the more satisfied was everyone at the capital that i had come on some secret mission even the venerable politician who acted as our minister the night of my arrival after dinner said confidentially now mr crosby between ourselves whats the game whats what game i asked you know what i mean he returned what are you here for but when for the tenth time i repeated how i came to be marooned in valencia he showed that his feelings were hurt and said stiffly as you please suppose we join the ladies and the next day his wife reproached me with i should think you could trust your own minister my husband never talks not even to me so i see i said and then her feelings were hurt also and she went about telling people i was an agent of the walkerkeefe crowd my only reason for repeating here that my going to valencia was an accident is that it was because schnitzel disbelieved that fact and to drag the hideous facts from me followed me back to new york through that circumstance i came to know him and am able to tell his story the simple truth was that i had been sent by the state department to panama to go look see and straighten out a certain conflict of authority among the officials of the canal zone while i was there the yellowfever broke out and every selfrespecting power clapped a quarantine on the isthmus with the result that when i tried to return to new york no steamer would take me to any place to which any white man would care to go but i knew that at valencia there was a direct line to new york so i took a tramp steamer down the coast to valencia i went to valencia only because to me every other port in the world was closed my position was that of the man who explained to his wife that he came home because the other places were shut but because formerly in valencia i had held a minor post in our legation and because the state department so constantly consults our firm on questions of international law it was believed i revisited valencia on some mysterious and secret mission as a matter of fact had i gone there to sell phonographs or to start a steam laundry i should have been as greatly suspected for in valencia even every commercial salesman from the moment he gives up his passport on the steamer until the police permit him to depart is suspected shadowed and begirt with spies i believe that during my brief visit i enjoyed the distinction of occupying the undivided attention of three a common or garden government spy from whom no guilty man escapes a walkerkeefe spy and the spy of the nitrate company the spy of the nitrate company is generally a man you meet at the legations and clubs he plays bridge and is dignified with the title of agent the walkerkeefe spy is ostensibly a travelling salesman or hotel runner the government spy is just a spy a scowling important little beast in a white duck suit and a diamond ring the limit of his intelligence is to follow you into a cigar store and note what cigar you buy and in what kind of money you pay for it the reason for it all was the threecornered fight which then was being waged by the government the nitrate trust and the walkerkeefe crowd for the possession of the nitrate beds valencia is so near to the equator and so far from new york that there are few who studied the intricate story of that disgraceful struggle which i hasten to add with the fear of libel before my eyes i do not intend to tell now briefly it was a triangular fight between opponents each of whom was in the wrong and each of whom to gain his end bribed blackmailed and robbed not only his adversaries but those of his own side the end in view being the possession of those great deposits that lie in the rocks of valencia baked from above by the tropic sun and from below by volcanic fires as one of their engineers one night in the plaza said to me those mines were conceived in hell and stink to heaven and the reputation of every man of us that has touched them smells like the mines at the time i was there the situation was acute in valencia the situation always is acute but this time it looked as though something might happen on the day before i departed the nitrate trust had cabled vehemently for warships the minister of foreign affairs had refused to receive our minister and at porto banos a mob had made the tin sign of the united states consulate look like a sieve our minister urged me to remain to be bombarded by ones own warships he assured me would be a thrilling experience but i repeated that my business was with panama not valencia and that if in this matter of his row i had any weight at washington as between preserving the nitrate beds for the trust and preserving for his country and various sweethearts one brownthroated cleanlimbed bluejacket i was for the bluejacket accordingly when i sailed from valencia the aged diplomat would have described our relations as strained our ship was a slow ship listed to touch at many ports and as early as noon on the following day we stopped for cargo at trujillo it was there i met schnitzel in panama i had bought a macaw for a little niece of mine and while we were taking on cargo i went ashore to get a tin cage in which to put it and for direction called upon our consul from an inner room he entered excitedly smiling at my card and asked how he might serve me i told him i had a parrot below decks and wanted to buy a tin cage exactly you want a tin cage the consul repeated soothingly the state department doesnt keep me awake nights cabling me what its going to do he said but at least i know it doesnt send a thousanddollaraminute fourcylinder lawyer all the way to this fever swamp to buy a tin cage now honest how can i serve you i saw it was hopeless no one would believe the truth to offer it to this friendly soul would merely offend his feelings and his intelligence so with much mystery i asked him to describe the situation and he did so with the exactness of one who believes that within an hour every word he speaks will be cabled to the white house when i was leaving he said oh theres a newspaper correspondent after you he wants an interview i guess he followed you last night from the capital by train you want to watch out he dont catch you his name is jones i promised to be on my guard against a man named jones and the consul escorted me to the ship as he went down the accommodation ladder i called over the rail in case they should declare war cable to curaзoa and ill come back and dont cable anything indefinite like situation critical or war imminent understand cable me come back or go ahead but whatever you cable make it clear he shook his head violently and with his greenlined umbrella pointed at my elbow i turned and found a young man hungrily listening to my words he was leaning on the rail with his chin on his arms and the brim of his panama hat drawn down to conceal his eyes on the pierhead from which we now were drawing rapidly away the consul made a megaphone of his hands thats him he called thats jones jones raised his head and i saw that the tropical heat had made jones thirsty or that with friends he had been celebrating his departure he winked at me and apparently with pleasure at his own discernment and with pity for me smiled oh of course he murmured his tone was one of heavy irony make it clear make it clear to the whole wharf shout it out sos everybody can hear you youre clear enough his disgust was too deep for ordinary words my uncle he exclaimed by this i gathered that he was expressing his contempt i beg your pardon i said we had the deck to ourselves its emptiness suddenly reminded me that we had the ship also to ourselves i remembered the purser had told me that except for those who travelled overnight from port to port i was his only passenger with dismay i pictured myself for ten days adrift on the high seas alone with jones with a dramatic gesture as one would say i am here he pushed back his panama hat with an unsteady finger he pointed as it was drawn dripping across the deck at the stern hawser you see that rope he demanded soon as that rope hit the water i knocked off work slong as you was in valencia me on the job now you cant go back i cant go back why further dissimlation who am i his condition seemed to preclude the possibility of his knowing who he was so i told him he sneered as i have seen men sneer only in melodrama oh of course he muttered oh of course he lurched toward me indignantly you know perfecly well jones is not my name you know perfecly well who i am my dear sir i said i dont know anything about you except that you are a damned nuisance he swayed from me pained and surprised apparently he was upon an outbreak of tears proud he murmured and haughty proud and haughty to the last i never have understood why an intoxicated man feels the climax of insult is to hurl at you your name perhaps because he knows it is the one charge you cannot deny but invariably before you escape as though assured the words will cover your retreat with shame he throws at you your full title jones did this slowly and mercilessly he repeated mr george morgan crosby of harvard he added proud and haughty to the last he then embraced a passing steward and demanded to be informed why the ship rolled he never knew a ship to roll as our ship rolled perfecly satisfactry ocean but ship rolling like a stonebreaker take me some place in the ship where this ship dont roll the steward led him away when he had dropped the local pilot the captain beckoned me to the bridge i saw you talking to mr schnitzel he said hes a little under the weather he has too light a head for liquors i agreed that he had a light head and said i understood his name was jones thats what i wanted to tell you said the captain his name is schnitzel he used to work for the nitrate trust in new york then he came down here as an agent hes a good boy not to tell things to understand sometimes i carry him under one name and the next voyage under another the purser and he fix it up between em it pleases him and it dont hurt anybody else so long as i tell them about it i dont know who hes working for now he went on but i know hes not with the nitrate company any more he sold them out how could he i asked hes only a boy he had a berth as typewriter to senator burnsides president of the nitrate trust sort of confidential stenographer said the captain whenever the senator dictated an important letter they say schnitzel used to make a carbon copy and when he had enough of them he sold them to the walkerkeefe crowd then when walkerkeefe lost their suit in the valencia supreme court i guess schnitzel went over to president alvarez and again some folks say hes back with the nitrate company after he sold them out yes but you see hes worth more to them now he knows all the walkerkeefe secrets and alvarezs secrets too i expressed my opinion of every one concerned it shouldnt surprise you complained the captain you know the country every man in it is out for something that isnt his the pilot wants his bit the health doctor must get his the customs take all your cigars and if you dont put up gold for the captain of the port and the alcalde and the commandant and the harbor police and the foreman of the cargadores they wont move a lighter and theyll hold up the ships papers well an american comes down here honest and straight and willing to work for his wages but pretty quick he finds every one is getting his squeeze but him so he tries to get some of it back by robbing the natives that robbed him then he robs the other foreigners and it aint long before hes cheating the people at home who sent him here there isnt a man in this nitrate row that isnt robbing the crowd hes with and that wouldnt change sides for money schnitzels no worse than the president nor the canteen contractor he waved his hand at the glaring coastline at the steaming swamps and the hot naked mountains its the country that does it he said its in the air you can smell it as soon as you drop anchor like you smell the slaughterhouse at puntaarenas how do you manage to keep honest i asked smiling i dont take any chances exclaimed the captain seriously when im in their damned port i dont go ashore i did not again see schnitzel until with haggard eyes and suspiciously wet hair he joined the captain doctor purser and myself at breakfast in the phrases of the tenderloin he told us cheerfully that he had been grandly intoxicated and to recover drank mixtures of raw egg vinegar and red pepper the sight of which took away every appetite save his own when to this he had added a bottle of beer he declared himself a new man the new man followed me to the deck and with the truculent bearing of one who expects to be repelled he asked if the day before he had not made a fool of himself i suggested he had been somewhat confidential at once he recovered his pose and patronized me dont you believe it he said thats all part of my game confidence for confidence is the way i work it thats how i learn things i tell a man something on the inside and he says heres a nice young fellow nothing standoffish about him and he tells me something he shouldnt like as not what i told him wasnt true see i assured him he interested me greatly you find then in your line of business i asked that apparent frankness is advisable as a rule i explained secrecy is what a a person in your line a to save his feelings i hesitated at the word a spy he said his face beamed with fatuous complacency but if i had not known you were a spy i asked would not that have been better for you in dealing with a party like you mr crosby schnitzel began sententiously i use a different method youre on a secret mission yourself and you get your information about the nitrate row one way and i get it another i deal with you just like we were drummers in the same line of goods we are rivals in business but outside of business hours perfect gentlemen in the face of the disbelief that had met my denials of any secret mission i felt to have schnitzel also disbelieve me would be too great a humiliation so i remained silent you make your report to the state department he explained and i make mine to my people who they are doesnt matter youd like to know and i dont want to hurt your feelings but thats my secret my only feelings were a desire to kick schnitzel heavily but for schnitzel to suspect that was impossible rather he pictured me as shaken by his disclosures as he hung over the rail the glare of the sun on the tumbling water lit up his foolish mongrel features exposed their cunning their utter lack of any character and showed behind the shifty eyes the vacant halfcrooked mind schnitzel was smiling to himself with a smile of complete selfsatisfaction in the light of his later conduct i grew to understand that smile he had anticipated a rebuff and he had been received as he read it with consideration the irony of my politeness he had entirely missed instead he read in what i said the admiration of the amateur for the professional he saw what he believed to be a high agent of the government treating him as a worthy antagonist in no other way can i explain his later heaping upon me his confidences it was the vanity of a child trying to show off in ten days in the limited area of a twothousandton steamer one could not help but learn something of the history of so communicative a fellowpassenger as schnitzel his parents were german and still lived in germany but he himself had been brought up on the east side an uncle who kept a delicatessen shop in avenue a had sent him to the public schools and then to a business college where he had developed remarkable expertness as a stenographer he referred to his skill in this difficult exercise with pitying contempt nevertheless from a room noisy with typewriters this skill had lifted him into the private office of the president of the nitrate trust there as schnitzel expressed it i saw mine and i took it to trace back the criminal instinct that led schnitzel to steal and sell the private letters of his employer was not difficult in all of his few early years i found it lying latent of every story he told of himself and he talked only of himself there was not one that was not to his discredit he himself never saw this nor that all he told me showed he was without the moral sense and with an instinctive enjoyment of what was deceitful mean and underhand that as i read it was his character illustration schnitzel was smiling to himself in appearance he was smoothshaven with long locks that hung behind wide protruding ears he had the unhealthy skin of bad blood and his eyes as though the daylight hurt them constantly opened and shut he was like hundreds of young men that you see loitering on upper broadway and making predatory raids along the rialto had you passed him in that neighborhood you would have set him down as a wiretapper a racing tout a wouldbe actor as i worked it out schnitzel was a spy because it gave him an importance he had not been able to obtain by any other effort as a child and as a clerk it was easy to see that among his associates schnitzel must always have been the butt until suddenly by one dirty action he had placed himself outside their class as he expressed it whenever i walk through the office now where all the stenographers sit you ought to see those slobs look after me when they go to the presidents door they got to knock like i used to but now when the old man sees me coming to make my report after one of these trips he calls out come right in mr schnitzel and like as not i go in with my hat on and offer him a cigar an they see me do it too to me that speech seemed to give schnitzels view of the values of his life his vanity demanded he be pointed at if even with contempt but the contempt never reached him he only knew that at last people took note of him they no longer laughed at him they were afraid of him in his heart he believed that they regarded him as one who walked in the dark places of world politics who possessed an evil knowledge of great men as evil as himself as one who by blackmail held public ministers at his mercy this view of himself was the one that he tried to give me i probably was the first decent man who ever had treated him civilly and to impress me with his knowledge he spread that knowledge before me it was sale shocking degrading at first i took comfort in the thought that schnitzel was a liar later i began to wonder if all of it were a lie and finally in a way i could not doubt it was proved to me that the worst he charged was true the night i first began to believe him was the night we touched at cristobal the last port in valencia in the most lighthearted manner he had been accusing all concerned in the nitrate fight with every crime known in wall street and in the dark reaches of the congo river but i know him mr schnitzel i said sternly he is incapable of it i went to college with him i dont care whether hes a rahrah boy or not said schnitzel i know thats what he did when he was up the orinoco after orchids and if the tribe had ever caught him theyd have crucified him and i know this too he made forty thousand dollars out of the nitrate company on a tenthousanddollar job and i know it because he beefed to me about it himself because it wasnt big enough we were passing the limestone island at the entrance to the harbor where in the prison fortress with its muzzleloading guns pointing drunkenly at the sky are buried the political prisoners of valencia now there said schnitzel pointing that shows you what the nitrate trust can do judge rojas is in there he gave the first decision in favor of the walkerkeefe people and for making that decision william t scott the nitrate manager made alvarez put rojas in there hes seventy years old and hes been there five years the cell they keep him in is below the sealevel and the saltwater leaks through the wall ive seen it thats what william t scott did an up in new york people think billy scott is a fine man i seen him at the horse show sitting in a box bowing to everybody with his wife sitting beside him all hung out with pearls an that was only a month after id seen rojas in that sewer where scott put him schnitzel i laughed you certainly are a magnificent liar schnitzel showed no resentment go ashore and look for yourself he muttered dont believe me ask rojas ask the first man you meet he shivered and shrugged his shoulders i tell you the walls are damp like sweat the government had telegraphed the commandant to come on board and as he expressed it offer me the hospitality of the port which meant that i had to take him to the smokingroom and give him champagne what the government really wanted was to find out whether i was still on board and if it were finally rid of me i asked the official concerning judge rojas oh yes he said readily he is still incommunicado without believing it would lead to anything i suggested it was foolish of him to give offence to mr scott the commandant nodded vivaciously mr scott is very powerful man he assented we all very much love mr scott the president he love mr scott too but the judges were not sympathetic to mr scott so mr scott asked our president to give them a warning and seсor rojas he is the warning when will he get out i asked the commandant held up the glass in the sunlight from the open airport and gazed admiringly at the bubbles who can tell he said any day when mr scott wishes maybe never seсor rojas is an old man old and he has much rheumatics maybe he will never come out to see our beloved country any more as we left the harbor we passed so close that one could throw a stone against the wall of the fortress the sun was just sinking and the air became suddenly chilled around the little island of limestone the waves swept through the seaweed and black manigua up to the rusty bars of the cells i saw the barefooted soldiers smoking upon the sloping ramparts the common criminals in a long stumbling line bearing kegs of water three stormbeaten palms rising like gallows and the green and yellow flag of valencia crawling down the staff somewhere entombed in that blotched and mildewed masonry an old man of seventy years was shivering and hugging himself from the damp and cold a man who spoke five languages a just brave gentleman to me it was no new story i knew of the horrors of cristobal prison of political rivals chained to criminals loathsome with disease of men who had raised the flag of revolution driven to suicide but never had i supposed that my own people could reach from the city of new york and cast a fellowman into that cellar of fever and madness illustration schnitzel you certainly are a magnificent liar as i watched the yellow wall sink into the sea i became conscious that schnitzel was near me as before leaning on the rail with his chin sunk on his arms his face was turned toward the fortress and for the first time since i had known him it was set and serious and when a moment later he passed me without recognition i saw that his eyes were filled with fear when we touched at curaзoa i sent a cable to my sister announcing the date of my arrival and then continued on to the hotel venezuela almost immediately schnitzel joined me with easy carelessness he said i was in the cable office just now sending off a wire and that operator told me he cant make head or tail of the third word in your cable that is strange i commented because its a french word and he is french thats why i wrote it in french with the air of one who nails another in a falsehood schnitzel exclaimed then how did you suppose your sister was going to read it its a cipher thats what it is oh no youre not on a secret mission not at all it was most undignified of me but in five minutes i excused myself and sent to the state department the following words roses red violets blue send snow later at the state department the only person who did not eventually pardon my jest was the clerk who had sat up until three in the morning with my cable trying to fit it to any known code immediately after my return to the hotel venezuela schnitzel excused himself and half an hour later returned in triumph with the cable operator and ordered lunch for both they imbibed much sweet champagne when we again were safe at sea i said schnitzel how much did you pay that frenchman to let you read my second cable schnitzels reply was prompt and complacent one hundred dollars gold it was worth it do you want to know how i doped it out i even challenged him to do so roses red war declared violets blue outlook bad or blue send snow send squadron because the white squadron is white like snow see it was too easy schnitzel i cried you are wonderful schnitzel yawned in my face oh you dont have to hit the soles of my feet with a nightstick to keep me awake he said after i had been a week at sea i found that either i had to believe that in all things schnitzel was a liar or that the men of the nitrate trust were in all things evil i was convinced that instead of the people of valencia robbing them they were robbing both the people of valencia and the people of the united states to go to war on their account was to degrade our government i explained to schnitzel it was not becoming that the united states navy should be made the catspaw of a corrupt corporation i asked his permission to repeat to the authorities at washington certain of the statements he had made schnitzel was greatly pleased youre welcome to tell em anything ive said he assented and he added most of its true too i wrote down certain charges he had made and added what i had always known of the nitrate fight it was a terrible arraignment in the evening i read my notes to schnitzel who in a corner of the smokingroom sat frowning importantly checking off each statement and where i made an error of a date or a name severely correcting me several times i asked him are you sure this wont get you into trouble with your people you seem to accuse everybody on each side schnitzels eyes instantly closed with suspicion dont you worry about me and my people he returned sulkily thats my secret and you wont find it out neither i may be as crooked as the rest of them but im not giving away my employer i suppose i looked puzzled i mean not a second time he added hastily i know what youre thinking of and i got five thousand dollars for it but now i mean to stick by the men that pay my wages but youve told me enough about each of the three to put any one of them in jail of course i have cried schnitzel triumphantly if id let down on any one crowd youd know i was working for that crowd so ive touched em all up only what i told you about my crowd isnt true the report we finally drew up was so sensational that i was of a mind to throw it overboard it accused members of the cabinet of our senate diplomats business men of national interest judges of the valencia courts private secretaries clerks hired bullies and filibusters men the trust could not bribe it had blackmailed those it could not corrupt and they were pitifully few it crushed with some disgraceful charge looking over my notes i said you seem to have made every charge except murder howd i come to leave that out schnitzel answered flippantly what about coleman the foreman at bahia and that german contractor ebhardt and old smedburg they talked too much and they died of yellowfever maybe and maybe what happened to them was they ate knockout drops in their soup i disbelieved him but there came a sudden nasty doubt curtis who managed the companys plant at barcelona died of yellowfever i said and was buried the same day for some time schnitzel glowered uncertainly at the bulkhead did you know him he asked when i was in the legation i knew him well i said so did i said schnitzel he wasnt murdered he murdered himself he was wrong ten thousand dollars in his accounts he got worrying about it and we found him outside the clearing with a hole in his head he left a note saying he couldnt bear the disgrace as if the company would hold a little grafting against as good a man as curtis schnitzel coughed and pretended it was his cigarette you see you dont put in nothing against him he added savagely it was the first time i had seen schnitzel show emotion and i was moved to preach why dont you quit i said you had an a job as a stenographer why dont you go back to it maybe some day but its great being your own boss if i was a stenographer i wouldnt be helping you send in a report to the state department would i no this job is all right they send you after something big and you have the devil of a time getting it but when you get it you feel like you had picked a hundredtoone shot the talk or the drink had elated him his fishlike eyes bulged and shone he cast a quick look about him except for ourselves the smokingroom was empty from below came the steady throb of the engines and from outside the whisper of the waves and of the wind through the cordage a barefooted sailor pattered by to the bridge schnitzel bent toward me and with his hand pointed to his throat ive got papers on me thats worth a million to a certain party he whispered you understand my notes in cipher he scowled with intense mystery i keep em in an oiledsilk bag tied around my neck with a string and here he added hastily patting his hip as though to forestall any attack i might make upon his person i carry my automatic it shoots nine bullets in five seconds they got to be quick to catch me well if you have either of those things on you i said testily i dont want to know it how often have i told you not to talk and drink at the same time ah go on laughed schnitzel thats an old gag warning a fellow not to talk so as to make him talk i do that myself that schnitzel had important papers tied to his neck i no more believe than that he wore a shirt of chain armor but to please him i pretended to be greatly concerned now that were getting into new york i said you must be very careful a man who carries such important documents on his person might be murdered for them i think you ought to disguise yourself a picture of my bag being carried ashore by schnitzel in the uniform of a ships steward rather pleased me go on youre kidding said schnitzel he was drawn between believing i was deeply impressed and with fear that i was mocking him on the contrary i protested i dont feel quite safe myself seeing me with you they may think i have papers around my neck they wouldnt look at you schnitzel reassured me they know youre just an amateur but as you say with me its different i got to be careful now you mightnt believe it but i never go near my uncle nor none of my friends that live where i used to hang out if i did the other spies would get on my track i suppose he went on grandly i never go out in new york but that at least two spies are trailing me but i know how to throw them off i live way down town in a little hotel you never heard of you never catch me dining at sherrys nor the waldorf and you never met me out socially did you now i confessed i had not and then i always live under an assumed name like jones i suggested well sometimes jones he admitted to me i said jones lacks imagination its the sort of name you give when youre arrested for exceeding the speed limit why dont you call yourself machiavelli go on im no dago said schnitzel and dont you go off thinking jones is the only disguise i use but im not tellin what it is am i oh no schnitzel i asked have you ever been told that you would make a great detective cut it out said schnitzel youve been reading those fairy stories theres no fly cops nor pinks could do the work i do theyre pikers compared to me they chase pettylarceny cases and kick in doors i wouldnt stoop to what they do its being mixed up the way i am with the problems of two governments that catches me he added magnanimously you see something of that yourself we left the ship at brooklyn and with regret i prepared to bid schnitzel farewell seldom had i met a little beast so offensive but his vanity his lies his moral blindness made one pity him and in ten days in the smokingroom together we had had many friendly drinks and many friendly laughs he was going to a hotel on lower broadway and as my cab on my way uptown passed the door i offered him a lift he appeared to consider the advisability of this and then with much byplay of glancing over his shoulder dived into the front seat and drew down the blinds this hotel i am going to is an oldfashioned trap he explained but the clerk is wise to me understand and i dont have to sign the register as we drew nearer to the hotel he said its a pity we cant dine out somewheres and go to the theatre but you know with almost too much heartiness i hastily agreed it would be imprudent i understand perfectly i assented you are a marked man until you get those papers safe in the hands of your people you must be very cautious thats right he said then he smiled craftily i wonder if youre on yet to which my people are i assured him that i had no idea but that from the avidity with which he had abused them i guessed he was working for the walkerkeefe crowd he both smiled and scowled dont you wish you knew he said ive told you a lot of inside stories mr crosby but ill never tell on my pals again not me thats my secret at the door of the hotel he bade me a hasty goodbye and for a few minutes i believed that schnitzel had passed out of my life forever then in taking account of my belongings i missed my fieldglasses i remembered that in order to open a trunk for the customs inspectors i had handed them to schnitzel and that he had hung them over his shoulder in our haste at parting we both had forgotten them i was only a few blocks from the hotel and i told the man to return i inquired for mr schnitzel and the clerk who apparently knew him by that name said he was in his room number eightytwo but he has a caller with him now he added a gentleman was waiting for him ands just gone up i wrote on my card why i had called and soon after it had been born skyward the clerk said i guess hell be able to see you now thats the party that was calling on him there he nodded toward a man who crossed the rotunda quickly his face was twisted from us as though as he almost ran toward the street he were reading the advertisements on the wall he reached the door and was lost in the great tide of broadway i crossed to the elevator and as i stood waiting it descended with a crash and the boy who had taken my card flung himself shrieking into the rotunda that man stop him he cried the man in eightytwo hes murdered the clerk vaulted the desk and sprang into the street and i dragged the boy back to the wire rope and we shot to the third story the boy shrank back a chambermaid crouching against the wall her face colorless lowered one hand and pointed at an open door in there she whispered in a mean common room stretched where he had been struck back upon the bed i found the boy who had elected to meddle in the problems of two governments in tiny jets from three wide knifewounds his blood flowed slowly his staring eyes were lifted up in fear and in entreaty i knew that he was dying and as i felt my impotence to help him i as keenly felt a great rage and a hatred toward those who had struck him i leaned over him until my eyes were only a few inches from his face schnitzel i cried who did this you can trust me who did this quick i saw that he recognized me and that there was something which with terrible effort he was trying to make me understand in the hall was the rush of many people running exclaiming the noise of bells ringing from another floor the voice of a woman shrieked hysterically at the sounds the eyes of the boy grew eloquent with entreaty and with a movement that called from each wound a fresh outburst like a man strangling he lifted his fingers to his throat voices were calling for water to wait for the doctor to wait for the police but i thought i understood still doubting him still unbelieving ashamed of my own credulity i tore at his collar and my fingers closed upon a package of oiled silk i stooped and with my teeth ripped it open and holding before him the slips of paper it contained tore them into tiny shreds the eyes smiled at me with cunning with triumph with deep content it was so like the schnitzel i had known that i believed still he might have strength enough to help me who did this i begged ill hang him for it do you hear me i cried seeing him lying there with the life cut out of him swept me with a blind anger with a need to punish ill see they hang for it tell me i commanded who did this the eyes now filled with weariness looked up and the lips moved feebly my own people he whispered in my indignation i could have shaken the truth from him i bent closer then by god i whispered back youll tell me who they are the eyes flashed sullenly thats my secret said schnitzel the eyes set and the lips closed a man at my side leaned over him and drew the sheet across his face the messengers when ainsley first moved to lone lake farm all of his friends asked him the same question they wanted to know if the farmer who sold it to him had abandoned it as worthless how one of the idle rich who could not distinguish a plough from a harrow hoped to make it pay his answer was that he had not purchased the farm as a means of getting richer by honest toil but as a retreat from the world and as a test of true friendship he argued that the people he knew accepted his hospitality at sherrys because in any event they themselves would be dining within a taxicab fare of the same place but if to see him they travelled all the way to lone lake farm he might feel assured that they were friends indeed lone lake farm was spread over many acres of rocky ravine and forest at a point where connecticut approaches new york and between it and the nearest railroad station stretched six miles of an execrable wood road in this wilderness directly upon the lonely lake and at a spot equally distant from each of his boundary lines ainsley built himself a red brick house here in solitude he exiled himself ostensibly to become a gentleman farmer in reality to wait until polly kirkland had made up her mind to marry him lone lake which gave the farm its name was a pond hardly larger than a city block it was fed by hidden springs and fringed about with reeds and cattails stunted willows and shivering birch from its surface jutted points of the same rock that had made farming unremunerative and to these miniature promontories and islands ainsley in keeping with a fancied resemblance gave such names as the needles st helena the isle of pines from the edge of the pond that was farther from the house rose a high hill heavily wooded at its base oak and chestnut trees spread their branches over the water and when the air was still were so clearly reflected in the pond that the leaves seemed to float upon the surface to the smiling expanse of the farm the lake was what the eye is to the human countenance the oaks were its eyebrows the fringe of reeds its lashes and in changing mood it flashed with happiness or brooded in sombre melancholy for ainsley it held a deep attraction through the summer evenings as the sun set he would sit on the brick terrace and watch the fish leaping and listen to the venerable bullfrogs croaking false alarms of rain indeed after he met polly kirkland staring moodily at the lake became his favorite form of exercise with a number of other men ainsley was very much in love with miss kirkland and unprejudiced friends thought that if she were to choose any of her devotees ainsley should be that one ainsley heartily agreed in this opinion but in persuading miss kirkland to share it he had not been successful this was partly his own fault for when he dared to compare what she meant to him with what he had to offer her he became a mass of sodden humility could he have known how much polly kirkland envied and admired his depth of feeling entirely apart from the fact that she herself inspired that feeling how greatly she wished to care for him in the way he cared for her life even alone in the silences of lone lake would have been a beautiful and blessed thing but he was so sure she was the most charming and most wonderful girl in all the world and he an unworthy and despicable being that when the lady demurred he faltered and his pleading at least to his own ears carried no conviction when one thinks of being married said polly kirkland gently it isnt a question of the man you can live with but the man you cant live without and i am sorry but ive not found that man i suppose returned ainsley gloomily that my not being able to live without you doesnt affect the question in the least you have lived without me miss kirkland pointed out reproachfully for thirty years lived almost shouted ainsley do you call that living what was i before i met you i was an ignorant beast of the field i knew as much about living as one of the cows on my farm i could sleep twelve hours at a stretch or if i was in new york i never slept i was a day and night bank of health and happiness a great big useless puppy and now i cant sleep cant eat cant think except of you i dream about you all night think about you all day go through the woods calling your name cutting your initials in tree trunks doing all the fool things a man does when hes in love and i am the most miserable man in the world and the happiest he finally succeeded in making miss kirkland so miserable also that she decided to run away friends had planned to spend the early spring on the nile and were eager that she should accompany them to her the separation seemed to offer an excellent method of discovering whether or not ainsley was the man she could not live without ainsley saw in it only an act of torture devised with devilish cruelty what will happen to me he announced firmly is that i will plain die as long as i can see you as long as i have the chance to try and make you understand that no one can possibly love you as i do and as long as i know i am worrying you to death and no one else is i still hope ive no right to hope still i do and that one little chance keeps me alive but egypt if you escape to egypt what hold will i have on you you might as well be in the moon can you imagine me writing loveletters to a woman in the moon can i send american beauty roses to the ruins of karnak here i can telephone you not that i ever have anything to say that you want to hear but because i want to listen to your voice and to have you ask oh is that you as though you were glad it was me but egypt can i call up egypt on the longdistance if you leave me now youll leave me forever for ill drown myself in lone lake the day she sailed away he went to the steamer and separating her from her friends and family drew her to the side of the ship farther from the wharf and which for the moment was deserted directly below a piledriver with rattling of chains and shrieks from her donkeyengine was smashing great logs on the deck above the ships band was braying forth fictitious gayety and from every side they were assailed by the raucous whistles of ferryboats the surroundings were not conducive to sentiment but for the first time polly kirkland seemed a little uncertain a little frightened almost on the verge of tears almost persuaded to surrender for the first time she laid her hand on ainsleys arm and the shock sent the blood to his heart and held him breathless when the girl looked at him there was something in her eyes that neither he nor any other man had ever seen there the last thing i tell you she said the thing i want you to remember is this that though i do not care i want to care ainsley caught at her hand and to the delight of the crew of a passing tugboat kissed it rapturously his face was radiant the fact of parting from her had caused him real suffering had marked his face with hard lines now hope and happiness smoothed them away and his eyes shone with his love for her he was trembling laughing jubilant and if you should he begged how soon will i know you will cable he commanded you will cable come and the same hour ill start toward you ill go home now he cried and pack the girl drew away already she regretted the admission she had made in fairness and in kindness to him she tried to regain the position she had abandoned but a change like that she pleaded might not come for years may never come to recover herself to make the words she had uttered seem less serious she spoke quickly and lightly and how could i cable such a thing she protested it would be far too sacred too precious you should be able to feel that the change has come i suppose i should assented ainsley doubtfully but its a long way across two oceans it would be safer if youd promise to use the cable just one word come the girl shook her head and frowned if you cant feel that the woman you love loves you even across the world you cannot love her very deeply i dont have to answer that said ainsley i will send you a sign continued the girl hastily a secret wireless message it shall be a test if you love me you will read it at once you will know the instant you see it that it comes from me no one else will be able to read it but if you love me you will know that i love you whether she spoke in metaphor or in fact whether she was playing for time or whether in her heart she already intended to soon reward him with a message of glad tidings ainsley could not decide and even as he begged her to enlighten him the last whistle blew and a determined officer ordered him to the ships side just as in everything that is beautiful he whispered eagerly i always see something of you so now in everything wonderful i will read your message but he persisted how shall i be sure the last bag of mail had shot into the hold the most reluctant of the visitors were being hustled down the last remaining gangplank ainsleys state was desperate will it be in symbol or in cipher he demanded must i read it in the sky or will you hide it in a letter or where help me give me just a hint the girl shook her head you will read it in your heart she said from the end of the wharf ainsley watched the funnels of the ship disappear in the haze of the lower bay his heart was sore and heavy but in it there was still room for righteous indignation read it in my heart he protested how the devil can i read it in my heart i want to read it printed in a cablegram because he had always understood that young men in love found solace for their misery in solitude and in communion with nature he at once drove his car to lone lake but his misery was quite genuine and the emptiness of the brick house only served to increase his loneliness he had built the house for her though she had never visited it and was associated with it only through the somewhat indefinite medium of the telephone box but in new york they had been much together and ainsley quickly decided that in revisiting those places where he had been happy in her company he would derive from the recollection some melancholy consolation he accordingly raced back through the night to the city nor did he halt until he was at the door of her house she had left it only that morning and though it was locked in darkness it still spoke of her at least it seemed to bring her nearer to him than when he was listening to the frogs in the lake and crushing his way through the pines he was not hungry but he went to a restaurant where when he was host she had often been the honored guest and he pretended they were at supper together and without a chaperon either the illusion or the supper cheered him for he was encouraged to go on to his club there in the library with the aid of an atlas he worked out where after thirteen hours of moving at the rate of twentytwo knots an hour she should be at that moment having determined that fact to his own satisfaction he sent a wireless after the ship it read it is now midnight and you are in latitude north longitude west and i have grown old and gray waiting for the sign the next morning and for many days after he was surprised to find that the city went on as though she still were in it with unfeeling regularity the sun rose out of the east river on broadway electriclight signs flashed streetcars pursued each other taxicabs bumped and skidded women and even men dared to look happy and had apparently taken some thought to their attire they did not respect even his widowerhood they smiled upon him and asked him jocularly about the farm and his crops and what he was doing in new york he pitied them for obviously they were ignorant of the fact that in new york there were art galleries shops restaurants of great interest owing to the fact that polly kirkland had visited them they did not know that on upper fifth avenue were houses of which she had deigned to approve or which she had destroyed with ridicule and that to walk that avenue and halt before each of these houses was an inestimable privilege each day with pathetic vigilance ainsley examined his heart for the promised sign but so far from telling him that the change he longed for had taken place his heart grew heavier and as weeks went by and no sign appeared what little confidence he had once enjoyed passed with them but before hope entirely died several false alarms had thrilled him with happiness one was a cablegram from gibraltar in which the only words that were intelligible were congratulate and engagement this lifted him into an ecstasy of joy and excitement until on having the cable company repeat the message he learned it was a request from miss kirkland to congratulate two mutual friends who had just announced their engagement and of whose address she was uncertain he had hardly recovered from this disappointment than he was again thrown into a tumult by the receipt of a mysterious package from the customhouse containing an intaglio ring the ring came from italy and her ship had touched at genoa the fact that it was addressed in an unknown handwriting did not disconcert him for he argued that to make the test more difficult she might disguise the handwriting he at once carried the intaglio to an expert at the metropolitan museum and when he was told that it represented cupid feeding a fire upon an altar he reserved a stateroom on the first steamer bound for the mediterranean but before his ship sailed a letter also from italy from his aunt maria who was spending the winter in rome informed him that the ring was a christmas gift from her in his rage he unjustly condemned aunt maria as a meddling old busybody and gave her ring to the cook after two months of pilgrimages to places sacred to the memory of polly kirkland ainsley found that feeding his love on postmortems was poor fare and in surrender determined to evacuate new york since her departure he had received from miss kirkland several letters but they contained no hint of a change in her affections and search them as he might he could find no cipher or hidden message they were merely frank friendly notes of travel at first filled with gossip of the steamer and later telling of excursions around cairo if they held any touch of feeling they seemed to show that she was sorry for him and as she could not regard him in any way more calculated to increase his discouragement he in utter hopelessness retreated to the solitude of the farm in new york he left behind him two trunks filled with such garments as a man would need on board a steamer and in the early spring in egypt they had been packed and in readiness since the day she sailed away when she had told him of the possible sign but there had been no sign nor did he longer believe in one so in the baggageroom of an hotel the trunks were abandoned accumulating layers of dust and charges for storage at the farm the snow still lay in the crevices of the rocks and beneath the branches of the evergreens but under the wet dead leaves little flowers had begun to show their faces the backbone of the winter was broken and spring was in the air but as ainsley was certain that his heart also was broken the signs of spring did not console him at each weekend he filled the house with people but they found him gloomy and he found them dull he liked better the solitude of the midweek days then for hours he would tramp through the woods pretending she was at his side pretending he was helping her across the streams swollen with winter rains and melted snow on these excursions he cut down trees that hid a view he thought she would have liked he cut paths over which she might have walked or he sat idly in a flatbottomed scow in the lake and made a pretence of fishing the loneliness of the lake and the isolation of the boat suited his humor he did not find it true that misery loves company at least to human beings he preferred his companions of lone lake the beaver building his home among the reeds the kingfisher the blue heron the wild fowl that in their flight north rested for an hour or a day upon the peaceful waters he looked upon them as his guests and when they spread their wings and left him again alone he felt he had been hardly used it was while he was sunk in this state of melancholy and some months after miss kirkland had sailed to egypt that hope returned for a weekend he had invited holden and lowell two former classmates and nelson mortimer and his bride they were all old friends of their host and well acquainted with the cause of his discouragement so they did not ask to be entertained but disregarding him amused themselves after their own fashion it was late friday afternoon the members of the houseparty had just returned from a tramp through the woods and had joined ainsley on the terrace where he stood watching the last rays of the sun leave the lake in darkness all through the day there had been sharp splashes of rain with the clouds dull and forbidding but now the sun was sinking in a sky of crimson and for the morrow a faint moon held out a promise of fair weather elsie mortimer gave a sudden exclamation and pointed to the east look she said the men turned and followed the direction of her hand in the fading light against a background of sombre clouds that the sun could not reach they saw moving slowly toward them and descending as they moved six great white birds when they were above the tops of the trees that edged the lake the birds halted and hovered uncertainly their wings lifting and falling their bodies slanting and sweeping slowly in short circles the suddenness of their approach their presence so far inland something unfamiliar and foreign in the way they had winged their progress for a moment held the group upon the terrace silent they are gulls from the sound said lowell they are too large for gulls returned mortimer they might be wild geese but he answered himself in a puzzled voice it is too late and wild geese follow a leader as though they feared the birds might hear them and take alarm the men unconsciously had spoken in low tones they move as though they were very tired whispered elsie mortimer i think said ainsley they have lost their way but even as he spoke the birds as though they had reached their goal spread their wings to the full length and sank to the shallow water at the farthest margin of the lake as they fell the sun struck full upon them turning their great pinions into flashing white and silver oh cried the girl but they are beautiful between the house and the lake there was a ridge of rock higher than the head of a man and to this ainsley and his guests ran for cover on hands and knees like hunters stalking game they scrambled up the face of the rock and peered cautiously into the pond below them less than one hundred yards away on a tiny promontory the six white birds stood motionless they showed no sign of fear they could not but know that beyond the lonely circle of the pond were the haunts of men from the farm came the tinkle of a cowbell the bark of a dog and in the valley six miles distant rose faintly upon the stillness of the sunset hour the rumble of a passing train but if these sounds carried the birds gave no heed in each drooping head and dragging wing in the forward stoop of each white body weighing heavily on the slim black legs was written utter weariness abject fatigue to each even to lower his bill and sip from the cool waters was a supreme effort and in their exhaustion so complete was something humanly helpless and pathetic illustration i think said ainsley they have lost their way to ainsley the mysterious visitors made a direct appeal he felt as though they had thrown themselves upon his hospitality that they showed such confidence that the sanctuary would be kept sacred touched him and while his friends spoke eagerly he remained silent watching the drooping ghostlike figures his eyes filled with pity i have seen birds like those in florida mortimer was whispering but they were not migratory birds and ive seen white cranes in the adirondacks said lowell but never six at one time theyre like no bird i ever saw out of a zoo declared elsie mortimer maybe they are from the zoo maybe they escaped from the bronx the bronx is too near objected lowell these birds have come a great distance they move as though they had been flying for many days as though the absurdity of his own thought amused him mortimer laughed softly ill tell you what they do look like he said they look like that bird you see on the nile the sacred ibis they something between a gasp and a cry startled him into silence he found his host staring wildly his lips parted his eyes open wide where demanded ainsley where did you say his voice was so hoarse so strange that they all turned and looked on the nile repeated mortimer all over egypt why ainsley made no answer unclasping his hold he suddenly slid down the face of the rock and with a bump lit on his hands and knees with one bound he had cleared a flowerbed in two more he had mounted the steps to the terrace and in another instant had disappeared into the house what happened to him demanded elsie mortimer hes gone to get a gun exclaimed mortimer but he mustnt how can he think of shooting them he cried indignantly ill put a stop to that in the hall he found ainsley surrounded by a group of startled servants you get that car at the door in five minutes he was shouting and you telephone the hotel to have my trunks out of the cellar and on board the kron prinz albert by midnight then you telephone hoboken that i want a cabin and if they havent got a cabin i want the captains and tell them anyway im coming on board tonight and im going with them if i have to sleep on deck and you he cried turning to mortimer take a shotgun and guard that lake and if anybody tries to molest those birds shoot him theyve come from egypt from polly kirkland she sent them theyre a sign are you going mad cried mortimer no roared ainsley im going to egypt and im going now polly kirkland and her friends were travelling slowly up the nile and had reached luxor a few hundred yards below the village their dahabiyeh was moored to the bank and on the deck miss kirkland was watching a scarlet sun sink behind two palmtrees by the grace of that special providence that cares for drunken men citizens of the united states and lovers her friends were on shore and she was alone for this she was grateful for her thoughts were of a melancholy and tender nature and she had no wish for any companion save one in consequence when a steamlaunch approaching at full speed with the rattle of a quickfiring gun broke upon her meditations she was distinctly annoyed but when with much ringing of bells and shouting of orders the steamlaunch rammed the paint off her dahabiyeh and a young man flung himself over the rail and ran toward her her annoyance passed and with a sigh she sank into his outstretched eager arms half an hour later ainsley laughed proudly and happily well he exclaimed you can never say i kept you waiting i didnt lose much time did i ten minutes after i got your cqd signal i was going down the boston post road at seventy miles an hour my what said the girl the sign explained ainsley the sign you were to send me to tell me he bent over her hands and added gently that you cared for me oh i remember laughed polly kirkland i was to send you a sign wasnt i you were to read it in your heart she quoted and i did returned ainsley complacently there were several false alarms and id almost lost hope but when the messengers came i knew them with puzzled eyes the girl frowned and raised her head messengers she repeated i sent no message of course she went on when i said you would read it in your heart i meant that if you really loved me you would not wait for a sign but you would just come she sighed proudly and contentedly and you came you understood that didnt you she asked anxiously for an instant ainsley stared blankly and then to hide his guilty countenance drew her toward him and kissed her of course he stammered of course i understood that was why i came i just couldnt stand it any longer breathing heavily at the thought of the blunder he had so narrowly avoided ainsley turned his head toward the great red disk that was disappearing into the sands of the desert he was so long silent that the girl lifted her eyes and found that already he had forgotten her presence and transfixed was staring at the sky on his face was bewilderment and wonder and a touch of awe the girl followed the direction of his eyes and in the swiftly gathering darkness saw coming slowly toward them and descending as they came six great white birds they moved with the last effort of complete exhaustion in the drooping head and dragging wings of each was written utter weariness abject fatigue for a moment they hovered over the dahabiyeh and above the two young lovers and then like tired travellers who had reached their journeys end they spread their wings and sank to the muddy waters of the nile and into the enveloping night some day said ainsley i have a confession to make to you a wasted day when its turn came the private secretary somewhat apologetically laid the letter in front of the wisest man in wall street from mrs austin probation officer court of general sessions he explained wants a letter about spear hes been convicted of theft comes up for sentence tuesday spear repeated arnold thorndike young fellow stenographer used to do your letters last summer going in and out on the train the great man nodded i remember what about him the habitual gloom of the private secretary was lightened by a grin went on the loose had with him about five hundred dollars belonging to the firm hes with isaacs sons now shoe people on sixth avenue met a woman and woke up without the money the next morning he offered to make good but isaacs called in a policeman when they looked into it they found the boy had been drunk they tried to withdraw the charge but hed been committed now the probation officer is trying to get the judge to suspend sentence a letter from you sir would it was evident the mind of the great man was elsewhere young men who drunk or sober spent the firms money on women who disappeared before sunrise did not appeal to him another letter submitted that morning had come from his art agent in europe in florence he had discovered the correggio he had been sent to find it was undoubtedly genuine and he asked to be instructed by cable the price was forty thousand dollars with one eye closed and the other keenly regarding the inkstand mr thorndike decided to pay the price and with the facility of long practice dismissed the correggio and snapped his mind back to the present spear had a letter from us when he left didnt he he asked what he has developed into since he left us he shrugged his shoulders the secretary withdrew the letter and slipped another in its place homer firth the landscape man he chanted wants permission to use blue flint on the new road with turf gutters and to plant silver firs each side says it will run to about five thousand dollars a mile no protested the great man firmly blue flint makes a country place look like a cemetery mine looks too much like a cemetery now landscape gardeners he exclaimed impatiently their only idea is to insult nature the place was better the day i bought it when it was running wild you could pick flowers all the way to the gates pleased that it should have recurred to him the great man smiled why spear he exclaimed always took in a bunch of them for his mother dont you remember we used to see him before breakfast wandering around the grounds picking flowers mr thorndike nodded briskly i like his taking flowers to his mother he said it was to his mother suggested the secretary gloomily well he picked the flowers anyway laughed mr thorndike he didnt pick our pockets and he had the run of the house in those days as far as we know he dictated he was satisfactory dont say more than that the secretary scribbled a mark with his pencil and the landscape man tell him commanded thorndike i want a wood road suitable to a farm and to let the trees grow where god planted them as his car slid downtown on tuesday morning the mind of arnold thorndike was occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad the japanese loan the new wing to his art gallery and an attack that morning in his own newspaper upon his pet trust but his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him or by some genius of memory to recall the fact that it was on this morning young spear was to be sentenced for theft it was a charming morning the spring was at full tide and the air was sweet and clean mr thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence he regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter he remembered the young man now and favorably a shy silent youth deft in work and at other times conscious and embarrassed but that on the part of a stenographer in the presence of the wisest man in wall street was not unnatural on occasions mr thorndike had put even royalty frayed impecunious royalty on the lookout for a loan at its ease the hood of the car was down and the taste of the air warmed by the sun was grateful it was at this time a year before that young spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother a year from now where would young spear be it was characteristic of the great man to act quickly so quickly that his friends declared he was a slave to impulse it was these same impulses leading so invariably to success that made his enemies call him the wisest man he leaned forward and touched the chauffeurs shoulder stop at the court of general sessions he commanded what he proposed to do would take but a few minutes a word a personal word from him to the district attorney or the judge would be enough he recalled that a sunday special had once calculated that the working time of arnold thorndike brought him in two hundred dollars a minute at that rate keeping spear out of prison would cost a thousand dollars out of the sunshine mr thorndike stepped into the gloom of an echoing rotunda shut in on every side hung by balconies lit many stories overhead by a dirty skylight the place was damp the air acrid with the smell of stale tobacco juice and foul with the presence of many unwashed humans a policeman chewing stolidly nodded toward an elevator shaft and other policemen nodded him further on to the office of the district attorney there arnold thorndike breathed more freely he was again among his own people he could not help but appreciate the dramatic qualities of the situation that the richest man in wall street should appear in person to plead for a humble and weaker brother he knew he could not escape recognition his face was too well known but he trusted for the sake of spear the reporters would make no display of his visit with a deprecatory laugh he explained why he had come but the outburst of approbation he had anticipated did not follow the district attorney ran his finger briskly down a printed card henry spear he exclaimed thats your man part three judge fallon andrews is in that court he walked to the door of his private office andrews he called he introduced an alert broadshouldered young man of years of much indiscretion and with a charming and inconsequent manner mr thorndike is interested in henry spear coming up for sentence in part three this morning wants to speak for him take him over with you the district attorney shook hands quickly and retreated to his private office mr andrews took out a cigarette and as he crossed the floor lit it come with me he commanded somewhat puzzled slightly annoyed but enjoying withal the novelty of the environment and the curtness of his reception mr thorndike followed he decided that in his ignorance he had wasted his own time and that of the prosecuting attorney he should at once have sent in his card to the judge as he understood it mr andrews was now conducting him to that dignitary and in a moment he would be free to return to his own affairs which were the affairs of two continents but mr andrews led him to an office bare and small and offered him a chair and handed him a morning newspaper there were people waiting in the room strange people only like those mr thorndike had seen on ferryboats they leaned forward toward young mr andrews fawning their eyes wide with apprehension mr thorndike refused the newspaper i thought i was going to see the judge he suggested court doesnt open for a few minutes yet said the assistant district attorney judge is always late anyway mr thorndike suppressed an exclamation he wanted to protest but his clear mind showed him that there was nothing against which with reason he could protest he could not complain because these people were not apparently aware of the sacrifice he was making he had come among them to perform a kindly act he recognized that he must not stultify it by a show of irritation he had precipitated himself into a game of which he did not know the rules that was all next time he would know better next time he would send a clerk but he was not without a sense of humor and the situation as it now was forced upon him struck him as amusing he laughed goodnaturedly and reached for the desk telephone may i use this he asked he spoke to the wall street office he explained he would be a few minutes late he directed what should be done if the market opened in a certain way he gave rapid orders on many different matters asked to have read to him a cablegram he expected from petersburg and one from vienna they answer each other was his final instruction it looks like peace mr andrews with genial patience had remained silent now he turned upon his visitors a levantine burly unshaven and soiled towered truculently above him young mr andrews with his swivel chair tilted back his hands clasped behind his head his cigarette hanging from his lips regarded the man dispassionately you gotta hell of a nerve to come to see me he commented cheerfully to mr thorndike the form of greeting was novel so greatly did it differ from the procedure of his own office that he listened with interest was it you demanded young andrews in a puzzled tone or your brother who tried to knife me mr thorndike unaccustomed to cross the pavement to his office unless escorted by bank messengers and plainclothes men felt the room growing rapidly smaller the figure of the truculent greek loomed to heroic proportions the hand of the banker went vaguely to his chin and from there fell to his pearl pin which he hastily covered get out said young andrews and dont show your face here the door slammed upon the flying greek young andrews swung his swivel chair so that over his shoulder he could see mr thorndike i dont like his face he explained a kindly eyed sad woman with a basket on her knee smiled upon andrews with the familiarity of an old acquaintance is that woman going to get a divorce from my son she asked now that hes in trouble now that hes in sing sing corrected mr andrews i hope so she deserves it that son of yours mrs bernard he declared emphatically is no good the brutality shocked mr thorndike for the woman he felt a thrill of sympathy but at once saw that it was superfluous from the secure and lofty heights of motherhood mrs bernard smiled down upon the assistant district attorney as upon a naughty child she did not even deign a protest she continued merely to smile the smile reminded thorndike of the smile on the face of a mother in a painting by murillo he had lately presented to the chapel in the college he had given to his native town that son of yours repeated young andrews is a leech hes robbed you robbed his wife best thing i ever did for you was to send him up the river the mother smiled upon him beseechingly could you give me a pass she said young andrews flung up his hands and appealed to thorndike isnt that just like a mother he protested that son of hers has broken her heart tramped on her cheated her hasnt left her a cent and she comes to me for a pass so she can kiss him through the bars and ill bet shes got a cake for him in that basket illustration was it you demanded young andrews in a puzzled tone or your brother who tried to knife me the mother laughed happily she knew now she would get the pass mothers explained mr andrews from the depth of his wisdom are all like that your mother my mother if you went to jail your mother would be just like that mr thorndike bowed his head politely he had never considered going to jail or whether if he did his mother would bring him cake in a basket apparently there were many aspects and accidents of life not included in his experience young andrews sprang to his feet and with the force of a hose flushing a gutter swept his soiled visitors into the hall come on he called to the wisest man the court is open in the corridors were many people and with his eyes on the broad shoulders of the assistant district attorney thorndike pushed his way through them the people who blocked his progress were of the class unknown to him their looks were anxious furtive miserable they stood in little groups listening eagerly to a sharpfaced lawyer or in sullen despair eying each other at a door a tipstaff laid his hand roughly on the arm of mr thorndike thats all right joe called young mr andrews hes with me they entered the court and passed down an aisle to a railed enclosure in which were high oak chairs again in his effort to follow mr thorndike was halted but the first tipstaff came to his rescue all right he signalled hes with mr andrews mr andrews pointed to one of the oak chairs you sit there he commanded its reserved for members of the bar but its all right youre with me distinctly annoyed slightly bewildered the banker sank between the arms of a chair he felt he had lost his individuality andrews had become his sponsor because of andrews he was tolerated because andrews had a pull he was permitted to sit as an equal among policecourt lawyers no longer was he arnold thorndike he was merely the man with mr andrews then even andrews abandoned him the judgell be here in a minute now said the assistant district attorney and went inside a railed enclosure in front of the judges bench there he greeted another assistant district attorney whose years were those of even greater indiscretion than the years of mr andrews seated on the rail with their hands in their pockets and their backs turned to mr thorndike they laughed and talked together the subject of their discourse was one mike donlin as he appeared in vaudeville to mr thorndike it was evident that young andrews had entirely forgotten him he arose and touched his sleeve with infinite sarcasm mr thorndike began my engagements are not pressing but a court attendant beat with his palm upon the rail sit down whispered andrews the judge is coming mr thorndike sat down the court attendant droned loudly words mr thorndike could not distinguish there was a rustle of silk and from a door behind him the judge stalked past he was a young man the type of the tammany politician on his shrewd alert irishamerican features was an expression of unnatural gloom with a smile mr thorndike observed that it was as little suited to the countenance of the young judge as was the robe to his shoulders mr thorndike was still smiling when young andrews leaned over the rail stand up he hissed mr thorndike stood up after the court attendant had uttered more unintelligible words every one sat down and the financier again moved hurriedly to the rail i would like to speak to him now before he begins he whispered i cant wait mr andrews stared in amazement the banker had not believed the young man could look so serious speak to him now exclaimed the district attorney youve got to wait till your man comes up if you speak to the judge now the voice of andrews faded away in horror not knowing in what way he had offended but convinced that it was only by the grace of andrews he had escaped a dungeon mr thorndike retreated to his armchair the clock on the wall showed him that already he had given to young spear one hour and a quarter the idea was preposterous no one better than himself knew what his time was really worth in half an hour there was a board meeting later he was to hold a post mortem on a railroad at every moment questions were being asked by telegraph by cable questions that involved the credit of individuals of firms of even the country and the one man who could answer them was risking untold sums only that he might say a good word for an idle apprentice inside the railed enclosure a lawyer was reading a typewritten speech he assured his honor that he must have more time to prepare his case it was one of immense importance the name of a most respectable business house was involved and a sum of no less than nine hundred dollars nine hundred dollars the contrast struck mr thorndikes sense of humor full in the centre unknowingly he laughed and found himself as conspicuous as though he had appeared suddenly in his nightclothes the tipstaffs beat upon the rail the lawyer he had interrupted uttered an indignant exclamation andrews came hurriedly toward him and the young judge slowly turned his head those persons he said who cannot respect the dignity of this court will leave it as he spoke with his eyes fixed on those of mr thorndike the latter saw that the young judge had suddenly recognized him but the fact of his identity did not cause the frown to relax or the rebuke to halt unuttered in even icy tones the judge continued and it is well they should remember that the law is no respecter of persons and that the dignity of this court will be enforced no matter who the offender may happen to be andrews slipped into the chair beside mr thorndike and grinned sympathetically sorry he whispered should have warned you we wont be long now he added encouragingly as soon as this fellow finishes his argument the judgell take up the sentences your man seems to have other friends isaacs sons are here and the typewriter firm who taught him but what you say will help most it wont be more than a couple of hours now a couple of hours mr thorndike raged inwardly a couple of hours in this place where he had been publicly humiliated he smiled a thin sharklike smile those who made it their business to study his expressions on seeing it would have fled young andrews not being acquainted with the moods of the great man added cheerfully by one oclock anyway mr thorndike began grimly to pull on his gloves for all he cared now young spear could go hang andrews nudged his elbow see that old lady in the front row he whispered thats mrs spear what did i tell you mothers are all alike shes not taken her eyes off you since court opened she knows youre her one best bet impatiently mr thorndike raised his head he saw a little whitehaired woman who stared at him in her eyes was the same look he had seen in the eyes of men who at times of panic fled to him beseeching entreating forcing upon him what was left of the wreck of their fortunes if only he would save their honor and here come the prisoners andrews whispered see spear third man from the last a long line guarded in front and rear shuffled into the courtroom and as ordered ranged themselves against the wall among them were old men and young boys well dressed cleverlooking rascals collarless tramps fierceeyed aliens smoothshaven thinlipped broadwayards and spear spear his head hanging with lips white and cheeks ashen and his eyes heavy with shame mr thorndike had risen and in farewell was holding out his hand to andrews he turned and across the courtroom the eyes of the financier and the stenographer met at the sight of the great man spear flushed crimson and then his look of despair slowly disappeared and into his eyes there came incredulously hope and gratitude he turned his head suddenly to the wall mr thorndike stood irresolute and then sank back into his chair the first man in the line was already at the railing and the questions put to him by the judge were being repeated to him by the other assistant district attorney and a court attendant his muttered answers were in turn repeated to the judge says hes married naturalized citizen lutheran church diecutter by profession the probation officer her hands filled with papers bustled forward and whispered mrs austin says continued the district attorney shes looked into this case and asks to have the man turned over to her he has a wife and three children has supported them for five years is the wife in court the judge said a thin washedout pretty woman stood up and clasped her hands in front of her has this man been a good husband to you madam asked the young judge the woman broke into vehement assurances no man could have been a better husband would she take him back indeed she would take him back she held out her hands as though she would physically drag her husband from the pillory illustration mr thorndike stood irresolute and then sank back into his chair the judge bowed toward the probation officer and she beckoned the prisoner to her other men followed and in the fortune of each mr thorndike found himself to his surprise taking a personal interest it was as good as a play it reminded him of the sicilians he had seen in london in their little sordid tragedies only these actors were appearing in their proper persons in real dramas of a life he did not know but which appealed to something that had been long untouched long in disuse it was an uncomfortable sensation that left him restless because as he appreciated it needed expression an outlet he found this partially in praising through andrews the young judge who had publicly rebuked him mr thorndike found him astute sane his queries intelligent his comments just and this probation officer she too was capable was she not smiling at his interest in what to him was an old story the younger man nodded i like her looks whispered the great man like her clear eyes and clean skin she strikes me as able full of energy and yet womanly these men when they come under her charge he insisted eagerly need money to start again dont they he spoke anxiously he believed he had found the clew to his restlessness it was a desire to help to be of use to these failures who had fallen and who were being lifted to their feet andrews looked at him curiously anything you give her he answered would be well invested if you will tell me her name and address whispered the banker he was much given to charity but it had been perfunctory it was extended on the advice of his secretary in helping here he felt a genial glow of personal pleasure it was much more satisfactory than giving an old master to his private chapel in the rear of the courtroom there was a scuffle that caused every one to turn and look a man who had tried to force his way past the tipstaffs was being violently ejected and as he disappeared he waved a paper toward mr thorndike the banker recognized him as his chief clerk andrews rose anxiously that man wanted to get to you ill see what it is maybe its important mr thorndike pulled him back maybe it is he said dryly but i cant see him now im busy slowly the long line of derelicts of birds of prey of sorry weak failures passed before the seat of judgment mr thorndike had moved into a chair nearer to the rail and from time to time made a note upon the back of an envelope he had forgotten the time or had chosen to disregard it so great was his interest that he had forgotten the particular derelict he had come to serve until spear stood almost at his elbow thorndike turned eagerly to the judge and saw that he was listening to a rotund gray little man with beady birdlike eyes who as he talked bowed and gesticulated behind him stood a younger man a more modern edition of the other he also bowed and behind gold eyeglasses smiled ingratiatingly the judge nodded and leaning forward for a few moments fixed his eyes upon the prisoner you are a very fortunate young man he said he laid his hand upon a pile of letters when you were your own worst enemy your friends came to help you these letters speak for you your employers whom you robbed have pleaded with me in your favor it is urged in your behalf that at the time you committed the crime of which you are found guilty you were intoxicated in the eyes of the law that is no excuse some men can drink and keep their senses it appears you can not when you drink you are a menace to yourself and as is shown by this crime to the community therefore you must not drink in view of the good character to which your friends have testified and on the condition that you do not touch liquor i will not sentence you to jail but will place you in charge of the probation officer the judge leaned back in his chair and beckoned to mr andrews it was finished spear was free and from different parts of the courtroom people were moving toward the door their numbers showed that the friends of the young man had been many mr thorndike felt a certain twinge of disappointment even though the result relieved and pleased him he wished in bringing it about he had had some part he begrudged to isaacs sons the credit of having given spear his liberty his morning had been wasted he had neglected his own interests and in no way assisted those of spear he was moving out of the railed enclosure when andrews called him by name his honor he said impressively wishes to speak to you the judge leaned over his desk and shook mr thorndike by the hand then he made a speech the speech was about publicspirited citizens who to the neglect of their own interests came to assist the ends of justice and fellowcreatures in misfortune he purposely spoke in a loud voice and every one stopped to listen the law mr thorndike is not vindictive he said it wishes only to be just nor can it be swayed by wealth or political or social influences but when there is good in a man i personally want to know it and when gentlemen like yourself of your standing in this city come here to speak a good word for a man we would stultify the purpose of justice if we did not listen i thank you for coming and i wish more of our citizens were as unselfish and publicspirited it was all quite absurd and most embarrassing but inwardly mr thorndike glowed with pleasure it was a long time since any one had had the audacity to tell him he had done well from the friends of spear there was a ripple of applause which no tipstaff took it upon himself to suppress and to the accompaniment of this mr thorndike walked to the corridor he was pleased with himself and with his fellowmen he shook hands with isaacs sons and congratulated them upon their public spirit and the typewriter firm upon their public spirit and then he saw spear standing apart regarding him doubtfully spear did not offer his hand but mr thorndike took it and shook it and said i want to meet your mother and when mrs spear tried to stop sobbing long enough to tell him how happy she was and how grateful he instead told her what a fine son she had and that he remembered when spear used to carry flowers to town for her and she remembered it too and thanked him for the flowers and he told spear when isaacs sons went bankrupt which at the rate they were giving away their money to the hebrew hospital would be very soon spear must come back to him and isaacs sons were delighted at the great mans pleasantry and afterward repeated it many times calling upon each other to bear witness and spear felt as though some one had given him a new backbone and andrews who was guiding thorndike out of the building was thinking to himself what a great confidence man had been lost when thorndike became a banker the chief clerk and two bank messengers were waiting by the automobile with written calls for help from the office they pounced upon the banker and almost lifted him into the car theres still time panted the chief clerk there is not answered mr thorndike his tone was rebellious defiant it carried all the authority of a spoiled child of fortune ive wasted most of this day he declared and i intend to waste the rest of it andrews he called jump in and ill give you a lunch at sherrys the vigilant protector of the public dashed back into the building wait till i get my hat he called as the two truants rolled up the avenue the spring sunshine warmed them the sense of duties neglected added zest to their holiday and young mr andrews laughed aloud mr thorndike raised his eyebrows inquiringly i was wondering said andrews how much it cost you to keep spear out of jail i dont care said the great man guiltily it was worth it a charmed life she loved him so that when he went away to a little war in which his country was interested she could not understand nor quite forgive as the correspondent of a newspaper chesterton had looked on at other wars when the yellow races met when the infidel turk spanked the christian greek and one he had watched from inside a british square where he was greatly alarmed lest he should be trampled upon by terrified camels this had happened before he and she had met after they met she told him that what chances he had chosen to take before he came into her life fell outside of her jurisdiction but now that his life belonged to her this talk of his standing up to be shot at was wicked it was worse than wicked it was absurd when the maine sank in havana harbor and the word war was appearing hourly in hysterical extras miss armitage explained her position you mustnt think she said that i am one of those silly girls who would beg you not to go to war at the moment of speaking her cheek happened to be resting against his and his arm was about her so he humbly bent his head and kissed her and whispered very proudly and softly no dearest at which she withdrew from him frowning no im not a bit like those girls she proclaimed i merely tell you you cant go my gracious she cried helplessly she knew the words fell short of expressing her distress but her education had not supplied her with exclamations of greater violence my goodness she cried how can you frighten me so its not like you she reproached him you are so unselfish so noble you are always thinking of other people how can you talk of going to war to be killed to me and now now that you have made me love you so the hands that when she talked seemed to him like swallows darting and flashing in the sunlight clutched his sleeve the fingers that he would rather kiss than the lips of any other woman that ever lived clung to his arm their clasp reminded him of that of a drowning child he had once lifted from the surf if you should die whispered miss armitage what would i do what would i do but my dearest cried the young man my dearest one ive got to go its our own war everybody else will go he pleaded every man you know and theyre going to fight too im going only to look on thats bad enough isnt it without sitting at home you should be sorry im not going to fight sorry exclaimed the girl if you love me if i love you shouted the young man his voice suggested that he was about to shake her how dare you she abandoned that position and attacked from one more logical but why punish me she protested do i want the war do i want to free cuba no i want you and if you go you are the one who is sure to be killed you are so big and so brave and you will be rushing in wherever the fighting is and then then you will die she raised her eyes and looked at him as though seeing him from a great distance and she added fatefully i will die too or maybe i will have to live to live without you for years for many miserable years fearfully with great caution as though in his joy in her he might crush her in his hands the young man drew her to him and held her close after a silence he whispered but you know that nothing can happen to me not now that god has let me love you he could not be so cruel he would not have given me such happiness to take it from me a man who loves you as i love you cannot come to any harm and the man you love is immortal immune he holds a charmed life so long as you love him he must live the eyes of the girl smiled up at him through her tears she lifted her lips to his then you will never die she said she held him away from her listen she whispered what you say is true it must be true because you are always right i love you so that nothing can harm you my love will be a charm it will hang around your neck and protect you and keep you and bring you back to me when you are in danger my love will save you for while it lives i live when it dies chesterton kissed her quickly what happens then he said doesnt matter the war game had run its happygolucky course briefly and brilliantly with glory enough for all even for chesterton for in no previous campaign had good fortune so persistently stood smiling at his elbow at each moment of the war that was critical picturesque dramatic by some lucky accident he found himself among those present he could not lose even when his press boat broke down at cardenas a yankee cruiser and two spanish gunboats apparently for his sole benefit engaged in an impromptu duel within range of his megaphone when his horse went lame the column with which he had wished to advance passed forward to the front unmolested while the rear guard to which he had been forced to join his fortune fought its way through the stifling underbrush between his news despatches when he was not singing the praises of his fellowcountrymen or copying lists of their killed and wounded he wrote to miss armitage his letters were scrawled on yellow copy paper and consisted of repetitions of the three words i love you rearranged illuminated and intensified each letter began much in the same way the war is still going on you can read about it in the papers what i want you to know is that i love you as no man ever and so on for many pages from her only one of the letters she wrote reached him it was picked up in the sand at siboney after the medical corps in an effort to wipe out the yellowfever had set fire to the postoffice tent she had written it some weeks before from her summer home at newport and in it she said when you went to the front i thought no woman could love more than i did then but now i know at least i know one girl who can she cannot write it she can never tell you you must just believe each day i hear from you for as soon as the paper comes i take it down to the rocks and read your cables and i look south across the ocean to cuba and try to see you in all that fighting and heat and fever but i am not afraid for each morning i wake to find i love you more that it has grown stronger more wonderful more hard to bear and i know the charm i gave you grows with it and is more powerful and that it will bring you back to me wearing new honors bearing your sheaves with you as though i cared for your new honors i want you you you only you when santiago surrendered and the invading army settled down to arrange terms of peace and imbibe fever and general miles moved to porto rico chesterton moved with him in that pretty little island a command of regulars under a general of the regular army had in a night attack driven back the spaniards from adhuntas the next afternoon as the column was in line of march and the men were shaking themselves into their accoutrements a dusty sweating volunteer staff officer rode down the main street of adhuntas and with the authority of a field marshal held up his hand general miless compliments sir he panted and peace is declared different men received the news each in a different fashion some whirled their hats in the air and cheered those who saw promotion and the new insignia on their straps vanish swore deeply chesterton fell upon his saddlebags and began to distribute his possessions among the enlisted men after he had remobilized his effects consisted of a change of clothes his camera waterbottle and his medicine case in his present state of health and spirits he could not believe he stood in need of the medicine case but it was a gift from miss armitage and carried with it a promise from him that he always would carry it he had packed it throughout the campaign and for others it had proved of value i take it you are leaving us said an officer enviously i am leaving you so quick cried chesterton laughing that you wont even see the dust theres a transport starts from mayaguez at six tomorrow morning and if i dont catch it this pony will die on the wharf the road to mayaguez is not healthy for americans said the general in command i dont think i ought to let you go the enemy does not know peace is on yet and there are a lot of guerillas chesterton shook his head in pitying wonder not let me go he exclaimed why general you havent enough men in your command to stop me and as for the spaniards and guerillas im homesick cried the young man im so damned homesick that i am liable to die of it before the transport gets me to sandy hook if you are shot up by an outpost growled the general you will be worse off than homesick its forty miles to mayaguez better wait till daylight wheres the sense of dying after the fightings over if i dont catch that transport i sure will die laughed chesterton his head was bent and he was tugging at his saddle girths apparently the effort brought a deeper shadow to his tan but nothing else can kill me i have a charm general he exclaimed we hadnt noticed it said the general the staff officers according to regulations laughed its not that kind of a charm said chesterton goodby general the road was hardly more than a trail but the moon made it as light as day and cast across it black tracings of the swinging vines and creepers while high in the air it turned the polished surface of the palms into glittering silver as he plunged into the cool depths of the forest chesterton threw up his arms and thanked god that he was moving toward her the luck that had accompanied him throughout the campaign had held until the end had he been forced to wait for a transport each hour would have meant a month of torment an arid wasted place in his life as it was with each eager stride of el capitan his little porto rican pony he was brought closer to her he was so happy that as he galloped through the dark shadows of the jungle or out into the brilliant moonlight he shouted aloud and sang and again as he urged el capitan to greater bursts of speed he explained in joyous breathless phrases why it was that he urged him on for she is wonderful and most beautiful he cried the most glorious girl in all the world and if i kept her waiting even for a moment el capitan i would be unworthy and i might lose her so you see we ride for a great prize the spanish column that the night before had been driven from adhuntas now in ignorance of peace occupied both sides of the valley through which ran the road to mayaguez and in ambush by the road itself had placed an outpost of two men one was a sharpshooter of the picked corps of the guardia civile and one a sergeant of the regiment that lay hidden in the heights if the americans advanced toward mayaguez these men were to wait until the head of the column drew abreast of them when they were to fire the report of their rifles would be the signal for those in the hill above to wipe out the memory of adhuntas chesterton had been riding at a gallop but as he reached the place where the men lay in ambush he pulled el capitan to a walk and took advantage of his first breathing spell to light his pipe he had already filled it and was now fumbling in his pocket for his matchbox the matchbox was of wood such as one can buy filled to the brim with matches for one penny but it was a most precious possession in the early days of his interest in miss armitage as they were once setting forth upon a motor trip she had handed it to him why he asked you always forget to bring any she said simply and have to borrow some the other men in the car knowing this to be a just reproof laughed sardonically and at the laugh the girl had looked up in surprise chesterton seeing the look understood that her act trifling as it was had been sincere had been inspired simply by thought of his comfort and he asked himself why young miss armitage should consider his comfort and why the fact that she did consider it should make him so extremely happy and he decided it must be because she loved him and he loved her having arrived at that conclusion he had asked her to marry him and upon the matchbox had marked the date and the hour since then she had given him many pretty presents marked with her initials marked with his crest with strange cabalistic mottoes that meant nothing to any one save themselves but the wooden matchbox was still the most valued of his possessions as he rode into the valley the rays of the moon fell fully upon him and exposed him to the outpost as pitilessly as though he had been held in the circle of a searchlight the bronzed mausers pushed cautiously through the screen of vines there was a pause and the rifle of the sergeant wavered when he spoke his tone was one of disappointment he is a scout riding alone he said he is an officer returned the sharpshooter excitedly the others follow we should fire now and give the signal he is no officer he is a scout repeated the sergeant they have sent him ahead to study the trail and to seek us he may be a league in advance if we shoot him we only warn the others chesterton was within fifty yards after an excited and anxious search he had found the matchbox in the wrong pocket the eyes of the sharpshooter frowned along the barrel of his rifle with his chin pressed against the stock he whispered swiftly from the corner of his lips he is an officer i am aiming where the strap crosses his heart you aim at his belt we fire together the heat of the tropic night and the strenuous gallop had covered el capitan with a lather of sweat the reins upon his neck dripped with it the gauntlets with which chesterton held them were wet as he raised the matchbox it slipped from his fingers and fell noiselessly in the trail with an exclamation he dropped to the road and to his knees and groping in the dust began an eager search the sergeant caught at the rifle of the sharpshooter and pressed it down look he whispered he is a scout he is searching the trail for the tracks of our ponies if you fire they will hear it a league away but if he finds our trail and returns the sergeant shook his head i let him pass forward he said grimly he will never return chesterton pounced upon the halfburied matchbox and in a panic lest he might again lose it thrust it inside his tunic little do you know el capitan he exclaimed breathlessly as he scrambled back into the saddle and lifted the pony into a gallop what a narrow escape i had i almost lost it toward midnight they came to a wooden bridge swinging above a ravine in which a mountain stream forty feet below splashed over halfhidden rocks and the stepping stones of the ford even before the campaign began the bridge had outlived its usefulness and the unwonted burden of artillery and the vibrations of marching men had so shaken it that it swayed like a house of cards threatened by its own weight at the mercy of the first tropic storm it hung a death trap for the one who first added to its burden no sooner had el capitan struck it squarely with his four hoofs than he reared and whirling sprang back to the solid earth the suddenness of his retreat had all but thrown chesterton but he regained his seat and digging the pony roughly with his spurs pulled his head again toward the bridge what are you shying at now he panted thats a perfectly good bridge for a minute horse and man struggled for the mastery the horse spinning in short circles the man pulling tugging urging him with knees and spurs the first round ended in a draw there were two more rounds with the advantage slightly in favor of el capitan for he did not approach the bridge the night was warm and the exertion violent chesterton puzzled and annoyed paused to regain his breath and his temper below him in the ravine the shallow waters of the ford called to him suggesting a pleasant compromise he turned his eyes downward and saw hanging over the water what appeared to be a white bird upon the lower limb of a dead tree he knew it to be an orchid an especially rare orchid and he knew also that the orchid was the favorite flower of miss armitage in a moment he was on his feet and with the reins over his arm was slipping down the bank dragging el capitan behind him he ripped from the dead tree the bark to which the orchid was clinging and with wet moss and grass packed it in his leather camera case the camera he abandoned on the path he always could buy another camera he could not again carry a white orchid plucked in the heart of the tropics on the night peace was declared to the girl he left behind him followed by el capitan nosing and snuffing gratefully at the cool waters he waded the ford and with his camera case swinging from his shoulder galloped up the opposite bank and back into the trail a minute later the bridge unable to recover from the death blow struck by el capitan went whirling into the ravine and was broken upon the rocks below hearing the crash behind him chesterton guessed that in the jungle a tree had fallen they had started at six in the afternoon and had covered twenty of the forty miles that lay between adhuntas and mayaguez when just at the outskirts of the tiny village of caguan el capitan stumbled and when he arose painfully he again fell forward caguan was a little church a little vinecovered inn a dozen onestory adobe houses shining in the moonlight like whitewashed sepulchres they faced a grassgrown plaza in the centre of which stood a great wooden cross at one corner of the village was a corral and in it many ponies at the sight chesterton gave a cry of relief a light showed through the closed shutters of the inn and when he beat with his whip upon the door from the adobe houses other lights shone and whiteclad figures appeared in the moonlight the landlord of the inn was a spaniard fat and prosperouslooking but for the moment his face was eloquent with such distress and misery that the heart of the young man who was at peace with all the world went instantly out to him the spaniard was less sympathetic when he saw the khaki suit and the campaign hat he scowled and ungraciously would have closed the door chesterton apologizing pushed it open his pony he explained had gone lame and he must have another and at once the landlord shrugged his shoulders these were war times he said and the american officer could take what he liked they in caguan were noncombatants and could not protest chesterton hastened to reassure him the war he announced was over and were it not he was no officer to issue requisitions he intended to pay for the pony he unbuckled his belt and poured upon the table a handful of spanish doubloons the landlord lowered the candle and silently counted the gold pieces and then calling to him two of his fellowvillagers crossed the tiny plaza and entered the corral the american pig he whispered wishes to buy a pony he tells me the war is over that spain has surrendered we know that must be a lie it is more probable he is a deserter he claims he is a civilian but that also is a lie for he is in uniform you paul sell him your pony and then wait for him at the first turn in the trail and take it from him he is armed protested the one called paul you must not give him time to draw his revolver ordered the landlord you and pedro will shoot him from the shadow he is our countrys enemy and it will be in a good cause and he may carry despatches if we take them the commandante at mayaguez he will reward us and the gold pieces demanded the one called paul we will divide them in three parts said the landlord in the front of the inn surrounded by a ghostlike group that spoke its suspicions chesterton was lifting his saddle from el capitan and rubbing the lame foreleg it was not a serious sprain a week would set it right but for that night the pony was useless impatiently chesterton called across the plaza begging the landlord to make haste he was eager to be gone alarmed and fearful lest even this slight delay should cause him to miss the transport the thought was intolerable but he was also acutely conscious that he was very hungry and he was too old a campaigner to scoff at hunger with the hope that he could find something to carry with him and eat as he rode forward he entered the inn the main room of the house was now in darkness but a smaller room adjoining it was lit by candles and by a tiny taper floating before a crucifix in the light of the candles chesterton made out a bed a priest bending over it a woman kneeling beside it and upon the bed the little figure of a boy who tossed and moaned as chesterton halted and waited hesitating the priest strode past him and in a voice dull and flat with grief and weariness ordered those at the door to bring the landlord quickly as one of the group leaped toward the corral the priest said to the others there is another attack i have lost hope chesterton advanced and asked if he could be of service the priest shook his head the child he said was the only son of the landlord and much beloved by him and by all the village he was now in the third week of typhoid fever and the period of hemorrhages unless they could be checked the boy would die and the priest who for many miles of mountain and forest was also the only doctor had exhausted his store of simple medicines nothing can stop the hemorrhage he protested wearily but the strongest of drugs and i have nothing chesterton bethought him of the medicine case miss armitage had forced upon him i have given opium to the men for dysentery he said would opium help you the priest sprang at him and pushed him out of the door and toward the saddlebags my children he cried to the silent group in the plaza god has sent a miracle after an hour at the bedside the priest said he will live and knelt and the mother of the boy and the villagers knelt with him when chesterton raised his eyes he found that the landlord who had been silently watching while the two men struggled with death for the life of his son had disappeared but he heard leaving the village along the trail to mayaguez the sudden clatter of a ponys hoofs it moved like a thing driven with fear the priest strode out into the moonlight in the recovery of the child he saw only a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer and he could not too quickly bring home the lesson to his parishioners amid their murmurs of wonder and gratitude chesterton rode away to the kindly care of the priest he bequeathed el capitan with him also he left the gold pieces which were to pay for the fresh pony a quarter of a mile outside the village three white figures confronted him two who stood apart in the shadow shrank from observation but the landlord seated bareback upon a pony that from some late exertion was breathing heavily called to him to halt in the fashion of my country he began grandiloquently we have come this far to wish you god speed upon your journey in the fashion of the american he seized chesterton by the hand i thank you seсor he murmured not me returned chesterton but the one who made me pack that medicine chest thank her for tonight i think it saved a life the spaniard regarded him curiously fixing him with his eyes as though deep in consideration at last he smiled gravely you are right he said let us both remember her in our prayers as chesterton rode away the words remained gratefully in his memory and filled him with pleasant thoughts the world he mused is full of just such kind and gentle souls after an interminable delay he reached newport and they escaped from the others and miss armitage and he ran down the lawn to the rocks and stood with the waves whispering at their feet it was the moment for which each had so often longed with which both had so often tortured themselves by living in imagination that now that it was theirs they were fearful it might not be true finally he said and the charm never failed indeed it was wonderful it stood by me so obviously for instance the night before san juan in the mill at el poso i slept on the same poncho with another correspondent i woke up with a raging appetite for bacon and coffee and he woke up out of his mind and with a temperature of one hundred and four and again i was standing by caprons gun at el caney when a shell took the three men who served it and only scared me and there was another time he stopped anyway he laughed here i am but there was one night one awful night began the girl she trembled and he made this an added excuse for drawing her closer to him when i felt you were in great peril that you would surely die and all through the night i knelt by the window and looked toward cuba and prayed and prayed to god to let you live chesterton bent his head and kissed the tips of her fingers after a moment he said would you know what night it was it might be curious if i had been would i know cried the girl it was eight days ago the night of the twelfth an awful night the twelfth exclaimed chesterton and laughed and then begged her pardon humbly i laughed because the twelfth he exclaimed was the night peace was declared the war was over im sorry but that night i was riding toward you thinking only of you i was never for a moment in danger the amateur i it was february off the banks and so thick was the weather that on the upper decks one could have driven a sleigh inside the smokingroom austin ford as securely sheltered from the blizzard as though he had been sitting in front of a wood fire at his club ordered hot gin for himself and the ships doctor the ships doctor had gone below on another hurry call from the widow at the first luncheon on board the widow had sat on the right of doctor sparrow with austin ford facing her but since then except to the doctor she had been invisible so at frequent intervals the ill health of the widow had deprived ford of the society of the doctor that it deprived him also of the society of the widow did not concern him her life had not been spent upon ocean liners she could not remember when staterooms were named after the states of the union she could not tell him of shipwrecks and salvage of smugglers and of the modern pirates who found their victims in the smokingroom ford was on his way to england to act as the london correspondent of the new york republic for three years on that most sensational of the new york dailies he had been the star man the chief muckraker the chief sleuth his interest was in crime not in crimes committed in passion or inspired by drink but in such offences against law and society as are perpetrated with nice intelligence the murderer the burglar the strongarm men who in side streets waylay respectable citizens did not appeal to him the man he studied pursued and exposed was the cashier who evolved a new method of covering up his peculations the dishonest president of an insurance company the confidence man who used no concealed weapon other than his wit toward the criminals he pursued young ford felt no personal animosity he harassed them as he would have shot a hawk killing chickens not because he disliked the hawk but because the battle was unequal and because he felt sorry for the chickens had you called austin ford an amateur detective he would have been greatly annoyed he argued that his position was similar to that of the dramatic critic the dramatic critic warned the public against bad plays ford warned it against bad men having done that he left it to the public to determine whether the bad man should thrive or perish when the managing editor told him of his appointment to london ford had protested that his work lay in new york that of london and the english except as a tourist and sightseer he knew nothing thats just why we are sending you explained the managing editor our readers are ignorant to make them read about london youve got to tell them about themselves in london they like to know whos been presented at court about the american girls who have married dukes and which ones opened a bazaar and which one opened a hat shop and which is getting a divorce dont send us anything concerning suffragettes and dreadnaughts just send us stuff about americans if you take your meals in the carlton grillroom and drink at the cecil you can pick up more good stories than we can print you will find lots of your friends over there some of those girls who married dukes he suggested know you dont they not since they married dukes said ford well anyway all your other friends will be there continued the managing editor encouragingly now that they have shut up the tracks here all the con men have gone to london they say an american cant take a drink at the salisbury without his fellowcountrymen having a fight as to which one will sell him a gold brick fords eyes lightened in pleasurable anticipation look them over urged the managing editor and send us a special call it the american invasion dont you see a story in it it will be the first one i send you said ford the ships doctor returned from his visit below decks and sank into the leather cushion close to fords elbow for a few moments the older man sipped doubtfully at his gin and water and as though perplexed rubbed his hand over his bald and shining head i told her to talk to you he said fretfully her who inquired ford oh the widow you were right about that said doctor sparrow she is not a widow the reporter smiled complacently do you know why i thought not he demanded because all the time she was at luncheon she kept turning over her weddingring as though she was not used to it it was a new ring too i told you then she was not a widow do you always notice things like that asked the doctor not on purpose said the amateur detective i cant help it i see ten things where other people see only one just as some men run ten times as fast as other men we have tried it out often at the office put all sorts of junk under a newspaper lifted the newspaper for five seconds and then each man wrote down what he had seen out of twenty things i would remember seventeen the next best guess would be about nine once i saw a man lift his coat collar to hide his face it was in the grand central station i stopped him and told him he was wanted turned out he was wanted it was goldberg making his getaway to canada it is a gift said the doctor no its a nuisance laughed the reporter i see so many things i dont want to see i see that people are wearing clothes that are not made for them i see when women are lying to me i can see when men are on the verge of a nervous breakdown and whether it is drink or debt or morphine the doctor snorted triumphantly you did not see that the widow was on the verge of a breakdown no returned the reporter is she im sorry if youre sorry urged the doctor eagerly youll help her she is going to london alone to find her husband he has disappeared she thinks that he has been murdered or that he is lying ill in some hospital i told her if any one could help her to find him you could i had to say something shes very ill to find her husband in london repeated ford london is a large town she has photographs of him and she knows where he spends his time pleaded the doctor he is a company promoter it should be easy for you maybe he doesnt want her to find him said ford then it wouldnt be so easy for me the old doctor sighed heavily i know he murmured i thought of that too and she is so very pretty that was another thing i noticed said ford the doctor gave no heed she must stop worrying he exclaimed or she will have a mental collapse i have tried sedatives but they dont touch her i want to give her courage she is frightened shes left a baby boy at home and shes fearful that something will happen to him and shes frightened at being at sea frightened at being alone in london its pitiful the old man shook his head pitiful will you talk to her now he asked nonsense exclaimed ford she doesnt want to tell the story of her life to strange young men but it was she suggested it cried the doctor she asked me if you were austin ford the great detective ford snorted scornfully she did not he protested his tone was that of a man who hopes to be contradicted but she did insisted the doctor and i told her your specialty was tracing persons her face lightened at once it gave her hope she will listen to you speak very gently and kindly and confidently say you are sure you can find him where is the lady now asked ford doctor sparrow scrambled eagerly to his feet she cannot leave her cabin he answered the widow as ford and doctor sparrow still thought of her was lying on the sofa that ran the length of the stateroom parallel with the lower berth she was fully dressed except that instead of her bodice she wore a kimono that left her throat and arms bare she had been sleeping and when their entrance awoke her her blue eyes regarded them uncomprehendingly ford hidden from her by the doctor observed that not only was she very pretty but that she was absurdly young and that the drowsy smile she turned upon the old man before she noted the presence of ford was as innocent as that of a baby her cheeks were flushed her eyes brilliant her yellow curls had become loosened and were spread upon the pillow when she saw ford she caught the kimono so closely around her throat that she choked had the doctor not pushed her down she would have stood i thought she stammered he was an old man the doctor misunderstanding hastened to reassure her mr ford is old in experience he said soothingly he has had remarkable success why he found a criminal once just because the man wore a collar and he found walsh the burglar and phillips the forger and a gang of counterfeiters mrs ashton turned upon him her eyes wide with wonder but my husband she protested is not a criminal my dear lady the doctor cried i did not mean that of course not i meant if mr ford can find men who dont wish to be found how easy for him to find a man who he turned helplessly to ford you tell her he begged ford sat down on a steamer trunk that protruded from beneath the berth and turning to the widow gave her the full benefit of his working smile it was confiding helpless appealing it showed a trustfulness in the person to whom it was addressed that caused that individual to believe ford needed protection from a wicked world doctor sparrow tells me began ford timidly you have lost your husbands address that you will let me try to find him if i can help in any way i should be glad the young girl regarded him apparently with disappointment it was as though doctor sparrow had led her to expect a man full of years and authority a man upon whom she could lean not a youth whose smile seemed to beg one not to scold him she gave ford three photographs bound together with a string when doctor sparrow told me you could help me i got out these she said ford jotted down a mental note to the effect that she got them out that is she did not keep them where she could always look at them that she was not used to look at them was evident by the fact that they were bound together the first photograph showed three men standing in an open place and leaning on a railing one of them was smiling toward the photographer he was a goodlooking young man of about thirty years of age well fed well dressed and apparently well satisfied with the world and himself fords own smile had disappeared his eyes were alert and interested the one with the panama hat pulled down over his eyes is your husband he asked yes assented the widow her tone showed slight surprise this was taken about a year ago inquired ford must have been he answered himself they havent raced at the bay since then this was taken in front of the club stand probably for the telegraph he lifted his eyes inquiringly rising on her elbow the young wife bent forward toward the photograph does it say that there she asked doubtfully how did you guess that in his rфle as chorus the ships doctor exclaimed with enthusiasm didnt i tell you hes wonderful ford cut him off impatiently you never saw a rail as high as that except around a racetrack he muttered and the badge in his buttonhole and the angle of the stand all show he interrupted himself to address the widow this is an owners badge what was the name of his stable i dont know she answered she regarded the young man with sudden uneasiness they only owned one horse but i believe that gave them the privilege of i see exclaimed ford your husband is a bookmaker but in london he is a promoter of companies so my friend tells me said mrs ashton shes just got back from london her husband told her that harry my husband was always at the american bar in the cecil or at the salisbury or the savoy the girl shook her head but a woman cant go looking for a man there she protested thats why i thought you thatll be all right ford assured her hurriedly its a coincidence but it happens that my own work takes me to these hotels and if your husband is there i will find him he returned the photographs hadnt you better keep one she asked i wont forget him said the reporter besides he turned his eyes toward the doctor and as though thinking aloud said he may have grown a beard there was a pause the eyes of the woman grew troubled her lips pressed together as though in a sudden access of pain and he may ford continued have changed his name as though fearful if she spoke the tears would fall the girl nodded her head stiffly having learned what he wanted to know ford applied to the wound a soothing ointment of promises and encouragement hes as good as found he protested you will see him in a day two days after you land the girls eyes opened happily she clasped her hands together and raised them you will try she begged you will find him for me she corrected herself eagerly for me and the baby the loose sleeves of the kimono fell back to her shoulders showing the white arms the eyes raised to ford were glistening with tears of course i will find him growled the reporter he freed himself from the appeal in the eyes of the young mother and left the cabin the doctor followed he was bubbling over with enthusiasm that was fine he cried you said just the right thing there will be no collapse now his satisfaction was swept away in a burst of disgust the blackguard he protested to desert a wife as young as that and as pretty as that so i have been thinking said the reporter i guess he added gravely what is going to happen is that before i find her husband i will have got to know him pretty well apparently young mrs ashton believed everything would come to pass just as ford promised it would and as he chose to order it for the next day with a color not born of fever in her cheeks and courage in her eyes she joined ford and the doctor at the luncheontable her attention was concentrated on the younger man in him she saw the one person who could bring her husband to her she acts growled the doctor later in the smokingroom as though she was afraid you were going to back out of your promise and jump overboard dont think he protested violently its you shes interested in all she sees in you is what you can do for her can you see that any one as clever at seeing things as i am returned the reporter cannot help but see that later as ford was walking on the upper deck mrs ashton came toward him beating her way against the wind without a trace of coquetry or selfconsciousness and with a sigh of content she laid her hand on his arm when i dont see you she exclaimed as simply as a child i feel so frightened when i see you i know all will come right do you mind if i walk with you she asked and do you mind if every now and then i ask you to tell me again it will all come right for the three days following mrs ashton and ford were constantly together or at least mrs ashton was constantly with ford she told him that when she sat in her cabin the old fears returned to her and in these moments of panic she searched the ship for him the doctor protested that he was growing jealous im not so greatly to be envied suggested ford harry at meals three times a day and on deck all the rest of the day becomes monotonous on a closer acquaintance with harry he seems to be a decent sort of a young man at least he seems to have been at one time very much in love with her well sighed the doctor sentimentally she is certainly very much in love with harry ford shook his head noncommittingly i dont know her story he said dont want to know it the ship was in the channel on her way to cherbourg and running as smoothly as a clock from the shore friendly lights told them they were nearing their journeys end that the land was on every side seated on a steamerchair next to his in the semidarkness of the deck mrs ashton began to talk nervously and eagerly now that we are so near she murmured i have got to tell you something if you did not know i would feel i had not been fair you might think that when you were doing so much for me i should have been more honest she drew a long breath its so hard she said wait commanded ford is it going to help me to find him no then dont tell me his tone caused the girl to start she leaned toward him and peered into his face his eyes as he looked back to her were kind and comprehending you mean said the amateur detective that your husband has deserted you that if it were not for the baby you would not try to find him is that it mrs ashton breathed quickly and turned her face away yes she whispered that is it there was a long pause when she faced him again the fact that there was no longer a secret between them seemed to give her courage maybe she said you can understand maybe you can tell me what it means i have thought and thought i have gone over it and over it until when i go back to it my head aches i have done nothing else but think and i cant make it seem better i cant find any excuse i have had no one to talk to no one i could tell i have thought maybe a man could understand she raised her eyes appealingly if you can only make it seem less cruel dont you see she cried miserably i want to believe i want to forgive him i want to think he loves me oh i want so to be able to love him but how can i i cant i cant in the week in which they had been thrown together the girl unconsciously had told ford much about herself and her husband what she now told him was but an amplification of what he had guessed she had met ashton a year and a half before when she had just left school at the convent and had returned to live with her family her home was at far rockaway her father was a cashier in a bank at long island city one night with a party of friends she had been taken to a dance at one of the beach hotels and there met ashton at that time he was one of a firm that was making book at the aqueduct racetrack the girl had met very few men and with them was shy and frightened but with ashton she found herself at once at ease that night he drove her and her friends home in his touringcar and the next day they teased her about her conquest it made her very happy after that she went to hops at the hotel and as the bookmaker did not dance the two young people sat upon the piazza then ashton came to see her at her own house but when her father learned that the young man who had been calling upon her was a bookmaker he told him he could not associate with his daughter but the girl was now deeply in love with ashton and apparently he with her he begged her to marry him they knew that to this partly from prejudice and partly owing to his position in the bank her father would object accordingly they agreed that in august when the racing moved to saratoga they would run away and get married at that place their plan was that ashton would leave for saratoga with the other racing men and that she would join him the next day they had arranged to be married by a magistrate and ashton had shown her a letter from one at saratoga who consented to perform the ceremony he had given her an engagement ring and two thousand dollars which he asked her to keep for him lest tempted at the track he should lose it but she assured ford it was not such material things as a letter a ring or gift of money that had led her to trust ashton his fear of losing her his complete subjection to her wishes his happiness in her presence all seemed to prove that to make her happy was his one wish and that he could do anything to make her unhappy appeared impossible they were married the morning she arrived at saratoga and the same day departed for niagara falls and quebec the honeymoon lasted ten days they were ten days of complete happiness no one so the girl declared could have been more kind more unselfishly considerate than her husband they returned to saratoga and engaged a suite of rooms at one of the big hotels ashton was not satisfied with the rooms shown him and leaving her upstairs returned to the office floor to ask for others since that moment his wife had never seen him nor heard from him on the day of her marriage young mrs ashton had written to her father asking him to give her his good wishes and pardon he refused both as she had feared he did not consider that for a bank clerk a gambler made a desirable soninlaw and the letters he wrote his daughter were so bitter that in reply she informed him he had forced her to choose between her family and her husband and that she chose her husband in consequence when she found herself deserted she felt she could not return to her people she remained in saratoga there she moved into cheap lodgings and in order that the two thousand dollars ashton had left with her might be saved for his child she had learned to typewrite and after four months had been able to support herself within the last month a girl friend who had known both ashton and herself before they were married had written her that her husband was living in london for the sake of her son she had at once determined to make an effort to seek him out the son nonsense exclaimed the doctor when ford retold the story she is not crossing the ocean because she is worried about the future of her son she seeks her own happiness the woman is in love with her husband ford shook his head i dont know he objected shes so extravagant in her praise of harry that it seems unreal it sounds insincere then again when i swear i will find him she shows a delight that you might describe as savage almost vindictive as though if i did find harry the first thing she would do would be to stick a knife in him maybe volunteered the doctor sadly she has heard there is a woman in the case maybe she is the one shes thinking of sticking the knife into well declared the reporter if she doesnt stop looking savage every time i promise to find harry i wont find harry why should i act the part of fate anyway how do i know that harry hasnt got a wife in london and several in the states how do we know he didnt leave his country for his countrys good thats what it looks like to me how can we tell what confronted him the day he went down to the hotel desk to change his rooms and instead got into his touringcar and beat the speed limit to canada whom did he meet in the hotel corridor a woman with a perfectly good marriage certificate or a detective with a perfectly good warrant or did harry find out that his bride had a devil of a temper of her own and that for him marriage was a failure the widow is certainly a very charming young woman but there may be two sides to this you are a cynic sir protested the doctor that may be growled the reporter but i am not a private detective agency or a matrimonial bureau and before i hear myself saying bless you my children both of these young people will have to show me why they should not be kept asunder ii on the afternoon of their arrival in london ford convoyed mrs ashton to an oldestablished private hotel in craven street here he explained you will be within a few hundred yards of the place in which your husband is said to spend his time i will be living in the same hotel if i find him you will know it in ten minutes the widow gave a little gasp whether of excitement or of happiness ford could not determine whatever happens she begged will you let me hear from you sometimes you are the only person i know in london and its so big it frightens me i dont want to be a burden she went on eagerly but if i can feel you are within call what you need said ford heartily is less of the doctors nerve tonic and sleeping draughts and a little innocent diversion tonight i am going to take you to the savoy to supper mrs ashton exclaimed delightedly and then was filled with misgivings i have nothing to wear she protested and over here in the evening the women dress so well i have a dinner gown she exclaimed but its black would that do ford assured her nothing could be better he had a mans vanity in liking a woman with whom he was seen in public to be pretty and smartly dressed and he felt sure that in black the blond beauty of mrs ashton would appear to advantage they arranged to meet at eleven on the promenade leading to the savoy supperroom and parted with mutual satisfaction at the prospect the finding of harry ashton was so simple that in its very simplicity it appeared spectacular on leaving mrs ashton ford engaged rooms at the hotel cecil before visiting his rooms he made his way to the american bar he did not go there seeking harry ashton his object was entirely selfcentred his purpose was to drink to himself and to the lights of london but as though by appointment the man he had promised to find was waiting for him as ford entered the room at a table facing the door sat ashton there was no mistaking him he wore a mustache but it was disguise he was the same goodnatured goodlooking youth who in the photograph from under a panama hat had smiled upon the world with a glad cry ford rushed toward him fancy meeting you he exclaimed mr ashtons goodnatured smile did not relax he merely shook his head afraid you have made a mistake he said the reporter regarded him blankly his face showed his disappointment arent you charles w garrett of new york he demanded not me said mr ashton but ford insisted in hurt tones as though he were being trifled with you have been told you look like him havent you mr ashtons good nature was unassailable sorry he declared never heard of him ford became garrulous he could not believe two men could look so much alike it was a remarkable coincidence the stranger must certainly have a drink the drink intended for his twin ashton was bored but accepted he was well acquainted with the easy goodfellowship of his countrymen the room in which he sat was a meetingplace for them he considered that they were always giving each other drinks and not only were they always introducing themselves but saying shake hands with my friend mr soandso after five minutes they showed each other photographs of the children this one though as loquacious as the others seemed better dressed more wise he brought to the exile the atmosphere of his beloved broadway so ashton drank to him pleasantly my name is sydney carter he volunteered as a pokerplayer skims over the cards in his hand ford in his minds eye ran over the value of giving or not giving his right name he decided that ashton would not have heard it and that if he gave a false one there was a chance that later ashton might find out that he had done so accordingly he said mine is austin ford and seated himself at ashtons table within ten minutes the man he had promised to pluck from among the eight million inhabitants of london was smiling sympathetically at his jests and buying a drink on the steamer ford had rehearsed the story with which should he meet ashton he would introduce himself it was one arranged to fit with his theory that ashton was a crook if ashton were a crook ford argued that to at once ingratiate himself in his good graces he also must be a crook his plan was to invite ashton to cooperate with him in some scheme that was openly dishonest by so doing he hoped apparently to place himself at ashtons mercy he believed if he could persuade ashton he was more of a rascal than ashton himself and an exceedingly stupid rascal any distrust the bookmaker might feel toward him would disappear he made his advances so openly and apparently showed his hand so carelessly that from being bored ashton became puzzled then interested and when ford insisted he should dine with him he considered it so necessary to find out who the youth might be who was forcing himself upon him that he accepted the invitation they adjourned to dress and an hour later at fords suggestion they met at the carlton there ford ordered a dinner calculated to lull his newly made friend into a mood suited to confidence but which had on ashton exactly the opposite effect merely for the pleasure of his company utter strangers were not in the habit of treating him to strawberries in february and vintage champagne and in consequence in fords hospitality he saw only cause for suspicion if as he had first feared ford was a new york detective it was most important he should know that no one better than ashton understood that at that moment his presence in new york meant for the police unalloyed satisfaction and for himself undisturbed solitude but ford was unlike any detective of his acquaintance and his acquaintance had been extensive it was true ford was familiar with all the habits of broadway and the tenderloin of places with which ashton was intimate and of men with whom ashton had formerly been well acquainted he talked glibly but if he were a detective ashton considered they certainly had improved the class the restaurant into which for the first time ashton had penetrated and in which he felt ill at ease was to ford he observed a matter of course evidently for ford it held no terrors he criticised the service patronized the head waiters and grumbled at the food and when on leaving the restaurant an englishman and his wife stopped at their table to greet him he accepted their welcome to london without embarrassment ashton rolling his cigar between his lips observed the incident with increasing bewilderment youve got some swell friends he growled ill bet you never met them at healeys i meet all kinds of people in my business said ford i once sold that man some mining stock and the joke of it was he added smiling knowingly it turned out to be good ashton decided that the psychological moment had arrived what is your business he asked im a company promoter said ford easily i thought i told you i did not tell you that i was a company promoter too did i demanded ashton no answered ford with apparent surprise are you thats funny ashton watched for the next move but the subject seemed in no way to interest ford instead of following it up he began afresh have you any money lying idle he asked abruptly about a thousand pounds ashton recognized that the mysterious stranger was about to disclose both himself and whatever object he had in seeking him out he cast a quick glance about him i can always find money he said guardedly whats the proposition with pretended nervousness ford leaned forward and began the story he had rehearsed it was a new version of an old swindle and to every selfrespecting confidence man was well known as the sick engineer game the plot is very simple the sick engineer is supposed to be a mining engineer who as an expert has examined a gold mine and reported against it for his services the company paid him partly in stock he falls ill and is at the point of death while he has been ill much gold has been found in the mine he examined and the stock which he considers worthless is now valuable of this owing to his illness he is ignorant one confidence man acts the part of the sick engineer and the other that of a broker who knows the engineer possesses the stock but has no money with which to purchase it from him for a share of the stock he offers to tell the dupe where it and the engineer can be found they visit the man apparently at the point of death and the dupe gives him money for his stock later the dupe finds the stock is worthless and the supposed engineer and the supposed broker divide the money he paid for it in telling the story ford pretended he was the broker and that he thought in ashton he had found a dupe who would buy the stock from the sick engineer as the story unfolded and ashton appreciated the part ford expected him to play in it his emotions were so varied that he was in danger of apoplexy amusement joy chagrin and indignation illuminated his countenance his cigar ceased to burn and with his eyes opened wide he regarded ford in pitying wonder wait he commanded he shook his head uncomprehendingly tell me he asked do i look as easy as that or are you just naturally foolish ford pretended to fall into a state of great alarm i dont understand he stammered why son exclaimed ashton kindly i was taught that story in the public schools i invented it i stopped using it before you cut your teeth gee he exclaimed delightedly i knew i had grown respectablelooking but i didnt think i was so damned respectablelooking as that he began to laugh silently so greatly was he amused that the tears shone in his eyes and his shoulders shook im sorry for you son he protested but thats the funniest thing thats come my way in two years and you buying me hothouse grapes too and fancy water i wish you could see your face he taunted ford pretended to be greatly chagrined all right he declared roughly the laughs on me this time but just because i lost one trick dont think i dont know my business now that im wise to what you are we can work together and illustration do i look as easy as that or are you just naturally foolish the face of young mr ashton became instantly grave his jaws snapped like a trap when he spoke his tone was assured and slightly contemptuous not with me you cant work he said dont think because i fell down on this ford began hotly im not thinking of you at all said ashton youre a nice little fellow all right but you have sized me up wrong i am on the straight and narrow that leads back to little old new york and gods country and i am warranted not to run off my trolley the words were in the vernacular but the tone in which the young man spoke rang so confidently that it brought to ford a pleasant thrill of satisfaction from the first he had found in the personality of the young man something winning and likable a shrewd manliness and tolerant goodhumor his eyes may have shown his sympathy for in sudden confidence ashton leaned nearer its like this he said several years ago i made a bad break and about a year later they got on to me and i had to cut and run in a month the law of limitation lets me loose and i can go back and you can bet im going back i will be on the bowsprit of the first boat ive had all i want of the fugitivefromjustice game thank you and i have taken good care to keep a clean bill of health so that i wont have to play it again theyve been trying to get me for several years especially the pinkertons they have chased me all over europe chased me with all kinds of men sometimes with women theyve tried everything except bloodhounds at first i thought you were a pink thats why i interrupted ford exploding derisively thats good thats one on you he ceased laughing and regarded ashton kindly how do you know im not he asked for an instant the face of the bookmaker grew a shade less red and his eyes searched those of ford in a quick agony of suspicion ford continued to smile steadily at him and ashton breathed with relief ill take a chance with you he said and if you are as bad a detective as you are a sport i neednt worry they both laughed and with sudden mutual liking each raised his glass and nodded but they havent got me yet continued ashton and unless they get me in the next thirty days im free so you neednt think that ill help you its never again for me the first time that was the fault of the crowd i ran with the second time that would be my fault and there aint going to be any second time he shook his head doggedly and with squared shoulders leaned back in his chair if it only breaks right for me he declared ill settle down in one of those ownyourownhomes fortyfive minutes from broadway and never leave the wife and the baby the words almost brought ford to his feet he had forgotten the wife and the baby he endeavored to explain his surprise by a sudden assumption of incredulity fancy you married he exclaimed married protested ashton im married to the finest little lady that ever wore skirts and in thirtyseven days ill see her again thirtyseven days he repeated impatiently gee thats a hell of a long time ford studied the young man with increased interest that he was speaking sincerely from the heart there seemed no possible doubt ashton frowned and his face clouded ive not been able to treat her just right he volunteered if she wrote me the letters might give them a clew and i dont write her because i dont want her to know all my troubles until theyre over but i know he added that five minutes talk will set it all right that is if she still feels about me the way i feel about her the man crushed his cigar in his fingers and threw the pieces on the floor thats whats been the worst he exclaimed bitterly not hearing not knowing its been hell his eyes as he raised them were filled with suffering deep and genuine ford rose suddenly lets go down to the savoy for supper he said supper growled ashton whats the use of supper do you suppose cold chicken and a sardine can keep me from thinking ford placed his hand on the others shoulder you come with me he said kindly im going to do you a favor im going to bring you a piece of luck dont ask me any questions he commanded hurriedly just take my word for it they had sat so late over their cigars that when they reached the restaurant on the embankment the supperroom was already partly filled and the corridors and lounge were brilliantly lit and gay with welldressed women ashton regarded the scene with gloomy eyes since he had spoken of his wife he had remained silent chewing savagely on a fresh cigar but ford was grandly excited he did not know exactly what he intended to do he was prepared to let events direct themselves but of two things he was assured mrs ashton loved her husband and her husband loved her as the god in the car who was to bring them together he felt a delightful responsibility the young men left the coatroom and came down the short flight of steps that leads to the wide lounge of the restaurant ford slightly in advance searching with his eyes for mrs ashton found her seated alone in the lounge evidently waiting for him at the first glance she was hardly to be recognized her lowcut dinner gown of black satin that clung to her like a wet bath robe was the last word of the new fashion and since ford had seen her her blond hair had been arranged by an artist her appearance was smart elegant daring she was easily the prettiest and most strikinglooking woman in the room and for an instant ford stood gazing at her trying to find in the selfpossessed young woman the deserted wife of the steamer she did not see ford her eyes were following the progress down the hall of a woman and her profile was toward him the thought of the happiness he was about to bring to two young people gave ford the sense of a genuine triumph and when he turned to ashton to point out his wife to him he was thrilling with pride and satisfaction his triumph received a bewildering shock already ashton had discovered the presence of mrs ashton he was standing transfixed lost to his surroundings devouring her with his eyes and then to the amazement of ford his eyes filled with fear doubt and anger swiftly with the movement of a man ducking a blow he turned and sprang up the stairs and into the coatroom ford bewildered and more conscious of his surroundings followed him less quickly and was in consequence only in time to see ashton dragging his overcoat behind him disappear into the courtyard he seized his own coat and raced in pursuit as he ran into the courtyard ashton in the strand was just closing the door of a taxicab but before the chauffeur could free it from the surrounding traffic ford had dragged the door open and leaped inside ashton was huddled in the corner panting his face pale with alarm illustration she was easily the prettiest and most strikinglooking woman in the room what the devil ails you roared ford are you trying to shake me youve got to come back you must speak to her speak to her repeated ashton his voice was sunk to a whisper the look of alarm in his face was confused with one grim and menacing did you know she was there he demanded softly did you take me there knowing of course i knew protested ford shes been looking for you his voice subsided in a squeak of amazement and pain ashtons left hand had shot out and swiftly seized his throat with the other he pressed an automatic revolver against fords shirt front i know shes been looking for me the man whispered thickly for two years shes been looking for me i know all about her but who in hell are you ford gasping and gurgling protested loyally you are wrong he cried shes been at home waiting for you she thinks you have deserted her and your baby i tell you she loves you you fool she loves you the fingers on his throat suddenly relaxed the flaming eyes of ashton glaring into his wavered and grew wide with amazement loves me he whispered who loves me your wife protested ford the girl at the savoy your wife again the fingers of ashton pressed deep around his neck that is not my wife he whispered his voice was unpleasantly cold and grim thats baby belle with her hair dyed a detective lady of the pinkertons hired to find me and you know it now who are you to permit him to reply ashton released his hand but at the same moment in a sudden access of fear dug the revolver deeper into the pit of fords stomach quick he commanded never mind the girl who are you ford collapsed against the cushioned corner of the cab and she begged me to find you he roared because she loved you because she wanted to believe in you he held his arms above his head go ahead and shoot he cried you want to know who i am he demanded his voice rang with rage im an amateur just a natural born foolamateur go on and shoot the gun in ashtons hand sank to his knee between doubt and laughter his face was twisted in strange lines the cab was whirling through a narrow unlit street leading to covent garden opening the door ashton called to the chauffeur and then turned to ford you get off here he commanded maybe youre a pink maybe youre a good fellow i think youre a good fellow but im not taking any chances get out ford scrambled to the street and as the taxicab again butted itself forward ashton leaned far through the window goodby son he called send me a picturepostal card to paris for i am off to maxims he cried and you can go to not at all shouted the amateur detective indignantly im going back to take supper with baby belle the makebelieve man i i had made up my mind that when my vacation came i would spend it seeking adventures i have always wished for adventures but though i am old enough i was twentyfive last october and have always gone halfway to meet them adventures avoid me kinney says it is my fault he holds that if you want adventures you must go after them kinney sits next to me at joyce carboys the woollen manufacturers where i am a stenographer and kinney is a clerk and we both have rooms at mrs shaws boardinghouse kinney is only a year older than myself but he is always meeting with adventures at night when i have sat up late reading law so that i may fit myself for court reporting and in the hope that some day i may become a member of the bar he will knock at my door and tell me some surprising thing that has just happened to him sometimes he has followed a fireengine and helped people from a fireescape or he has pulled the shield off a policeman or at the bar of the hotel knickerbocker has made friends with a stranger who turns out to be no less than a nobleman or an actor and women especially beautiful women are always pursuing kinney in taxicabs and calling upon him for assistance just to look at kinney without knowing how clever he is at getting people out of their difficulties he does not appear to be a man to whom you would turn in time of trouble you would think women in distress would appeal to some one bigger and stronger would sooner ask a policeman but on the contrary it is to kinney that women always run especially as i have said beautiful women nothing of the sort ever happens to me i suppose as kinney says it is because he was born and brought up in new york city and looks and acts like a new york man while i until a year ago have always lived at fairport fairport is a very pretty harbor but it does not train one for adventures we arranged to take our vacation at the same time and together at least kinney so arranged it i see a good deal of him and in looking forward to my vacation not the least pleasant feature of it was that everything connected with joyce carboy and mrs shaws boardinghouse would be left behind me but when kinney proposed we should go together i could not see how without being rude i could refuse his company and when he pointed out that for an expedition in search of adventure i could not select a better guide i felt that he was right sometimes he said i can see you dont believe that half the things i tell you have happened to me really have happened now isnt that so to find the answer that would not hurt his feelings i hesitated but he did not wait for my answer he seldom does well on this trip he went on you will see kinney on the job you wont have to take my word for it you will see adventures walk up and eat out of my hand our vacation came on the first of september but we began to plan for it in april and up to the night before we left new york we never ceased planning our difficulty was that having been brought up at fairport which is on the sound north of new london i was homesick for a smell of salt marshes and for the sight of water and ships though they were only schooners carrying cement i wanted to sit in the sun on the stringpiece of a wharf and watch them i wanted to beat about the harbor in a catboat and feel the tug and pull of the tiller kinney protested that that was no way to spend a vacation or to invite adventure his face was set against fairport the conversation of clamdiggers he said did not appeal to him and he complained that at fairport our only chance of adventure would be my capsizing the catboat or robbing a lobsterpot he insisted we should go to the mountains where we would meet what he always calls our best people in september he explained everybody goes to the mountains to recuperate after the enervating atmosphere of the seashore to this i objected that the little sea air we had inhaled at mrs shaws basement diningroom and in the subway need cause us no anxiety and so along these lines throughout the sleepless sultry nights of june july and august we fought it out there was not a summer resort within five hundred miles of new york city we did not consider from the information bureaus and passenger agents of every railroad leaving new york kinney procured a library of timetables maps folders and pamphlets illustrated with the most attractive pictures of summer hotels golf links tennis courts and boathouses for two months he carried on a correspondence with the proprietors of these hotels and in comparing the different prices they asked him for suites of rooms and sun parlors derived constant satisfaction the outlook house he would announce wants twentyfour dollars a day for bedroom parlor and private bath while for the same accommodations the carteret arms asks only twenty but the carteret has no tennis court and then again the outlook has no garage nor are dogs allowed in the bedrooms as kinney could not play lawn tennis and as neither of us owned an automobile or a dog or twentyfour dollars these details to me seemed superfluous but there was no health in pointing that out to kinney because as he himself says he has so vivid an imagination that what he lacks he can make believe he has and the pleasure of possession is his kinney gives a great deal of thought to his clothes and the question of what he should wear on his vacation was upon his mind when i said i thought it was nothing to worry about he snorted indignantly you wouldnt he said if id been brought up in a catboat and had a tan like a red indian and hair like a broadway blonde i wouldnt worry either mrs shaw says you look exactly like a british peer in disguise i had never seen a british peer with or without his disguise and i admit i was interested why are the girls in this house demanded kinney always running to your room to borrow matches because they admire your clothes if theyre crazy about clothes why dont they come to me for matches you are always out at night i said you know thats not the answer he protested why do the typewriter girls at the office always go to you to sharpen their pencils and tell them how to spell the hard words why do the girls in the lunchrooms serve you first because theyre hypnotized by your clothes is that it do they i asked i hadnt noticed kinney snorted and tossed up his arms he hadnt noticed he kept repeating he hadnt noticed for his vacation kinney bought a secondhand suitcase it was covered with labels of hotels in france and switzerland joe i said if you carry that bag you will be a walking falsehood kinneys name is joseph forbes kinney he dropped the joseph because he said it did not appear often enough in the social register and could be found only in the old testament and he has asked me to call him forbes having first known him as joe i occasionally forget my name is not joe he said sternly and i have as much right to carry a secondhand bag as a new one the bag says it has been to europe it does not say that i have been there but you probably will i pointed out and then some one who has really visited those places listen commanded kinney if you want adventures you must be somebody of importance no one will go shares in an adventure with joe kinney a twentydollaraweek clerk the human adding machine the hallroom boy but forbes kinney esq with a bag from europe and a harvard ribbon round his hat is that a harvard ribbon round your hat i asked it is declared kinney and i have a yale ribbon and a turf club ribbon too they come on hooks and you hook em on to match your clothes or the company you keep and whats more he continued with some heat ive borrowed a tennis racket and a golf bag full of sticks and you take care you dont give me away i see i returned that you are going to get us into a lot of trouble i was thinking said kinney looking at me rather doubtfully it might help a lot if for the first week you acted as my secretary and during the second week i was your secretary sometimes when mr joyce goes on a business trip he takes me with him as his private stenographer and the change from office work is very pleasant but i could not see why i should spend one week of my holiday writing letters for kinney you wouldnt write any letters he explained but if i could tell people you were my private secretary it would naturally give me a certain importance if it will make you any happier i said you can tell people i am a british peer in disguise there is no use in being nasty about it protested kinney i am only trying to show you a way that would lead to adventure it surely would i assented it would lead us to jail the last week in august came and as to where we were to go we still were undecided i suggested we leave it to chance the first thing i pointed out is to get away from this awful city the second thing is to get away cheaply let us write down the names of the summer resorts to which we can travel by rail or by boat for two dollars and put them in a hat the name of the place we draw will be the one for which we start saturday afternoon the idea i urged is in itself full of adventure kinney agreed but reluctantly what chiefly disturbed him was the thought that the places near new york to which one could travel for so little money were not likely to be fashionable i have a terrible fear he declared that with this limit of yours we will wake up in asbury park friday night came and found us prepared for departure and at midnight we held our lottery in a pillowcase we placed twenty slips of paper on each of which was written the name of a summer resort ten of these places were selected by kinney and ten by myself kinney dramatically rolled up his sleeve and plunging his bared arm into our grabbag drew out a slip of paper and read aloud new bedford via new bedford steamboat line the choice was one of mine new bedford shouted kinney his tone expressed the keenest disappointment its a mill town he exclaimed its full of cotton mills that may be i protested but its also a most picturesque old seaport one of the oldest in america you can see whaling vessels at the wharfs there and wooden figureheads and harpoons is this an expedition to dig up buried cities interrupted kinney or a pleasure trip i dont want to see harpoons i wouldnt know a harpoon if you stuck one into me i prefer to see hatpins the patience did not sail until six oclock but we were so anxious to put new york behind us that at five we were on board our cabin was an outside one with two berths after placing our suitcases in it we collected campchairs and settled ourselves in a cool place on the boat deck kinney had bought all the afternoon papers and as later i had reason to remember was greatly interested over the fact that the young earl of ivy had at last arrived in this country for some weeks the papers had been giving more space than seemed necessary to that young irishman and to the young lady he was coming over to marry there had been pictures of his different country houses pictures of himself in uniform in the robes he wore at the coronation on a polo pony as master of foxhounds and there had been pictures of miss aldrich and of her country places at newport and on the hudson from the afternoon papers kinney learned that having sailed under his family name of meehan the young man and lady moya his sister had that morning landed in new york but before the reporters had discovered them had escaped from the wharf and disappeared inquiries at the different hotels read kinney impressively failed to establish the whereabouts of his lordship and lady moya and it is believed they at once left by train for newport with awe kinney pointed at the red funnels of the mauretania there is the boat that brought them to america he said i see he added that in this picture of him playing golf he wears one of those knit jackets the eiselbaum has just marked down to three dollars and seventyfive cents i wish he added regretfully you can get one at new bedford i suggested i wish he continued we had gone to newport all of our best people will be there for the wedding it is the most important social event of the season you might almost call it an alliance i went forward to watch them take on the freight and kinney stationed himself at the rail above the passengers gangway where he could see the other passengers arrive he had dressed himself with much care and was wearing his yale hatband but when a very smartlooking youth came up the gangplank wearing a harvard ribbon kinney hastily retired to our cabin and returned with one like it a few minutes later i found him and the young man seated in campchairs side by side engaged in a conversation in which kinney seemed to bear the greater part indeed to what kinney was saying the young man paid not the slightest attention instead his eyes were fastened on the gangplank below and when a young man of his own age accompanied by a girl in a dress of rough tweed appeared upon it he leaped from his seat then with a conscious look at kinney sank back the girl in the tweed suit was sufficiently beautiful to cause any man to rise and to remain standing she was the most beautiful girl i had ever seen she had gray eyes and hair like goldenrod worn in a fashion with which i was not familiar and her face was so lovely that in my surprise at the sight of it i felt a sudden catch at my throat and my heart stopped with awe and wonder and gratitude after a brief moment the young man in the real harvard hatband rose restlessly and with a nod to kinney went below i also rose and followed him i had an uncontrollable desire to again look at the girl with the goldenrod hair i did not mean that she should see me never before had i done such a thing but never before had i seen any one who had moved me so strangely seeking her i walked the length of the main saloon and back again but could not find her the delay gave me time to see that my conduct was impertinent the very fact that she was so lovely to look upon should have been her protection it afforded me no excuse to follow and spy upon her with this thought i hastily returned to the upper deck to bury myself in my book if it did not serve to keep my mind from the young lady at least i would prevent my eyes from causing her annoyance i was about to take the chair that the young man had left vacant when kinney objected he was very much interested in our conversation kinney said and he may return i had not noticed any eagerness on the part of the young man to talk to kinney or to listen to him but i did not sit down i should not be surprised a bit said kinney if that young man is no end of a swell he is a harvard man and his manner was most polite that explained kinney is one way you can always tell a real swell theyre not high and mighty with you their social position is so secure that they can do as they like for instance did you notice that he smoked a pipe i said i had not noticed it for his holiday kinney had purchased a box of cigars of a quality more expensive than those he can usually afford he was smoking one of them at the moment and as it grew less had been carefully moving the gold band with which it was encircled from the lighted end but as he spoke he regarded it apparently with distaste and then dropped it overboard keep my chair he said rising i am going to my cabin to get my pipe i sat down and fastened my eyes upon my book but neither did i understand what i was reading nor see the printed page instead before my eyes confusing and blinding me was the lovely radiant face of the beautiful lady in perplexity i looked up and found her standing not two feet from me something pulled me out of my chair something made me move it toward her i lifted my hat and backed away but the eyes of the lovely lady halted me to my perplexity her face expressed both surprise and pleasure it was as though either she thought she knew me or that i reminded her of some man she did know were the latter the case he must have been a friend for the way in which she looked at me was kind and there was besides the expression of surprise and as though something she saw pleased her maybe it was the quickness with which i had offered my chair still looking at me she pointed to one of the skyscrapers could you tell me she asked the name of that building had her question not proved it her voice would have told me not only that she was a stranger but that she was irish it was particularly soft low and vibrant it made the commonplace question she asked sound as though she had sung it i told her the name of the building and that farther uptown as she would see when we moved into midstream there was another still taller she listened regarding me brightly as though interested but before her i was embarrassed and fearing i intruded i again made a movement to go away with another question she stopped me i could see no reason for her doing so but it was almost as though she had asked the question only to detain me what is that odd boat she said pumping water into the river i explained that it was a fireboat testing her hoselines and then as we moved into the channel i gained courage and found myself pointing out the statue of liberty governors island and the brooklyn bridge the fact that it was a stranger who was talking did not seem to disturb her i cannot tell how she conveyed the idea but i soon felt that she felt no matter what unconventional thing she chose to do people would not be rude or misunderstand i considered telling her my name at first it seemed that that would be more polite then i saw to do so would be forcing myself upon her that she was interested in me only as a guide to new york harbor when we passed the brooklyn navy yard i talked so much and so eagerly of the battleships at anchor there that the lady must have thought i had followed the sea for she asked are you a sailorman it was the first question that was in any way personal i used to sail a catboat i said my answer seemed to puzzle her and she frowned then she laughed delightedly like one having made a discovery you dont say sailorman she said what do you ask over here when you want to know if a man is in the navy she spoke as though we were talking a different language we ask if he is in the navy i answered she laughed again at that quite as though i had said something clever and you are not no i said i am in joyce carboys office i am a stenographer again my answer seemed both to puzzle and to surprise her she regarded me doubtfully i could see that she thought for some reason i was misleading her in an office she repeated then as though she had caught me she said how do you keep so fit she asked the question directly as a man would have asked it and as she spoke i was conscious that her eyes were measuring me and my shoulders as though she were wondering to what weight i could strip its only lately ive worked in an office i said before that i always worked outofdoors oystering and clamming and in the fall scalloping and in the summer i played ball on a hotel nine i saw that to the beautiful lady my explanation carried no meaning whatsoever but before i could explain the young man with whom she had come on board walked toward us neither did he appear to find in her talking to a stranger anything embarrassing he halted and smiled his smile was pleasant but entirely vague in the few minutes i was with him i learned that it was no sign that he was secretly pleased it was merely his expression it was as though a photographer had said smile please and he had smiled when he joined us out of deference to the young lady i raised my hat but the youth did not seem to think that outward show of respect was necessary and kept his hands in his pockets neither did he cease smoking his first remark to the lovely lady somewhat startled me have you got a brass bed in your room he asked the beautiful lady said she had sove i said the young man they do you rather well dont they and its only three dollars how much is that four times three would be twelve said the lady twelve shillings the young man was smoking a cigarette in a long amber cigaretteholder i never had seen one so long he examined the end of his cigaretteholder and apparently surprised and relieved at finding a cigarette there again smiled contentedly the lovely lady pointed at the marble shaft rising above madison square that is the tallest skyscraper she said in new york i had just informed her of that fact the young man smiled as though he were being introduced to the building but exhibited no interest is it he remarked his tone seemed to show that had she said that is a rabbit he would have been equally gratified some day he stated with the same startling abruptness with which he had made his first remark our warships will lift the roofs off those skyscrapers the remark struck me in the wrong place it was unnecessary already i resented the manner of the young man toward the lovely lady it seemed to me lacking in courtesy he knew her and yet treated her with no deference while i a stranger felt so grateful to her for being what i knew one with such a face must be that i could have knelt at her feet so i rather resented the remark if the warships you send over here i said doubtfully arent more successful in lifting things than your yachts youd better keep them at home and save coal seldom have i made so long a speech or so rude a speech and as soon as i had spoken on account of the lovely lady i was sorry but after a pause of half a second she laughed delightedly i see she cried as though it were a sort of a game he means lipton we cant lift the cup we cant lift the roofs dont you see stumps she urged in spite of my rude remark the young man she called stumps had continued to smile happily now his expression changed to one of discomfort and utter gloom and then broke out into a radiant smile i say he cried thats awfully good if your warships arent any better at lifting things oh i say really he protested thats awfully good he seemed to be afraid i would not appreciate the rare excellence of my speech you know really he pleaded it is awfully good we were interrupted by the sudden appearance in opposite directions of kinney and the young man with the real hatband both were excited and disturbed at the sight of the young man stumps turned appealingly to the goldenrod girl he groaned aloud and his expression was that of a boy who had been caught playing truant oh lord he exclaimed whats he huffy about now he told me i could come on deck as soon as we started the girl turned upon me a sweet and lovely smile and nodded then with stumps at her side she moved to meet the young man when he saw them coming he halted and when they joined him began talking earnestly almost angrily as he did so much to my bewilderment he glared at me at the same moment kinney grabbed me by the arm come below he commanded his tone was hoarse and thrilling with excitement our adventures he whispered have begun ii i felt for me adventures had already begun for my meeting with the beautiful lady was the event of my life and though kinney and i had agreed to share our adventures of this one i knew i could not even speak to him i wanted to be alone where i could delight in it where i could go over what she had said what i had said i would share it with no one it was too wonderful too sacred but kinney would not be denied he led me to our cabin and locked the door i am sorry he began but this adventure is one i cannot share with you the remark was so in keeping with my own thoughts that with sudden unhappy doubt i wondered if kinney too had felt the charm of the beautiful lady but he quickly undeceived me i have been doing a little detective work he said his voice was low and sepulchral and i have come upon a real adventure there are reasons why i cannot share it with you but as it develops you can follow it about half an hour ago he explained i came here to get my pipe the window was open the lattice was only partly closed outside was that young man from harvard who tried to make my acquaintance and the young englishman who came on board with that blonde kinney suddenly interrupted himself you were talking to her just now he said i hated to hear him speak of the irish lady as that blonde i hated to hear him speak of her at all so to shut him off i answered briefly she asked me about the singer building i see said kinney well these two men were just outside my window and while i was searching for my pipe i heard the american speaking he was very excited and angry i tell you he said every boat and railroad station is watched you wont be safe till we get away from new york you must go to your cabin and stay there and the other one answered i am sick of hiding and dodging kinney paused dramatically and frowned well i asked what of it what of it he cried he exclaimed aloud with pity and impatience no wonder he cried you never have adventures why its plain as print they are criminals escaping the englishman certainly is escaping i was concerned only for the lovely lady but i asked you mean the irishman called stumps stumps exclaimed kinney what a strange name too strange to be true its an alias i was incensed that kinney should charge the friends of the lovely lady with being criminals had it been any one else i would have at once resented it but to be angry with kinney is difficult i could not help but remember that he is the slave of his own imagination it plays tricks and runs away with him and if it leads him to believe innocent people are criminals it also leads him to believe that every woman in the subway to whom he gives his seat is a great lady a leader of society on her way to work in the slums joe i protested those men arent criminals i talked to that irishman and he hasnt sense enough to be a criminal the railroads are watched repeated kinney do honest men care a darn whether the railroad is watched or not do you care do i care and did you notice how angry the american got when he found stumps talking with you i had noticed it and i also recalled the fact that stumps had said to the lovely lady he told me i could come on deck as soon as we started the words seemed to bear out what kinney claimed he had overheard but not wishing to encourage him of what i had heard i said nothing he may be dodging a summons i suggested he is wanted probably only as a witness it might be a civil suit or his chauffeur may have hit somebody kinney shook his head sadly excuse me he said but i fear you lack imagination those men are rascals dangerous rascals and the woman is their accomplice what they have done i dont know but i have already learned enough to arrest them as suspicious characters listen each of them has a separate stateroom forward the window of the americans room was open and his suitcase was on the bed on it were the initials hpa the stateroom is number twentyfour but when i examined the pursers list pretending i wished to find out if a friend of mine was on board i found that the man in twentyfour had given his name as james preston now he demanded why should one of them hide under an alias and the other be afraid to show himself until we leave the wharf he did not wait for my answer i have been talking to mr hpa alias preston he continued i pretended i was a person of some importance i hinted i was rich my object kinney added hastily was to encourage him to try some of his tricks on me to try to rob me so that i could obtain evidence i also he went on with some embarrassment told him that you too were wealthy and of some importance i thought of the lovely lady and i felt myself blushing indignantly you did very wrong i cried you had no right you may involve us both most unpleasantly you are not involved in any way protested kinney as soon as we reach new bedford you can slip on shore and wait for me at the hotel when ive finished with these gentlemen ill join you finished with them i exclaimed what do you mean to do to them arrest them cried kinney sternly as soon as they step upon the wharf you cant do it i gasped i have done it answered kinney its good as done i have notified the chief of police at new bedford he declared proudly to meet me at the wharf i used the wireless here is my message from his pocket he produced a paper and with great importance read aloud meet me at wharf on arrival steamer patience two wellknown criminals on board escaping new york police will personally lay charges against them forbes kinney as soon as i could recover from my surprise i made violent protest i pointed out to kinney that his conduct was outrageous that in making such serious charges on such evidence he would lay himself open to punishment he was not in the least dismayed i take it then he said importantly that you do not wish to appear against them i dont wish to appear in it at all i cried youve no right to annoy that young lady you must wire the police you are mistaken i have no desire to arrest the woman said kinney stiffly in my message i did not mention her if you want an adventure of your own you might help her to escape while i arrest her accomplices i object i cried to your applying the word accomplice to that young lady and suppose they are criminals i demanded how will arresting them help you kinneys eyes flashed with excitement think of the newspapers he cried theyll be full of it already in imagination he saw the headlines a clever haul he quoted noted band of crooks elude new york police but are captured by forbes kinney he sighed contentedly and theyll probably print my picture too he added i knew i should be angry with him but instead i could only feel sorry i have known kinney for a year and i have learned that his makebelieve is always innocent i suppose that he is what is called a snob but with him snobbishness is not an unpleasant weakness in his case it takes the form of thinking that people who have certain things he does not possess are better than himself and that therefore they must be worth knowing and he tries to make their acquaintance but he does not think that he himself is better than any one his life is very bare and narrow in consequence on many things he places false values as for example his desire to see his name in the newspapers even as an amateur detective so while i was indignant i also was sorry joe i said youre going to get yourself into an awful lot of trouble and though i am not in this adventure you know if i can help you i will he thanked me and we went to the diningsaloon there at a table near ours we saw the lovely lady and stumps and the american she again smiled at me but this time so it seemed a little doubtfully in the mind of the american on the contrary there was no doubt he glared both at kinney and myself as though he would like to boil us in oil after dinner in spite of my protests kinney set forth to interview him and as he described it to lead him on to commit himself i feared kinney was much more likely to commit himself than the other and when i saw them seated together i watched from a distance with much anxiety an hour later while i was alone a steward told me the purser would like to see me i went to his office and found gathered there stumps his american friend the night watchman of the boat and the purser as though inviting him to speak the purser nodded to the american that gentleman addressed me in an excited and belligerent manner my name is aldrich he said i want to know what your name is i did not quite like his tone nor did i like being summoned to the pursers office to be questioned by a stranger why i asked because said aldrich it seems you have several names as one of them belongs to this gentleman he pointed at stumps he wants to know why you are using it i looked at stumps and he greeted me with the vague and genial smile that was habitual to him but on being caught in the act by aldrich he hurriedly frowned i have never used any name but my own i said and i added pleasantly if i were choosing a name i wouldnt choose stumps aldrich fairly gasped his name is not stumps he cried indignantly he is the earl of ivy he evidently expected me to be surprised at this and i was surprised i stared at the muchadvertised young irishman with interest aldrich misunderstood my silence and in a triumphant tone which was far from pleasant continued so you see he sneered when you chose to pass yourself off as ivy you should have picked out another boat the thing was too absurd for me to be angry and i demanded with patience but why should i pass myself off as lord ivy thats what we intend to find out snapped aldrich anyway weve stopped your game for tonight and tomorrow you can explain to the police your pal he taunted has told every one on this boat that you are lord ivy and hes told me lies enough about himself to prove hes an impostor too i saw what had happened and that if i were to protect poor kinney i must not as i felt inclined use my fists but my head i laughed with apparent unconcern and turned to the purser oh thats it is it i cried i might have known it was kinney hes always playing practical jokes on me i turned to aldrich my friend has been playing a joke on you too i said he didnt know who you were but he saw you were an anglomaniac and hes been having fun with you has he roared aldrich he reached down into his pocket and pulled out a piece of paper this he cried shaking it at me is a copy of a wireless that ive just sent to the chief of police at new bedford with great satisfaction he read it in a loud and threatening voice two impostors on this boat representing themselves to be lord ivy my future brotherinlaw and his secretary lord ivy himself on board send police to meet boat we will make charges henry philip aldrich it occurred to me that after receiving two such sensational telegrams and getting out of bed to meet the boat at six in the morning the chief of police would be in a state of mind to arrest almost anybody and that his choice would certainly fall on kinney and myself it was ridiculous but it also was likely to prove extremely humiliating so i said speaking to lord ivy theres been a mistake all around send for mr kinney and i will explain it to you lord ivy who was looking extremely bored smiled and nodded but young aldrich laughed ironically mr kinney is in his stateroom he said with a steward guarding the door and window you can explain tomorrow to the police i rounded indignantly upon the purser are you keeping mr kinney a prisoner in his stateroom i demanded if you are he doesnt have to stay there protested the purser sulkily when he found the stewards were following him he went to his cabin i will see him at once i said and if i catch any of your stewards following me ill drop them overboard no one tried to stop me indeed knowing i could not escape they seemed pleased at my departure and i went to my cabin kinney seated on the edge of the berth greeted me with a hollow groan his expression was one of utter misery as though begging me not to be angry he threw out his arms appealingly how the devil he began was i to know that a little redheaded shrimp like that was the earl of ivy and that that tall blonde girl he added indignantly that i thought was an accomplice is lady moya his sister what happened i asked kinney was wearing his hat he took it off and hurled it to the floor it was that damned hat he cried its a harvard ribbon all right but only men on the crew can wear it how was i to know that i saw aldrich looking at it in a puzzled way and when he said i see you are on the crew i guessed what it meant and said i was on last years crew unfortunately he was on last years crew thats what made him suspect me and after dinner he put me through a third degree i must have given the wrong answers for suddenly he jumped up and called me a swindler and an impostor i got back by telling him he was a crook and that i was a detective and that i had sent a wireless to have him arrested at new bedford he challenged me to prove i was a detective and of course i couldnt and he called up two stewards and told them to watch me while he went after the purser i didnt fancy being watched so i came here when did you tell him i was the earl of ivy kinney ran his fingers through his hair and groaned dismally that was before the boat started he said it was only a joke he didnt seem to be interested in my conversation so i thought id liven it up a bit by saying i was a friend of lord ivys and you happened to pass and i happened to remember mrs shaw saying you looked like a british peer so i said that is my friend lord ivy i said i was your secretary and he seemed greatly interested and kinney added dismally i talked too much i am so sorry he begged its going to be awful for you his eyes suddenly lit with hope unless he whispered we can escape the same thought was in my mind but the idea was absurd and impracticable i knew there was no escape i knew we were sentenced at sunrise to a most humiliating and disgraceful experience the newspapers would regard anything that concerned lord ivy as news in my turn i also saw the hideous headlines what would my father and mother at fairport think what would my old friends there think and what was of even greater importance how would joyce carboy act what chance was there left me after i had been arrested as an impostor to become a stenographer in the law courts in time a member of the bar but i found that what for the moment distressed me most was that the lovely lady would consider me a knave or a fool the thought made me exclaim with exasperation had it been possible to abandon kinney i would have dropped overboard and made for shore the night was warm and foggy and the short journey to land to one who had been brought up like a duck meant nothing more than a wetting but i did not see how i could desert kinney can you swim i asked of course not he answered gloomily and besides he added our names are on our suitcases we couldnt take them with us and theyd find out who we are if we could only steal a boat he exclaimed eagerly one of those on the davits he urged we could put our suitcases in it and then after every one is asleep we could lower it into the water the smallest boat on board was certified to hold twentyfive persons and without waking the entire ships company we could as easily have moved the chartroom this i pointed out dont make objections kinney cried petulantly he was rapidly recovering his spirits the imminence of danger seemed to inspire him think he commanded think of some way by which we can get off this boat before she reaches new bedford we must we must not be arrested it would be too awful he interrupted himself with an excited exclamation i have it he whispered hoarsely i will ring in the firealarm the crew will run to quarters the boats will be lowered we will cut one of them adrift in the confusion what was to happen in the confusion that his imagination had conjured up i was not to know for what actually happened was so confused that of nothing am i quite certain first from the water of the sound that was lapping pleasantly against the side i heard the voice of a man raised in terror then came a rush of feet oaths and yells then a shock that threw us to our knees and a crunching ripping and tearing roar like that made by the roof of a burning building when it plunges to the cellar and the next instant a large bowsprit entered our cabin window there was left me just space enough to wrench the door open and grabbing kinney who was still on his knees i dragged him into the alleyway he scrambled upright and clasped his hands to his head wheres my hat he cried i could hear the water pouring into the lower deck and sweeping the freight and trunks before it a horse in a box stall was squealing like a human being and many human beings were screaming and shrieking like animals my first intelligent thought was of the lovely lady i shook kinney by the arm the uproar was so great that to make him hear i was forced to shout where is lord ivys cabin i cried you said its next to his sisters take me there kinney nodded and ran down the corridor and into an alleyway on which opened three cabins the doors were ajar and as i looked into each i saw that the beds had not been touched and that the cabins were empty i knew then that she was still on deck i felt that i must find her we ran toward the companionway women and children first kinney was yelling women and children first as we raced down the slanting floor of the saloon he kept repeating this mechanically at that moment the electric lights went out and except for the oil lamps the ship was in darkness many of the passengers had already gone to bed these now burst from the staterooms in strange garments carrying lifepreservers handbags their arms full of clothing one man in one hand clutched a sponge in the other an umbrella with this he beat at those who blocked his flight he hit a woman over the head and i hit him and he went down finding himself on his knees he began to pray volubly when we reached the upper deck we pushed out of the crush at the gangway and to keep our footing for there was a strong list to port clung to the big flagstaff at the stern at each rail the crew were swinging the boats over the side and around each boat was a crazy fighting mob above our starboard rail towered the foremast of a schooner she had rammed us fair amidships and in her bows was a hole through which you could have rowed a boat into this the water was rushing and sucking her down she was already settling at the stern by the light of a swinging lantern i saw three of her crew lift a yawl from her deck and lower it into the water into it they hurled oars and a sail and one of them had already started to slide down the painter when the schooner lurched drunkenly and in a panic all three of the men ran forward and leaped to our lower deck the yawl abandoned swung idly between the patience and the schooner kinney seeing what i saw grabbed me by the arm there he whispered pointing theres our chance i saw that with safety the yawl could hold a third person and as to who the third passenger would be i had already made up my mind wait here i said on the patience there were many immigrants only that afternoon released from ellis island they had swarmed into the lifeboats even before they were swung clear and when the ships officers drove them off the poor souls not being able to understand believed they were being sacrificed for the safety of the other passengers so each was fighting as he thought for his life and for the lives of his wife and children at the edge of the scrimmage i dragged out two women who had been knocked off their feet and who were in danger of being trampled but neither was the woman i sought in the halfdarkness i saw one of the immigrants a girl with a kerchief on her head struggling with her lifebelt a stoker as he raced past seized it and made for the rail in my turn i took it from him and he fought for it shouting its every man for himself now all right i said for i was excited and angry look out for yourself then i hit him on the chin and he let go of the lifebelt and dropped i heard at my elbow a low excited laugh and a voice said well bowled you never learned that in an office i turned and saw the lovely lady i tossed the immigrant girl her lifebelt and as though i had known lady moya all my life i took her by the hand and dragged her after me down the deck you come with me i commanded i found that i was trembling and that a weight of anxiety of which i had not been conscious had been lifted i found i was still holding her hand and pressing it in my own thank god i said i thought i had lost you lost me repeated lady moya but she made no comment i must find my brother she said you must come with me i ordered go with mr kinney to the lower deck i will bring that rowboat under the stern you will jump into it i cannot leave my brother said lady moya upon the word as though shot from a cannon the human whirlpool that was sweeping the deck amidships cast out stumps and hurled him toward us his sister gave a little cry of relief stumps recovered his balance and shook himself like a dog that has been in the water thought id never get out of it alive he remarked complacently in the darkness i could not see his face but i was sure he was still vaguely smiling worse than a football night he exclaimed worse than mafeking night his sister pointed to the yawl this gentleman is going to bring that boat here and take us away in it she told him we had better go when we can right ho assented stumps cheerfully how about phil hes just behind me as he spoke only a few yards from us a peevish voice pierced the tumult i tell you it cried you must find lord ivy if lord ivy a voice with a strong and brutal american accent yelled in answer to hell with lord ivy lady moya chuckled get to the lower deck i commanded i am going for the yawl as i slipped my leg over the rail i heard lord ivy say ill find phil and meet you i dropped and caught the rail of the deck below and hanging from it shoved with my knees and fell into the water two strokes brought me to the yawl and scrambling into her and casting her off i paddled back to the steamer as i lay under the stern i heard from the lower deck the voice of kinney raised importantly ladies first he cried her ladyship first i mean he corrected even on leaving what he believed to be a sinking ship kinney could not forget his manners but mr aldrich had evidently forgotten his i heard him shout indignantly ill be damned if i do the voice of lady moya laughed youll be drowned if you dont she answered i saw a black shadow poised upon the rail steady below there her voice called and the next moment as lightly as a squirrel she dropped to the thwart and stumbled into my arms the voice of aldrich was again raised in anger id rather drown he cried lord ivy responded with unexpected spirit well then drown the water is warm and its a pleasing death at that with a bump he fell in a heap at my feet easy kinney i shouted dont swamp us ill be careful he called and the next instant hit my shoulders and i shook him off on top of lord ivy get off my head shouted his lordship kinney apologized to every one profusely lady moya raised her voice for the last time phil she called are you coming or are you not not with those swindlers im not he shouted i think you two are mad i prefer to drown there was an uncomfortable silence my position was a difficult one and not knowing what to say i said nothing if one must drown exclaimed lady moya briskly i cant see it matters who one drowns with in his strangely explosive manner lord ivy shouted suddenly phil youre a silly ass push off commanded lady moya i think from her tone the order was given more for the benefit of aldrich than for myself certainly it was effective for on the instant there was a heavy splash lord ivy sniffed scornfully and manifested no interest ah he exclaimed he prefers to drown sputtering and gasping aldrich rose out of the water and while we balanced the boat climbed over the side understand he cried even while he was still gasping i am here under protest i am here to protect you and stumps i am under obligation to no one im can you row i asked why dont you ask your pal he demanded savagely he rowed on last years crew phil cried lady moya her voice suggested a temper i had not suspected you will row or you can get out and walk take the oars she commanded and be civil lady moya with the tiller in her hand sat in the stern stumps with kinney huddled at his knees was stowed away forward i took the stroke and aldrich the bow oars we will make for the connecticut shore i said and pulled from under the stern of the patience in a few minutes we had lost all sight and except for her whistle all sound of her and we ourselves were lost in the fog there was another eloquent and embarrassing silence unless in the panic they trampled upon each other i had no real fear for the safety of those on board the steamer before we had abandoned her i had heard the wireless frantically sputtering the standby call and i was certain that already the big boats of the fall river providence and joy lines and launches from every wireless station between bridgeport and newport were making toward her but the margin of safety which to my thinking was broad enough for all the other passengers for the lovely lady was in no way sufficient that mobswept deck was no place for her i was happy that on her account i had not waited for a possible rescue in the yawl she was safe the water was smooth and the connecticut shore was i judged not more than three miles distant in an hour unless the fog confused us i felt sure the lovely lady would again walk safely upon dry land selfishly on kinneys account and my own i was delighted to find myself free of the steamer and from any chance of her landing us where police waited with open arms the avenging angel in the person of aldrich was still near us so near that i could hear the water dripping from his clothes but his power to harm was gone i was congratulating myself on this when suddenly he undeceived me apparently he had been considering his position toward kinney and myself and having arrived at a conclusion was anxious to announce it i wish to repeat he exclaimed suddenly that im under obligations to nobody just because my friends he went on defiantly choose to trust themselves with persons who ought to be in jail i cant desert them its all the more reason why i shouldnt desert them thats why im here and i want it understood as soon as i get on shore im going to a police station and have those persons arrested rising out of the fog that had rendered each of us invisible to the other his words sounded fantastic and unreal in the dripping silence broken only by hoarse warnings that came from no direction and within the mind of each the conviction that we were lost police stations did not immediately concern us so no one spoke and in the fog the words died away and were drowned but i was glad he had spoken at least i was forewarned i now knew that i had not escaped that kinney and i were still in danger i determined that so far as it lay with me our yawl would be beached at that point on the coast of connecticut farthest removed not only from police stations but from all human habitation as soon as we were out of hearing of the patience and her whistle we completely lost our bearings it may be that lady moya was not a skilled coxswain or it may be that aldrich understands a racing scull better than a yawl and pulled too heavily on his right but whatever the cause we soon were hopelessly lost in this predicament we were not alone the night was filled with foghorns whistles bells and the throb of engines but we never were near enough to hail the vessels from which the sounds came and when we rowed toward them they invariably sank into silence after two hours stumps and kinney insisted on taking a turn at the oars and lady moya moved to the bow we gave her our coats and making cushions of these she announced that she was going to sleep whether she slept or not i do not know but she remained silent for three more dreary hours we took turns at the oars or dozed at the bottom of the boat while we continued aimlessly to drift upon the face of the waters it was now five oclock and the fog had so far lightened that we could see each other and a stretch of open water at intervals the foghorns of vessels passing us but hidden from us tormented aldrich to a state of extreme exasperation he hailed them with frantic shrieks and shouts and stumps and the lady moya shouted with him i fear kinney and myself did not contribute any great volume of sound to the general chorus to be rescued was the last thing we desired the yacht or tug that would receive us on board would also put us on shore where the vindictive aldrich would have us at his mercy we preferred the freedom of our yawl and the shelter of the fog our silence was not lost upon aldrich for some time he had been crouching in the bow whispering indignantly to lady moya now he exclaimed aloud what did i tell you he cried contemptuously they got away in this boat because they were afraid of me not because they were afraid of being drowned if theyve nothing to be afraid of why are they so anxious to keep us drifting around all night in this fog why dont they help us stop one of those tugs lord ivy exploded suddenly rot he exclaimed if theyre afraid of you why did they ask you to go with them they didnt cried aldrich truthfully and triumphantly they kidnapped you and moya because they thought they could square themselves with you but they didnt want me the issue had been fairly stated and no longer with selfrespect could i remain silent we dont want you now i said cant you understand i went on with as much selfrestraint as i could muster we are willing and anxious to explain ourselves to lord ivy or even to you but we dont want to explain to the police my friend thought you and lord ivy were crooks escaping you think we are crooks escaping you both aldrich snorted contemptuously thats a likely story he cried no wonder you dont want to tell that to the police from the bow came an exclamation and lady moya rose to her feet phil she said you bore me she picked her way across the thwart to where kinney sat at the stroke oar my brother and i often row together she said i will take your place when she had seated herself we were so near that her eyes looked directly into mine drawing in the oars she leaned upon them and smiled now then she commanded tell us all about it before i could speak there came from behind her a sudden radiance and as though a curtain had been snatched aside the fog flew apart and the sun dripping crimson and gorgeous sprang from the waters from the others there was a cry of wonder and delight and from lord ivy a shriek of incredulous laughter lady moya clapped her hands joyfully and pointed past me i turned and looked directly behind me not fifty feet from us was a shelving beach and a stone wharf and above it a vinecovered cottage from the chimney of which smoke curled cheerily had the yawl while lady moya was taking the oars not swung in a circle and had the sun not risen in three minutes more we would have bumped ourselves into the state of connecticut the cottage stood on one horn of a tiny harbor beyond it weatherbeaten shingled houses saillofts and wharfs stretched cosily in a halfcircle back of them rose splendid elms and the delicate spire of a church and from the unruffled surface of the harbor the masts of many fishingboats across the water on a grassgrown point a whitewashed lighthouse blushed in the crimson glory of the sun except for an oysterman in his boat at the end of the wharf and the smoke from the chimney of his cottage the little village slept the harbor slept it was a picture of perfect content confidence and peace oh cried the lady moya how pretty how pretty lord ivy swung the bow about and raced toward the wharf the others stood up and cheered hysterically at the sound and at the sight of us emerging so mysteriously from the fog the man in the fishingboat raised himself to his full height and stared as incredulously as though he beheld a mermaid he was an old man but straight and tall and the oystermans boots stretching to his hips made him appear even taller than he was he had a bristling white beard and his face was tanned to a fierce copper color but his eyes were blue and young and gentle they lit suddenly with excitement and sympathy are you from the patience he shouted in chorus we answered that we were and ivy pulled the yawl alongside the fishermans boat but already the old man had turned and making a megaphone of his hands was shouting to the cottage mother he cried mother here are folks from the wreck get coffee and blankets and and bacon and eggs may the lord bless him exclaimed the lady moya devoutly but aldrich excited and eager pulled out a roll of bills and shook them at the man do you want to earn ten dollars he demanded then chase yourself to the village and bring the constable lady moya exclaimed bitterly lord ivy swore kinney in despair uttered a dismal howl and dropped his head in his hands its no use mr aldrich i said seated in the stern the others had hidden me from the fisherman now i stood up and he saw me i laid one hand on his and pointed to the tin badge on his suspender he is the village constable himself i explained i turned to the lovely lady lady moya i said i want to introduce you to my father i pointed to the vinecovered cottage thats my home i said i pointed to the sleeping town that i told her is the village of fairport most of it belongs to father you are all very welcome peace manoeuvres the scout stood where three roads cut three green tunnels in the pine woods and met at his feet above his head an aged signpost pointed impartially to east carver south carver and carver centre and left the choice to him the scout scowled and bit nervously at his gauntlet the choice was difficult and there was no one with whom he could take counsel the three sunshot roads lay empty and the other scouts who with him had left the main column at sunrise he had ordered back they were to report that on the right flank so far at least as middleboro there was no sign of the enemy what lay beyond it now was his duty to discover the three empty roads spread before him like a picture puzzle smiling at his predicament whichever one he followed left two unguarded should he creep upon for choice carver centre the enemy masked by a mile of fir trees might advance from carver or south carver and obviously he could not follow three roads at the same time he considered the better strategy would be to wait where he was where the three roads met and allow the enemy himself to disclose his position to the scout this course was most distasteful he assured himself that this was so because while it were the safer course it wasted time and lacked initiative but in his heart he knew that was not the reason and to his heart his head answered that when ones country is at war when fields and firesides are trampled by the iron heels of the invader a scout should act not according to the dictates of his heart but in the service of his native land in the case of this particular patriot the man and scout were at odds as one of the bicycle squad of the boston corps of cadets the scout knew what at this momentous crisis in her history the commonwealth of massachusetts demanded of him it was that he sit tight and wait for the hated foreigners from new york city new jersey and connecticut to show themselves but the man knew and had known for several years that on the road to carver was the summer home of one beatrice farrar as private lathrop it was no part of his duty to know that as a man and a lover and a rejected lover at that he could not think of anything else struggling between love and duty the scout basely decided to leave the momentous question to chance in the front tire of his bicycle was a puncture temporarily effaced by a plug laying the bicycle on the ground lathrop spun the front wheel swiftly if he decided the wheel stops with the puncture pointing at carver centre ill advance upon carver centre should it point to either of the two other villages ill stop here its a two to one shot against me any way he growled kneeling in the road he spun the wheel and as intently as at monte carlo and palm beach he had waited for other wheels to determine his fortune he watched it come to rest it stopped with the plug pointing back to middleboro the scout told himself he was entitled to another trial again he spun the wheel again the spokes flashed in the sun again the puncture rested on the road to middleboro if it does that once more thought the scout its a warning that there is trouble ahead for me at carver and all the little carvers for the third time the wheel flashed but as he waited for the impetus to die the sound of galloping hoofs broke sharply on the silence the scout threw himself and his bicycle over the nearest stone wall and unlimbering his rifle pointed it down the road he saw approaching a small boy in a white apron seated in a white wagon on which was painted pies and pastry east wareham the boy dragged his horse to an abrupt halt dont point that at me shouted the boy where do you come from demanded the scout wareham said the baker are you carrying any one concealed in that wagon as though to make sure the bakers boy glanced apprehensively into the depths of his cart and then answered that in the wagon he carried nothing but freshbaked bread to the trained nostrils of the scout this already was evident before sunrise he had breakfasted on hard tack and muddy coffee and the odor of crullers and mince pie still warm assailed him cruelly he assumed a fierce and terrible aspect where are you going he challenged to carver centre said the boy to chance lathrop had left the decision he believed the fates had answered dragging his bicycle over the stone wall he fell into the road go on he commanded ill use your cart for a screen ill creep behind the enemy before he sees me the bakers boy frowned unhappily but supposing he argued they see you first will they shoot the scout waved his hand carelessly of course he cried then said the baker my horse will run away what of it demanded the scout are middleboro south middleboro rock brockton and boston to fall are they to be captured because youre afraid of your own horse they wont shoot real bullets this is not a real war dont you know that the bakers boy flushed with indignation sure i know that he protested but my horse he dont know that lathrop slung his rifle over his shoulder and his leg over his bicycle if the reds catch you he warned in parting theyll take everything youve got the blues have took most of it already wailed the boy and just as they were paying me the battle begun and this horse run away and i couldnt get him to come back for my money war exclaimed lathrop morosely is always cruel to the innocent he sped toward carver centre in his motor car he had travelled the road many times and as always his goal had been the home of miss beatrice farrar he had covered it at a speed unrecognized by law but now he advanced with stealth and caution in every clump of bushes he saw an ambush behind each rock he beheld the enemy in a clearing was a group of portuguese cranberry pickers dressed as though for a holiday when they saw the man in uniform one of the women hailed him anxiously is the parade coming she called have you seen any of the reds lathrop returned no complained the woman and we been waiting all morning when will the parade come its not a parade said lathrop severely its a war the summer home of miss farrar stood close to the road it had been so placed by the farmer who built it in order that the women folk might sit at the window and watch the passing of the stagecoach and the peddler great elms hung over it and a white fence separated the road from the narrow lawn at a distance of a hundred yards a turn brought the house into view and at this turn as had been his manoeuvre at every other possible ambush lathrop dismounted and advanced on foot up to this moment the road had been empty but now in front of the farrar cottage it was blocked by a touringcar and a station wagon in the occupants of the car he recognized all the members of the farrar family except miss farrar in the station wagon were all of the farrar servants miss farrar herself was leaning upon the gate and waving them a farewell the touringcar moved off down the road the station wagon followed miss farrar was alone lathrop scorched toward her and when he was opposite the gate dug his toes in the dust and halted when he lifted his broadbrimmed campaign hat miss farrar exclaimed both with surprise and displeasure drawing back from the gate she held herself erect her attitude was that of one prepared for instant retreat when she spoke it was in tones of extreme disapproval you promised said the girl you would not come to see me lathrop straddling his bicycle peered anxiously down the road this is not a social call he said im on duty have you seen the reds his tone was brisk and alert his manner preoccupied the ungraciousness of his reception did not seem in the least to disconcert him but miss farrar was not deceived she knew him not only as a persistent and irrepressible lover but as one full of guile adroit in tricks fertile in expedients he was one who could not take no for an answer at least not from her when she repulsed him she seemed to grow in his eyes only the more attractive it is not the lover who comes to woo he was constantly explaining but the lovers way of wooing miss farrar had assured him she did not like his way she objected to being regarded and treated as a castle that could be taken only by assault whether she wished time to consider or whether he and his proposal were really obnoxious to her he could not find out his policy of campaign was that she also should not have time to find out again and again she had agreed to see him only on the condition that he would not make love to her he had promised again and again and had failed to keep that promise only a week before he had been banished from her presence to remain an exile until she gave him permission to see her at her home in new york it was not her purpose to return there for two weeks and yet here he was a beggar at her gate it might be that he was there as he said on duty but her knowledge of him and of the doctrine of chances caused her to doubt it mr lathrop she began severely as though to see to whom she had spoken lathrop glanced anxiously over his shoulder apparently pained and surprised to find that it was to him she had addressed herself he regarded her with deep reproach his eyes were very beautiful it was a fact which had often caused miss farrar extreme annoyance he shook his head sadly mr lathrop he protested you know that to you i am always charles charles the bold because i am bold to love you but never mr lathrop unless he went on briskly you are referring to a future state when as mrs lathrop you will make me miss farrar had turned her back on him and was walking rapidly up the path beatrice he called i am coming after you miss farrar instantly returned and placed both hands firmly upon the gate i cannot understand you she said dont you see that when you act as you do now i cant even respect you how do you think i could ever care when you offend me so you jest at what you pretend is the most serious thing in your life you play with it laugh at it the young man interrupted her sharply its like this he said when i am with you i am so happy i cant be serious when i am not with you it is so serious that i am utterly and completely wretched you say my love offends you bores you i am sorry but what in heavens name do you think your not loving me is doing to me i am a wreck i am a skeleton look at me he let his bicycle fall and stood with his hands open at his sides as though inviting her to gaze upon the ruin she had caused four days of sun and rain astride of a bicycle without food or sleep had drawn his face into fine hard lines had bronzed it with a healthy tan his uniform made by the same tailor that fitted him with polo breeches clung to him like a jersey the spectacle he presented was that of an extremely picturesque handsome manly youth and of that fact no one was better aware than himself look at me he begged sadly miss farrar was entirely unimpressed i am she returned coldly i never saw you looking so well and you know it she gave a gasp of comprehension you came here because you knew your uniform was becoming lathrop regarded himself complacently yes isnt it he assented i brought on this war in order to wear it if you dont mind he added i think ill accept your invitation and come inside ive had nothing to eat in four days miss farrars eyes flashed indignantly youre not coming inside she declared but if youll only promise to go away at once ill bring you everything in the house in that house exclaimed lathrop dramatically theres only one thing that i desire and i want that so badly that life holds no charm without you miss farrar regarded him steadily do you intend to drive me away from my own door or will you go lathrop picked his wheel out of the dust goodby he said ill come back when you have made up your mind in vexation miss farrar stamped her foot upon the path i have made up my mind she protested then returned lathrop ill come back when you have changed it he made a movement as though to ride away but much to miss farrars dismay hastily dismounted on second thoughts he said it isnt right for me to leave you the woods are full of tramps and hangerson of the army youre not safe i can watch this road from here as well as from anywhere else and at the same time i can guard you to the consternation of miss farrar he placed his bicycle against the fence and as though preparing for a visit leaned his elbows upon it i do not wish to be rude said miss farrar but you are annoying me i have spent fifteen summers in massachusetts and i have never seen a tramp i need no one to guard me if not you said lathrop easily then the family silver and think of your jewels and your mothers jewels think of yourself in a house filled with jewels and entirely surrounded by hostile armies my duty is to remain with you miss farrar was so long in answering that lathrop lifted his head and turned to look he found her frowning and gazing intently into the shadow of the woods across the road when she felt his eyes upon her she turned her own guiltily upon him her cheeks were flushed and her face glowed with some unusual excitement i wish she exclaimed breathlessly i wish she repeated the reds would take you prisoner take me where asked lathrop take you anywhere cried miss farrar you should be ashamed to talk to me when you should be looking for the enemy i am waiting for the enemy explained lathrop its the same thing miss farrar smiled vindictively her eyes shone you need not wait long she said there was a crash of a falling stone wall and of parting bushes but not in time to give lathrop warning as though from the branches of the trees opposite two soldiers fell into the road around his hat each wore the red band of the invader each pointed his rifle at lathrop hands up shouted one youre my prisoner cried the other mechanically lathrop raised his hands but his eyes turned to miss farrar did you know he asked i have been watching them she said creeping up on you for the last ten minutes lathrop turned to the two soldiers and made an effort to smile that was very clever he said but i have twenty men up the road and behind them a regiment you had better get away while you can the two reds laughed derisively one who wore the stripes of a sergeant answered that wont do we been a mile up the road and you and us are the only soldiers on it gimme the gun lathrop knew he had no right to refuse he had been fairly surprised but he hesitated when miss farrar was not in his mind his amateur soldiering was to him a most serious proposition the war game was a serious proposition and that through his failure for ten minutes to regard it seriously he had been made a prisoner mortified him keenly that his humiliation had taken place in the presence of beatrice farrar did not lessen his discomfort nor did the explanation he must later make to his captain afford him any satisfaction already he saw himself playing the star part in a courtmartial he shrugged his shoulders and surrendered his gun as he did so he gloomily scrutinized the insignia of his captors who took me he asked we took you exclaimed the sergeant what regiment demanded lathrop sharply i have to report who took me and you probably dont know it but your collar ornaments are upside down with genuine exasperation he turned to miss farrar lord he exclaimed isnt it bad enough to be taken prisoner without being taken by raw recruits that cant put on their uniforms the reds flushed and the younger a sandyhaired ratfaced youth retorted angrily mebbe we aint strong on uniforms beau he snarled but youve got nothing on us yet that i can see you look pretty with your hands in the air dont you shut up commanded the other red he was the older man heavily built with a strong hard mouth and chin on which latter sprouted a three days irongray beard dont you see hes an officer officers dont like being took by twospot privates lathrop gave a sudden start why he laughed incredulously dont you know he stopped and his eyes glanced quickly up and down the road dont we know what demanded the older red suspiciously i forgot said lathrop i i must not give information to the enemy for an instant there was a pause while the two reds stood irresolute then the older nodded the other to the side of the road and in whispers they consulted eagerly miss farrar laughed and lathrop moved toward her i deserve worse than being laughed at he said i made a strategic mistake i should not have tried to capture you and an army corps at the same time you she taunted who were always so keen on soldiering to be taken prisoner she lowered her voice and by men like that arent they funny she whispered and east side and tenderloin it made me homesick to hear them i think when not in uniform the little one drives a taxicab and the big one is a guard on the elevated they certainly are very new york assented lathrop and very tough i thought whispered miss farrar those from new york with the red army were picked men what does it matter exclaimed lathrop its just as humiliating to be captured by a hallroom boy as by a mere millionaire i cant insist on the invading army being entirely recruited from harvard graduates the two reds either had reached a decision or agreed that they could not agree for they ceased whispering and crossed to where lathrop stood we been talking over your case explained the sergeant and we see we are in wrong we see we made a mistake in taking you prisoner we had ought to shot you dead so now were going to shoot you dead you cant objected lathrop its too late you should have thought of that sooner i know admitted the sergeant but a prisoner is a hell of a nuisance if you got a prisoner to look after you cant do your own work you got to keep tabs on him and there aint nothing in it for the prisoner neither if we take you youll have to tramp all the way to our army and all the way back but if youre dead how different you aint no bother to anybody you got a half holiday all to yourself and you can loaf around the camp so dead that they cant make you work but not so dead you cant smoke or eat the sergeant smiled ingratiatingly in a tempting manner he exhibited his rifle better be dead he urged id like to oblige you said lathrop but its against the rules you cant shoot a prisoner the ratfaced soldier uttered an angry exclamation to hell with the rules he cried we cant waste time on him turn him loose the older man rounded on the little one savagely the tone in which he addressed him was cold menacing sinister his words were simple but his eyes and face were heavy with warning who is running this he asked the little soldier muttered and shuffled away from under the brim of his campaign hat his eyes cast furtive glances up and down the road as though anxious to wipe out the effect of his comrades words the sergeant addressed lathrop suavely and in a tone of conciliation you see he explained him and me are scouts were not supposed to waste time taking prisoners so well set you free he waved his hand invitingly toward the bicycle you can go he said to miss farrars indignation lathrop instead of accepting his freedom remained motionless i cant he said im on post my captain ordered me to stay in front of this house until i was relieved miss farrar amazed at such duplicity exclaimed aloud he is not on post she protested hes a scout he wants to stop here because because hes hungry i wouldnt have let you take him prisoner if i had not thought you would take him away with you she appealed to the sergeant please take him away she begged the sergeant turned sharply upon his prisoner why dont you do what the lady wants he demanded because ive got to do what my captain wants returned lathrop and he put me on sentrygo in front of this house with the back of his hand the sergeant fretfully scraped the three days growth on his chin theres nothing to it he exclaimed but for to take him with us when we meet some more reds well turn him over fall in he commanded no protested lathrop i dont want to be turned over ive got a much better plan you dont want to be bothered with a prisoner i dont want to be a prisoner as you say i am better dead you cant shoot a prisoner but if he tries to escape you can ill try to escape you shoot me then i return to my own army and report myself dead that ends your difficulty and saves me from a courtmartial they cant courtmartial a corpse the face of the sergeant flashed with relief and satisfaction in his anxiety to rid himself of his prisoner he lifted the bicycle into the road and held it in readiness youre all right he said heartily you can make your getaway as quick as you like but to the conspiracy miss farrar refused to lend herself how do you know she demanded that he will keep his promise he may not go back to his own army he can be just as dead on my lawn as anywhere else lathrop shook his head at her sadly how you wrong me he protested how dare you doubt the promise of a dying man these are really my last words and i wish i could think of something to say suited to the occasion but the presence of strangers prevents he mounted his bicycle if i had a thousand lives to give he quoted with fervor id give them all to he hesitated and smiled mournfully on miss farrar seeing her flushed and indignant countenance he added with haste to the commonwealth of massachusetts as he started on his wheel slowly down the path he turned to the sergeant im escaping he explained the reds with an enthusiasm undoubtedly genuine raised their rifles and the calm of the indian summer was shattered by two sharp reports lathrop looking back over his shoulder waved one hand reassuringly death was instantaneous he called he bent his body over the handlebar and they watched him disappear rapidly around the turn in the road miss farrar sighed with relief thank you very much she said as though signifying that to oblige a woman he would shoot any number of prisoners the sergeant raised his hat dont mention it lady he said i seen he was annoying you and thats why i got rid of him some of them amateur soldiers as soon as they get into uniform are too fresh he took advantage of you because your folks were away from home but dont you worry about that ill guard this house until your folks get back miss farrar protested warmly really she exclaimed i need no one to guard me but the soldier was obdurate he motioned his comrade down the road watch at the turn he ordered he may come back or send some of the blues to take us ill stay here and protect the lady again miss farrar protested but the sergeant in a benign and fatherly manner smiled approvingly seating himself on the grass outside the fence he leaned his back against the gatepost apparently settling himself for conversation now how long might it have been he asked before we showed up that you seen us i saw you miss farrar said when mr when that bicycle scout was talking to me i saw the red bands on your hats among the bushes the sergeant appeared interested but why didnt you let on to him miss farrar laughed evasively maybe because i am from new york too she said perhaps i wanted to see soldiers from my city take a prisoner they were interrupted by the sudden appearance of the smaller soldier on his ratlike countenance was written deep concern when i got to the turn he began breathlessly i couldnt see him where did he go did he double back through the woods or did he have time to ride out of sight before i got there the reappearance of his comrade affected the sergeant strangely he sprang to his feet his under jaw protruding truculently his eyes flashing with anger get back he snarled do what i told you under his breath he muttered words that to miss farrar were unintelligible the little ratlike man nodded and ran from them down the road the sergeant made an awkward gesture of apology excuse me lady he begged but it makes me hot when them rookies wont obey orders you see he ran on glibly im a reglar served three years in the philippines and i cant get used to not having my men do what i say miss farrar nodded and started toward the house the sergeant sprang quickly across the road have you ever been in the philippines miss he called its a great country miss farrar halted and shook her head she was considering how far politeness required of her to entertain unshaven militiamen who insisted on making sentries of themselves at her front gate the sergeant had plunged garrulously into a confusing description of the far east he was clasping the pickets of the fence with his hands and his eyes were fastened on hers he lacked neither confidence nor vocabulary and not for an instant did his tongue hesitate or his eyes wander and yet in his manner there was nothing at which she could take offence he appeared only amiably vain that he had seen much of the world and anxious to impress that fact upon another miss farrar was bored but the man gave her no opportunity to escape in consequence she was relieved when the noisy approach of an automobile brought him to an abrupt pause coming rapidly down the road was a large touringcar filled with men in khaki the sergeant gave one glance at it and leaped across the road taking cover behind the stone wall instantly he raised his head above it and shook his fist at miss farrar dont tell he commanded theyre blues in that car dont tell again he sank from sight miss farrar now was more than bored she was annoyed why grown men should play at war so seriously she could not understand it was absurd she no longer would remain a party to it and lest the men in the car might involve her still further she retreated hastily toward the house as she opened the door the car halted at the gate and voices called to her but she pretended not to hear them and continued up the stairs behind her the car passed noisily on its way she mounted the stairs and crossing a landing moved down a long hall at the further end of which was her bedroom the hall was uncarpeted but the tennis shoes she wore made no sound nor did the door of her bedroom when she pushed it open on the threshold miss farrar stood quite still a swift sinking nausea held her in a vice her instinct was to scream and run but her throat had tightened and gone dry and her limbs trembled opposite the door was her dressingtable and reflected in its mirror were the features and figure of the ratlike soldier his back was toward her with one hand he swept the dressingtable the other hanging at his side held a revolver in a moment the panic into which miss farrar had been thrown passed her breath and blood returned and intent only on flight she softly turned on the instant the ratfaced one raised his eyes saw her reflected in the mirror and with an oath swung toward her he drew the revolver close to his cheek and looked at her down the barrel dont move he whispered dont scream where are the jewels miss farrar was not afraid of the revolver or of the man she did not believe either would do her harm the idea of both the presence of the man in her room and that any one should dare to threaten her was what filled her with repugnance as the warm blood flowed again through her body her spirit returned she was no longer afraid she was instead indignant furious with one step she was in the room leaving the road to the door open get out of here she commanded the little man snarled and stamped the floor he shoved the gun nearer to her the jewels damn you he whispered do you want me to blow your fool head off where are the jewels jewels repeated miss farrar i have no jewels you lie shrieked the little man he said the house was full of jewels we heard him he said he would stay to guard the jewels miss farrar recognized his error she remembered lathrops jest and that it had been made while the two men were within hearing behind the stone wall it was a joke she cried leave at once she backed swiftly toward the open window that looked upon the road or ill call your sergeant if you go near that window or scream whispered the ratlike one ill shoot a heavy voice speaking suddenly from the doorway shook miss farrars jangled nerves into fresh panic she wont scream said the voice in the door miss farrar saw the bulky form of the sergeant blocking her escape without shifting his eyes from miss farrar the man with the gun cursed breathlessly at the other why didnt you keep her away he panted an automobile stopped in front of the gate explained the sergeant have you got them he demanded no returned the other nothing she wont tell where they are the older man laughed oh yes shell tell he whispered his voice was still low and suave but it carried with it the weight of a threat and the threat although unspoken filled miss farrar with alarm her eyes wide with concern turned fearfully from one man to the other the sergeant stretched his hands toward her the fingers working and making clutches in the air the look in his eyes was quite terrifying if you dont tell he said slowly ill choke it out of you if his intention was to frighten the girl he succeeded admirably with her hands clasped to her throat miss farrar sank against the wall she saw no chance of escape the way to the door was barred and should she drop to the garden below from the window before she could reach the road the men would overtake her even should she reach the road the house nearest was a half mile distant the sergeant came close his fingers opening and closing in front of her eyes he raised his voice to a harsh bellowing roar im going to make you tell he shouted im going to choke it out of you although she was alone in the house although on every side the pine woods encompassed her miss farrar threw all her strength into one long piercing cry for help and upon the instant it was answered from the hall came the swift rush of feet the ratlike one swung toward it from his revolver came a report that shook the room a flash and a burst of smoke and through it miss farrar saw lathrop hurl himself he dived at the ratlike one and as on the football field he had been taught to stop a runner flung his arms around the others knees the legs of the man shot from under him his body cut a half circle through the air and the part of his anatomy to first touch the floor was his head the floor was of oak and the impact gave forth a crash like the smash of a baseball bat when it drives the ball to centre field the man did not move he did not even groan in his relaxed fingers the revolver lay within reach of lathrops hand he fell upon it and still on his knees pointed it at the sergeant youre my prisoner now he shouted cheerfully hands up the man raised his arms slowly as if he were lifting heavy dumbbells the lady called for help he said i came to help her no no protested the girl he did not help me he said he would choke me if i didnt he said he would what bellowed lathrop he leaped to his feet and sent the gun spinning through the window he stepped toward the man gingerly on the balls of his feet like one walking on ice the man seemed to know what that form of approach threatened for he threw his arms into a position of defence you bully whispered lathrop you coward you choke women do you he shifted from one foot to the other his body balancing forward his arms swinging limply in front of him with his eyes he seemed to undress the man as though choosing a place to strike i made the same mistake you did he taunted i should have killed you first now i am going to do it he sprang at the man his chin still sunk on his chest but with his arms swinging like the spokes of a wheel his opponent struck back heavily violently but each move of his arm seemed only to open up some vulnerable spot blows beat upon his chin upon his nose his eyes blows jabbed him in the ribs drove his breath from his stomach ground his teeth together cut the flesh from his cheeks he sank to his knees with his arms clasping his head get up roared lathrop stand up to it you coward but the man had no idea of standing up to it howling with pain he scrambled toward the door and fled staggering down the hall at the same moment the automobile that a few minutes before had passed up the road came limping to the gate and a halfdozen men in uniform sprang out of it from the window lathrop saw them spread across the lawn and surround the house theyve got him he said he pointed to the prostrate figure on the floor he and the other one he explained breathlessly are new york crooks they have been looting in the wake of the reds disguised as soldiers i knew they werent even amateur soldiers by the mistakes in their makeup and i made that bluff of riding away so as to give them time to show what the game was then that provost guard in the motor car stopped me and when they said who they were after i ordered them back here but they had a flat tire and my bicycle beat them in his excitement he did not notice that the girl was not listening that she was very pale that she was breathing quickly and trembling ill go tell them he added that the other one they want is up here miss farrars strength instantly returned with a look of terror at the now groaning figure on the floor she sprang toward lathrop with both hands clutching him by his sleeves you will not she commanded you will not leave me alone appealingly she raised her face to his startled countenance with a burst of tears she threw herself into his arms im afraid she sobbed dont leave me please no matter what i say never leave me again between bewilderment and joy the face of lathrop was unrecognizable as her words reached him as he felt the touch of her body in his arms and her warm wet cheek against his own he drew a deep sigh of content and then fearfully and tenderly held her close after a pause in which peace came to all the world he raised his head dont worry he said you can bet i wont leave you
