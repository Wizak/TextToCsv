 chapter one mr sherlock holmes my name is doctor watson i am writing this story about my friend mr sherlock holmes the famous detective sherlock holmes lives at b baker street in the middle of london my story begins in baker street one morning in when a man knocked on the door i heard the man say mr holmes my name is dr mortimer i need your help come in said holmes how can i help you i have a strange story to tell you mr holmes said dr mortimer my story is very strange perhaps you will not believe me chapter two the curse of the baskervilles dr mortimer sat down sherlock holmes and i listened to his story i am a doctor and i work in the country said dr mortimer i live and work on dartmoor and as you know dartmoor is a large wild place there is only one big house on dartmoor baskerville hall the owner of the house was sir charles baskerville i was his friend as well as his doctor i read of his death in the times newspaper said holmes that was three months ago said dr mortimer the newspaper reported his death but it did not report all the facts was there something strange about his death asked sherlock holmes i am not certain said dr mortimer there was a story about a curse on the baskerville family sir charles believed this old story a curse i asked what do you mean here is the story said dr mortimer he took a large piece of paper out of his pocket please read this it is the story of the curse of the baskervilles holmes took the paper and read it it is called the hound of the baskervilles he said he showed me the paper this is what it said in the year sir hugo baskerville was the owner of baskerville hall sir hugo was a cruel man who did not believe in god every day he went out hunting and drinking with a gang of wild friends a farmer on dartmoor had a beautiful daughter sir hugo wanted to marry the girl but she was afraid of him the girls father told sir hugo to stay away from his farm sir hugo was very angry one day when the farmer was working in his fields sir hugo rode to the farm with his friends they caught the girl and took her to baskerville hall the poor girl was terrified sir hugo locked her in a bedroom then he started drinking with his gang when he was drunk he became more wild and cruel he shouted at his men and hit them the frightened girl waited until it was dark then she opened a window and escaped from baskerville hall her fathers farm was about four miles away it was night but she was able to follow the path in the moonlight she started to run across the dark moor sir hugo went to the girls room it was empty and sir hugo was terribly angry he ran to his men and jumped onto the table where they were drinking he kicked the plates and glasses off the table fetch the horses he shouted get the girl they all ran outside and jumped onto their horses sir hugo kept a pack of wild dogs for hunting let the dogs find her he shouted the devil can take me if i do not catch her the dogs ran out across the dark moor sir hugo and his men rode after them the dogs barked and sir hugo shouted then they heard another noise it was louder than the noise of barking and shouting the dogs stopped and listened they were afraid the men heard the noise too it was a loud and deep howling sound the sound of a huge dog howling at the moon the men stopped their horses but sir hugo rode on he wanted to catch the girl sir hugo did not catch the girl suddenly his horse stopped and threw him to the ground the horse ran away in terror in the moonlight the men saw a strange black animal it looked liked a dog with huge fiery eyes but it was as big as a horse all the men became very frightened the huge black dog jumped on sir hugo baskerville and killed him the other men ran away into the night and sir hugo was never seen again since that time many of the sons of the baskerville family have died while they were young many of them have died strangely this is the curse of the baskervilles the black dog the hound of the baskervilles still walks on the moor at night well mr holmes what do you think of this story asked dr mortimer i do not think it is a true story said sherlock holmes why do you show me this story do you believe it before sir charles baskervilles death i did not believe the story dr mortimer answered but sir charles believed the story it worried him he became ill and his heart was weak why did he believe this story i asked because he saw the hound on the moor answered dr mortimer or he thought he saw it when sir charles told me this story i told him to take a holiday i told him to go to london for a few weeks and forget all about the curse did he take a holiday i asked no said dr mortimer he planned to go to london the following friday but on the thursday evening he went for a walk on the edge of the moor and he never returned how did he die i asked he died of a heart attack answered dr mortimer his servant came to fetch me i found sir charles near the house on the edge of the moor he was running away from something when he died i am sure of that i think he was terrified of something terrified asked holmes what was he running away from i looked at the ground where sir charles had walked i saw his footprints said dr mortimer but there were other footprints on the ground they were not the footprints of a man they were the footprints of a gigantic hound chapter three the problem holmes and i were surprised this was a very strange story i did not believe that sir charles baskerville had been killed by a gigantic black dog but i wanted to know the truth who else saw these footprints asked sherlock holmes his bright eyes shone and he leant forward in his chair no one else saw the footprints answered dr mortimer there was a lot of rain in the night by morning the footprints had been washed away how large were the footprints were they larger than the footprints of a sheepdog yes mr holmes much larger they were not the prints of an ordinary dog also you say that sir charles ran away from this dog how do you know asked holmes the ground was soft answered dr mortimer i saw sir charles footprints outside baskerville hall his footprints were close together as he walked along a path at the edge of the moor then he stopped and waited by a wooden gate after that his footprints changed they became wide apart and deep i am sure he began to run he ran towards the house i believe that something came from the moor i believe he saw the hound of the baskervilles yes yes said holmes but how do you know that sir charles waited by this wooden gate because he smoked a cigar said dr mortimer i saw the white cigar ash on the ground good said holmes good you are a detective thank you said dr mortimer with a smile but you believe that sir charles was killed by a gigantic hound i know he ran away from something said dr mortimer i know i saw those strange footprints of a huge dog but he looked at his watch i am meeting sir henry baskerville at waterloo station in an hour sir henry is sir charles nephew he has come from canada sir charles had no children so sir henry is now the owner of baskerville hall and now i have a problem what is your problem asked holmes i believe that sir henry is in danger said dr mortimer is it safe to take him to baskerville hall i must think said sherlock holmes stay in london tonight come and see me again tomorrow morning please bring sir henry with you i shall do so said dr mortimer he stood up now i must go to meet sir henry at waterloo station good day when dr mortimer had left holmes said to me we have a problem here watson there are three questions what is the crime who did it how was it done chapter four sir henry baskerville the next morning dr mortimer brought sir henry baskerville to baker street sir henry was about thirty years old he was not tall but he was broad and strong he looked like a boxer how do you do mr holmes said sir henry i arrived in london yesterday and two strange things have happened already please sit down sir henry said holmes tell me what has happened no one knows that i am staying at the northumberland hotel said sir henry but i have received a letter here is the letter you see the words are cut from a newspaper except for the word moor your life is in danger keep away from the moor the words are cut from the times newspaper said holmes but how did this person know where i am staying asked sir henry i do not know said holmes but you said that two strange things have happened what is the other strange thing i have lost a boot said sir henry someone has stolen one of my boots at the hotel one of your boots asked holmes someone took only one yes answered sir henry the boots are new i bought them yesterday and i have never worn them but why take

other business shall we meet at two oclock for lunch at the northumberland hotel we shall come at two said holmes sir henry baskerville and dr mortimer left the house and walked along baker street sherlock holmes watched them through the window of his study quick watson we must follow them said holmes i put on my hat and followed holmes into the street why are we following them i asked in surprise because my dear watson someone else is also following them said holmes look there is the man there in that cab i looked where holmes was pointing a horsedrawn cab was moving slowly along the street a man with a black beard was sitting in the cab he was watching sir henry and dr mortimer as they walked towards oxford street the man with the black beard turned round as holmes pointed at him he saw us and shouted to the cab driver drive drive quickly the cab driver whipped the horse and the cab disappeared round a corner i think we have the answer to one of our questions said holmes that man with the black beard followed sir henry to the northumberland hotel he is the man who sent the letter chapter five the stolen boot we arrived at the northumberland hotel at ten minutes to two sir henry baskerville was talking to the hotel manager two boots in two days sir henry said loudly two boots have disappeared from my room one new boot and one old boot we shall look everywhere sir said the manager we shall find your stolen boots sir henry was silent while we ate lunch he was angry about his stolen boots tell me mr holmes said dr mortimer is it safe for sir henry to go to baskerville hall it is safer than staying in london said holmes do you know that a man followed you this morning followed us said dr mortimer in surprise who followed us a man with a thick black beard said holmes do you know a man with a black beard yes i do replied dr mortimer the servant at baskerville hall has a thick black beard his name is barrymore i cant think why he is following us but i am sure sir henry is in danger it is better if sir henry stays here in london no you are wrong said holmes there are millions of people in london we cannot watch them all there are not as many people on dartmoor everyone will notice someone who is a stranger but this man may not be a stranger said dr mortimer i agree said holmes that is why sir henry must not stay at baskerville hall alone i myself will be busy in london but my good friend dr watson will go with you to dartmoor oh yes of course i said i will certainly go to dartmoor thank you dr watson said sir henry you will be very welcome at baskerville hall good said holmes now sir henry tell me about the other boot which has been stolen it is one of an old pair of boots said sir henry how strange said holmes and tell me sir henry if you

he died in south america i have no living relatives i dont know who will get all my money if i die today and may i ask how much money do you have certainly mr holmes sir charles left me a fortune of one million pounds said sir henry many men will murder their best friend for a million pounds said holmes chapter six baskerville hall on saturday morning sherlock holmes came with me to paddington station this is a dangerous business watson he said stay near to sir henry do not let him walk on the moor alone at night dont worry holmes i said i have brought my army revolver good said holmes write to me every day tell me what you see and hear tell me all the facts everything i said goodbye to sherlock holmes and met sir henry baskerville and dr mortimer at the station the train journey to devon took three hours we looked out of the windows at the green countryside at last we reached dartmoor then the countryside changed from green to grey and we saw broken hills of black rock we got off the train at the small station in grimpen village a driver was waiting with a carriage and horses to take us to baskerville hall as we rode along the narrow country road i saw a soldier on a horse the soldier was carrying a gun and was watching the road i spoke to the driver why is that soldier guarding the road is there some trouble why is that soldier guarding the road is there some trouble yes sir the driver replied a prisoner has escaped from dartmoor prison hes a very dangerous man his name is selden he is a dangerous murderer i looked across the empty moor a cold wind blew and made me shiver holmes believed that someone wanted to murder sir henry baskerville now another murderer was out on the moor i felt that this lonely place was very dangerous i wanted to go back to london there were thick trees all round baskerville hall it looked like a castle it stood alone on the empty moor we stopped outside baskerville hall i must leave you here said dr mortimer i have a lot of work to do and my wife is waiting for me at home i hope you will come to dinner very soon said sir henry i will said dr mortimer and if you ever need me send for me at any time day or night then dr mortimer rode away in the carriage a man with a thick black beard and a pale face came out of the house he greeted sir henry welcome to baskerville hall sir i am barrymore i have been a servant here for many years my wife and i have prepared the house for you shall i show you around the house yes please barrymore said sir henry this is dr watson he will be my guest for a few days very good sir said barrymore he took our cases into the house i looked carefully at barrymore was he the man with a black beard who had followed sir henry in london i was not sure mr and mrs barrymore had looked after the house well everything was in order but the house was a cold and lonely place there was trouble here that night i wrote a letter to sherlock holmes i told him all that i had seen and heard while i was writing i heard a sound a woman crying the only woman in the house was mrs barrymore i wondered why she was so unhappy chapter seven the stapletons of merripit house at breakfast next morning i asked sir henry did you hear a woman crying in the night i heard a sound like crying said sir henry but i thought it was the wind on the moor sir henry had many papers to read i left him sitting at his desk and went for a walk on the moor i walked for two or three miles across the empty moor then behind me i heard a voice call dr watson i looked round i thought it was dr mortimer but i saw a stranger walking towards me my name is stapleton said the man how do you do dr watson i saw dr mortimer this morning and he told me your name i have heard about you you are the friend of the famous detective sherlock holmes arent you yes mr stapleton i am i said and is mr holmes staying at baskerville hall too asked stapleton is he interested in dartmoor mr holmes is in london i said he is a busy man of course said stapleton please come and see my house its very near here i live with my sister stapleton led me along a narrow path across a wide flat part of the moor the land around us was a strange green colour we walked towards a hill of grey rock be very careful dr watson said stapleton stay on the path we are in the great grimpen mire there is a sea of soft mud underneath the grass if you fall in you will never get out again thank you for telling me i said but why do you live here it is a dangerous and lonely place i am a naturalist i study nature said stapleton there are many interesting flowers and birds on the great grimpen mire and there are some unusual animals on dartmoor at that moment we heard a strange sound it was a deep howling sound the sound of a large dog it came from some distance away stapleton is that the sound of a dog i asked it is only the sound of the wind said stapleton the wind blows through the rocks and makes strange sounds but here is my house merripit house on the moor he pointed to the long low farmhouse which we could see near the hill and my sister is coming to meet us miss stapleton was a very attractive woman she was slim and tall with beautiful dark eyes i thought she looked very different from her brother she had dark hair but her brother had fair hair they were both about thirty years old stapleton looked a little older he was a small thin cleanshaven man with a long face how do you do miss stapleton i said your brother has told me about the great grimpen mire and the unusual flowers and birds did you hear that strange sound a moment ago does the wind often make this sound i heard nothing miss stapleton said quickly she looked at her brother and i saw fear in her eyes her brother looked at her angrily let us show dr watson our house he said i stayed for a short time stapleton showed me his collection of flowers and butterflies i will come to baskerville hall to visit sir henry this afternoon said stapleton will you tell him of course i replied now if you will excuse me i must go back to baskerville hall i hope to see you again soon stay on the path said stapleton remember the great grimpen mire many men have died in it miss stapleton walked outside with me she spoke quickly in a quiet voice dr watson i want to tell you about the strange sound you heard the people here say that it is the sound of the hound of the baskervilles they say it killed sir charles and now it will kill sir henry but please do not tell my brother that i spoke to you now go back to london go back today she went into the house quickly i walked along the narrow path slowly thinking about what she had said chapter eight dr watsons first report baskerville hall dartmoor october my dear holmes i wrote and told you about baskerville hall and the people who live here now i have more facts to tell you first i will draw a map of the area it will help you to understand my story baskerville hall is about two miles southwest of grimpen village i walk to the village to post letters there are trees all round the hall and a long avenue leads to a small summerhouse in the garden sir charles baskerville died near the summerhouse i have marked the gate on the map it is where sir charles stood and smoked a cigar the gate opens onto the moor i have told you about the neighbours dr mortimer lives nearby about halfway between the villages of grimpen and coombe tracey i have met the stapletons their house is about three miles from the hall it is on the other side of high tor there is one man i have not met but dr mortimer has told me about him his name is mr frankland and he lives at lafter hall he has a large telescope and is interested in astronomy he uses his telescope to look at the stars in the past few days he has not looked at the stars he has looked at the moor he is watching the moor because the police have not caught the murderer selden mr frankland watches the moor looking for strangers but i do not think that selden is hiding on the moor there is no food and the weather is now very cold sir henry is worried about the stapletons he thinks that the murderer may break into their house he has visited miss stapleton several times and they have become good friends but mr stapleton is a strange man he does not like sir henry visiting his sister now here is some news about barrymore the servant at baskerville hall he looks like the man we saw in the carriage in london you remember the man who followed sir henry and dr mortimer to baker street i told sir henry what i thought and he called barrymore and asked him have you been to london recently barrymore says he has never been to london in his life also sir henrys question made him angry he said he wanted to leave baskerville hall sir henry said he was sorry he gave barrymore some clothes and barrymore was pleased barrymore and his wife thanked sir henry very much for the clothes then last night i saw something very strange in the middle of the night i heard footsteps and i looked out of my bedroom door i saw barrymore with a candle i saw him walk to the end of the corridor he stopped at the large window which looks out over the moor he held the candle to the window and moved it backwards and forwards i went to the window of my own room and looked out across the moor i saw a light moving backwards and forwards it was somewhere near high tor and it was clearly a signal but a signal for what chapter nine the light on the moor baskerville hall dartmoor october my dear holmes i am now able to answer the question at the end of my last letter i know why barrymore signalled with a candle first let me tell you about sir henry and miss stapleton i told you that they are very friendly i have found out that sir henry is in love with her the truth is he wants to marry her yesterday morning he said to me i am going to see miss stapleton i want to go alone but mr holmes told me to stay with you i said you must not go across the moor on your own i shall go alone said sir henry and he went out i did not know what to do i waited for ten minutes then i decided to follow him i did not see everything but this is what happened sir henry met miss stapleton on the moor he asked her to marry him he told me this afterwards they walked towards merripit house to see mr stapleton they met him outside the house sir henry told stapleton the news i reached high tor before sir henry met stapleton so i saw what happened next i saw sir henry talking to stapleton suddenly stapleton became wild and angry he shouted at sir henry then he took his sisters hand and pulled her towards merripit house sir henry turned away and walked back towards the hall he saw me by high tor he was not angry that i had followed him watson he said that man is mad i told him that i want to marry his sister he shouted at me he told me never to see her again i think he is mad i said nothing and we walked back to the hall that afternoon stapleton came to the hall he wanted to speak to sir henry he kept saying i am sorry i was very rude then he invited sir henry to dinner at merripit house on friday night now i will tell you the story of barrymore i told sir henry that i had seen barrymore signal with a candle sir henry said we will wait for him tonight if he signals again we will catch him sir henry and i did not go to bed we sat waiting in sir henrys study until two oclock in the morning then we heard footsteps outside the study we listened the footsteps went upstairs sir henry and i waited for two more minutes then we opened the door quietly and went upstairs we saw barrymore by the large window at the end of the corridor he had a candle in his hand and he was waving the candle in front of the window what are you doing barrymore sir henry shouted barrymore almost dropped the candle he looked frightened nothing sir henry he said im checking the window thats all you are signalling to someone on the moor said sir henry who is outside tell me no one sir said barrymore tell me said sir henry or you shall leave this house tomorrow tell me now sir henry said another voice please dont be angry with my husband it is my fault we turned and saw mrs barrymore she was standing at the top of the stairs holding her hands tightly together my brother is outside sir she said my brother is selden the man who escaped from prison selden the murderer i said and why do you signal to him at night my husband takes him food and clothes said mrs barrymore we signal to tell him my husband is coming i understand said sir henry he is your brother you must try to help him go to your room we will talk about this in the morning the barrymores left the room sir henry turned and spoke to me i am sorry for them but selden is a murderer i must try to catch him look i said look out of the window there is a light on the moor sir henry looked a small light was shining on the moor it was near high tor thats him said sir henry come dr watson we will go to that light bring your revolver we put on our coats quickly and went out onto the moor the moon was bright and so we could see the path across the moor also we could see the signal light it was about a mile away there said sir henry selden is there hurry i followed sir henry along the path across the moor i was worried i did not want sir henry to go far on the moor at night at that moment we heard a strange sound it was a deep howling sound it came from some distance away whats that asked sir henry there was fear in his voice i was afraid too it sounds like a dog i said it sounds like a very large dog shall we turn back no said sir henry we are nearly there look in front of us we saw the signal light clearly it came from a lamp which stood on a rock beside the rock was a man but the man did not see us he was looking in the other direction again we heard that deep howling sound the sound of a huge dog the sound was much nearer now we heard the sound again it was coming nearer all the time the man by the rock heard the sound as well he picked up the lantern and jumped on the rock he looked one way then the other suddenly he jumped off the rock and started to run he ran towards high tor he was running away from us but he was not running away because he saw us he was running away from something else which we could not see quick dr watson follow him shouted sir henry get your revolver ready we ran along the narrow path near us we heard the deep howling sound it was very near and very loud then we heard a scream we stopped be careful dr watson said sir henry let us go forward slowly the night was silent we walked forward slowly there was something or someone lying near the bottom of the tor we went over to it i held my revolver in front of me we found the body of a man at the foot of the tor the man had fallen from the rocky hill he was dead his neck was broken we were sure that the man was selden he was dressed in sir henrys old clothes the clothes that sir henry had given to barrymore i have one last strange thing to tell you holmes i looked up at the tor from which selden had fallen up above at the top of the tor stood a tall thin man i saw him only for a moment then he disappeared into the night but i know i have seen him before i will search for this strange man who walks on the moor at night chapter ten the man on the moor who was the man i had seen on high tor was it the man holmes and i had seen in london but i was sure that the man on high tor did not have a beard sir henry did not see the man on the tor and i said nothing to him there was nothing we could do for selden we went back to the house what had selden run away from what had he seen what had we heard was it the hound of the baskervilles i felt safer in baskerville hall than out on the moor at night sir henry felt the same in the morning we sent for the police they took seldens body away sir henry told the barrymores what had happened but he did not speak about the strange sounds we had heard mrs barrymore cried and covered her face with a handkerchief mr barrymore said it had to end poor selden could not have lived on the moor in winter it is far too cold please forget what i said last night sir henry told them i want you to stay at baskerville hall thank you sir we will said barrymore i went to my room and wrote a long report to sherlock holmes then i decided to go for a walk but i did not want to walk on the moor i did not like the moor usually i posted my letters to holmes in grimpen village but today i decided to walk to coombe tracey the village to the south it took me an hour to walk there along the road on the way i saw stapleton i heard you caught the escaped murderer said stapleton i will look forward to hearing the story from sir henry at dinner tomorrow sir henry is looking forward to dining with you and your sister tomorrow i replied and so is my sister stapleton said coldly i look forward to seeing sir henry tomorrow at eight oclock i will tell him i said good day i walked on to coombe tracey and posted my letter i saw a large house outside the village and asked who lived there that is mr franklands house the village shopkeeper told me dr mortimer had told me about mr frankland and about mr franklands interest in the stars i decided to visit the gentleman and ask to see his telescope mr frankland was standing by his garden gate he was a redfaced elderly man with white hair good day i said my name is watson dr watson asked mr frankland yes i replied i heard that you caught selden last night on the moor said mr frankland i nearly caught him myself how did you do that i asked in surprise with my telescope come and see mr frankland showed me into his house i was very interested in his telescope it was very large and powerful i saw a man on the moor a number of times said mr frankland why did you not tell the police i asked i was not sure that it was the murderer he replied i began to think that perhaps there were two men on the moor but why would anyone want to live out on the moor there is no food and the weather is cold then yesterday i saw something what did you see i asked i saw someone taking food out on the moor answered mr frankland at night i asked i thought of barrymore and his signal light perhaps mr frankland had seen barrymore taking food and clothing out to selden no said mr frankland i saw a boy taking food during the day and letters letters i asked are you sure very sure said mr frankland because i know the boy i asked the postman and learnt that the boy collects letters every day and where does he take them i asked look through the telescope said mr frankland look at that old farmhouse to the right of high tor that is high tor farm someone lives there but i do not know who he is a stranger i looked through the telescope at high tor on the left of the tor i saw the roof of merripit house where the stapletons lived on the right i saw an old farmhouse the roof was broken and so was one wall but i saw smoke coming from the chimney thank you mr frankland i said whoever lives there is not selden selden is dead i said goodbye to mr frankland then i decided to walk across the moor and look at old high tor farm it was a mile or two away and i reached it late in the afternoon the sun was low in the sky and the air was cold i walked up to the farmhouse slowly the door broken and i looked inside the farmhouse was empty and silent part of the farmhouse was dry where the roof was not broken there was a wood fire on the floor and a bed in the corner a lamp stood on a table with a pile of papers next to it i went into the farmhouse carefully i put my hand into my jacket pocket where i kept my army revolver i walked slowly to the table and looked at the pile of papers i saw one of my own letters someone had stolen one of my own letters who lived in the farmhouse was it the man with the black beard was it the man i had seen on the tor i soon found out as i heard the sound of footsteps outside i took my revolver out of my pocket and turned towards the door a tall thin man stood in the doorway with his back to the setting sun i could not see his face it is a lovely evening isnt it watson the man said the man was sherlock holmes chapter eleven high tor farm holmes i said in surprise what are you doing here i am watching said holmes i am waiting for the murderer to show himself the murderer do you mean selden selden is dead i know i was on the tor last night and saw what happened holmes said someone wanted to kill sir henry baskerville not selden but how long have you been here i asked and why are you here in secret i came here on the same day as you answered sherlock holmes i came in secret because the murderer is clever he will not show himself if he knows i am here and what about my letters i asked have you read them yes i have holmes replied they were sent to me from london but i have not read your report of last night come tell me about it as we walk to baskerville hall he left the farmhouse and i walked quickly after him the sun had gone down and it was getting dark a thick white mist was rising from the moor you are a good detective said holmes tell me how did you find me how did you know i was at high tor farm i did not know it was you i answered mr frankland saw you through his telescope and he saw the boy who brought you food and letters he thought you were selden the murderer also i saw you last night on the tor i see said holmes if you saw me i think the murderer of sir charles baskerville saw me too he will want to kill me as well as sir henry so i said you think that sir charles was murdered i am sure of it said holmes now stay on the path it was dark and the moon had not come up we had to walk carefully the path went through the great grimpen mire and a sea of soft mud lay under the grass on either side of us behind us we heard that strange sound the deep howling sound i had heard on the moor last night it made me shiver with fear what is it holmes i asked do you know what makes that sound no he answered but the village people say it is the hound of the baskervilles i will not go back to high tor farm tonight come we must hurry keep your revolver ready we walked quickly along the dark path i was pleased to see the lights of baskerville hall in front of us i was afraid of what was behind us out on the moor at night chapter twelve setting the trap mr sherlock holmes said sir henry baskerville what a surprise welcome to baskerville hall thank you said holmes but you did not obey my orders last night you went out on the moor you were nearly murdered but i did not go alone said sir henry dr watson was with me he has a revolver to protect me and i shall protect you too said holmes next time you go out on the moor at night both dr watson and i will go with you the next time sir henry began the next time will be tomorrow night said holmes dr watson tells me that you are going to dinner at merripit house on the moor i believe the stapletons have invited you yes sir henry said and has dr watson told you that i want to marry miss stapleton yes he has said holmes now i would like to ask barrymore some questions sir henry called for his servant barrymore barrymore came and stood in front of us sherlock holmes looked at him carefully was this the man with the black beard we had seen in london tell me about sir charles baskerville holmes said to barrymore did he often go for a walk at night no sir said barrymore sir charles did not often leave the house at night but on the night he died he went for a walk on the edge of the moor said holmes we know he stood by the gate on the edge of the moor for about ten minutes was he waiting for someone im not sure sir said barrymore i remember that sir charles received a letter that day a letter holmes asked why do you remember this letter did you read it no sir barrymore said i never read sir charles letters but sir charles usually kept his letters on his desk this letter was unusual he read it then he put it on the fire oh so he burnt it holmes said perhaps this letter asked him to meet someone perhaps he went to this meeting and met someone or something but why did sir charles burn the letter i asked why do people burn letters watson asked holmes often because they have something to hide but sir charles was afraid to go out on the moor at night dr mortimer told us that sir charles believed the story of the hound of the baskervilles why would he go out on the moor alone at night if he was going to meet someone it was someone he knew but why meet on the edge of the moor was it a secret meeting do you think sir charles was murdered by a friend i asked i think he knew his murderer replied holmes and i think his murderer is not far away after dinner we sat in the library there were paintings of the baskerville family hanging on the walls some of the paintings were very old sherlock holmes looked at the paintings carefully he was interested in the painting of sir hugo baskerville dated interesting watson very interesting said holmes here is a painting of sir hugo the man who started the story of the hound of the baskervilles i am able to remember faces look at this black beard and the face have you seen this face before yes holmes i said it is the face of the man we saw in london it is the man who followed sir henry in a cab chapter thirteen the hound of the baskervilles holmes got up early the next morning he went to grimpen village and sent a telegram when he returned to baskerville hall he was excited we shall go hunting tonight he said and inspector lestrade from scotland yard will come with us why are we waiting until tonight i asked you know who the murderer is holmes why cant we catch him before tonight we must make sure we have the right man holmes said we must wait we will catch him tonight inspector lestrade arrived from london at five oclock we met him at grimpen station he was a short man with bright eyes he and sherlock holmes were good friends he and holmes talked together as we drove to baskerville hall at half past seven when sir henry left the hall we were ready sir henry walked along the path across the great grimpen mire towards merripit house the stapletons had asked him to come to dinner at eight oclock the three of us followed him lestrade holmes and i each of us carried a revolver we saw sir henry go into merripit house we waited below high tor about two hundred yards from the house the lights burned brightly in merripit house and the curtains of the dining room were open we saw sir henry talking to stapleton where is miss stapleton i said to holmes sir henry has come to see her not her brother perhaps stapleton wants to talk to sir henry alone holmes said but look the mist is rising soon we will not be able to see i looked around thick white mist was rising from the great grimpen mire shall we climb up the tor i asked perhaps we will be able to see better from above the mist we climbed a little way up the tor but the mist was so thick we could see only a few yards in front of us i did not think of this said holmes our plan may fail if we cannot see clearly we must listen for any sounds from merripit house we waited in the mist and the moon came up the white moonlight shone through the mist but we could not see merripit house or the path across the moor we listened at last we heard a door open then the sound of voices stapleton was saying goodnight to sir henry then we heard footsteps below the tor someone was walking along a stony part of the path at the same time we heard another sound it was the sound of a metal chain and came from merripit house then we heard the deep howling sound of a huge dog the hound holmes shouted sir henry sir henry climb the tor we are here on the tor hurry lestrade moved forward to help sir henry but we could not see clearly in the mist keep back holmes shouted to lestrade lestrade cried out and fired his revolver into the mist we saw the yellow flash of the revolver and we heard the loud bang its coming lestrade cried out he fired again in the light of the flash we saw a huge black shape its eyes and jaws were burning bright with fire it was a horrible huge monster it ran past lestrade we heard sir henry cry out we heard the sound of falling stones holmes and i both fired our revolvers at the black shape we heard a howl we fired again and again then we moved forward carefully and climbed down the tor sir henry was at the bottom of the tor he had fallen but he was not hurt he now stood up carefully what was it mr holmes he asked what was that thing in the mist holmes walked along the path reloading his revolver with bullets we are safe he called back the dog is dead i went to look there on the path lay the largest black dog i have ever seen fire burned around the dogs eyes and mouth blood was pouring from its head could it have killed sir henry i asked it would have frightened him said holmes the path across the great grimpen mire is narrow if he had run in the dark sir henry would have fallen into the mire and died but where did it come from i asked and why is its head burning with fire i believe it was kept in merripit house said holmes the fire is easy to explain he touched the dogs head with his fingers it is a special paint he said come let us find the murderer we walked back to merripit house the door was open sir henry went into the house miss stapleton he shouted where is she she did not join us for dinner a sound came from one of the rooms sir henry pushed the door open miss stapleton lay on the bed her hands and feet were tied together there was a cloth tied across her mouth sir henry cut the rope around her hands holmes took the cloth from her mouth where is your brother miss stapleton sir henry asked miss stapleton looked at the floor gone she said my husband has gone your husband shouted sir henry you are mrs stapleton yes i am his wife she said but his name is not stapleton he is the son of your dead uncle roger baskerville he is your cousin out on the moor we heard a terrible cry we ran outside the mist was thick on the great grimpen mire the cry came again and then a loud scream then silence i believe that the great grimpen mire has taken your cousin holmes said to sir henry he has fallen into the mire we shall never find his body chapter fourteen back in baker street there are still some things i dont understand i said to holmes tell me who was stapleton why did he want to kill sir henry it is simple my dear watson said holmes remember sir charles had two brothers the youngest brother roger was a bad man he got into trouble over money and went to south america he died in venezuela he did not marry so no one knew he had a son and this son called himself stapleton yes and the son was both bad and clever he wanted the baskerville money there were only two baskervilles left alive sir charles and sir henry if they died baskerville hall would belong to stapleton what about his wife why did stapleton say she was his sister at first stapleton wanted her to marry sir charles or sir henry that was a way of getting the money what an evil man i said but she did not want to help stapleton she tried to warn both of them didnt she yes she tried to meet sir charles the night he died but stapleton found out stapleton waited for sir charles and frightened him to death with the black dog also mrs stapleton sent the note to sir henry at the northumberland hotel then sir henry fell in love with mrs stapleton so stapleton was worried and angry at last stapleton had to tie her up to stop her telling sir henry and stapleton was the man with the black beard yes he tried to hide his face he put on a beard when he followed sir henry in london what about the missing boots i asked the dog and the boots go together holmes said stapleton knew the silly story about the hound of the baskervilles and he knew that sir charles believed the story so stapleton bought that huge black dog and let it walk on the moor at night but the boots i said what about the stolen boots watson you are very slow said holmes it was a hunting dog hunting dogs will follow a smell stapleton wanted some of sir henrys clothes to give to the dog he paid a waiter at the hotel to steal the boots but the first boot did not work because it was new it did not have sir henrys smell then remember the dog hunted selden because selden was wearing sir henrys old clothes what a strange story i said stapleton was clever yes my dear watson said holmes i needed your help to catch him now why dont you write about it perhaps you can call your story the case of the stolen boot the end
