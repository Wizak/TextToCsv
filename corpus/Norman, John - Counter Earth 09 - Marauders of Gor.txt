 marauders of gor chapter the hall i sat alone in the great hall in the darkness in the captains chair the walls of stone some five feet in thickness formed of large blocks loomed about me before me over the long heavy table behind which i sat i could see the large tiles of the hall floor the table was not dark and bare no longer was it set with festive yellow and scarlet cloths woven in distant tor no longer did it bear the freight of plates of silver from the mines of tharna nor of cunningly wrought goblets of gold from the smithies of luxurious turia ar of the south it was long since i had tasted the fiery paga of the satarna fields north of the vosk now even the wines from the vineyards of ar seemed bitter to me i looked up at the narrow apertures in the wall to my right through them i could see certain of the stars of gor in the tarnblack sky the hall was dark no longer did the several torches bristling and tarred burn in the iron rings at the wall the hall was silent no musicians played no cup companions laughed and drank lifting their goblets on the broad flat tiles before me under the torches barefoot collared in scarlet silks bells at their wrists and ankles there danced no slave girls the hall was large and empty and silent i sat alone seldom did i have my chair carried from the hall i remained much in this place i heard footsteps approaching i did not turn my head it was caused me pain to do so captain i heard it was luma the chief scribe of my house in her blue robe and sandals her hair was blond and straight tied behind her head with a ribbon of blue wool from the bounding hurt died in the blood of the vosk sorp she was a scrawny girl not attractive but with deep eyes blue and she was a superb scribe in her accounting swift incisive accurate brilliant once she had been a paga slave though a poor one i had slaved her from surbus a captain who had purchased her to slay her she not having served him to his satisfaction in the alcoves of the tavern he would have cast her bound to the swift silken urts in the canals i had dealt surbus his death blow but before he had died i had on the urging of the woman she moved to pity carried him to the roof of the tavern that he might before his eyes closed look once more upon the sea he was a pirate and a cutthroat but he was not unhappy in his death he had died by the sword which would have been his choice and before he had died he had looked again upon the gleaming thassa it is called the death of blood and the sea he died not unhappy men of port kar do not care to die in their beds weak lingering at the mercy of tiny foes that cannot see they live often by violence and desire that they shall similarly perish to die by the sword is regarded as the right and honour of he who lives by it captain said the woman standing back to one side of the chair after the death of surbus the woman had been mine i had won her from him by sword right i had of course as she had expected put her in my collar and kept her slave to my astonishment however by the laws of port kar the ships properties and chattels of surbus he having been vanquished in fair combat and permitted death of blood and sea became mine his men stood ready to obey me his ships became mine to command his hall became my hall his riches mine his slaves mine it was thus that i had become a captain in port kar jewel of gleaming thassa i have the accounts for your inspection said luma luma no longer wore a collar after the victory of the th of sekara over the fleets of tyros and cos i had freed her she had much increased my fortunes freed she took payment but not as much as her services i knew warranted few scribes i expected were so skilled in the supervision and management of complex affairs as this light unattractive brilliant girl other captains other merchants seeing the waxing of my fortunes and understanding the commercial complexities involved had offered this scribe considerable emoluments to join their service she however had refused to do so i expect she was pleased at the authority and trust and freedom which i had accorded her too perhaps she had grown fond of the house of bosk i do not wish to see the accounts i told her the venna and tela have arrived from scagnar she said with full cargoes of the fur of sea sleen my information indicates that highest prices currently for such products are being paid in asperiche very well i said give the men time for their pleasure eight days and have the cargoes transferred to one of my round ships whichever can be most swiftly fitted and embark them for asperiche the venna and tela as convoy yes captain said luma go now i said i do not wish to see the accounts yes captain she said at the door she stopped does the captain wish food or drink she asked no i told her thurnock she said would be pleased should you play with him a game of kaissa i smiled huge yellowhaired thurnock he of the peasants master of the great bow wished to play kaissa with me he knew himself no match for me in this game thank thurnock for me said i but i do not wish to play i had not played kaissa since my return from the northern forests thurnock was a good man a kind man the yellowhaired giant meant well the accounts said luma are excellent your enterprises are prospering you are much richer go said i scribe go luma she left i sat alone in the darkness i did not wish to be disturbed i looked about the hall at the great walls of stone the long table the tiles the narrow apertures through which i could glimpse the far stars burning in the scape of the night i was rich so luma said so i knew i smiled bitterly there are few men as helpless as impoverished as i it was true that the fortunes of the house of bosk had waxed mightily i supposed there were few merchants in known gor whose houses were as rich as powerful as mine doubtless i was the envy of men who did not know me bosk the recluse who had returned crippled from the northern forests i was rich but i was poor because i could not move the left side of my body wounds had i at the shore of thassa high on the coast at the edge of the forests when one night i had in a stockade of enemies commanded by sarus of tyros chosen to recollect my honour never could i regain my honour but i had recollected it and never had i forgotten it once i had been tarl cabot in the songs called tarl of bristol i recalled that i or what had once been i had fought at the siege of ar that young man with fiery hair laughing innocent seemed far from me now this huddled mass half paralysed bitter like a maimed larl sitting alone in a captains chair in a great darkened hall my hair was no longer now the same the sea the wind and the salt and i suppose the changes in my body as i had matured and learned with bitterness the nature of the world and myself and men had changed it it was now i thought not much different from that of other men as i had learned too that i was not much different either from others it had turned lighter now and more straw coloured tarl cabot was gone he had fought in the siege of ar one could still here the songs he had restored lara tatrix of tharna to her throne he had entered the sardar and was one of the few men who knew the true nature of the priestkings those remote and extraordinary beings who controlled the world of gor he had been instrumental in the nest war and had earned the friendship and gratitude of the priestking misk glorious gentle misk there is nest trust between us misk had told him i recalled that i in the palms of my hands had felt the delicate touch of the antennae of that golden creature yes there is nest trust between us tarl cabot told him and he had gone to the land of the wagon peoples to the plains of turia and had obtained there the last egg of the priestkings and had returned it safe to the sardar he had well served priestkings had tarl cabot that young brave distant man so fine so proud so much of the warriors and he had gone too to ar and there defeated the schemes of cernus and the hideous aliens the others intent on the conquest of gor and then the earth he had well served priestkings that young man and then he had ventured to the delta of the vosk to make his way through it to make contact with samos of port kar agent of priestkings to continue in their service but in the delta of the vosk he had lost his honour he had betrayed his codes there merely to save his miserable life he had chosen ignominious slavery to the freedom of honourable death he had sullied the sword the honour which he had pledged to korobas home stone by that act he had cut himself away from his codes his vows for such an act there was no atonement even to the throwing of ones body upon ones sword it was in that moment of his surrender to his cowardice that tarl cabot was gone and in his place knelt a slave contemptuously named bosk for a great shambling oxlike creature of the plains of gor but this bosk forcing his mistress the beautiful telima to grant him his freedom had come to port kar bringing her with him as his slave and had there after many adventures earned riches and fame and the title even of admiral of port kar he stood high in the council of captains and was it no he who had been victor on the th of sekara in the great engagement of the fleets of port kar and cos and tyros he had come to love telima and had freed her but when he had learned the location of his former free companion talena once daughter of marlenus of ar and vowed to free her from slavery telima had left him in the fury of a gorean female and returned to the rence marshes her home in the vosks vast delta a true gorean he knew would have gone after her and brought her back in slave bracelets and a collar but he in his weakness had wept and let her go doubtless she despised him now in the marshes and so tarl cabot gone bosk merchant of port kar had gone to the northern forests to free talena once his free companion there he had encountered marlenus of ar urbar of ar urbar of urbars he though only of the merchants had saved marlenus of ar from the degradation of slavery that one such as he had been of service to the great marlenus of ar doubtless was tantamount to insult but marlenus had been freed earlier he had disowned his daughter talena for she had sued for her freedom a slaves act his honour had been kept that of tarl cabot could not be recovered but i recalled that i had in the stockade of tyros recollected the matter of honour i had entered the stockade alone not expecting to survive it was not that i was the friend of marlenus of ar or his ally it was rather that i had as a warrior or one once of such as caste set myself the task of his liberation i had accomplished this task and in the night under the stars i had recollected a neverforgotten honour but wounds had i to show for this act and a body heavy with pain whose left side i could not move i had recollected my honour but it had won for me only the chair of a cripple to be sure carved in wood high on the chair was the helmet with crest of sleenfur the mark of the captain but i could not rise from the chair my own body and its weakness held me as chains could not proud and mighty as the chair might be it was the throne only of the maimed remains of a man i was rich i gazed into the darkness of the hall samos of port kar had purchased talena as a mere slave from two panther girls obtaining her with ease in this manner while i had risked my life in the forest i laughed but i had recollected my honour but little good had it done me was honour not a sham a fraud an invention of clever men to manipulate their less wily brethren why had i not returned to port kar and left marlenus to his fate to slavery and doubtless eventually to a slaves death broken and helpless under the lashes of overseers in the quarries of tyros i sat in the darkness and wondered on honour and courage if they were shams i thought them most precious shams how else could we tell ourselves from urts and sleens what distinguishes us from such beasts the ability to multiply and subtract to tell lies to make knives no i think particularly it is the sense of honour and the will to hold ones ground but i had no right to such thoughts for i had surrendered my honour my courage in the delta of the vosk i had behaved as might have any animal not a man i could not recover my honour but i could and did upon one occasion recollect it in a stockade at the shore of thassa at the edge of the northern forests i grew cold in the blankets i had become petulant bitter petty as an invalid frustrated and furious at his own weakness does but when i half paralysed and crippled had left the shores of thassa i had left behind me a beacon a mighty beacon formed from the logs of the stockade of sarus and it blazed behind me visible for more than fifty pasangs at sea i did not know why i had set the beacon but i had done so it had burned long and fiery in the gorean night on the stones of the beach and then in the morning it would have been ashes and the winds and rains would have scattered them and there would have been little left save the stones the sand and the prints of the feet of sea birds tiny like the thiefs brand in the sand but it would once have burned and that was fixed undeniable a part of what had been that it had burned nothing could change that not the eternities of time not the will of priestkings the machinations of others the wilfulness and hatred of men nothing could change that it had been that once on the beach there a beacon had burned i wondered how men should live in my chair i had thought long on such matters i knew only that i did not know the answer to this question yet it is an important question is it not many wise men give wise answers to this question and yet they do not agree among themselves only the simple the fools the unreflective the ignorant know the answer to this question perhaps to a question this profound the answer cannot be known perhaps it is a question too deep to be answered yet we do know there are false answers to such a question this suggests that there may be a true answer for how can there be falsity without truth one thing seems clear to me that a morality which produces guilt and selftorture which results in anxiety and agony which shortens lifespans cannot be the answer but what is not mistaken the goreans have very different notions of morality from those of earth yet who is to say who is the more correct i envy sometimes the simplicities of those of earth and those of gor who creatures of their conditioning are untroubled by such matters but i would not be s either of them if either should be correct it is for them no more than a lucky coincidence they would have fallen into truth but to take truth for granted is not to know it truth not won is not possessed we are not entitled to truths for which we have not fought do we not know learn by living as we learn to speak by speaking to paint by painting to build by building those who best know how to live sometimes it seems to me are those least likely to be articulate in such skills it is not that they have not learned but having learned they find they cannot tell what they know for only words can be told and what is learned in living is more than words other than words beyond words we can say this building is beautiful but we do not learn the beauty of the building from the words the building it is which teaches us its beauty and how can one speak the beauty of the building as it is does one say it has so many pillars that it has a roof of a certain type and such can one simply say the building is beautiful yes one can say that but what one learns when one sees the beauty of the building cannot be spoken it is not words it is the buildings beauty the morality of earth from the gorean point of view is a morality which would be viewed as more appropriate to slaves than free men it would be seen in terms of the envy and resentment of inferiors for their superiors it lays great stress on equalities and being humble and being pleasant and avoiding friction and being ingratiating and small it is a morality in the best interest of slaves who would be only too eager to be regarded as the equals of others we are all the same that is the hope of slaves that is what it is in their best interests to convince others of the gorean morality on the other hand is more one of inequalities based on the assumption that individuals are not the same but quite different in many ways it might be said to be though this is oversimple a morality of masters guilt is almost unknown in gorean morality though shame and anger are not many earth moralities encourage resignation and accommodation gorean morality is bent more towards conquest and defiance many earth moralities encourage tenderness pity and gentleness sweetness gorean morality encourages honor courage hardness and strength to gorean morality many earth moralities might ask why so hard to these earth moralities the gorean ethos might ask why so soft i have sometimes thought that the goreans might do well to learn something of tenderness and perhaps that those of earth might do well to learn something of hardness but i do not know how to live i have sought the answers but i have not found them the morality of slaves says you are equal to me we are both the same the morality of masters says we are not equal we are not the same become equal to me then we will be the same the morality of slaves reduces all to bondage the morality of masters encourages all to attain if they can the heights of freedom i know of no prouder more selfreliant more magnificent creature than the free gorean male or female they are often touchy and viciously tempered but they are seldom petty or small moreover they do not hate and fear their bodies or their instincts when they restrain themselves it is a victory over titanic forces not the consequence of a slow metabolism but sometimes they do not restrain themselves they do not assume that their instincts and blood are enemies and spies saboteurs in the house of themselves they know them and welcome them as part of their persons they are as little suspicious of them as the cat of its cruelty or the lion of its hunger their desire for vengeance their will to speak out and defend themselves their lust they regard as intrinsically and gloriously a portion of themselves as their thinking or their hearing many earth moralities make people little the object of gorean morality for all its faults is to make people free and great these objectives are quiet different it is clear to see accordingly one would expect that the implementing moralities would also be considerably different i sat in the darkness and thought on these things there were no maps for me i tarl talbot or bosk of port kar was torn between worlds i did not know how to live i was bitter but the goreans have a saying which came to me in the darkness in the hall do not ask the stones or the trees how to live they cannot tell you they do not have tongues do not ask the wise man how to live for if he knows he will know he cannot tell you if you would learn how to live do not ask the question its answer is not in the question but in the answer which is not in words do not ask how to live but instead proceed to do so i do not fully understand this saying how for example can one proceed to do what one doers not know how to do the answer i suspect is that the gorean belief is that one does truly in some way know how to live though one may not know that one knows the knowledge is regarded as being somehow within one perhaps it is regarded as being somehow innate or a function of instincts i do not know the saying may also be interpreted as encouraging one to act to behave to do and then in the acting the doing the behaving to learn these two interpretations of course are not incompatible the child one supposes has the innate disposition when a certain maturation level is attained to struggle to its feet and walk as it did to crawl when an earlier level was attained and yet it truly learns to crawl and to walk and then to run only in the crawling in the walking and running the refrain ran through my mind do not ask how to live but instead proceed to do so but how could i live i a cripple huddled in the chair of a captain in a darkened hall i was rich but i envied the meanest herder of verr the lowest peasant scattering dung in his furrows for they could move as they pleased i tried to clench my left fist but the hand did not move how should one live in the codes of the warriors there is a saying be strong and do as you will the swords of others will set your limits i had been one of the finest swordsmen on gor but now i could not move the left side of my body but i could still command steel that of my men who for no reason i understood they goreans remained true to me loyal to a cripple confined to a captains chair in a darkened hall i was grateful to them but i would show them nothing of this for i was a captain they must not be demeaned within the circle of each mans sword say the codes of the warrior therein is each man a ubar steel is the coinage of the warrior say the codes with it he purchases what pleases him when i had returned from the northern forests i had resolved not to look upon talena once daughter of marlenus of ar whom samos had purchased from panther girls but i had had my hair carried to his hall shall i present her to you asked samos naked and in bracelets no i had said present her in the most resplendent robes you can find as befits a highborn woman of the city of ar but she is a slave he said her thigh bears the brand of treve her throat is encircled in the collar of my house as befits said i a highborn woman of the city of glorious ar and so it was that she talena once daughter of marlenus of ar then disowned once my companion was ushered into my presence the slave said samos don not kneel i said to her strip your face slave said samos gracefully the girl the property of samos first slaver of port kar removed her veil unfastening it dropping it about her shoulders we looked once more upon each other i saw again those marvellous green eyes those lips luscious perfect for crushing beneath a warriors mouth and teeth the subtle complexion olive she removed a pin from her hair and with a small movement of her head shook loose the wealth of her sable hair we regarded one another is master pleased she asked it has been a long time talena said i yes she said it has been long he is free said samos it has been long master she said many years said i many years i smiled at her i last saw you on the night of our companionship when i awakened you were gone she said i was abandoned not of my own free will did i leave you said i that was not of my will i saw in the eyes of samos that i must not speak of priestkings it had been them who had returned me then to earth i do not believe you she said watch your tongue girl said samos if you command me to believe you she said i shall of course for i am slave i smiled no i said i do not command you i was kept in great honor in koroba she said respected and free for i had been your companion even after the year of companionship had gone and it had not been renewed at that point in gorean law the companionship had been dissolved the companionship had not been renewed by the twentieth hour the gorean midnight of its anniversary when priestkings by fire signs made it clear koroba was to be destroyed i left the city no stone would be allowed to stand upon another stone no man of koroba to stand by another the population had been scattered the city razed by the power of the priestkings you fell slave i said within five days she said as i tried to return to ar i was sheltered by an itinerant leather worker who did not believe of course that i was the daughter of marlenus of ar he treated me well the first evening with gentleness and honor i was grateful in the morning to his laughter i awakened his collar was on my throat she looked at me angrily he then used me well do you understand he forced me to yield to him i the daughter of marlenus of ar he only a leather worker afterwards he whipped me he taught me to obey at night he chained me he sold me to a salt merchant she regarded me i have had many masters she said among them i said rask of treve she stiffened i served him well she said i was given no choice it was he who branded me she tossed her head until then many masters had regarded me as too beautiful to brand they were fools said samos a brand improves a slave she put her head in the air i had no doubt that this was one of the most beautiful women in gor it is because of you i gather said she to me that i have been permitted clothing for this interview further i have you to thank i gather that i have been given the opportunity to wash the stink of the pens from my body i said nothing the cages are not pleasant she said my cage measures four paces by four paces in it are twenty girls food is thrown to us from above we drink from a trough shall i have her whipped asked samos she paled no i said rask of treve gave me to a panther girl in his camp one named verna i was taken to the northern forests my present master noble samos of port kar purchased me at the shore of thassa i was brought to port kar chained top a ring in the hold of his ship here in spite of my birth i was placed in a pen with common girls you are only another slave said samos i am the daughter of marlenus of ar she said proudly in the forest i said it is my understanding that you sued for freedom begging in a missive that your father purchase you yes she said i did are you aware i asked that against you on his sword and on the medallion of ar marlenus swore the oath of disownment i do not believe it she said you are no longer his daughter i said you are now without caste without homestone without family you lie she screamed kneel to the whip said samos piteously she knelt a slave girl her wrists were crossed under her as though bound her head was to the floor the bow of her back was exposed she shuddered i had little doubt but what this slave knew well and much feared the disciplining kiss of the gorean slave lash samos sword was in his hand thrust under the collar of her garment ready to thrust in and lift parting the garment causing the robes to fall to either side about her then naked body do not punish her i told samos samos looked at me irritably the slave had not been pleasing to his sandal salve said samos i felt talenas lips press to my sandal forgive me master she whispered rise i said she rose to her feet and stepped back i could see that she feared samos you were disowned i told her your status now whether you know this or not is less than that of the meanest peasant wench secure in her caste rights i do not believe you she said do you not care for me i asked talena she pulled the riobes down from her throat i wear a collar she said i saw the simple circular gray collar the collar of the house of samos locked around her throat what is her price i asked samos i paid ten pieces of gold for her said samos she seemed startled that she had sold for so small a sum yet for a girl late in the season high on the coast of thassa it was a marvelous price doubtless she had obtained it only because she was so beautiful yet to be sure it was less than she would have brought if expertly displayed on the block in turia or ar or koroba or tharna or port kar i will give you fifteen i said very well said samos with my right hand i reached into the pouch at my belt and drew out the coins i handed them to samos free her i said samos with a general key one used for many of the gray collars unlocked the band of steel which encircled her lovely throat am i truly free she asked yes i said i should have brought a thousand of gold she said as daughter of marlenus of ar my companion price might be a thousand tarns five thousand tharlarion you are no longer the daughter of marlenus of ar i told her you are a liar she said she looked at me contemptuously with you permission said samos i shall withdraw stay said i samos very well said he long ago said i talena we cared for each other we were companions irt was a foolish girl who cared for you said talena i am now a waoman you no longer care for me i asked she looked at me i am free she said i can speak what i wish look at yourself you cannot even walk you cannot even move your left arm you are a cripple a cripple you make me ill do you think that one such as i the daughter of marlenus of ar could care for such a thing look upon me i am beautiful look upon yourself you are a cripple care for you you are a fool a fool yes i said bitterly i am a fool she turned away from me robes swirling then she turned and faced me slave she sneered i do not understand i said i took the liberty said samos though at the time i did not know of your injuries your paralysis to inform her of what occured in the delta of the vosk my right hand clenched i was furious i am sorry said samos it is no secret i said it is known to many it is a wonder that any man will follow you cried talena you betrayed your codes you are a coward a fool you are not worthy of me that you dare ask me if i could care for such as you is to me a free woman an insult you chose slavery to death why did you tell her of the delta of the vosk i asked samos so that if there might have been love between you it would no longer exist said samos you are cruel i said truth is cruel said samos she would have to know sooner or later why did you tell her i asked that she might not care for you and lure you from the service of those whose names we shall not now speak i could never care for a cripple said talena it remained yet my hope said samos to recall you to a lofty service one dignified and of desperate importance i laughed samos shrugged i did know until too late the consequences of your wounds i am sorry now said i samos i cannot even serve myself i am sorry said samos coward traitor to your codes sllen cried talena all that you say is true i told her you did well i understand said samos in the stockade of sarus of tyros i wish to be returned to my father said talena i drew forth five pieces of gold this money said i to samos is for safe passage for ar by guard and tarn for this woman talena drew about her face her veil refastening it i shall have the monies returned to you she said no i said take it rather as a gift as a token of a former affection once borne to you by one who was honoured to be your companion she is a shesleen said samos vicious and ignoble my father would avenge that insult she said coldly with the tarn cavalries of ar you have been disowned said samos and turned and left i still held the five coins in my hand give me the coinsd said talena i held them in my hand in the palm she came to me and snatched them away as loath to touch me then she stood and faced me the coins in her hand how ugly you are she said how hideous in your chair i did not speak she turned and strode toward the door of the hall at the portal she stopped and turned in my veins she said flows the blood of marlenus of ar how revolting and incredible that one such as you a coward and betrayer of codes should have aspired to touch me she lifted the coins in her hand it was gloved my gratitude said she sir and turned away talena i cried she turned to face me once more it is nothing i said and you will let me go she said she smiled contemptuously you were never a man she said always you were a boy a weakling she lifted the coins again in her hand farewell weakling said she and left the room i now sat in my own hall in the darkness thinking on many things i wondered how to live within the circle od each mans sword says the codes of the warrior therein is each man a ubar steel is the coinage of the warrior says the codes with it he purchases what pleases him once i had been among the finest swordsmen on the planet gor now i was a cripple talena would now be in ar how startled how crushed would she have been to learn at last incontrovertibly that her disownment was true she had beeged to be purchased a slaves act marlenus protecting his honor on his sword and upon the medallion of ar had sworn her from him no longer had she caste no longer a homestone the meanest peasant wench secure in her caste right would be more than talena even a slave giorl had her collar i knew that marlenus would keep her sequestered in the central cylinder that her shame not reflect upon his glory she would be in ar in effect a prisoner she was no longer entitled even to call its homestone her own such an act by one such as she was subject to public discipline for it she might be suspended naked on a forty foot rope from one of the high bridges to be lashed by tarnsmen sweeping past her in flight i had watched her go i had not attempted to stop her and when telima had fled my house when i had determined to seek talena in the northern forests i had too let her go i smiled a true gorean i knew would have followed her and brought her back in bracelets and collar i thought then of vella once elizabeth cardwell whom i had encountered in the city of lydius at the mouth of the laurius river below the borders of the forest i had once loved her and had wanted to return her safe to earth but she had not honored my will but that night had saddled my tarn great ubar of the skies and fled the sardar when the bird had returned i in fury had driven it away then i encountered the girl in a paga tavern in lydius she had fallen slave her flight had been a brave act i admired her but it was an act not without its consequences she had gambled she had lost in an alcove after i had used her she had begged me to buy her to free her it was a slaves act like that of talena i left her slave in the paga tavern before i had left i had informed her master sarpedon of lydius that as he did not know she was an exquisitely trained pleasure slave and a most stimulating performer of slave dances i had not returned that night to see her dance in the sand to please her customers i had matters of business to attend to she had not honored my will she was only a female she had cost me a tarn she had told me that i had become harder more gorean i wondered if it were true or not a true gorean i speculated would not have left her in the paga tavern a true gorean i speculated would have purchased her and brought her back to put her with his other women a delicious new slave fopr his house i smiled to myself the girl elizabeth cardwell once a secretary in new york was one of the most delicious weches i had ever seen in slave silk her thigh bore the brand of the four bosk horns no i had not treated her as would have a true gorean i had not brought her back in my collar to serve my pleasures and too i knew that i had in my fevered delirium attendant on my wounds when i lay in the stern castle of the tesephone cried out her name this had shamed me and was weakness though i was half motionless though i could not close the fingers of my left hand i resolved that i must burn from myself the vestiges of weakness there was still much in me that was of earth much shallowness much compromise much weakness i was not yet in my will truly gorean i wondered how to live do not ask how to live but instead proceed to do so i wondered too on the nature of my affliction i had had the finest wound physicians on gor brought to attend me to inquire into its nature they could tell me little yet i had learned there was no damage in the brain nor directly to the spinal column the men of medicine were puzzled the wounds were deep and severe and would doubtless from time to time cause me pain but the paralysis given the nature of the injury seemed to them unaccountable then one more physician unsummoned came to my door admit him i had said he is a renegade from turia a lost man had said thurnock admit him i had said it is iskander whispered thurnock i knew well the name of iskander of turia i smiled he remembered well the city that had exiled him keeping still its name as part of his own it had been many years since he had seen its lofty walls he had in the course of his practice in turia once given treatment outside of its walls to a young tuchuk warrior whose name was kamchak for this aid given to an enemy he had been exiled he had come like many to port kar he had risen in the city and had been for years the private physician to sullius maximus who had been one of the five ubars presiding in port kar prior to the assumption of power by the council of captains sullius maximus was an authority on poetry and gifted in the study of poisons when sullius maximus had fled the city iskander had remained behind he had even beenm with the fleet on the th of the sekkara sullius maximus shortly after the decision of the th of sekara had sought refuge in tyros and had been granted it greetings iskander i had said greetings bosk of port kar he had said the findings of iskander of turia matched those of the other physicians but to my astonishment when he had replaced his instruments in the pouch slung at his shoulder he said the wounds were given by the blades of tyros yes i said they were there is a subtle contaminant in the woinds he said are you sure i asked i have not detected it he said but there seems no likely explanation a contaminant i asked poisoned steel he said i said nothing sullius maximus he said is in tyros i would not have thought saurus of tyros would have used poisoned steel i said such a device like the poisoned arrow was not only against the codes of the warriors but generally was regarded as unworthy of men poison was regarded as a womans weapon iskander shrugged sullius maximus he said invented such a drug he tested it by pin pricks on the limbs of a captured enemy paralyzing him from the neck down he kept him seated at his right side as a guest in regal robes for more than a week when he tired of the sport he had him killed is there no antidote i asked no said iskander then there is no hope i said no said iskander there is no hope perhaps it is not the poison i said perhaps said iskander thurnock said i give this physician a double tarn of gold no said iskander i wish no payment why not i asked i was with you he said on the th of sekara i wish you well physician i said i wish you well too captain said he and left i wondered if what iskander of turia had conjectured was correct or not i wondered if such a poison if it existed could be overcome there is no antidote he had informed me the refrain ran through my mind do not ask how to live but instead proceed to do so i laughed bitterly captain i heard captain it was thurnock i could hear running feet behind him the gathering of members of the household what is it i heard luma ask captain cried thurnock ii must see him m immediately said another voice i was startled it was the voice of samos first slaver of port kar they entered carrying torches put torches in the rings said samos the hall was lit members of the house came forward samos appeared before the table at his side was thurnock a torch still uplifted in his hand luma was present i saw too tab who was captain of the venna clitus too was present and young henrius what is wrong i asked then one other stepped forward it was hohak from the marshes the rencer his face was white no longer about his throat was clasped the collar of the galley slave with short dangling chain he had been a bred slave an exotic his ears were large bred so as a collectors fancy but he had killed his master breaking his neck and escaped recaptured he had been sentenced to the galleys but had escaped too killing six men in his flight he had finally succeeded in making his way into the marshes in the vosks vast delta where he had been taken in by rencers who live on islands woven of rence reeds in the delta he had become chief of one such group and was much respected in the delta he had been instrumental in bringing the great bow to the rencers which put them on a military par with those of port kar who had hitherto victimized and exploited them rencer bowmen were now used by certain captains of port kar as auxilaries hohak did not speak but cast on the table an armlet of gold it was bloodied i knew the armlet well it had been that of telima who had fled to the marshes when i had determined to seek talina in the northern forests telima said hohak when did this happen i asked within four ahn said hohak then he turned to another rencer one who stood with him speak said hohak i saw little he said there was a tarn and a beast i heard the scream of the woman i poled my rence craft toward them my bow ready i heard another scream the tarn took flight low over the rence the beast upon it hunched shaggy i found her rence craft the pole floating nearby it was much bloodied i found there too the armlet the body i asked tharlarion were about said the rencer i nodded i wondered if the beast had struck for hunger such a beast in the house of cernus had fed on human flesh doubtless it was little other to them than venison would be to us why did you not kill the beast or strike the tarn i asked the great bow was capable of such matters i had no opportunity said the rencer which way did the tarn take flight i asked to the northwest said the rencer i was certain the taern would follow the coast it was extremely difficut if not impossible to fly a tarn from the sight of land it is counterinstinctual for them in the engagement of the th of sekara we had used tarns at sea but they had been kept below decks in cargo ships until beyond ther sight of land interestingly once released there had been no difficulty in managing them they had performed effectively in the engagement i looked at samos what do you know of this matter i asked i know only what i am told said samos describe the beast i said to the rencer i did not see it well he said it could only have been one of the kurii said samos the kurii i asked the word is a gorean corruption of their name for themselves for their kind said samos in torvaldsland said tab that means beasts that is interesting i said if samos were correct that kurii was a goprean corruption of the name of such animals for themselves and that the word was used in torvaldsland as a designation for beasts then it seemed not unlikely that such animals were not unknown in torvaldsland at least in certain areas perhaps remote ones the tarn had flown northwest it would presumably follow the coast north perhaps above the forests perhaps to the bleak coasts of forbidding torvaldsland itself do you surmise samos i asked that the beast killed for hunger speak said samos to the rencer the beast he said had been seen earlier twice on abandoned halfrotted rence islands lurking did it feed i asked not on those of the marshes said the man it had opportunity i asked as much or more as when it made its strike said the man the beast struck once and once only i asked yes said the man samos i asked the strike said samos seems deliberate who else in the marshes wore a golden armlet but why i asked why he looked at me the affairs of worlds said samos apparently still touch you he is crippled cried luma you speak strangely he can do nothing go away i put down my head on the table i felt my fists clenched i suddenly felt a hideous exhilaration bring me a goblet i said a goblet was fetched it was of heavy gold i took it in my left hand slowly i crushed it i threw it from me those of my house stood back frightened i will go said samos there is work to be done in the north i will seek the vengeance no samos i said i will go there were gasps from those about you cannot go whispered luma telima was once my woman i said it is mine to seek the vengeance you are crippled you vannot move cried luma there are two swords over my couch said i to thurnock one is plain with a worn hilt the other is rich with a jewelencrusted hilt i know them whispered thurnock bring me the blade of port kar swiftm fit with inhilted jewels he sped from the room i would have paga i said and bring me the red meat of bosk henrius and clitus left the table the sword was brought it was a fine blade it had been carried on the th of sekara its blade was figured its hilt encrusted with jewels i took the goblet filled with burning paga i had not had paga since returning frm the northern forests tasardargor said i pouring a libation to the table then i stood he is standing cried luma he is standing i threw back my head and swilled down the paga the meat red and hot was brought and i tore it in my teeth the juices running at the side of my mouth the blood and the paga were hot and dark within me i felt the heat of the meat i threw from me the goblet of gold i tore the meat and finished it i put over my left shoulder the scabbard strap saddle a tarn said i to thurnock yes captain he whispered i stood before the captains chair more paga i said another vessel was brought i drink said i to the blood of beasts then i drained the goblet and flung it from me with a howl of rage i struck the table with the side of my fists shattering the boards i flung aside the blanket and the captains chair do not go said samos it may be a trick to lure you to a trap i smiled at him of course i said to those with whom we deal telima is of no importance i regarded him it is me they want i said they shall not fail to have their opportunity do not go said samos there is work to be done in the north i said let me go said samos mine i said is the vengeance i turned and strode toward the door of the hall luma fell back before me her hand before her mouth i saw that her eyes were deep and very beautiful she was frightened precede me to my couch i said i am free she whispered collar her i said to thurnock and send her to my couch his hand closed on the arm of the thin blond scribe clitus i said send sandra the dancer to my couch as well you freed her captain smiled clitus collar her i told him yes captain he said i well remembered sandra with her black hair brownish skin and high cheekbones i wanted her it had been long since i had had a woman tab said i yes captain said he the two females i told him have recently been free accordingly as soon as they have been collared force them to drink slave wine yers captain grinned tab slave wine is bitter intentionally so its effect lasts for more than a gorean month i did not wish the females to conceive a female slave is taken off slave wine only when it is her masters intention to breed her the tarn captain asked thurnock have it saddled i told him i leave shortly for the north yes captain he said chapter the temple of kassau the incense stung my nostrils it was hot in the temple close stifling there were many bodies pressed about it was not easy to see for the clouds of incense hung heavy in the air the high initiate of kassau a town at the northern brink of the forest sat still in his white robes in his tall hat on the throne to the right within the white rail that separated the sanctuary of initiates from the common ground of the hall where those not anointed by the grease of priestkings must stand i heard a woman sobbing with emotion to my right praise the priestkings she repeated endlessly to herself nodding her head up and down near her bored was a slender blondish girl looking about he r hair was hung in a snood of scarlet yarn bound with filaments of golden wire she wore over her shoulder a cape of white fur of the northern sea sleen she had a scarlet vest embroidered in gold worn over a longsleeved blouse of white wool from distant ar she wore too a log woollen skirt dyed red which was belted with black with a buckle of gold wrought in cos she wore shoes of black polished leather which folded about her ankles laced twice once across the instep once about the ankle she saw me regarding her with interest and looked away other wenches too were in the crowd in the northern villages and in the forest towns and northward on the coast the woman do not veil themselves as is common in the cities to the south kassau is the seat of the high initiate of the north who claims spiritual sovereignty over torvaldsland which is commonly taken to commence with the thinning of the trees northward this claim like many of those of the initiates is disputed by few and ignored by most the men of torvaldsland on the whole i knew while tending to respect priestkings did not accord them special reverence they held to old gods and old ways the religion of the priestkings institutionalised and ritualised by the castle of initiates had made little headway among the primitive men to the north it had however taken hold in many towns such as kassau initiates often used their influence and their gold and pressures on trade and goods to spread their beliefs and rituals sometimes a chieftain converted to their ways would enforce his own commitments on his subordinates indeed this was not unusual too often a chiefs conversion would bring with it even without force those of his people who felt bound to him in loyalty sometimes too the religion of the priestkings under the control of the initiates utulizing secular rulers was propagated by fire and sword sometimes those who insisted on retaining the old ways or were caught making the sign of the fist the hammer over their ale were subjected to death by torture one that i had heard of had been boiled alive in one of the great sunken woodlined tubs in which meat was boiled for retainers the water is heated by placing rocks taken from a fire into the water when the rock has been in the water it is removed with a rake and then reheated another had been roasted alive on a spit over a long fire it was said that he did not utter a sound another was slain when an adder forced into his mouth tore its way free through the side of his face i looked at the cold haughty pale face of the high initiate on his throne he was flanked by minor initiates in their white robes with shaven heads initiates do not eat meat or beans they are trained in the mysteries of mathematics they converse among themselves in archaic gorean which is no longer spoken among the people their services too are conducted in this language portions of the services however are translated into contempory gorean when i had first come to gor i had been forced to learn certain long prayers to the priestkings but i had never fully mastered them and had by now long forgotten them still i recognized them when heard even now on a high platform behind the white rail an initiate weas reading one aloud to the congregation i was never much fond of such meetings the services and the rituals of initiates but i had some special interest in the service which was being helf today ivar forkbeard was dead i knew this man of torvaldsland only by reputation he was a rover a great captain a pirate a trader a warrior it had been he and his men who had freed chenbar of tyros the sea sleen from a dungeon in port kar breaking through to him shattering his chains with the blunt hammerlike backs of their great curved singlebladed axes he was said to be fearless and mighty swift with sword and axe fond of jokes a deep drinker a master of pretty wenches and a madman but he had taken in fee from chenbar chenbars weight in the sapphires of shendi i did not think him too mad but now the forkbeard was dead it was said that he wished in regret for the wickedness of his life to be carried in death to the temple of priestkings in kassau that the high initiate there might if it be his mercy draw on his bones in the sacred grease the sign of the priestkings it would thus indicate that he forkbeard if not in life had in death acknowledged the error of his way and embraced the will and wisdom of the faith of the priestkings such a conversion even though it be in death would be a great coup for the initiates i could sense the triumph of the high initiate on his throne though his cold face betrayed little sign of his victory now initiates to one side of the sanctuary opposite the throne of the high initiate began to chant the litanies of the priestkings responses in archaic gorean repetitive simple were uttered by the crowd kassau is a town of wood and the temple is the greatest building in the town it towers far above the squalid huts and stabler homes of merchants which crowd about it too the town is surrounded by a wall with two gates one large facing the inlet leading in from thassa the other small leading to the forest behind the town the wall is of sharpened logs and is defended by a catwalk the main business of kassau is trade lumber and fishing the slender striped parsit fish has vast plankton banks north of the town and may there particularly in the spring and the fall be taken in great numbers the smell of the fishdrying sheds of kassau carries far out to sea the trade is largely in furs from the north exchanged for weapons iron bars salt and luxury goods such as jewellery and silk from the south usually brought to kassau from lydius by tenoared coasting vessel lumber of course is a valuable commodity it is generally milled and taken northward torvaldsland though not treeless is bleak in it fine kalana wood for example and supple temwood cannot grow these two woods are prized in the north a hall built with kalana wood for example is thought a great luxury such halls incidentally are often adorned with rich carvings the men of torvaldsland are skilled with their hands trade to the south of course is largely in furs acquired from torvaldsland and in barrels of smoked dried parsit fish from the south of course the people of kassau obtain the goods they trade northward to torvaldsland and too of course civilised goods for themselves the population of kassau i did not think to be more than eleven hundred persons there are villages about however which use kassau as their market and meeting place if we count these perhaps we might think of greater kassau as having a population in the neighbourhood of some twentythree hundred persons the most important thing about kassau however was that it was the seat of the high initiate of the north it was accordingly the spiritual centre of a district extending for hundreds of pasangs around the nearest high initiate to kassau was hundreds of pasangs south in lydius the initiates are an almost universal wellorganized industrious caste they have many monasteries holy places and temples an initiate may often travel for hundreds of pasangs and each night find himself in a house of initiates they regard themselves as the highest caste and in many cities are so regarded generally there is often a tension between them and the civil authorities for each regards himself as supreme in matters of policy and law for their district the initiates have their own laws and courts and certain of them are well versed in the laws of the initiates their education generally is of little obvious practical value with its attention to authorised exegeses of dubious difficult texts purporting to be revelations of priestkings the details and observances of their own calendars their interminable involved rituals and so on but paradoxically this sort of learning impractical though it seems has a subtle practical aspect it tends to bind initiates together making them interdependent and muchly different from common men it sets them apart and makes them feel important and wise and specially privileged there are many texts of course which are secret to the caste and not even available to scholars generally in these it is rumoured there are marvelous spells and mighty magic particularly if read backwards on certain feast days whereas initiates tend not to be taken with great seriousness by the high castes or the more intelligent members iof the population except in matters of political alliance their teachings and purported ability to intercede with priestkings and further the welfare of their adherents is taken with great seriousness by many of the lower castes and many men who suspect that the initiates in their claims and pretensions are frauds will nonetheless avoid coming into conflict with the caste this is particularly true of civil leaders who do not wish the power of the initiates to turn the lower castes against them and after all who knows much of priestkings other than the obvious fact that they exist the invisible barrier about the sardar is evidence of that and the policing by flame death of illegal weapons and inventions the gorean knows that there are priestkings he does not of course know their nature that is where the role of the initiates becomes most powerful the gorean knows there are priestkings whoever or whatever they maybe he is also confronted with a socially and economically powerful caste that pretends to be able to intermediate between priestkings and common folk what if some of the claims of initiates should be correct what if they do have influence with priestkings the common gorean tends to play it safe and honour the initiates he will however commonly have as little to do with them as possible this does not mean that he will not contribute to their temples and fees for placating priestkings the attitude of priestkings toward initiates as i recalled having once been in the sardar is generally one of disinterest they are regarded as being harmless they are taken by many priestkings as an evidence of the aberrations of the human kind incidentally it is a teaching of the initiates that only initiates can obtain eternal life the regimen for doing this has something to do with learning mathematics and with avoiding the impurities of meat and beans this particular teaching of the initiates it is interesting to note is that least taken seriously by the general population the gorean feeling generally is that there is no reason why initiates or only initiates should live forever initiates though often feared by lower castes are also regarded as being a bit odd and often figure in common derisive jokes no female incidentally may become an initiate it is a consequence thusly that no female can obtain eternal life i have often thought that the initiates if somewhat more clever could have a much greater power than they posses on gor for example if they could fuse their superstitions and lore and myths with a genuine moral message of one sort or another they might appeal more seriously to the general population if they spoke more sense people would be less sensitive to or disturbed by the nonsense further they should teach that all goreans might by following their rituals obtain eternal life that would broaden the appeal of their message and subtly utilise the fear of death to further their projects lastly they should make greater appeal to women than they do for in most gorean cities women of one sort or another care for and instruct the children in the crucial first years that would be the time to imprint them while innocent and trusting at the mothers or nurses knee with superstitions which might in simpler brains subtly control then the length of their lives so simple an adjustment as the promise of eternal life to women who behaved in accordance with their teachings instructing the young and so on might have much effect but the initiates like many gorean castes were tradition bound besides they were quite powerful as it was most goreans took with some seriousness their claim to be able to placate and influence priestkings that was more than they needed for considerable power there had been much fear in kassau when the ship of ivar forkbeard had entered the inlet but it had come at midday and on its mast round and of painted wood had hung the white shield his men had rowed slowly singing a dirge at the oars even the tarnhead at the ships prow had been swung back on the great wooden hinges sometimes in light raiding galleys it is so attached to remove its weight from the prows height to ensure greater stability in high seas it is always however at the prow in harbour or when the ship enters an inlet or river to make its strike in calm seas of course there is little or no damage in permitting it to surmount the prow generally that the tarnhead was hinged back as the ship entered the inlet was suitable indication like the white shield that it came in peace the ship was a beautiful ship sleek and welllined it was a twentybencher but this nomenclature may be confusing there were twenty beches to a side with two men to each bench it carried thus forty oars with two men to each oar tersites of port kar the controversial inventer and shipwright had advocated more than one man to an oar but generally the southern galleys utilised one man per oar three oars and three men on a diagonal bench facing aft the oars staggered the diagonality of the bench permitting the multiplicity of levers the oars were generally some nineteen feet in length and narrower than the southern oars that they might cut and sweep with great speed more rapidly than the wider bladed oar and with two men to each oar and the lightness of the ship this would produce great speed as in the southern galleys the keel to beam ratio was designed too for swiftness being generally in the neighbourhood of one to eight forkbeards ship or serpent as they are sometimes called was approximately eighty gorean feet in length with a beam of some ten feet gorean his ship like most of the northern ships did not have a rowing frame and the rowers sat within the hull proper facing of course aft the thole ports i noted had covers on the inside on swivels which permitted them to be closed when the ship was under sail the sail was quite different from the southern ships being generally squarish though somewhat wider at the bottom the mast like that of the southern ships could be lowered it fitted into two blocks of wood and was wedged into the top block by means of a heavy diagonal plug driven tight with hammers the northern ship carries one sail not the several sails all lateens of the southern ships which must be removed and replaced it is an allpurpose sail hung straight from a spar of needle wood it can be shortened or let out by reefing ropes at its edges corner spars can hold it spread from the ship i doubted that such a ship could sail as close to the wind as a lateenrigged ship but the advantages of being able to shorten or let out sail in a matter of moments were not inconsiderable the sail was striped red and white the ship like most of the northern ships was clinker built being constructed of overlapping planks or strakes the frame then fitted within them between the strakes tarred ropes and tar served as calking outside the planks too was a coating of painted tar to protect then from the sea and the depredations of ship worms the tar was painted red and black in irregular lines the ship at night mast down with such colourings moving inland on a river among the shadows would be extremely difficult to detect it was a raiders ship the clinkerbuilt construction as opposed to the carvel construction of the south with flush planking is somewhat more inclined to leak but is much stronger in the high waters of the north the clinker construction allows the ship to literally bend and twist almost elastically in a vicious sea the hull planking can be bent more than a foot gorean without buckling the decking on the ship is loose and may be lifted or put to one side to increase cargo space the ship of course is open to protect goods or men from the rain or sun a large rectangle of boskhide on stakes tentlike stretched to cleats on the gunwales is sometime used this same rectangle of boskhide may be used dropped between the gunwales to collect rainwater at night the men sleep on the deck in waterproof bags sewn from the skins of the sea sleen in such a bag also they store their gear generally beneath their bench in some such ships the men sit not on benches but on their own large locked sea chests fixed in place using them as benches when in the harbour the ship rested on its moorings the shields overlapping of its men were hung on the sides this was another indication of peaceful intent the shields were round and of wood variously painted some reinforced with iron bands others with leather some with small bronze plates in battle of course such shields are not hung on the side of the ship they would obstruct the thole ports but even if oars were not used they would be within the hull at hand why should a crewman expose himself to missile fire to retrieve a shield so fastened also of course when the ship is under sail they are not carried on the side for the waves always a menace in a ship with a low freeboard would strike against them and perhaps even tear them from the ship but now they hung at the ships side tied by their straps to the wooden bars inside the gunwales the men did not carry their shields they came in peace i had turned away and walked to the temple for i wished to have a place to stand another feature of the northern ships is that they have in effect a prow on each end this permits them to be beached on rollers more easily they can be brought to land in either direction a valuable property in the rocky swift northern waters furthermore this permits the rowers in reversing positions on the benches to reverse the direction of the ship this adds considerably to the manoeuvrability of the craft it is almost impossible to ram one of the swift ships of the north the procession i knew must now be on its way to the temple within the temple the incense hung thick about the rafters it smarted my eyes it sickened me the litany and responses of the congregation were now completed and the initiates some twenty within the rail began to sing in archaic gorean i could make out little of the wording there was an accompaniment by sistrums portions of the hymn were taken up by four delicate boys standing outside the white rail on a raised platform their heads were shaved and they wore robes resembling those of the initiates choirs of such boys often sang in the great temples they were young male slaves purchased by initiates castrated by civil authorities and in the monasteries trained in song i supposed to one versed in music their soprano voices were very beautiful here in the far north of course in kassau to have any such boys properly trained in the archaic hymns indicated some wealth i did not think such singers existed even in lydius the high initiate of kassau obviously was a man of expensive tastes i looked about myself most of the people seemed poor fishermen sawyers porters peasants most wore simple garments of plain wool or even repcloth the feet of many were bound in skins their backs were often bowed their eyes vacant the furnishings of the temple were quite splendid gold hangings and chains of gold and lamps of gold burning the finest of imported tharlarion oils i looked into the hungry eyes of a child clinging in a sack to its mothers back she kept nodding her head in prayer the temple itself is quite large it is some one hundred and twenty feet in length and forty feet in width and height its roof woodenshingled is supported on the walls and two rows of squared pillars on these pillars and at places on the walls were nailed sheets of gold on these were inscribed prayers and invocations to the priestkings there were many candles in the sanctuary they made the air even closer burning the oxygen the high altar of marble setting on a platform also marble of three broad steps was surmounted by a great rounded circle of gold which is often taken as a symbol of priestkings it is without beginning or end it stands i suppose for eternity at the foot of the altar beasts were sometimes sacrificed their horns held their heads twisted the blood from their opened throats caught in shallow golden bowls to be poured upon the altar too choice portions of their flesh would be burnt upon the altar the smoke escaping through a small hole in the roof the temple incidentally is orientated to the sardar when the high initiate stands facing the altar before the circle of gold he faces the distant sardar the abode of priestkings he bows and prays to the distant sardar and lifts the burned meat to the remote denizens of those mysterious mountains there are no pictures or representations of priestkings within the temple incidentally or as far as i know elsewhere on gor it is regarded as blasphemy to attempt to picture a priestking i suppose it is just as well the initiates claim they have no size or shape or form this is incorrect but the initiates are just as well off i expect in their conjectures i speculated what a great picture of misk might look like hanging at the side of the table i wondered what might become of the religion of priestkings if priestkings should ever choose to make themselves known to men i would not prophesy for it a bright future i looked again upon the slender blondish girl bored in the crowd again she looked at me and looked away she was richly dressed the cape of white fur was a splendid fur the scarlet vest the blouse of white wool the long woollen skirt red were fine goods the buckle from cos was expensive even the shoes of black leather were finely tooled i supposed her the daughter of a rich merchant there were other good looking wenches too in the crowd generally blond girls as are most of the northern girls many with braided hair they were in festival finery this was holiday in kassau ivar forkbeard in death if not in life was making pilgrimage to the temple that his bones might be anointed at the hands of the high initiate would he sop graciously deign to do so this word had been brought from the wharves to the high initiate he had in his mercy granted this request the hollow bars on their great chains hanging from timber frames outside the temple had been struck word had been spread ivar forkbeard the unregenerate the raider the pirate he who had dared to make the fist of the hammer over his ale would come at last in death if not in life humbly to the temple of priestkings there was much rejoicing in kassau in the crowd with the poor were many burghers of kassau stout men of means the pillars of the town with their families several of these stood on raised platforms on the right near the front of the temple i understood these places to be reserved for dignitaries men of substance and their families i examined the younger women on the platform none it seemed to me was as excellent as the slender blond girl in the cape of white seasleen fur and scarlet vest one was however not without interest she was a tall statuesque girl lofty and proud greyeyed she wore black and silver a full anklelength gown of rich black velvet with silver belts or straps that crossed over her breasts and tied about her waist from it by strings hung a silver purse that seemed weighty her blond hair was lifted from the sides and back of her head by a comb of bone and leather like an inverted isosceles triangle the comb fastened by a tiny black ribbon about her neck and another such ribbon about her forehead her cloak of black fur from the black sea sleen glossy and deep swirled to her ankles it was fastened by a large circular brooch of silver probably from tharna she was doubtless the daughter of a very rich man she would have many suitors i looked again to the high initiate a cold stern dour man hard faced who sat in his high white hat in hie robes upon the throne within the white rail within that rail above the altar some in chests others displayed on shelvings was much rich plate and vessels of gold and silver there were the golden bowls used to gather the blood of the sacrificed animals cups to pour libations top the priestkings vessels containing oils lavers in which the celebrants of the rites might cleanse their hands from their work there were even the small bowls of coins brought as offerings by the poor to solicit the favour of initiates that they might intercede with priestkings on their behalf that the food rots would not fail the suls not rot the fish come to the plankton the verr yield her kid with health to both the vulos lay many eggs how hard to me and cruel seemed the face of the high initiate how rich they were the initiates and how little they did the peasant tilled his fields the fisherman went out in his boat the merchant risked his capital but the initiate did none of these things rather he lived by exploiting the superstitions and fears of simpler men i had little doubt but that the high initiate had long seen through his way of life if he had not at first surely now he was no simple novice but he had not changed his way of life he had not gone to the fields nor to the fishing banks nor to the market he had remained in the temple i studied his face it was not that of a simple man or that of a fool i had little doubt that the initiate knew full well what he was doing i had little doubt but what he knew that he knew as little as others of priestkings ands was as ignorant as others and yet still he sat upon his throne in the gilded temple amid the incense the ringing of the sistrum the singing of boys the child in the sack on the mothers back whimpered be silent she whispered to it be silent then from outside rang once the great hollow bar hanging on its chain inside the initiates and the boys at a sign from the high initiate a lifted clawlike hand were silent then the initiate rose from his throne and went slowly to the altar and climbed the steps he bowed thrice to the sardar and then turned to face the congregation let them enter the palace of priestkings he said i now heard the singing the chanting of initiates from outside the door twelve of them had gone down to the ship with candles to escort the body of ivar forkbeard to the temple two now entered holding candles all eyes craned to see the procession which now slowly the initiates singing entered the incensefilled temple four huge men of torvaldsland in long cloaks clasped about their necks heads down bearded with braided hair entered bearing on their shoulders a platform of crossed spears on this platform covered with a white shroud lay a body a large body ivar forkbeard i thought to myself must have been a large man i want to see him whispered the blond girl to the woman with whom she stood be silent hushed the woman i am tall and found it not difficult to look over the heads of many in the crowd so this is the end i thought to myself of the great ivar forkbeard he comes in death to the temple of priestkings that his bones may be anointed with the grease of priestkings it was his last will now loyally doggedly carried out by his saddened men somehow i regretted that ivar forkbeard was dead the initiates chanting now filed into the temple with their candles the chant was taken up by the initiates too within the sanctuary behind the platform of crossed spears heads down filed the crew of forkbeard they wore long cloaks they carried no weapons no shields they wore no helmets weapons i knew were not to be carried within the temple of priestkings they seemed beaten saddened dogs they were not as i had expected the men of torvaldsland to be are those truly men of torvaldsland asked the blonde girl of the older woman obviously disappointed hush said the older woman show reverence for this place for priestkings i thought they would be other than that sniffed the girl hush said the older woman very well said the girl irritably what weaklings they seem to the amazement of the crowd at a sign from the high initiate of kassau two lesser initiates opened the gate to the white rail another initiate sleek fat his shaved head oiled shining in the light of the candles carrying a small golden vessel of thickened chrism went to each of the four men of torvaldsland making on their foreheads the sign of the priestkings the circle of eternity the crowd gasped it was incredible honour that was being shown to these men that they might themselves on the platform of crossed spears carry the body of ivar forkbeard in death penitent to the high steps of the great altar it was the chrism of temporary permission which in the teachings of initiates allows one not consecrated to the service of priestkings to enter the sanctuary in a sense it is counted an anointing though an inferior one and of temporary efficacy it was first used at roadside shrines to permit civil authorities to enter and slay fugitives who had taken sanctuary at the altars it is also used for workmen and artists who may be employed to practice their craft within the rail to the enhancement of the temple and the priestkings glory ivar forkbeards body was not anointed as it was carried through the gate in the rail the dead need no anointing only the living it is held can profane the sacred the four men of torvaldsland carried the huge body of ivar forkbeard up the steps to the altar on the crossed spears then still beneath the white shroud they laid it gently on the highest step of the altar then the four men fell back two to each side heads down the high initiate then began to intone a complex prayer in archaic gorean to which at intervals responses were made by the assembled initiates those within the railing initially and now too the twelve still carrying candles who had accompanied the body from the ship through the dirt streets of kassau among the wooden buildings to the temple when the initiate finished his prayer the other initiates began to sing a solemn hymn while the chief initiate at the altar his back turned to the congregation began to prepare with words and signs the grease of priestkings for the anointing of the bones of ivar forkbeard toward the front of the temple behind the rail and even at the two doors of the temple by the great beams which close them stood the mean of forkbeard many of them were giants huge men inured to the cold accustomed to war and the labor of the oar raised from boyhood on steep isolated farms near the sea grown strong and hard on work and meat and cereals such men from boyhood in harsh games had learned to run to leap to throw the spear to wield the sword to wield the axe to stand against steel even bloodied unflinching such men these would be the hardest of the hard for only the largest the swiftest and finest might win for themselves a bench on the ship of a captain and the man great enough to command such as they must be first and mightiest among them for the men of torvaldsland will obey no other and that man had been ivar forksbeard but ivar forksbeard had come in death if not in life to the temple of priestkings betraying the old gods to have his bones anointed with the grease of priestkings no more would he make over his ale with his closed fist the sign of the hammer i noted one of the men of torvaldsland he was of incredible stature perhaps eight feet in height and broad as a bosk his hair was shaggy his skin seemed grayish his eyes were vacant and staring his lips parted he seemed to me in a stupor as though he heard or saw nothing the high initiate now turned to face the congregation in his hands he held the tiny golden rounded box in which lay the grease of priestkings at his feet lay the body of the forkbeard the congregation tensed and scarcely breathing lifting their heads intent observed the high initiate of kassau i saw the blond girl standing on her toes in the black shoes looking over the shoulders of the woman in front of her on the platform the men of importance and their families observed the high initiate among them craning her neck looking over her fathers shoulder was the large blond girl in her black velvet and silver praises be unto the priestkings called out the high initiate praises unto the priestkings responded the initiates it was in that moment and in that moment only that i detected on the thin cold face of the high initiate of kassau an tiny smile of triumph he bent down on one knee they tiny rounded golden box containing the grease of priestkings in his left hand and drew back with his right hand the long white shroud concealing the body of ivar forksbeard doubtless it was the high initiate of kassau who first knew he seemed frozen the eyes of the forkbeard opened and ivar forksbeard grinned at him with a roar of laughter hurling the shroud from him to the horror of the high initiate and other initiates and the congregation ivar forksbeard almost seven feet in height leaped to his feet in his right hand clutching a great curved singlebladed ax of hardened iron praise be to odin he cried then he with his ax with a single swing splattering blood on the sheets of gold cut the head from the body of the high initiate of kassau and leaped booted to the height of the very altar of the temple itself he threw back his head laugh with a wild roaring the bloody ax in his hand i heard the beams of the two doors of the temples being thrown in place locking the people within i saw ther cloaks of the men of torvaldsland hurled from them and saw gripped in their two hands great axes i suddenly saw the large man of torvaldsland he of incredible stature seem to come alive veins prominent on his forehead mouth slobbering striking about himself almost blindly with a great ax ivar forksbeard stood on the high altar the men of torvaldsland he cried are upon you chapter i make the acquaitance of ivar forkbeard and book passage on his ship screaming pierced my ears i was almost thrown from my feet by the buffeting shrieking bodies i strained my eyes to see through the clouds of incense hanging in the temple i smelled blood a girl cried out people merchants the rich the poor fishermen porters fled towards the great doors there to be cut down with axes they fled back to the centre of the temple huddled together axes cut through their midst i heard shouts i heard the harsh war cries of torvaldsland i heard golden sheets of metal being pried from the square pillars of the temple the interior of the sanctuary was strewn with dead initiates many hacked to pieces the four boys who had sung in the services held to one another crying like girls from the high altar standing upon it ivar forkbeard directed his men hurry he cried gather what you can kneel beneath the ax cried out one of the burghers of kassau who wore black satin a silver chain about his neck i gathered he might be administrator in this town the people obediently began to kneel on the dirt floor of the temple their heads down i saw two men of t loading their cloaks with golden plate and vessels from the sanctuary hurling them like tin and iron into the furs a fisherman cringed near me one of the men of torvaldsland raised his ax to strike him i caught the ax as it descended and held it the warrior of torvaldsland looked at me startled his eyes widened at his throat was then point of the sword of port kar weapon s are not to be carried in the temple of priestkings but i had been taught long ago by kamchak of the tuchuks at a banquet in turia that where weapons may not be carried it is well to carry weapons kneel before the ax i told the fisherman he did so i released the ax of the man of torvaldsland and removed my blade from his throat do not strike him i told the man of torvaldsland he drew back his ax and stepped away regarding me startled wary gather loot cried forkbeard are you waiting for the satarna harvest the man turned away and began to pull the gold hanging from the walls i saw twenty feet from me screaming the giant he of incredible stature striking down at the kneeling people who were crying out and trying to crawl away the great blade dipped and cut and swept up and then cut down again i saw the wild muscles of his bare arms bulging and knotted slobber came from his mouth one man lay half cut through rollo cried out forkbeard the battle is done the giant with the grayish face and shaggy hair stood suddenly unnaturally quiet the great curved blade lifted over a weeping man he lifted his head slowly and turned it slowly towards the altar the battle is done cried forkbeard two men of torvaldsland then held the giant by the arms and lowered his ax and gently turned him away from the people he turned and looked back at them and they cowered away but it did not seem that they recognised them it seemed he did not know them and had not seen them before again his eyes seemed vacant he turned away and walked slowly carrying his ax toward one of the doors of the temple those who would live called our forkbeard lie on the your stomachs the people in the temple many of them splattered with the blood of their neighbours some severely wounded threw themselves shuddering man and woman and child to their stomachs they lay among many of their own dead i myself did not lie with them once i had been of the warriors i stood the men of torvaldsland turned to face me why do you not lie beneath the ax stranger called out forkbeard i am not weary i told him forkbeard laughed it is a good reason he said are you of torvaldsland no i told him you are of the warriors asked forkbeard perhaps once i told him i shall see said forkbeard then to one of his men he said hand me a spear one of the spears which had formed the platform on which he had been carried gaining entrance to kassau and the temple was handed to him suddenly behind me i heard a war cry of torvaldsland i turned and swept to the guard position in the instant seeing the mans distance and spun again to strike from my body before it could penetrate it the hurled spear of ivar forkbeard it must be taken behind the point with the swift blow of the forearm the spear caroomed away and struck the wall of the temple fifty feet behind me in the same instant i had spun again in the guard position to stand against the man with his ax he pulled up short and looked to ivar forkbeard i turned again to face the forkbeard he grinned yes he said once perhaps you were of the warriors i looked to the man behind me and to the others they lifted their axes in their right hand it was a salute of torvaldsland i heard their cheers he remains standing said ivar forkbeard i sheathed my sword hurry called the forkbeard to his men hurry the people of the town will gather swiftly tearing hangings from the walls prying loose sheets of gold pulling down even lamps from their chains filling their cloaks with cups and plates the men of torvaldsland stripped the temple of what they could tear loose and carry ivar forkbeard leaped down from the altar and began angrily to hurl vessels of consecrated oils against the walls behind the sanctuary then he took a rack of candles and hurled it against the wall fire soon bit into the timbers behind the sanctuary the forkbeard then leaped over the rail of the sanctuary and strode among the people lying on their stomachs the wall facing the sardar being eaten by fire illuminating the interior of the temple he reached down here and there to rip a purse from one of the richer townsfolk he took the purse of the burgher in black satin and took too from his neck the silver chain of his office which he slung about his own neck he then drew with the handle of his ax a circle some twenty feet in diameter in the dirt floor of the circle it was a bondmaid circle females he cried gesturing with the great ax toward the wall opposite the doors swiftly to the wall stand with your backs against it terrified weeping the men groaning the females fled to the wall i saw standing there terrified their backs against it the blond girl in the scarlet vest and skirt her hair in the snood of scarlet yarn tied with filaments of golden wire and the large statuesque girl in black velvet with the silver straps over her breasts and tied about her waist with the purse ivar forkbeard in the light of the burning wall of the temple quickly examined the line of women from some he took jewellery bracelets necklaces and rings from others her took purses hanging at their belts he tore away the purse from the large blonde girl and the silver straps too which had decorated the black velvet of her gown she shrank back against the wall she was large breasted the men of torvaldsland are fond of such women the jewellery and coins which he took he hurled into a golden sacrificial bowl which one of his men carried at his side as he went down the line he freed certain women of the wall telling them to swiftly return to their place and lie beneath the ax gratefully they fled to their former places this left nineteen girls at the wall i admired the taste of forkbeard they were beauties my choices would have been the same among them of course were the slender blond girl in the red vest and skirt and the larger one now in black velvet torn stripped of its silver straps its brooches the purse he ripped the snood of scarlet yarn from the slender blond girls hair her hair now loose fell behind her to the small of her back he then tore away the ribbons and comb of bone and leather that had so intricately held the hair of the larger blond girl she in black velvet her hair was even longer than that of the more slender girl the nineteen girls regarded him terrified eyes wide their faces lit in the left side by the flames of the burning wall go to the bondmaid circle said ivar forkbeard indicating the circle he had drawn in the dirt the women cried out in misery to enter the circle if one is a female is by the laws of torvaldsland to declare oneself a bondmaid a woman of course need not to enter the circle of her own free will she may for example be thrown within it naked and bound howsoever she enters the circle voluntarily or by force free or secured she emerges from it by the laws of torvaldsland as a bondmaid seventeen of the girls weeping fled to the circle and huddled within it two did not the slender blond girl and the larger one in black velvet i am aelgifu said the large girl i am the daughter of gurt of kassau he is administrator there will be ransom money for me it is true cried a man the burgher in black satin whose chain of office forkbeard had torn from his neck one hundred pieces of gold said forkbeard to him observing the girl she stiffened yes cried the man yes five nights from this night said ivar forkbeard on the skerry of einar by the runestone of the torvaldsmark i had heard of this stone it is taken by many to mark the border between torvaldsland and the south many of those of torvaldsland however take its borders to be much farther extended than the torvalds regard torvaldsmark indeed some of their ships beach as the took their country and their steel with them yes said the man i will bring the money to that place go to the bondmaid circle said ivar forkbeard to the large girl but do not enter it yes she said hurrying to its edge the wall of the temple will not last much longer said one of the men of the forkbeard forkbeard looked then at the younger blond more slender girl she with her hair now loose the snood of scarlet she looked up at him boldly my father is poorer than aelgifus she said but forme too there will be a ransom she looked at him with horror in the crowd i heard a man and a woman cry out with misery go to the circle and enter it said ivar forkbeard to the girl she held up her head no she said i am free never will i consent to be a bondmaid i shall first choose death very well laughed the forkbeard kneel startled she did so uncertainly put your head down he said throw your hair forward exposing your neck she did so he lifted the great ax suddenly she cried out and thrust her head to his boot she held his ankle have mery on a bondmaid she wept ivar forkbeard laughed and reached down and pulled her up by the arm his great fist closed about her arm within the white woolen blouse and thrust her stumbling well within the circle the wall will soon fall said one of the me i could see the fire creeping now too to the roof bondmaids ordered ivar forkbeard harshly strip crying out the girls removed their garments i saw that the weeping slender blondhair girl was incredibly beautiful her legs and belly and breasts were marvelous and her face too was beautiful sensitive and intelligent i envied the forkbeard his catch fetter them said ivar forkbeard i hear the townfolk gathering said one of the men at the door two of the men of torvaldsland had from their left shoulder to their right hip that their right arms be less i impeded a chain formed of slave bracelets each pair of bracelets locked at each end about one of the bracelets of another pair the whole thus forming a circle now they removed this chain of bracelets and one by one removed the pairs closing them about the small wrists behind their backs of the female captives now bondmaids these bracelets were of the sort used to hold women in the north the are less ornate and finely tooled than those available in the south but they are satisfactory for their purpose they consist of curve hinged bands of black iron three quarters of an inch in width and a quarter inch in thickness on one of each of the two curved pieces constituting a bracelet there is a welded ring the two welded rings are joined by a single link about an inch in width counting both sides each of which is about a quarter of an inch in diameter and three inches long some of the girls cried out with pain as the fetters locking bit into their wrists i saw the slender girls wrists pulled behind her and snapped in the fetters she winced they were rough plain fetters but they would hold her well quite as well as the intricately wrought counterparts of the south ivar forkbeard regarded aelgifu fetter her too he said she was fettered the fire had now climbed well unto the roof and had taken hold on another wall near the railing against which the women earlier had stood it was growing hard to breathe in the temple coffle the females said forkbeard with a long length of binding fiber the nineteen girls were swiftly fastened throat to throat aelgifu clothed led the coffle she was free the others were only bondmaids the beams which secured the doors were thorwn back but the doors were not opened the men of torvaldsland strugled to lift their burdensgold is not light utilize the bondmaids said the forkbeard anglily swiftly about the necks of the bondmaids were tied strings plate soon they too were heavily burdened several stagered under the wieght of the riches they bore in the north my pretty maids ivar assured them the burdens you carry will be more prosaic bundles of wood for the fires buckets of water for the hall baskets of dung for the fields they looked at him with horror understanding then what the nature of their life would be and at night of course they would server the feasts of their masters carrying and filling the great the horns and delighting them with the softness of their bodies in the furs we are ready to depart said one of the men i could hear angry townspeople outside you will never get us to the ship said the slender blond girl be silent bondmaid said ivar forkbear my bondage will not last long she laughed we shall see laughed ivar forkbeard he then ran almost through the flames to the high altar of the temple of kassau with a single leap he attained its summit the with his boot and shoulder he tottered the great circle of gold which surmounted it it moved unsteadily rocking back and broke apart it was only golden sheathing on a wheel of clay the people of kassau within the burning temple cried startled they had understood the circle to be of solid gold standing on the broken fragments of the circle ivar forkbeard cried out his ax lifted and his left hand too praise be to odin and then throwing his ax to his left shoulder holding it there by his left hand the turned and faxed the sardar and lifted his fist clenched it was not only a sign of defiance to priestkings but the fist the sign of the hammer it was the sign of thor we can carry no more cried one of his men nor shall we laughed ivar the circle cried one leave it for the people to see laughed ivar that it is only gold on a wheel of clay he turned to face me i want passage to torvaldsland i said i hunt beast kurii he asked yes i said you are mad he said less mad i expect than ivar forkbeard i said my serpent said he is not a vessel on which one may book passage i play kaissa i said the voyage north will be long he said i am skilled at the game i said unless you are quite good i shall beat you we heard the people screaming outside i heard one of the beams in the ceiling crack the roar of the flames seemed deafening we shall die in the temple if we do not soon flee said one of his me of all those in the temple i think only i and ivar forkbeard and the giant he of incredible stature who had fought with such frenzy did not seem anxious he did not seem even aware of the flames he carried a sack of plate at his back heavy and bulging which had been given to him by other men that he might carry it i too am skilled at the game said ivar forkbeard are you truly good i am good i said whether i am as good as you of course i shall not know until we play true said forkbeard i sahll join you at your ship i said do so said he the he turned to one of his me keep close to me the coins brought as offerings by the poor to the temple of kassau he said these coins had now been placed in the large single bow yes captain said the man the rear wall too of the temple now caught fire i heard another beam in the ceiling crack there were sparks in the air they stung my face the bondmaids their bodies exposed to them cried out in pain open the other gate cried ivar forkbeard hysterically crowding those citizens of kassau who had weeping terified been lying on their stomachs in the dirt beneath the burning roof leapt to their feet and fled through the door ivar permitted them to leave the temple they are coming out cried a voice from the outside we heard angry men running to the door people turning the movements of chains flails and rakes now let us leave said ivar forkbear you will never get us to the ship said the slender girl you will hurry pretty little bondmaids and you too my largebreasted lovely said ivar indicating blackvelveted aelgifu or you will be cut out of the coffle by your heads open the door he said the door was swung open to the ships he cried hurry my pretties he laughed striking the slender blond girl and others of them sharply with the palm of his hand his men too the girls between them pushed through the door they are coming out here cried a voice a man in the crowd of the poor a peasant turning about seeing us but many of those in the crowd were clasping loved ones and friends as they escaped from the other door swiftly down the dirt street to the wharves from the temple stirding but not running moved ivar forkbeard with his men and his loot both that of female flesh and gold many of the peasants and fishermen and other poor people who had not found places in the temple turned about several of them began to follow us lifting flails and great scythes some carried chains others hoes they had no leadership like wolves crying out shouting lifting their fists they ran behind us as we made our way toward the wharves then a rock fell among us and another noen of them cared to rush upon the axes of the men of torvaldsland save us cried the slender blond girl you are men save us at her cries many of the men seemed emboldened and rushed more closely about us but swings of the great axes kept them back gather together we heard charge we saw gurt in his black satin rallying them they had lacked a leader they had one now ivar forkbeard then took aelgifu by the hair and turned her so that those following might see stop cried gurt to them the singlebaled edge of the great ax lay at aelgifus throat her head was bent back for forkbeard his left hand in her hair his right hand just below the head of the ax grinned at gurt stop said gurt moaning crushed do not fight them let them go ivar forkbeard released aelgifu and thrust her ruderly stumbling ahead of him hurry called ivar forkbeard to his men hurry brightfleshed ones called he to the fettered burdened coffled bonmids behind us we heard the roof of the temple collapese i looked back smoke stained the sky a hundred yards from the wharves we saw a crowd of angry men perhaps two hundred blocking the way they held gaff harpoons even pointed stick some carried crash hooks and others chisels and iron levers you see cried the blond girl delightedly my bondage is short citizens of kassau called out ivar forkbeard cheerily greetings from ivar forkbeard the men looked at him tense hunched over weapons ready angry forkbeard then grinning slung his ax over his left shoulder dropping it into the broad leather loop by which it may be carried its head behind his head and to the left this loop is fixed in a broad leather belt worn from the left shoulder to the right hip fastened there by a hook that the weight of the ax will not turn the belt which fits into a ring in the otherwise unarmed carry a knife at their master belt all men of torvaldsland incidentally even if otherwise unarmed carry a knife at their master belt the sword when carried and it often is is commonly supported might be mentioned the common gorean practice it can also of course be hung by its sheath and sheath straps form the master belt which is quite adequate being a stout heavy belt to hold it it is called the master belt doubtless to distinguish it from the ax belt and the sword belt and because it is almost always worn a pouch of course and other accoutrements my hang too from it gorean garments generally do not contain pockets some say the master belt gets its name be cause it is used sometimes in the disciplining of bondmaids this seems to be a doubtful origin for the name it is true however questions of the origin of the name aside that bondmaids stripped are often taught obedience under its lash ivar forkbeard reached out his hands and took from one of his men the bowl of coins which the poor had brought as their pitiful offerings to the temple of kassau then smiling by hadfuls he hurled the coins to the right and to the left tense the men watched him one of those coins of small denomination though they might be was days wages on the docks of kassau more coins in handfuls showered to the street to the sides of the men fight screamed the blond girl fight one of the men suddenly reached down and snatched one then with a great sweeping gesture ivar forkbeard emptied the bowl of coins scattering them in a shower of coper and iron over the men two more men reached down to snatch a coin fight screamed the blond girl fight the first man scrabbling in the dirt picked up another coin and the another then the second and third man found each another coin then the others agonized unable longer to resist scurried to the left and right their weapons discarded and fell to their knees snatching coins cowards slenn wept the blond girl then she cried out in misery half choked by the coffle loop on her throat as she found herself hurried fettered and burdened with the others through the workers of kassau we brushed through the scrabbling workers and saw before us the wharf and the serpent sleek and swift of ivar forkbeard at its moorings ten men had remained at the ship eight held bows with arrows at the string none had dared to approach the ship the short bow of the gorean north wit its short heavy arrows heavily headed lacks the range and power of the peasant bow of the south that now too the property of the rencers of the delta but at short range within a hundred and fifty yards it can administer a considerable strike it has too the advantage that it is more manageable in close quarters than the peasant box resembling somewhat the tuchuck bow of layered horn in this respect it is more useful in close combat on a ship for example than would be the peasant bow too it is easier to fire it through a thole port the oar withdrawn the two other men stood ready with knives to cut the ooring ropes the men of ivar forkbeard threw their bulging cloaks filled with gold and plate into the ship ivar forkbeard looked back we heard in the distance a muffle d crash a wall of the temple had fallen then amoment later we heard the falling of another wall smoke in angry billows black and fiery climbed the sky above kassau i shall fetch a belonging or two i said and be with you presenlty do not delay overlong suggested ivar forkbeard very well i said i ran to the yard of a tavern near the docks there i unsaddled unbridled and freed the tarn i had ridden north fly i commanded it it smote the air with its wings and beat its way into the smoky skies of kassau i saw it turn toward the southeast i smiled in such a direction i knew lay the mountains of thentis in those mountains had the borebearers of the bird been bred i thought of the webs of spiders and turtles running to the sea how fantastic how strange i thought is the blood of beasts and i realized too that i was a beast and wondered on what might be the nature of those instincts which must be my own i hurled a golden tarn disk to the ground to pay for lodging in kassau and the care of the bird i would leave the saddle but from it i took the saddlebags containing some belongings and some gold and too the bedroll of fur and boskhide from it too i took in its waterproof sheath the great bow and its arrows forty arrows flight and sheaf i looked after the tarn already it had gone disappearing in the smoking sky above kassau i had booked better passage to torvaldsland i turned and ran back to the wharf eight bows were trained on me eight arrows lay ready at the taut string do not fire called ivar forkbeard to his bowmen he grinned he plays kaissa i threw my gear into the ship and bow in hand leaped into the serpent cast off said ivar forkbeard the two mooring ropes were flung free of the mooring cleats they were not cut the bowmen took their places with their fellows on the benches the serpent backed from the pier and in the harbor turned the redandwhite striped sail snapping unfolding was dropped from the spar between the benches amidships among piles of loot their wrists fettered behind them sat the naked bondmaids and aelgifu in her torn black velvet they were still in throat coffle their ankles had been crossed and lashed tightly with binding fiber aelgifus shoes i noted had been removed and her woolen hose this was done that her ankles and feet bared now like those of the bondmaids might be as securely tied no gorean puts binding fiber over shoes or hose it seemed aelgifu proud and rich would go barefoot like a peasant wench or a stripped bonmaid by the will of ivar forbeard until her ransom was paid on the skerry of einar five nights from this night by the runestone of the torvaldsmark she alone of the women though fettered and bound and in coffle did not seem unduly upset ivar forbeard went to the bondmaids he looked down on the blond slender gir the coffle loop was on her throat she sat with her legs drawn up her ankles crossed moved her wrists in the fetters there was small sound as the threeinch joining link moved in the welded rings of the fetters it seems your bondage said he pretty maid will not be as short as you had hoped she looked down there is no escape he tole her she sobbed the men of torvaldsland began to sing at the oars ivar forkbeard reached down to the planking on the deck and picked up aelgifus shoes and hose where they had been discarded when they had been removed and her ankle bound he threw them over the side then he joined me at the stern we could see ment at the docks some were even attempting to rig a coasting vessel to purseu the serpent but they would not rig it it was pointless the men of torvaldsland sang with great voices the oars two men to an oars lifted and dipped the helmsman leaned on the tiller of the great steering oar behind us we could see the smoke of the burning temple too it seemed the fires had spread elsewhere in kassau doubtless carried by the wind we could now see those at the dock and even those who had been bestirring themselves with the coasting vessel returning to the town we heard the ringing of the great bar which hung on its timber frame outside the temple the town was afire the men of kassau left the docks hurrying up the dirt streets to take up their new labors behind us amidhsips we heard the weeping of women fettered bonmaids being carried north to serve harsh massters the smoke billowed high in the sky above kassau we could hear clearly carrying over the water the ringing of the great bar outside the temple the men of torvaldsland singing the oars lifting and dipping the serpent of ivar forkbeard took its way from the harbor of kassau chapter the forkbeard and i return to our game ivar forkbeard leaning over the side of his serpent studied the coloring of the water then he reached down and scooped up some in the palm of his hand testing its temperature we are one days rowing said he from the skerry of einar and th runestone of the torvaldsmark how do you know this i asked we had been out of sight of land for two days and the night preceding had been with shortened sail swept eastward by high winds there is plankton here said ivar that of the banks south of the skerry of einar and the temperarutre of the water tells me that we are now in the stream of torvald which moves eastward to the coast and then north the stream of torvald is a current as a broad river in the sea pasangs wide whose temperature is greater than that of the surrounding water without it much of torvaldsland bleak as it is would be only a forzen waste torvcliffs inlets and mountasin its arable soil is thin and found in patches the size of the average farm is very small good farms is often by sea in small boats without the stream of tovald it would probably be i possible to raise cereal crops in sufficient quantity to fee even its relatively sparse population there is often not enough food under any conditions particularly i n northern torvaldsland and famine is not known in such cases men feed on bark and lichens and seaweed it is not strange that the young men of torvaldsland often look to the sea and beyond it for their fortunes the stream of torvald is regarded by the men of torvaldsland as a gift of thor bestowed upon torvald legendary founder and hero of the land in exchange of a ring of gold ivar forkgeard went to the mast before it sat aelgifu she was chained to it by the neck her wrist in the black iron fetters of the north were now fastened before her body that she could feed herself there was salt in her hair she still wore her black velvet but now it was stained with sea water and slat and was discolored and stiff and creased she was barefoot tomorrow night said ivar forkbeard to her i shall have your ransom money she did not deign to speak to him but looked away like the bondmaids she had been fed only on cold satarna poridge and scraps of dried parist fish the men of toravldsland sometimes guide their vessels by noting the direction of the waves breaking against the prow these correlated with prevailing winds sometimes they use the shadows of the gunwales failing across the ghwarts judging their angles the sun too of couse is used and at night the stars give them suitable compass even in the open sea it is a matter of their tradition not to rely on the needle compass as is done in the south the gorean compass points always to the sardar the home of priestkings the men of torvaldsland do not use it they do not need it the sextant however correlated with sun and stars is not unknown to them it is commonly relied on however only in unfamiliar waters even fog banks and the feeding grounds of whales and ice floes in given season in their own waters give the men of torvaldsland information as to their whereabouts they utilizing such things as easily as unconsciously as a peasant might a mountain or a hunter a river the ships of the men of torvaldsland are swift in a day a full gorean day of twenty ahn with a fair wind they can cover from two hundred to two hundred and fifty pasangs i studied the board before me it was set on a square chest it was a board made for play at sea and such boards are common with the men of torvaldsland in the center of each square was a tiny peg the pieces correspondingly are drilled to match the pegs and fit over them this keeps them steady in the movements at sea the board was of red and yellow squares the kaissa of the men of torvaldsland is quite similar to that of the south though certain of the pieces differ there is for example not a ubar but a jarl as the most powerful piece moreover there is no ubara instead there is a piece called the jarls woman which is quite powerful more so than the southern ubara instead of tarnsmen there are two pieces called the axes the board has no initiates but there are corresponding pieces called runepriests similarly there are no scribes but a piece which moves identically called the singer i thought that andreas of tor a friend of the caste of singers might have been pleased to learn that his caste was represented and honored on the boards of the north the spearmen moved identically with the southern spearmen it did not take me much time to adapt to the kaissa of torvaldsland for it is quite similar to the kaissa of the south on the other hand feeling my way on the board i had lost the first two games to the forkbeard interestingly he had been eager to familiarize me with the game and was abundant in his explanations and advice clearly he wished me to play him at my full efficiency without handicap as soon as possible i had beaten him the third game and he had then delighted ceased in his explanations and advice and together the board between us each in our way a war rior we had played kaissa the forkbeards game was much more varied and tactical than was that of say marlenus of ar much more devious and it was far removed from the careful conservative positional play of a man such as mintar of the caste of merchants the forkbeard made great use of diversions and feints and double strategies in which an attack is double edged being in effect two attacks an open one and a concealed one either of which depending on a misplay by the opponent may be forced through the concealed attack requiring usually only an extra move to make it effective a move which ideally threatened or pinned an opponents piece giving him the option of surrendering it or facing a devastating attack he then a move behind in the beginning i had played forkbeard positionally learning his game when i felt i knew him better i played him more openly his wiliest tricks of coursej i knew he would seldom use saving them for games of greater import or perhaps for players of torvaldsland among them even more than in the south kaissa is a passion in the long winters of torvaldsland when the snow the darkness the ice and wintry winds are upon the land when the frost breaks open the rocks groaning at night when the serpents hide in their roofed sheds many hours under swinging soapstone lamps burning the oil of sea sleen are given to kaissa at such times even the bondmaids rolling and restless naked in the furs of their masters their ankles chained to a nearby ring must wait it is your move said forkbeard i have moved i told him i have thrown the ax tojarl six ah laughed the forkbeard he then sat down and looked again at the board he could not now with impunity place his jarl at ax four the sun for torvaldsland was hot in the chronology of port kar it was early in year of the sovereignty of the council of captains in the chronology of ar which serves generally to standardize chronology on gor it was ca or contasta ar from the founding of ar the battle of the th of sekara had taken place in ca in that same year in its spring in port kar the council of captains had assumed its sovereignty thus initiating year of its reign most gorean cities use the spring equinox as the date of the new year turia however uses the summer solstice the spring equinox incidentally is also used for the new year by the runepriests of the north who keep the calendars of torvaldsland they number years from the time of thors gift of the stream of torvald to torvald legendary hero and founder of the northern fatherlands in the calendars of the runepriests the year was forkbeard and i sat in the shade under a tented awning of sewn boskhides some thirtyfive feet in length it begins aft of the mast which is set forward it rests on four poles with two long narrow poles fixed in sockets mounted in tandem fashion serving as a single ridge pole these poles can also be used in pushing off and thwarting collisions on rocks the bottom edges of the tented awning are stretched taut and tied to cleats in the gunwales there is about a foot of space between the gunwales and the bottoms of the tented awnings permitting a view to sea on either side somewhat behind us between the benches in the shade of the awning among other riches taken in the sack of the temple of kassau were the bondmaids they loot too knelt or sat or laid among golden plate and candlesticks and golden hangings their ankles were no longer bound their wrists now those of most of them were fettered before their bodies about their necks now however they wore not simple binding fiber it had been replaced the first evening out of kassau they wore now knotted about their throats a coffle rope of the north about a half inch in thickness of braided leather cored with wire at night they slept with their hands fettered behind them some of the girls slept some curled on the golden hangings of the temple some sat or knelt heads down of the girls four of them though still held in the coffle were no longer fettered they knelt with soft cloths and polishes cleaning and rubbing to a high shine which must please the forkbeard the golden trove of the looted temple of kassau the men of forkbeard their oars inboard the ship under sail amused themselves as they would some slept on the benches or between them some under the awning and some not or on the exposed elevated stem deck here and there some sat in twos or threes talking two like forkbeard and myself gave themselves to kaissa two others elsewhere played stones a guessing game the giant he who might have been nearly eight feet in height and had in the temple wrought such furious slaughter sat now almost somnolently on a rowing bench sharpening with slow deliberate movements with a circular flat whetstone the blade of his great ax three other men of the forkbeard attended to fishing two with a net sweeping it along the side of the serpent for parsit fish and the third near the stem with a hook and line baited with vulo liver for the whitebellied grunt a large game fish which haunts the plankton banks to feed on parsit fish only two of the forkbeards men did not rest he at the helm bareheaded looking to sea and the fellow at the height of the mast on lookout the helmsman studies the sky and the waters ahead of the serpent beneath clouds there is commonly wind and he avoids moving a point or more to port or starboard areas where there is little wave activity for they betoken spots in which the serpent might for a time find itself becalmed the lookout stood upon a broad flat wooden ring bound in leather covered with the fur of sea sleen which fits over the mast it has a diameter of about thirty inches it sets near the top of the mast enabling the man to see over the sail as well as to other points he standing on this ring fastens himself by the waist to the mast by looping and buckling a heavy belt about it and through his master belt usually too he keeps one hand on or about the mast the wooden ring is reached by climbing a knotted rope the mast is not high only about thirtyfive feet gorean but it permits a scanning of the horizon to some ten pasangs forkbeard put his first singer to his own ax four threatening my ax i covered my piece with my own first singer moving it to my own ax five he exchanged taking my ax at jarl six and i his first singer with my first singer i now had a singer on a central square but he had freed his ax four on which he might now situate the jarl for an attack on the jarls womans axs file the tempo at this point was mine he had played to open position i had played to direct position the ax is a valuable piece of course but particularly in the early and middle game when the board is more crowded in the end game when the board is freer it seerns to me the singer is often of greater power because of the greater number of squares it can control scholars weight the pieces equally at three points in adjudications but i would weight the ax four points in the early and middle game and the singer two and reverse these weights in the end game both pieces are however quite valuable and i am fond of the ax you should not have surrendered your ax said forkbeard in not doing so i said i would have lost the tempo and position too the ax is regarded as less valuable in the end game you play the ax well said forkbeard what is true for many men may not be true for you the weapons you use best perhaps you should retain i thought on what he had said kaissa is not played by mechanical puppets but deeply and subtly by men idiosyncratic men with individual strengths and weaknesses i recalled i had many times late in the game regretted the surrender of the ax or its equivalent in the south the tarnsman when i had simply as i thought rationally moved in accordance with what were reputed to be the principles of sound strategy i knew of course that game context was a decisive matter in such considerations but only now playing forkbeard did i suspect that there was another context involved that of the inclinations capacities and dispositions of the individual player too it seemed to me that the ax or tarnsman might be a valuable piece in the end game where it is seldom found people would be less used to defending against it in the end game its capacity to surprise and to be used unexpectedly might be genuinely profitable at such a time in the game i felt a surge of power then i noted uneasily the forkbeard moving his jarl to the now freed ax four the men with the net drew it up in it twisting and flopping silverish striped with brown squirmed more than a stone of parsit fish they threw the net to the planking and with knives began to slice the heads and tails from the fish gorm said the forkbeard free the first bondmaid on the coffle the lazy girl has rested too long and send her to me with a bailing scoop gorm was barechested and barefoot he wore trousers of the fur of sea sleen about his neck was a golden chain and pendant doubtless taken once from a free woman of the south as he approached the bondmaids they shrank back from him fearing him as would any bondmaid one of the men of torvaldsland i looked upon the eyes of the first girl on the coffle who was the slender blondish girl who had worn the red vest and jacket i recalled how disappointed she had been in the men of torvaldsland when heads hanging they had accompanied the forkbeard to the temple at kassau she had then with amusement regarded them with contempt but it was neither amusement nor contempt which shone in her eyes now as she shrinking back from him looked upon gorm she now saw the men of torvaldsland in their mightiness in their freedom and strength and power and she a stripped fettered bondmaid coffled feared them she knew that she belonged to them such fierce and mighty beasts and that she and her beauty lay at their mercy that she and her beauty were theirs to do with as they pleased roughly gorm unknotted the coffle rope from her neck he then gestured that she kneeling should lift her fettered wrists to him she did so he with a key from his belt opened the fetters which held her he thrust them in his belt he then pulled her by the arm roughly to her feet and thrust her toward the forkbeard she stumbled across the loose deck planking and stood hair before her face before us she thrust her hair back with her right hand and stood well a bailing scoop was thrust into her hands it has four sides it is щmade of wood it is about six inches in width there is a diagonally set board in its bottom and the back and two sides are straight it has a straight but rounded handle carved smaller at the two ends one where it adjoins the scoop the other in back of the grip gorrn moved aside eight narrow planks from the loose decking below some two inches deep about a foot below the deck planking about two inches over the keel beam black and briny shifted the bilge water there was not much water in the bilge and i was surprised for a clinker built ship the serpent of ivar forkbeard was extraordinarily tight the ship actually had not needed to be bailed at all indeed it had not been bailed since kassau the average ship of torvaldsland is by custom bailed once a day even if the bilge water does not necessitate it a ship which must of necessity be bailed three times in two days is regarded as unseaworthy many such ships however are sailed by the men of torvaldsland particularly late in the season when the ship is less tight from months of the seas buffeting in the spring of course before the ships are brought from the sheds on rollers to the sea they are completely recalked and tarred bail said the forkbeard the girl went to the opened planking and fell to her knees beside it the wooden scoop in her hands return to me said the forkbeard harshly frightened the girl did so now turn about said he and walk there as a bondmaid her face went white then she turned and walked to the opened planking as a bondmaid the other bondmaids gasped the men watching her hooted with pleasure i grinned i wanted her bondmaid scorned aelgifu from where she was fettered and chained to the mast i gathered that these two in kassau had been rival beauties then sobbing the blondish girl who had been forced to walk as a bondmaid fell to her knees beside the opened planking once she vomited over the side but on the whole she did well once the forkbeard went to her and taught her to check the scoop with her left hand for snails that they not be thrown overboard returning to me he held one of the snails whose shell he crushed between his fingers and sucked out the animal chewing and swallowing it he then threw the shell fragments overboard they are edible he said and we use them for fish bait we then returned to our game once the blond girl cried out the scoop in her hand look she cried pointing over the port gunwale a hundred yards away rolling and sporting were a family of whales a male two females and four calves then she returned to her bailing your hall is taken said the forkbeard his jarl had moved decisively the taking of the hall in the kaissa of the north is equivalent to the capture of the home stone in the south you should not have surrendered your ax said the forkbeard it seems not i said the end game had not even been reached the hall had been taken in the middle game i would think more carefully before i would surrender the ax in the future i am finished said the slender girl returning to where we sat and kneeling on the deck she had performed her first task for her master the forkbeard drying as it is said the belly of his serpent it had been the first of her labors set to her by her master in her bondage give gorrn back the scoop said the forkbeard and then carry water to my men yes she said the forkbeard looked at her yes she said myjarl to the bondmaid the meanest of the free men of the north is her jarl we heard aelgifu laugh from the mastthe bondhaired girl rose to her feet and surrendered the scoop to gorm who put it away and then closed the deck planking she then went to one of the large wooden covered water buckets roped to the deck and in it submerged a waterskin i heard the bubbling as the skin filled the men of torvaldsland had not sought the whales they had meat enough they had barely taken notice of them it was now late in the afternoon i noted the blondish girl the water bag now wet and heavy over her shoulder going to the men of the forkbeard to offer them drink she was quite beautiful the men who had fished with the net had now cleaned the catch of parsit fish and chopped the cleaned boned silverish bodies into pieces a quarter inch in width another of the bondmaids was then freed to mix the bondmaid gruel mixing fresh water with satarna meal and then stirring in the raw fish let us have another game said the forkbeard i set up the pieces he went to ael ifu who sat before the mast her wrsts fettered before her her neck chained to the mast he lifted her black velvet dress up a little revealing her ankle she shrank back against the mast tomorrow night he said i will have your ransom money yes she said with his two large hands he held her right ankle she could not draw it away i am free she whispered holding her ankle with his left hand he with the fingers of his right hand caressed gently her instep she shuddered i am free she said free would you not my large breasted beauty said he like to spend the night with me in my bag of the skin of the sea sleen no she cried no then she said if i am violated he will not pay the ransom too he will bring with him awoman that determination on this matter be made surely you wish my ransom yes said the forkbeard putting down her ankle i do indeed want your ransom and i shall have it then beast said she do not touch me i am not touching you said he and got to his feet she turned away and would not look at him but she said to him give me a covering for the night that i may not be wet and cold go lie with the bondmaids said he never she said then stay where you are said the forkbeard she looked up at him her hair bedraggled her eyes flashing very well said she i shall endure the night cheerfully it will be my last in your bondage the girl who had prepared the bondmaid gruel had now been refettered and placed again in the coffle the slender blond girl who had been giving the men water from the skin bag was now given the work of filling small bowls from the large wooden bowl for the bondmaids she used a bronze ladle the handle of which was curved like the neck and head of a lovely bird about the handle was a closed bronze ring loose it formed a collar for the birds neck the bondmaids did not much care for their gruel unsweetened mudlike satarna meal with raw fish they fed however one girl who did not care to feed was struck twice across her back by a knotted rope in the hand of gorm quickly then and well she fed the girls including the slender blondish girl emptied rheir bowls even to licking them and rubbing them with their salivadampened fingers that no grain be left lest gorm their keeper in the ship should not be pleased they looked to one another in fear and put down their bowls as they finished fed bondwenches come here wench called the forkbeard the slender blondish girl quickly approached him and knelt before him on the deck feed her said the forkbeard gesturing over his shoulder the girl rose and went to fill one of the small bowls for aelgifu soon she brought it to her as she approached aelgifu aelgifu called out to her you walk well thyri you walk as a bondmaid the slender blondish girl called thyri though now actually she had no name not having been given one by the forkbeard did not respond to aelgifus taunt kneel said aelgifu the girl knelt what have you there asked aelgifu gruel said the girl taste it said aelgifu obediently angrily the girl did so it is bondmaid gruel is it not asked aelgifu yes said the girl why then asked aelgifu have you brought it to me the girl put her head down i am free said aelgifu take it away it is for such as you the girl did not respond when my ransom is paid and i return said aelgifu there will no longer be dispute as to who is the most beautiful in kassau no said the girl but i was always the most beautiful said aelgifu the blond girls eyes flashed take this gruel away said aelgifu it is for bondmaids such as you the blond girl rose to her feet and left aelgifu the forkbeard looked up from his game he reached out and took the bowl from the blond girl he said to gorm return her to the coffle he took the blond girl back to the coffle he made her kneel and again snapped on her wrists the iron singlelinked fetters of the north and then he tied her by the neck at the end of the coffle the forkbeard was using the jarls axs gambit a powerful opening i studied the board with care ivar forkbeard approached aelgifu with the small bowl of gruel he crouched down beside her when your father sees you tomorrow night said he you must not be weak but rosycheeked and brighteyed what otherwise would he think of the hospitality i extend to my prisoners i will not eat the gruel of bondmaids said aelgifu you will eat it said the forkbeard or you will be stripped and put to the oar she looked at him with horror that will not violate you my pretty said the forkbeard in this punishment the girl clothed or unclothed is bound tightly on an oar hands behind her her head down toward the blade when the oar lifts from the water she gasps for breath only in another moment to be submerged again a recalcitrant girl may be kept on the oar for hours there is also however some danger in this for sea sleen and the white sharks of the north occasionally attempt to tear such a girl from the oar when food is low it is not unknown for the men of torvaldsland to use a bondmaid if one is available on the ship for bait in such a manner the least pleasing girl is always used this practice of course encourages bondmaids to vie vigorously to please their masters an ahn on the oar is usually more than sufficient to make the coldest and proudest of females an obedient eagertoplease bondmaid it is regarded as second only to the fivelash gorean slave whip used also in the south and what among the men of torvaldsland is called the whip of the furs in which the master with his body incontrovertibly teaches the girl her slavery open your mouth my largebreasted beauty said the forkbeard eyes wide she did so he thrust the contents of the small bowl into her mouth choking the proud aelgifu swallowed the thick gruel that of dampened satarna meal and raw fish the gruel of bondmaids tomorrow night i shall have your ransom he said tomorrow night she cried i shall be free of you he threw the cup back to the stern of the ship and returned to sit down with me i think i may have devised a plan i said to meet the jaris axs gambit good said the forkbeard studying the board we heard sobbing from the bondmaids we looked and saw the slender blondish girl weeping her body shaken by sobs head down be silentl said one of the other girls they will beat us gorm was then at her and struck her five times with his knotted rope the slender blond girl stifled her sobs yes myjarl she wept then she put her head down and was silent though her body still shook the forkbeard and i returned to our game chapter feed her on the gruel of bondmaids it was at noon of the following day that the lookout cried out serpent to starboard the forkbeard looked up from the board swiftly the men of ivar forkbeard too suddenly came alive they rushed to the starboard gunwales still they could see nothing benches called the forkbeard swiftly his men took their places i heard the oars slide half outboard do not disturb the arrangement of the pieces said ivar forkbeard leaving the board he climbed halfway up the knotted rope halfway up the mast i stood up the day was cloudy the awning had not been stretched this day it lay rolled between the benches i could see nothing the bondmaids looked about themselves frightened gorm was suddenly among them he began one by one fettering their hands behind their backs when he had done this he knelt among them crossing their ankles tying them too tightly if there was to be battle they would be utterly helpless completely unable to interfere in the least way they would await the battles result and their disposition they were females at the mast aelgifu stood still chained to it by the neck her wrists still fettered before her it is the serpent of thorgard of scagnar cried out forkbeard much pleased is he an ally i asked no laughed the forkbeard delighted an enemy i saw the men of the forkbeard grinning one to the other the huge feliow with grayish face who seemed generally much in lethargy who had slaughtered with such frenzy in the temple of kassau slowly lifted his head i thought i saw his nostrils flare his mouth opened slightly and i saw his teeth the forkbeard then ordered the sail high reefed set even to the spar keep her stern to the wind he said the oars slid outboard let free the ship will swing prow to the wind we have time said ivar forkbeard for another move or two i am still attempting to break the jarls axs gambit i said singer to ax two is not a strong move said the forkbeard twice yesterday in long games until the torvaldsland gulls had left the sea and returned inland i had failed to meet the gambit you intend to follow it of course said the forkbeard with jarl to your ax four yes i admitted interesting said the forkbeard let us play that variation it was a popular variation in the south it is seen less frequently in the north in the south of course the response is to the ubars tarnsmans gambit i could see that the forkbeard though expecting the variation given the preceding four moves was delighted when it had materialized he had perhaps seldom played it the serpent of thorgard has seen us called the lookout not at all dismayed excellent said ivar forkbeard now we will not be forced to wind the signal horns across the water i grinned tell me about thorgard of scagnar i said he is an enemy said ivar forkbeard simply the ships of this thorgard i said have often preyed on the shipping of port kar the shipping of port kar smiled ivar forkbeard is not uniquely distinguished in this respect he is therefore said i my enemy as well as yours what is your name had asked the forkbeard call me tarl i said it is a name of torvaldsland he said are you not of torvaldsland no i had told him tarl what he had asked it is enough that you call me tarl i said smiling very well said he but here to distinguish you from others in the north we must do better than that how is that i asked he looked at my hair and grinned we will call you tarl red hair he said very well i said your city he asked what is it you may think of me i had said as one of port kar very well said he but i think we shall not make a great deal of that for the men of port kar are not overly popular in the north the men of torvaldsland i assured him are not overly popular in the south the men of port kar however said the forkbeard are respected in the north the men of torvaldslahd i told him are similarly respected in the south gorean enemies if skilled often hold one another in high regard you play kaissa well had said ivar forkbeard let us be friends you too are quite skilled i told him indeed he had much bested me i still had not fathomed the devious variations of the jarls axs gambit as played in the north i expected however to solve it we had shaken hands over the board friend he had said friend i had said we had then tasted salt each from the back of the wrist of the other the serpent of thorgard wheels upon us called the lookout cheerily shall i get the great bow from my belongings i asked ivar forkbeard i knew its range well exceeded that of the shorter bows of the north no said the forkbeard eight pasangs away called the lookout the serpent hunts us the forkbeard and i played four more moves fascinating he said four pasangs away called the lookout what shield is at his mast called the forkbeard the red shield called the lookout raise no shield to our own mast said the forkbeard his men looked at him puzzled thorgard is quite proud of his great longship he said the serpent called black sleen i had heard of the ship it has a much higher freeboard area than this vessel i told ivar forkbeard it is a warship not a raider in any engagement you would be at a disadvantage the forkbeard nodded it is said too said i to be the swiftest ship in the north that we will find out said the forkbeard two pasangs away called the lookout it has forty benches said ivar forkbeard eighty oars one hundred and sixty rowers the benches on only one side i recalled are counted but her lines are heavy and she is a weighty ship do you intend to engage her i asked i would be a fool to do so said the forkbeard i have with me the loot ofthe temple of kassau and eighteen bondmaids and lovely aelgifu i would have much to lose and little to gain that is true i said when i engage thorgard of scagnar said ivar eiorkbeard i shall do so to my advantage not his one pasang called the lookout do not disturb the pieces said ivar getting up he said to gorm take the first bondmaid and draw her up the mast then he said to two others of his men unbind the ankles of the other bondmaids and thrust them to the rail where they may be seen then he said to the rowers on the starboard side when i give the signal let us display to thorgard of scagnar what we can of the riches of the temple of kassau the men laughed will we not fight asked the giant slowly ivar forkbeard went to him as might have a father and took his head in his hands and held it against his chest no battle now said he rollo another time nobattlenow asked the giant no battle now repeated the forkbeard shaking the giants head another time another time there was an agony of disappointment in the large eyes of the huge head another tirne laughed the forkbeard giving the great head a shake as though it might have been that of a pet hound or bear a half pasang and slowing called the lookout she will approach astern swing to face her amidships laughed the forkbeard let them see what riches we carry the blond slender girls wrists were now fettered before her body and a rope attached to the fetters it was thrown over the spar her hands were jerked over her head then by her fettered wrists she moaning her naked body twisting against the mast foot by foot she was drawn to five feet below the spar she dangled there in pain her body that of a stripped bondmaid exquisite tempting squirming a taunt to the blood of the men of thorgard of scagnar that will encourage them to row their best said ivar forkbeard then the other bondmaids seventeen of them were thrust to the rail and steadied by the hands of rowers stood upon it wrists fettered behind them in coffle the ship of thorgard was now little more than a quarter of a pasang away i could detect its captain doubtless the great thorgard himself on its stern deck above the helmsman with a glass of the builders what marvelous beauties he saw seventeen naked prizes fettered and coffled that might be his could he but take them and dangling from the mast perhaps the most exquisite of all the slender blond girl perhaps herself worth five bondmaids of the more common sort aelgifu too of course might be seen chained to the mast her wrists fettered before her that she was clothed would indicate to thorgard thal she was free and might bring high ransom throw the bondmaids between the benches and secure them said ivar to those steadying them at the rail quickly the miserable bondwenches were pulled back and flung belly down some iying on others between the benches gorm quickly bent to them lashing their ankles together lower the wench from the spar called the forkbeard you on the starboard side display now the loot of kassaus temple rowers of ivar forkbeard now took their place at the port side some waved the golden hangings of the temple over their heads as though they might have been banners others jeering across the water lifted up plates and candlesticks the blond slender girl lowered from the mast collapsed at its foot she was pulled to her feet by the arm and thrust running stumbling to gorm he fettered her hands behind her body and thrust her to her belly face down among the other girls he then fastened her again in the coffle and swiftly lashed together her ankles the ship of thorgard was now only some hundred yards away an arrow cleft the air passing over the gunwales throw the loot over the bondmaids called the forkbeard this would provide the miserable wenches terrified and fettered some measure of protection from missiles stones and darts the awning called forkbeard some of the girls looked up the slender blond girl among them and saw the darkness of the awning unrolled quickly cast over the loot some of them screamed being suddenly plunged in darkness more arrows slipped past one struck in the mast aelgifu knelt behind it still chained to it by the neck her head in her fettered hands a javelin struck in the deck a stone bounded from the rail at the top of the port gunwale splintering it the ship of thorgard black sleen was no more than some fifty yards away i could see helmeted men at its gunwales some five feet above the water line the helmets of the north are commonly conical with a noseguard that can slip up and down at the neck and sides attached by rings usually hangs a mantle of linked chain the helmet of thorgard himself however covered his neck and the sides of his face it was horned their shields like those of torvaldsland are circular and of wood the spear points are large and heavy of tapered socketed bronze some eighteen inches in length many too carried axes benches laughed ivar forkbeard sail in my opinion he had waited too long his men leaped to their benches and seized their oars at the same time the sail with its red and white stripes in its full length fell snapping from the yard stroke called ivar a javelin hissed past him the wind like a hammer took the sail the oars bit the water the prow of the serpent of ivar forkbeard leaped from the water and its stern went almost awash stroke called the forkbeard i laughed with pleasure the serpent of ivar forkbeard leaped toward the line of the horizon there was consternation on the deck of black sleen i could see thorgard of scagnar in the horned helmet bearded crying orders the prow of black sleen sluggishly i thought turned our wake i saw men rushing to their benches i saw the long oars lift and then fall a javelin and four more arrows struck the deck of ivars ship two of the arrows struck the plate of the temple of kassau and hung broken in the boskhide awning that covered the forkbeards loot both that of gold and flesh and then anotherjavelin fell behind us into the sea and the bowmen returned to their benches for a quarter of an ahn the forkbeard himself held the helm of his ship but after a quarter of an ahn grinning the forkbeard surrendered the helm to one of his men and came to join me amidships we placed the board again between us on the chest the position of the pieces had not changed held by the boards pegs a most interesting variation said forkbeard returning his attention to the board it may meet thejarls axs gambit i said i think not said forkbeard but let us see after another quarter of an ahn forkbeard bade his men rest at their oars far behind us black sleen reputed to be the fastest ship in the north struggled under oars and sail to match our pace she could not do so under sail alone the serpent of ivar forkbeard almost scornfully sped from her soon she had become no more than a speck astern and was then visible only to the lookout the awning was drawn back and rolled and placed to one side the bondmaids their bodies sweaty broken out from rash and heat struggled to their knees their heads back and drank the fresh air the litter of gold under which they had been forced to lie was kicked to one side gorm then unbound their fair ankles and taking their wrists from behind them once more fettered thenbefore their bodies at their bellies shortly thereafter the were fed certain of them preparing the food life returned to normal aboard the ship soon black sleen was visible no even to the lookout it was growing toward evening take course said ivar forkbeard to his helmsman fo the skerry of einar yes captain said the helmsman aelgifu laughed with joy it was there at the runestone of the torvaldsmark that ivar forkbeard would receive her ransom i discovered to my instruction an ahn later that singer to ax two followed by jari to ax four is insufflcient to counter the jarls axs gambit as it is played in the north i did not think it would be said ivar forkbeard the name of the ship of thorgard of scagnar i said is black sleen what is the name of your ship if i may know the name of my ship said ivar is the hilda is it not unusual for a ship of the north to bear the name of a woman i asked no he said why is she called the hilda i asked that is the name of the daughter of thorgard of scagnar said ivar forkbeard i looked up at him astonished the hilda is my ship said ivar forkbeard and the daughter of thorgard of scagnar will be my bondmaid we lay to without lights a pasang from the skerry of einar the wrists of the bondmaids were fettered behind their backs their ankles were tied they wore the coffle rope of the north and their mouths with waddings of sleen fur and strappings of leather were tightly gagged there was silence on the ship of ivar forkbeard ivar and four men had taken the longboat which is tied keel up on the decking of the after quarter and made their way to the skerry with them her hair combed warmed with a broth of dried bosk meat heated in a copper kettle over a fire on a rimmed iron plate legged set on another plate on the stern quarter her hands tied behind her with simple binding fiber had gone aelgifu gorm who seemed second to ivar and i stood at the railing near the prow on the port side of the serpent i could see against the night sky the darker shape but low in the water of the skerry too against the sky i could see the tall runestone looking like a needle against the stars which forms the torvaldsmark ivar had left the ship in good humor i shall return with aelgifus ransom money he had told us with him in the longboat in a round bronze can with twist lid he had taken his scales collapsible of bronze and chain with their weights i knew that gurt of kassau too would bring his scales i hoped that the weights matched for if they did not there would be trouble indeed gurt i knew if wise would not attempt to cheat the forkbeard i had less confidence in the weights of the man of torvaldsland have you a coin you wish to check had asked ivar seriously of me all right i had said sensing his amusement i had drawn forth from my pouch a golden tarn he had placed it on the scale unfortunately said he this coin is debased it is only threequarters weight it bears the stamp said i of the mints of ar i would have thought better of the mints of ar said he if ar were to produce debased coins i said her trade would be reduced if not ruined have you another coin he asked i put a silver tarsk of tharna on the scale he changed his weight debased said he it is only threequarters weight tharna too i said is apparently tampering with her colnage the worst said ivar forkbeard is likely to be the coinage of lydius i expect so i said i smiled the ransom money of gurt of kassau would doubtless be largely composed of the stamped coin of lydi us the only mint at which gold coins were stamped within a thousand pasangs was in lydius at the mouth of the laurius certain jarls of course in a sense coined money marking bars of iron or gold usually small rectangular solids with their mark ring money was also used but seldom stamped with a jarls mark each ring strung on a larger ring would be individually weighed in scales many transactions are also done with fragments of gold and silver often broken from larger objects such as cups or plates and these must be individually weighed indeed the men of the north think little of breaking apart objects which in the south would be highly prized for their artistic value simply to obtain pieces of negotiable precious metal the fine candlesticks from the temple of kassau for example i expected would be chopped into bits small enough for the pans of the northern scales of their own art and metalwork however it should be mentioned that the men of the north are much more respectful a lovely brooch for example wrought by a northern craftsman would be seldom broken or mutilated i have two pair of scales admitted ivar forkbeard grinning these are my trading scales he said do you think gurt of kassau will accept your scales i asked the forkbeard fingered the silver chain of office looped about his neck which he had taken from the administrator of kassau yes he said i think so we laughed together but now with gorm and the men of ivar forkbeard i waited in silence on his serpent should the forkbeard not have returned by now i asked he is coming now said gorm i peered through the darkness some hundred yards away difficult to see was the longboat i heard the oars in good rhythm lifting and dipping the oar strokes spacing was such that i knew them not in flight then i saw the forkbeard at the tiller the longboat scraped gently at the side of the serpent did you obtain the ransom money i asked yes said he lifting a heavy bag of gold in his hand you were long i said it took time to weigh the gold he said and there was some dispute as to the accuracy of the scales oh i asked yes said the forkbeard the weights of gurt of kassau were too light i see i said here is the gold he said hurling the sack to gorm one hundred and twenty pieces the scales of gurt of kassau i see i said weighed lightly indeed yes laughed the forkbeard he then threw other purses to gorm what are these i asked the purses of those who were with gurt of kassau he said i heard a moan from the longboat and saw something under a fur of sea sleen move the forkbeard threw off the fur revealing the proud aelgifu bound hand and foot gagged lying in the bottom of the boat she still wore her black velvet she looked up her eyes terrified the forkbeard lifted her up to gorm put her in the coffle he told him aelgifu was carried to where the bondmaids perfectly restrained lay the binding fiber on her wrists was removed her hands were fettered behind her the coffle rope was looped about her throat and knotted gorm left her ankles like those of the bondmaids securely bound i helped the forkbeard and his men lift the longboat to the deck it was tied down on the after quarter keel up suddenly an arrow struck the side of the ship free the serpent called the forkbeard benches the two anchor hooks fore and aft were raised they resemble heavy grappling hooks their weight apiece is not great being little more than twentyfive gorean stone or about one hundred earth pounds they are attached to the ship not by chain but by tarred rope the men of the forkbeard scurried to their benches i heard the tholeport caps turned back and the oars thrust through the wood i could see from the shore black and dark more than a dozen small boats containing perhaps ten or fifteen men each moving towards us two more arrows struck the ship others slipped past in the darkness their passage marked by the swift whisper of the feathers and shaft to sea called the forkbeard stroke the serpent turned its prow to sea and the oars moved down entered the water and pulled against it stroke called the forkbeard the serpent slipped away the forkbeard stood angrily at the rail looking back at the small flotilla of boats dark in the night he turned to his men let this be a lesson to you he called to them never trust the men of kassau at the oars the men struck up a rowing song and what did you do with gurt and those with him on the skerry i asked we left them naked said the forkbeard then he looked aft at the small boats falling behind it seems these days he said one can trust no one then he went to the bondmaids remove their gags he sald their gags were removed but they dared not speak they were bondmaids their bodies bound loot prizes of the forkbeard lying in the darkness among the glint of the gold taken in the sack of kassaus temple were very beautiful the forkbeard freed aelgifu of her gag it seems he said that last night was not the last night which you will spend in my bondage you took ransom money she cried you took ransom i have taken more than ransom money said he my largebreasted beauty why did you not free me she cried i want you he said then he looked at her i said only you might remember said he that i would take your ransom money never did i say that i would exchange you for those paltry moneys never did i say my pretty one that i would permit you so luscious a wench as you to escape my fetters she struggled her head turned to one side her wrists locked behind her in the black iron of the north her ankles were bound the coffle rope was on her throat she was miserable welcome to the coffle said he i am free she cried now he said she shuddered you are too pretty to ransom he informed her and turned away to gorm he said feed her on the gruel of bondmaids chapter ivar forkbeards long hall there was a great cheer from the men of ivar forkbeard the serpent turned slowly between the high cliffs and entered the inlet here and there clinging to the rock were lichens and small bushes and even stunted trees the water below us was deep and cold i felt a breeze from inland coming to meet the sea the oars lifted and fell the sail fell slack and rustled stirred in the gentle wind from inland men of torvaldsland reefed it high to the spar the rowing song was strong and happy in the lusty throats of the crew of the forkbeard the serpent took its way between the cliffs looming high on each side ivar forkbeard at the prow lifted a great curved bronze horn and blew a blast i heard it echo among the cliffs amidships crowded together standing facing the starboard side of the vessel were the bondmaids and aelgifu she wore still her black velvet they were in throat coffle their wrists were fettered before their bodies they looked upon the new country harsh forbidding which was to be their home i heard perhaps from a pasang away up the inlet between the cliffs the winding of a horn soon i gathered we would be at forkbeards landfall put her said forkbeard indicating the slender blond girl at the prow she was quickly removed from the coffle and unfettered gorm put a rope on her neck and pulled her to the prow she was held by another crewman he fastened her at the prow her back was bent over it her wrists and ankles drawn back were tied at its sides she was roped to it too at the belly and throat again ivar forkbeard winded the great bronze horn in several seconds an answering blast echoed between the cliffs the oars lifted and dipped the men sang hang gold about the ship he cried candlesticks and cups were hung on strings from the prow plates with iron nails were pounded against the mast golden hangings were draped like banners at the gunwales then the ship turned a bend between the cliffs and to my astonishment i saw a dock of rough logs covered with adzed boards and a wide sloping area of land of several acres green though strewn with boulders with short grass there was a log palisade some hundred yards from the dock high on the cliff i saw a lookout a man with a horn doubtless it had been he whom we had heard from his vantage high on the cliff on his belly unseen he would have been able to see far down the inlet he stood now and waved the bronze horn in his hand forkbeard waved back to him i saw four small milk bosk grazing on the short grass in the distance above the acres i could see mountains snow capped a flock of verr herded by a maid with a stick turned bleating on the sloping hillside she shaded her eyes she was blond she was barefoot she wore an anklelength white kirtle of white wool sleeveless split to her belly about her neck i could see a dark ring men were now running from the palisade and the fields down to the dock they were bareheaded and wore shaggy jackets some wore trousers of skin others tunics of dyed wool i saw too fields fenced with rocks in the sloping area in them were growing small at this season shafts ol satarna too there would be peas and beans cabbages and onions and patches of the golden sul capable of surviving at this latitude i saw small fruit trees and hives where honey bees were raised and there were small sheds here and there with sloping roofs of boards in some such sheds might craftsmen work in others fish might be dried or butter made against one wall of the cliff was a long low shed in that the small bosk and the verr might be housed in the winter and there too would be stored their feed another shed thick with heavy logs in the shadow of the cliff would be the ice house where ice from the mountains brought down on sledges to the valley would be kept covered with chips of wood there were only a few bosk visible and they were milk bosk the sheds i saw would accomodate many more animals i surmised as is common in torvaldsland most of the cattle had been driven higher into the mountains to graze wild during the summer to be fetched back to the shed only in the fall with the coming of winter men in the fields wore short tunics of white wool some carried hoes their hair was close cropped about their throats had been hammered bands of black iron with a welded ring attached they did not leave the fields such a departure without permission might mean their death they were thralls i saw people running down the sloping green land toward the water several came from within the palisade among them white kirtled collared excited ran bondmaids these upon the arrival of their master are perrnitted to greet him the men of the north enjoy the bright eyes the leaping bodies the squealing the greetings of their bondmaids in the fields i saw an overseer clad in scarlet with a gesture of his hand releasing the thralls then they too ran down toward the water it would be holiday i gathered at the hall of ivar forkbeard the forkbeard himself now from a wooden keg poured a great tankard of ale which must have been of the measure of five gallons over this he then closed his fist it was the sign of the hammer the sign of thor the tankard then with two great bronze handles was passed from hands to hands among the rowers the men threw back their heads and the liquid spilling down their bodies drank ale it was the victory ale then the forkbeard himself drained the remains of the tankard threw it to the foot of the mast and then to my astonishment leapt from the ship onto the moving oars the men sang the forkbeard then to the delight of those on the bank who cheered him as the serpent edged into the dock addressed himself delightedly to the oardance of the rover of torvaldsland it is not actually a dance of course but it is an athletic feat of no little stature requiring a superb eye fantastic balance and incredible coordination ivar forkbeard crying out leaped from moving oar to moving oar proceeding from the oars nearest the stem on the port side to the stern then leaping back onto the deck at the stern quarter and leaping again on the oars this time on the starboard side and proceeding from the oar nearest the stern to that nearest the stem and then lifting his arms he leaped again into the ship almost thrown into it as the oar lifted he then stood on the prow near me sweating and grinning i saw cups of ale on the bank being lifted to him men cheered i heard the cries of bondmaids the serpent of ivar forkbeard gently slid against the rolls of leather hung at the side of the dock eager hands vied on the dock to grasp the mooring ropes the oars slid inboard the men hung their shields at the serpents flanks men on the dock cried out with pleasure looking on the harshly roped beauty of the slender blondish girl so cruelly fastened back bent at the prow of the forkbeards serpent i have eighteen others called ivar forkbeard his men laughing thrust the other girls forward to the rail forcing them to stand on the rowing benches heat the irons called the forkbeard they are hot laughed a brawny man in leather apron standing on the dock the girls shuddered they would be branded bring the anvil to the branding log said the forkbeard they knew then they would wear collars it is there laughed the brawny fellow doubtless a smith gorm had now unbound the slender blond girl from the prow he put her at the head of the coffle aelgifu in her black velvet it creased and stained discolored the fabric stiff and separated here and there brought up the rear gorm did not refetter the slender blond girl though he tie her by the neck in the coffle further he removed the fetterl from the other girls too including aelgifu all remained however coffled the gangplank was then thrust over the rail of the ser pent and struck on the heavy adzed boards of the dock the slender blond girl the hand of ivar forkbeard or her arm was thrust to the head of the gangplank she looked down at the cheering men gorm then stood beside ivar forkbeard he carried on a strap over his shoulder a tall dark vessel filled with liquid the men on the shore laughed attached to the vessel by a light chain was a golden cup it had two handles from a spout on the vessel grinning gorm filled the golden cup the liquid swirling in the cup was black drink said ivar forkbeard thrusting the cup into the hands of the slender blond girl she who had so long ago in the temple of kassau worn the snood of scarlet yarn with twisted golden wire the red vest and skirt the white blouse she held the cup it was decorated about its sides cunningly wrought was a design bondmaids chained a chain design also decorated the rim and at five places on the cup was the image of a slave whip fivestrapped she looked at the black liquid drink said the forkbeard she lifted it to her lips and tasted it she closed her eyes and twisted her face it is too bitter she wept she felt the knife of the forkbeard at her belly drink said he she threw back her head and drank down the foul brew she began to cough and weep the coffle rope was untied from her throat send her to the branding log said the forkbeard he thrust the girl down the gangplank into the arms of the waiting men who hurried her from the dock one by one the prizes of ivar forkbeard even the rich proud aelgifu were forced to down the slave wine then they were one by one freed from the coffle and hurried to the branding log ivar forkbeard then followed by gorm and myself and his men descended the gangplank he was much greeted many clasped him and struck him on the back and he too clasped many of them to himself and shook the heads of many in his great hands was the luck good asked one man with a spiral silver ring on his arm fair admitted the forkbeard who is this asked another man indicating me i see his hair has not been cropped and he does not wear the chains of a thrall this is tarl red hair said the forkbeard whose man is he asked the man my own i said have you no jarl asked the man i am my own jarl i said can you play with the ax he asked teach me the ax i said to him your sword is too tiny said he is it used for peeling suls it moves swiftly i said it bites like the serpent he reached out his hand to me and then suddenly gripped me about the waist clearly it was his intention as a joke to hurl me into the water he did not move me he grunted in surprise i took him too about the waist we swayed on the adzed boards the men moved back to give us room ottar enjoys sport said ivar forkbeard with a sudden wrench i threw him from his feet and hurled him from the dock into the water he crawled drenched and sputtering back to the dock tomorrow he laughed i will teach you the ax we clasped hands ottar in the absence of ivar forkbeard kept hls cattle his properties his farm and accounts he plays excellent kaissa said the forkbeard i shall beat him said ottar we shall see i said a bondmaid thrust through the crowd does my jarl not remember gunnhild she asked she whimpered and slipped to his side holding him lifting her lips to kiss him on the throat beneath the beard about her neck riveted was a collar of black iron with a welded ring to which a chain might be attached what of pouting lips said another girl kneeling before him lifting her eyes to his sometimes bondmaids are given descriptive names the girl had full sensuous lips she was blond she also smelled of verr it had doubtless been she whom i had seen on the slope herding verr pouting lips has been in agony awaiting the return of her jarl she whimpered the forkbeard shook her head with his great hand what of olga whined another wench sweet and strapping blackhaired do not forget pretty ankles myjarl said another wench a delicious little thing perhaps not more than sixteen she thrust her lips greedily to the back of his left hand biting at the hair there away you wenches laughed ottar the forkbeard has new prizes fresher meat to chew gunnhild angrily with two hands jerked her kirtle to her waist and stood straight proudly before the forkbeard her breasts which were marvelous thrust forward how magnificent she seemed the heavy black iron at her throat riveted none of them can please you she said as well as gunnhild he seized her in his arms and raped her lips with a kiss his hand at her body then threw her from him to the boards of the dock prepare a feastl he said let a feast be prepared yes my jarl she cried and leaped to her feet running toward the palisade yes my jarl cried the other girls hurrying behind her to begin the preparations for the feast then the forkbeard turned his attention to the serpent and the disembarkment of its riches which on the shoulders of his men and others were carried amid shouts of joy and wonder from those gathered about to the palisade when this was done i accompanied the forkbeard to a place behind and to one side of a forge shed there was a great log there from a fallen tree the bark had been removed from the log it was something in the neighborhood of a yard in thickness against the log kneeling one behind the other their right shoulders in contact with it knelt the new bondmaids and aelgifu some men stood about as well and the brawny fellow the smith nearby on a large flat stone to keep it from sinking into the ground was the anvil a few feet away glowing with heat stood two canister braziers in these among the white coats were irons air by means of a small bellows pumped by a thrall boy in white wool collared hair cropped was forced through a tube in the bottom of each the air above the canisters shook with heat to one side tall broadshouldered stood a young male thrall in the thrall tunic of white wool his hair cropped short an iron collar on his throat she first said the forkbeard indicating the slender blond girl she moaning was seized by a fellow and thrown on her belly over the peeled log two men held her upper arms two others her upper legs a fifth man with a heavy leather glove drew forth one of the irons from the fire the air ab ut its tip shuddered with heat please my jarl she cried do not mark your giri at a sign from the forkbeard the iron was pressed deeply into her flesh and held there smoking for five ihn it was only when it was pulled away that she screamed her eyes had been shut her teeth gritted she had tried not to scream she had dared to pit her will against the iron but when the iron had been pulled back from deep within her flesh smoking she her pride gone her will shattered had screamed with pain long and miserably revealing herself as only another branded girl she by the arm was dragged from the log she threw back her head tears streaming down her face and again screamed in pain she looked down at her body she was marked for identification a hand on her arm she was thrust sobbing to the anvil beside which she was thrust to her knees the brand used by forkbeard is not uncommon in the north though there is less uniformity in torvaldsland on these matters than in the southi where the mercnant caste with its recommendations for standardisation is more powerful all over gor of course the slave girl is a familiar commodity the brand used by the forkbeard found rather frequently in the north consisted of a half circle with at its right tip adjoining it a steep diagonal line the half circle is about an inch and a quarter in width and the diagonal line about an inch and a quarterin height the brand is like many symbolic in the north the bondmaid is sometimes referred to as a woman whose belly lies beneath the sword look up at me said the smith the slender blond girl tears in her eyes looked up at him he opened the hinged collar of black iron about a half inch in height he put it about her throat it also contained a welded ring suitable for the attachment of a chain put your head beside the anvil he said he took her hair and threw it forward and thrust her neck against the left side of the anvil over the anvil lay the joining ends of the two pieces of the collar the inside of the collar was separated by a quarter of an inch from her neck i saw the fine hairs on the back of her neck on one part of the collar are two small flat thick rings on the other is a slngle such ring these rings when the wings of the collar are joined are aligned those on one wing on top and bottom that on the other in the center they fit closely together one on top of the other the holes in each about threeeighths of an inch in diameter too of course are perfectly aligned the smith with his thumb forcibly pushed a metal rivet through the three holes the rivet fits snugly do not move your head bondmaid said the smith then with great blows of the iron hammer he riveted the iron collar about her throat a man then pulled her by the hair from the anvil and threw her to one side she lay there weeping a naked bondmaid marked and collared next called out the forkbeard weeping another girl was flung over the branding log in the end only aelgifu was left the forkbeard with the heel of his boot on the ground drew a bondmaid circle she looked at it then to the laughter of the men her head high lifting her skirt she stepped to the circle and stood facing him within it remove your clothing my pretty one said ivar forkbeard she reached behind the back of her neck and unbuttoned the dress of black velvet and then drew it over her head she stood then before us in a chemise of fine silk this too she drew over her head and threw to the ground she then stood there statuesque proudly ivar licked his lips several of his men cried out with pleasure others struck their left shoulders with the palms of their right hand two who were armed with shield and spear smote the spear blade on the wooden shield will she not be a tasty morsel indeed ivar asked his men the men cheered and struck their shoulders and again the spear blades smote upon the shields fear entered the eyes of the proud aelgifu run to the iron wench suddenly commanded ivar forkbeard harshly moaning aelgifu ran from the circle to the branding log and was thrown over it belly down in a moment the iron had bitten her her scream brought laughter from some of the other bondmaids she was then thrust to the anvil and thrown to her knees beside it i saw the young broadshouldered thrall who had been standing to one side go to the slender blond girl he lifted her to her feet i see thyri said he that you are now a woman whose belly lies beneath the sword wulfstan she said i am called tarsk here he said he fingered the collar on her throat the proud thyri he said a bondmaid he smiled you refused my suit said he do you recall she said nothing you were too good for me he said he laughed now said he doubtless you would crawl on your belly to any man who would free you she looked at him angrily would you not he asked yes wulfstan she said i would he held her by the collar but you will not be freed thyri he said you will continue to wear this you are a bondmaid she looked down it pleases me said he to see you here he stepped back from her she lifted her eyes angrily to look upon him a brand said he improves a woman it improves you thyri your collar too the iron on your neck it against the softness of your body is quite becoming thank you wulfstan said she women said he belong in collars her eyes flashed sometimes said he to discipline a bondmaid she is hurled naked among the thralls he smiled do not fear should this be done to you i in my turn shall use you well bondmaid quite well she shrank back from him the last blows of the smiths hamrner rang out and aelgifu by the hair was pulled from the anvil wearing a collar of black iron hurry bondmaids cried ivar forkbeard hurry lazy girls there is a feast to be prepared the bondmaids thyri and aelgifu among them fled like a frightened herd of tabuk across the short turflike green grass to the gate of the palisade to be put to work ivar forkbeard roared with laughter his head back on his lap naked cuddling sat she who had been aelgifu her arrns about his neck her lips to the side of his head her name had now been changed the new name of the daughter of gurt administrator of kassau was pudding on his other side stripped her collar of black iron at her throat her arms about his waist rubbing herself against his belt was the bondmaid gunnhild i held the large drinking horn of the north there is no way for this to stand upright i said to him puzzled he threw back his head again and roared once more with laughter if you cannot drain it he said give it to another i threw back my head and drained the horn splendid cried the forkbeard i handed the horn to thyri who in her collar naked between two of the benches knelt at my feet yes jarl said she and ran to fill it from the great vat how marvelously beauhful is a naked collared woman your hall said i to the forkbeard is scarcely what had expected i had learned much to my instruction that my conception of the northern halls left much to be desired indeed the true hall lofty highbeamed built of logs and boards with its benches and highseat pillars its carvings and hangings its long fires its suspended kettles was actually quite rare and generally only the richest of the jarls possessed such the hall of ivar forkbeard i learned to my surprise was of a type much more common upon reflection however it seemed to me not so strange that this should be so in a bleak country one in which many of the trees too would be stunted and windtwisted in torvaldsland fine tlmber is at a premium too what fine lumber there is is often marked and hoarded for the use of shipwrights if a man of torvaldsland must choose between his hall and his ship it is the ship which invariably wins his choice furthermore of course were it not for goods won by his ship or ships it would be unlikely that he would have the means to build a hall and house within it his men here jarl said thyri again handing me the horn it was filled with the mead of torvaldsland brewed from fermented honey thick and sweet the hall of ivar forkbeard was a longhouse it was about one hundred and twenty feet gorean in length its walls formed of turf and stone were curved and thick some eight feet or more in thickness it is oriented north and south thls reduces its exposure to the north wind which is partlcularly important in the torvaldsland winter a fire in a rounded pit was in its center it consisted for the most part of a single long room which served for living and eating and sleeping at one end was a cooking compartment separated from the rest of the house by a partition of wood the roof was about six feet in height which meant that most of those within if male were forced to bend over as they moved about the long room besides being low is dark too there is usually lingering smoke in it ventilation is supplied as it is generally in torvaldsland by narrow holes in the roof the center of the hall down its length is dug out about a foot below the ground level in the long center are set the tables and benches also in the center down its length are two long rows of posts each post separated from the next by about seven feet which support the roof at the edges of the hall at ground level is a dirt floor on which furs are spread stones mark sections off into sleeping quarters thus in a sense the hall proper is about a foot below ground level and the sleeping level on each side is at the ground level where the walls begin the sleeping levels which also can accommodate a mansgear though some keep it at the foot of the level are about eight feet in length the hall proper the center of the hall is about twelve feet in width the two bondmaids stripped too like the others for the feast pretty ankles and pouting lips struggled down the length of the smoky dark hall a spitted roasted tarsk on their shoulders they were slapped by the men hurrying them along they laughed with pleasure their shoulders were protected from the heat of the metal spit by rolls of leather the roasted tarsk was flung before us on the table with his belt knife thrusting pudding and gunnhild back ivar forkbeard addressed himself to the cutting of the meat he threw pieces down the length of the table i heard men laughing too from the darkness behind me and more than forty feet away on the raised level i heard the screams of a raped bondmaid she was one of the new girls i had seen her being dragged by the hair to the raised platform her screams were screams of pleasure well said ivar forkbeard to me i am an outlaw i did not know that i said that is one reason said he that my hall is not of wood i see i said but you have at least a palisade i said he threw me a piece of meat he cut two small pieces and thrust them in the mouths of pudding and gunnhild they ate obediently his pets the palisade he said is low and the cracks are filled with daub i tore a piece of meat from what ivar had thrown me and held it to thyri she smiled at me she was trying to learn how to please a man thank you my jarl she said she took the meat delicately in her teeth i grinned and she looked down frightened she knew that soon she might be taught truly how to please men you are rich i said and have many men surely you could have a hall of wood if you wished why did you come to torvaldsland suddenly asked ivar forkbeard on a work of vengeance i told him i hunt one of the kurii they are dangerous said ivar forkbeard i shrugged one has struck here said ottar suddenly ivar looked at him last month said ottar a verr was taken i knew then that it could not be the one of the kurii i sought we hunted him but failed to find him said ottar doubtless he has left the district said ivar do the beasts often bother you i asked no said ivar they seldom hunt this far to the south they are rational i told him they have a language that is known to me said ivar i did not tell ivar that those he knew as kurii or the beasts were actually specimens of an alien race that they or those in their ships were locked in war with priestkings for the domination of two worlds gor and the earth in these battles unknown to most men even of gor from time to time ships of the kurii had been shattered and fallen to the surface it was the practice of priestkings to destroy the wrecks of such ships but usually at least they did not attempt to hunt and exterminate survivors if the marooned kurii abided by the weapon and technology laws of priestkings they like men another life form were perrmitted to survive the kurii i knew were beasts of fierce terrible instincts who regarded humans and other beasts as food blood as to the shark was an agitant to their systems they were extremely powerful and highly intelligent though their intellectual capacities like those of humans were far below those of priestkings fond of killing and technologically advanced they were in their way worthy adversaries of priestkings most lived in ships the steel wolves of space their instincts bridled to some extent by ship loyalty ship law it was thought that their own world had been destroyed this seemed plausible when one considered their ferocity and greed and what might be its implementation in virtue of an advanced technology their own world destroyed the kurii now wished another the kurii of course with which the men of torvaldsland might have had dealings might have been removed by as much as generations from the kurii of the ships it was regarded as one of the great dangers of the war however that the kurii of the ships might make contact with and utilize the kurii of gor in their schemes men and the kurii where they met which was usually only in the north regarded one another as mortal enemies the kurii not unoften fed on men and men of course in consequence attempted to hunt and slay when they could the beasts usually however because of the power and ferocity of the beasts men would hunt them only to the borders of their own districts particularly if only the loss of a bosk or thrall was involved it was usually regarded as quite sufficient even by the men of torvaldsland to drive one of the beasts out of their own district they were especially pleased when they had managed to harry one into the district of an enemy how will you know the one of the kurii whom you seek asked ivar i think i said he will know me you are a brave or foolish man said ivar i drank more of the mead i ate too of the roast tarsk you are of the south said ivar i have a proposition a scheme what is that i asked the bondmaid olga laughing and kicking thrown helplessly over the shoulder of an oarsman was carried past i saw several of the bondmaids in the arms of ivars men among them too some trying to resist were the new girls one who had irritated an oarsman her hands held was beaten crying out with his belt released she began to kiss him weeping trying to please him men laughed another of the new girls was thrown over one of the benches she lay on her back her head was down her dark hair lon wild was in the dirt and reeds strewn on the floor of the hall her head twisted from side to side her eyes were close her lips were parted i saw her teeth do not stop jarl she begged your bondmaid begs you not to stop i am an outlaw said ivar in a duel i killed fin broadbeit it was in a duel i said finn broadbelt was the cousin of jarl svein blue tooth ah i said svein blue tooth was the high jarl of torvaldsland in the sense that he was generally regarded as th e most powerful in his hall it was said he fed a thousand men beyond this his heralds could carry the war arrow it was said to ten thousand farms ten ships he had at his own wharves and it was said he could sumrnon a hundred more he is your jarl i asked he was my jarl said ivar forkbeard the wergild must be high i speculated the forkbeard looked at me and grinned it was set so high said he out of the reach of custom and law against the protests of the runepriests and his own men that none in his belief could pay it and thus said i that your outlawry would remain in effect until you were apprehended or slain he hoped to drive me from torvaldsland said ivar he has not succeeded in doing so i said ivar grinned he does not know where i am said he if he did a hundred ships might enter the inlet how much asked i is the wergild a hundred stone of gold said ivar you have taken that much or more said i in the sack of kassaus temple and the weight of a fullgrown man in the sapphires of schendi said the forkbeard i said nothing are you not surprised asked ivar it seems a preposterous demand i admitted smiling you know however what i did in the south asked ivar it is well known i said that you freed chenbar the sea sleen ubar of tyros from the chains of a dungeon of port kar your fee being his weight in the sapphires of schendi i did not mention to the forkbeard that it had been i as bosk of port kar admiral of the city who had been responsible for the incarceration of chenbar yet i admired the audacity of the man of torvaldsland though his act in freeing chenbar to act against me had almost cost me my life last year in the northern forests sarus of tyros acting under his orders had struck to capture both marlenus of ar and myself he had failed to capture me and i had eventually managed to free marlenus his men and mine and defeat sarus now laughed ivar forkbeard i expect that these nights svein blue tooth rests less well in his furs you have already i said accumulated one hundred stone of gold and the weight of chenbar of tyros the sea sleen in the sapphires of schendi but there is one thing more which the blue tooth demanded of me said ivar the moons of gor i asked no said he the moon of scagnar i do not understand i said the daughter said he of thorgard of scagnar hilda the haughty i laughed thorgard of scagnar i said has power comparable to that of the blue tooth himself you are of port kar said ivar my house is in that city said i is thorgard of scagnar not an enemy of those of port kar he asked we of port kar i said have little quarrel generally with those oi scagnar but it is true that the ships of this thorgard have preyed with devastation upon our shipping many men of port kar has he given to the bosom of thassa woud you say asked ivar that he is your enemy yes i said i would say that he is my enemy you hunt one of the kurii said ivar yes i said it may be dangerous and difflcult he said it is quite possible i admitted it might be good sport said he to engage in such a hunt you are welcome to accompany me i said is it of concern to you whether or not the daughter oi thorgard of scagnar wears a collar it does not matter to me said i whether she wears a collar or not i think soon said he his daughter might be fetched to the hal of ivar forkbeard it will be difficult and dangerous i said it is quite possible said he am i welcome to accompany you i asked he grinned gunnhild said he run for a horn of mead yes my jarl said she and sped from his side in a moment through the dark smoky hall returned gurmhild bearing a great horn of mead my jarls said she the forkbeard took from her the horn of mead and together we drained it we then clasped hands you are welcome to accompany me said he then he rose to his feet behind the table drink called he to his men drink mead to hilda the haughty daughter of thorgard of scagnar his men roared with laughter bondmaids collared and naked fled about filling horns with mead feast called ivar forkbeard feast much meat was eaten many horns were drained though the hall of ivar forkbeard was built only of turf and stone and though he himself was outlaw he had met me at lts door after i had been bidden wait outside in his finest garments of scarlet and gold and carrying a bowl of water and a towel welcome to the hall of ivar forkbeard he had said i had washed my hands and face in the bowl held by the master of the house himself and dried myself on the towel then invited within i had been seated across from him in the place of honor then from his chests within the hall he had given me a long swirling cloak of the fur of sea sleen a bronzeheaded spear a shield of painted wood reinforced with bosses of iron the shield was red in color the bosses enameled yellow a helmet conical of iron with hanging chain and a steel nosepiece that might be raised and lowered in its bands and too a shirt and trousers of skin and too a broad ax formed in the fashion of torvaldsland large curved singlebladed and four rings of gold that might be worn on the arm my gratitude said i you play excellent kaissa had said he i surmised to myself that the help of the forkbeard might in the bleak realities of torvaldsland be of incalculable value he might know the haunts of kurii he might know dialects of the north some of which are quite divergent from standard gorean as it is spoken say in ar or koroba or even in distant turia the habits and customs of the northern halls and villages might be familiar to him i had no wish to be thrown bound beneath the hoes of thralls because i had inadvertently insulted a free manatarms or breached a custom perhaps as simple as using the butter before someone who sat closer to the highseat pillars than myself most importantly the forkbeard was a mighty fighter a brave man a cunning mind in my work in the north i was grateful that i might have so formidable an ally to put a collar on the throat of the daughter of thorgard of scagnar seemed small enough price to pay for the assistance of so mighty a comrade thorgard of scagnar vicious and cruel one of the most powerfill of the northern jarls was my enemy too he had in his ship black sleen hunted us at sea i smiled let his daughter hilda the haughty beware i looked to the forkbeard he had one arm about the full naked waist of the daughter of the administrator of kassau pudding and the other about the waist of marvelously breasted collared gunnhild taste your pudding my jarl begged pudding he kissed her gunnhild gunnhild protested gunnhild her hand was inside his furred shirt he turned and thrust his mouth upon hers let pudding please you wept pudding let gunnhild please you cried gunnhild i will please you better said pudding i will please you better cried gunnhild ivar forkbeard stood up both bondmaids looked up at him touching him run to the furs said ivar forkbeard both of youl both girls quickly fled to his furs he stepped over the bench and followed them at the foot of the ground level which is the sleeping level which lies about a foot above the dugout floor the long center of the hall on the floor against the raised dirt here and there were rounded logs laid lengthwise each log is ten to fifteen feet long and commonly about eight inches to a foot thick if one thinks of the sleeping level on each side as constituting in effect a couch almost the length of the hall except for the cooking area the logs lie at the foot of these two couches and parallel to their foot about each log fitting snugly into deep wide circular grooves in the wood were several iron bands these each contained a welded ring to which was attached a length of chain termmating in a blackiron fetter gunnhild thrust out her left ankle the forkbeard fettered her a moment later pudding too had thrust forth her ankle and her ankle too was locked in a fetter of the north the forkbeard threw off his jacket there was a rustle of chain as the two bondmaids turned puddingon her left side gunnhild on her right waiting for the forkbeard to lie between rhem i heard men down the table laughing one of the new girls from kassau had been thrown on her back on the table she lay in meat and spilled mead she was kicking and laughing trying to push back from her body the pressing jackets of fur of the men of torvaldsland another girl i saw was seized and thrown to the darkness of the sleeping platform i saw her white body briefly trying to crawl away but he who had thrown her upon the furs seized her ankle and drew her to him she was thrown mercilessly under him her shoulders pressed back her beauty his prize i saw her head lift thrusting her lips to his but it was then thrust back and she whimpered her body squirming held helpless loot his to be done with as he pleased when he lifted his mouth from hers she put her arrns about his neck and thrust up her head again lips parted my jarl she wept my jarl then he again thrust her back to the furs with such force that she cried out and then he with rudeness and incredible force used her for his pleasure i saw her body struck again and again she clinging to him helplessly he gave her no quarter bondmaids are treated without mercy i love you my jarl she screamed men at the tables mead spilling chewing on meat laughed at her she wept and cried out with pleasure when the oarsman had finished with her and would return to the table she tried to hold him he struck her back on the furs weeping she held out her arms to him he returned to his mead i saw another oarsman then crawl to her and by the hair pull her into his arms in a moment i saw her collared body desperately pressing and rubbing against hirn he in her small white arms her belly thrust against the great buckle of the master belt then he too threw her to her back i love you my jarls she wept i love you my jarls there was much laughter i looked to one side there at a bench lethargic somnolent like a great stone or a sleeping larl sat rollo he of such great stature with grayish skin he was barechested about his neck looped was a cord of woven golden wire with a golden pendant in the shape of an ax he was shaggy haired he seemed not to be aware of the wildness of the feast he seemed not to hear the laughter the screams of the yielding bondmaids he sat with his hands on his knees hls eyes were closed a bondmaid passing him carrying mead brushed him frightened she hurried past him his eyes did not open rollo rested oh no i heard pudding say i turned to look to the forkbeards couch from about his neck he had taken the silver chain which had been the symbol of office of gurt administrator of kassau he had forcibly drawn puddings hands behind her and cunningly twisting the chain had fastened her wrists behind her with it she sat on the furs her left ankle clasped in the iron fetter which chained her to the log at the foot of the forkbeards couch her wrists fastened behind her with her fathers chain of office she looked at the forkbeard with fear he then threw her to her back do not forget gunnhild whined gunnhild pressing her lips to the forkbeards shoulder i heard the movement of her own chain on the log male thralls are chained for the night in the bosk sheds bondmaids are kept in the hall for the pleasure of the free men they are often handed from one to the other it is the responsibility of he who last sports with them to secure them i heard screams of pleasure i looked down at thyri kneeling beside my bench she looked up at me frightened she was a beautiful girl with a beautifill face she was delicate sensitive her eyes were highly intelligent beautiful and deep a collar of black iron was riveted on her throat run to the furs bondmaid i said harshly thyri leaped to her feet and fled to my furs weeping i finished a horn of mead rose to my feet and went to my sleeping area she lay there her legs drawn up ankle i said to her i looked upon her her eyes were on mine frightened her body small white curved luscious contrasted with the shadowed redness and blackness o the soft deep furs on which she lay she trembled ankle i told her she extended her shapely limb i took her ankle and about it closed the fetter of black iron i then joined her upon the furs chapter the kur the next five days were pleasant ones for me in the mornings under the eye of ottar keeper of forkbeards farm i learned the ax the blade bit deep into the post more back laughed ottar put more back into it the men cried out with pleasure as the blade then with a single stroke split through the post thyri and other bondmaids leaped and clapped their hands how alive and vital they seemed their hair was loose in the fashion of bondmaids their eyes shone their cheeks were flushed each inch of them each marvelous imbonded inch of them was incredibly alive and beautiful how incredibly feminine they were so living and uninhlbited and delightful so utterly fresh so free so spontaneous so open in their emotions and the movements of their bodies they now moved and laughed and walked and stood as women pride was not permitted them joy was only a kirtle of thin white wool split to the belly stood between their beauty and the leather of their masters again again please my jarl cried thyri once more the great ax struck the post it jerked in the earth and another foot of it splintering flew from the ax well done said ottar then suddenly he struck at me with his own ax i caught the blow on its handle with the handle of my ax and lifting my left fist not releasing my ax hurled him from his feet to his left he sprawled on the turf and i leaped over him my ax raised splendid he cried the bondmaids cried out with pleasure gunnhild pouting lips olga thyri and others ottar leaped up laughing and raised his ax against the delighted girls they fled back from him squealing and laughing olga he said there is butter to be churning in the churning shed yes my jarl said she holding her skirt up running from the place of our exercises gunnhild pouting lips said he to the looms yes jarl said they turning and hurrying toward the hall their looms lay against its west wall you little wench said ottar to thyri she stepped back yes jarl she said you he said gather verr dung in your kirtle and carry to the sul patch yesjarl she laughed and turned away i watched her as she ran barefoot to do his bidding she was exquisite you other lazy girls cried ottar addressing the remaining bondmaids is it your wish to be cut into strips and fed to parsit fish no my jarl they cried to your labors cried he shrieking they turned about and fled away now twice more said ottar to me his hand on his broad black belt inlaid with gold then we will find another post there are many tricks in the use of the ax feints are often used and short strokes and the handle jabbing and punching a full swing of course should it miss exposes the warrior certain elementary stratagems might be mentioned the following are typical it is pretended to have taken a full swing even to the cry of the kill but the swing is held short and not followed through the antagonist then if unwary may rush forward and be taken the ax turned offguard by the back cut from the left to right sometimes it is possible too lf the opponent carries his shield too high to step to the left and with a looping stroke cut off the shield arm a low stroke too can be dangerous for the human foot as swift as a sapling may be struck away defensively of course if one can lure the full stroke and yet escape it one has an instant to press the advantage this is sometimes done by seeming to expose more of the body than one wary to the ax might that to tempt the antagonist he thinking he is dealing with an unskilled foe to prematurely commit the weight of his body to a full blow the ax of torvaldsland is one of the most fearful of the weapons on gor if one can get behind the ax of course one can meet it but it is not easy to get behind the ax of one who knows its use he need only strike one blow he is not likely to launch it until it is assured of its target an ahn later the forkbeard accompanied by ottar keeper of his farm and tarl red hair now of forkbeards landfall inspected his fields the northern satarna in its rows yellow and sprouting was about ten inches high the growing season at this latitude mitigated by the torvaldstream was about one hundred and twenty days this crop had actually been sown the preceding fall a month following the harvest festival it is sown early enough however that before the deep frosts temporarily stop growth a good root system can develop then in the warmth of the spring in the softening soil the plants hardy and rugged again assert themselves the yield of the fallsown satarna is statistically larger than that of the springsown varieties good said the forkbeard he climbed to his feet he knocked the dirt from the knees of his leather trousers good he said satarna is the major crop of the forkbeards lands but too there are many gardens and as i have noted bosk and verr too are raised ottar dug for the forkbeard and myself two radishes and we wiping the dirt from them ate them the tospits in the forkbeards orchard which can grow at this latitude as the larma cannot were too green to eat i smiled recalling that tospits almost invariably have an odd number of seeds saving the rarer longstemmed variety i do not care too much for tospits as they are quite bitter some men like them they are commonly used sliced and sweetened with honey and in syrups and to flavor with their juices a variety of dishes they are also excellent in the prevention of nutritional deficiencies at sea in long voyages containing i expect a great deal of vitamin c they are sometimes called the seamans larma they are a fairly hardfleshed fruit and are not difficult to dry and store on the serpents they are carried in small barrels usually kept with vegetables under the overturned keel of the longboat we stopped by the churning shed where olga sweating had finished making a keg of butter we dipped our fingers into the keg it was quite good take it to the kitchen said the forkbeard yes my jarl she said hurry lazy girl said he yes my jarl she said seizing the rope handle of the keg and leaning to the right to balance it hurried from the churning shed earlier before he had begun his tour of inspection pudding had come to him and knelt before him holding a plate of satarna loaves the daughter of gurt the administrator of kassau was being taught to bake she watched fearfully as the forkbeard bit into one it needs more salt he had said to her she shuddered do you think you are a bondmaid of the south he asked no my jarl she had said do you think it is enough for you to be pleasant in the furs he asked oh no my jarl she cried bondmaids of the north must know how to do useful things he told her yes my jarl she cried take these said he to the stink pen and with them swill the tarsks yes myjarl she wept leaping to her feet and fleeing away bondmaid called he she stopped and turned do you wish to go to the whipping post he asked this is a stout post outside the hall of peeled wood with an iron ring near the top to which the wrists of a bondmaid crossed are lashed over her head near the bosk shed there is a similar post with a higher ring used for thralls no my jarl cried pudding see then said he that your baking improves yes myjarl she said and fled away it is not bad bread said ivar forkbeard to me when she had disappeared from sight he broke me a piece we finished it it was really quite good but as the forkbeard ha said it could have used a dash more salt when we left the side of the hall we had stopped briefly to watch gunnhild and pouting lips at the standing looms they worked well and stood beautifully under the eyes of the forkbeard otto had then joined us and we had begun our inspection shortly before concluding our inspection we had stopped at the shed of the smith whose name was gautrek we had then continued on our way on the way back to the hall cutting through the tospit trees we had passed by the sul patch in it his back to us hoeing was the young broadshouldered thrall in his white tunic with cropped hair he did not see us approaching him her kirtle held high in two hands it filled with verr dung was blond collared thyri she has good legs said ottar we were quite close to them neither of them saw us thyri in the afternoon had made many trips to the sul patch this however was the first time she had encountered the young man earlier he had been working with other thralls at the shore with parsit nets ah said he greetings my fine young lady of kassau she looked at him her eyes flashing did you think in kassau he asked that you would one day be dunging the fields of one of torvaldsland she said nothing to him i did not know in kassau said he that you had such fine legs he laughed why did you not in kassau he asked show us what fine legs you have she was furious she holding her kirtle with her left hand angrily scattered the dung about the sul plants it would be left to a thrall to hoe it in about the plants oh do not lower your kirtle thyri said he your brand is quite lovely will you not show it again to wulfstan of kassau angrily she drew her kirtle up revealing her thigh then furiously she thrust it down how do you like it thyri asked he to find that you are now a girl whose belly lies beneath the sword it lies not beneath your sword she snapped i belong to free men then with the brazenness of a bondmaid she thyri who had been the fine young lady of kassau threw her kirtle up over her hips and leaning forward spit furiously at the thrall he leaped toward her but ottar was even quicker he struck wulfstan the thrall tarsk behind the back of his neck with the handle of his ax wulfstan fell stunned in an instant ottar had bound the young mans hands before his body he then jerked him to his knees by the iron collar you have seen what your ax can do to posts said he to me now let us see what it can do to the body of a man he then threw the young thrall to his feet holding him by the collar his back to me the spine of course would be immediately severed moreover part of the ax will if the blow be powerful emerge from the abdomen it takes however more than one blow to cut a body that of a man in two to strike more than twice however is regarded as clumsiness the young man stood numbly caught thyri her kirtle down shrank back her hand before her mouth you have seen said ottar to the forkbeard that he has been bold with a bondmaid the property of free men thralls and bondmaids sometimes said i banter he would have put his hands upon her said ottar that seemed true and was surely more serious bondmaids were after all the property of free men it was not permitted for a thrall to touch them would you have touched her asked the forkbeard yes my jarl whispered the young man you see cried ottar let red hair strike i smiled let llim be whipped instead i said no cried ottar let it be as red hair suggests said the forkbeard he then looked at the thrall run to the whipping post he said beg the first free rnan who passes to beat you yes myjarl he said he would be stripped and bound wrists over his head to the post at the bosk shed fifty strokes said the forkbeard yes my jarl said the young man the lash said the forkbeard will be the snake his punishment would be heavy indeed the snake is a singlebladed whip weighted of braided leather eight feet long and about a half an inch to an inch thick it is capable of lifting the flesh from a mans back sometimes it is set with tiny particles of metal it was not impossible that he would die under its blows the snake is to be distinguished from the much more common gorean slave whip with its five broad striking surfaces the latter whip commonly used on females punishes terribly it has however the advantage of not marking the victim no one is much concerned of course with whether or not a thrall is marked a girl with an unmarked back commonly will bring a much hlgher price than a comparable wench if her back be muchly scarred men commonly relish a smooth female except for the brand scar in turia and ar it might be mentioned it is not uncommon for a female slave to be depilated the young thrall looked at me it was to me that he owed his life thank you my jarl he said then he turned and wrists still bound before his body as ottar had fastened them ran toward the bosk shed go ottar to the forge shed said the forkbeard grinning tell gautrek to pass by the bosk shed ottar grinned good he said gautrek was the smith i did not envy the young man and ottar said the forkbeard see that the thrall returns to his work in the morning i shall said ottar and turned toward the forge shed i hear red hair said ivar forkbeard that your lessons with the ax proceed well i am pleased if ottar should think so i said i too am pleased that he should think so said ivar forkbeard for that is indication that it is true then he turned away i shall see you tonight at the feast he said is there to be another feast i asked what is the occasion there had been feasts the past four nights that we are pleased to feast said ivar forkbeard that is occasion enough he then turned away i turned to the girl thyri i stood over her part of what occurred here i told her is your fault bondmaid she put her head down i hate him she said but i would not have wanted him to be killed she looked up am i to be punished my jarl she asked yes i told her fear entered her eyes how beautiful she was but with the whip of the furs i laughed i look forward eagerly my jarl laughed she to my punishment run said i she turned and ran toward the hall but after a few steps turned and faced me i await your discipline my jarl she cried and then turned again and fled that fine young lady of kassau barefoot and collared now only a bondmaid to the hall to the furs to await her discipline is it only a bondmaid my jarl asked thyri who can know these pleasures it is said i said that only a bondmaid can know them she lay on her back her head turned toward me i lay at her side on one elbow her left knee was drawn up about her left ankle locked was the blackiron fetter with its chain on her throat was the collar of iron then myjarl said sheo i am happy that i am a bondmaid i took her again in my arrns red hair called ivar forkbeard come with mel rudely i thrust thyri from me leaving her on the furs in moments ax in its sheath on my back i joined the forkbeard outside were gathered several men both of ivars ship and of the farm arnong them eyes terrified crookedbacked was a cringing lame thrall lead us to what you have found demanded the forkbeard we followed the man more than four pasangs up the slopes leading to the summer pastures then on a height from which we could see far below the farm and ship of ivar forkbeard we stopped behind a large rock the cringing thrall frightened indicated what he had found then he did not wish to look upon it i was startled are there larls in these mountains i asked the men looked at me as though i might have been insane no sieen did this said i we iooked down at the remains of a bosk torn apart eaten through even large bones had been broken snapped apparently in rnighty jaws the marrow sucked from thern the brains too had been scooped with a piece of wood from the skull did you not know asked ivar forkbeard of what animal this is the work no i said this has been killed by one of the kurii he said for four days we hunted the animal but we did not find it though the kill was recent we found no trace of the predator we must find it had said the forkbeard it must learn it cannot with impunity hunt on the lands of forkbeard but we did not find it we did not have a feast as we had intended on the night on which the bosk had been found eaten nor on the next nights in vain we hunted the men grew angry sullen apprehensive even the bondmaids no longer laughed and sported there might for all we knew be somewhere in the lands of ivar forkbeard one of the kurii it must have left the district said ottar on the fourth night there have been no further kills pointed out gautrek the smith who had hunted with us do you think it is the one who killed the verr last month i asked ottar and similarly disappeared i do not know said ottar it could be for those of the kurii are quite rare this far to the south it may have been driven fram its own kind said the forkbeard one too vicious even to be tolerated in its own caves it might too said ottar be insane or ignorant perhaps suggested gorm it is diseased or injured and can no longer hunt the swift deer of the north in these cases too i supposed one of the kurii might be driven by teeth and claws from its own caves kurii i suspected those of gor as well as those of the ships did not tolerate weakness at any rate i said it seems now to be gone we are safe now said gautrek shall we have a feast asked gorm no said the forkbeard this night my heart is not in feasting at least the beast is gone said gautrek we are safe now said gorm i awakened in the darkness thyris body was snuggled against mine she was asleep i had not used her this night she was fettered of course i lay very still for some reason i was uneasy i heard the heavy breathing of the men in the hall at my side i heard thyris breathing too deep and soft that of the smaller lungs of a girl i did not move i felt or thought i felt a breath of fresh air i lay in the darkness i did not move then i smelled it with a cry of rage i leaped to my feet on the couch hurling away the furs in the same instant i felt myself seized in great clawed paws and lifted high into the air of the hall i could not see my assailant then i was hurled over the couch against the curved wall of turf and stone what is going on i heard cry thyri awakened screamed i lay stunned at the foot of the wall on the couch torches cried the forkbeard torches men cried out bondmaids screamed i heard the sound of feeding then in the light of a torch lifted by the forkbeard lit from being thrust beneath the ashes of the fire pit we saw it it was not more than ten feet from me it lifted its face from the halfeaten body of a man its eyes large round blazed in the light of the torch i heard the screaming of bondmaids the movements of their chains their ankles were held by their fetters weapons cried the forkbeapd kur kur i heard men cry the beast stood there blinking bent over the body it was unwilling to surrender it its fir was sable mottled with white its ears large pointed and wide were laid back flat against its head it was perhaps seven feet tall and weighed four or five hundred pounds its snout was wide leathery there were two nostrils slitlike its tongue was dark it had two rows of fangs four of which were particularly prominent those in the first row of fangs above and below in the position of canines of these the upper two were particularly long and curved its arms were longer and larger than its legs it held the body it was devouring in clawed pawlike hands yet sixdigited extrajointed almost like tentacles it hissed and howled and eyes blazing fangs bared threatened us no one could seem to move it stood there in the torchlight threatening us unwilling to surrender its body then behind it i saw an uplifted ax and the ax struck down cutting its backbone a foot beneath its neck it slumped forward over the couch half falling across the body of a hysterical bondmaid behind it i saw rollo he did not seem in a frenzy nor did he seem human he had struck when others gautrek gorm i even the forkbeard had been unable to do other than look upon it with horror rollo again lifted the ax no cried ivar forkbeard the battle is done the giant lowered his ax and slowly returned to his couch to sleep one of his men touched its snout with the butt of his spear and then thrust it into the beasts mouth the butt of the spear was torn away the bondmaids screamed it is still alive cried gorm get it out of here said ivar forkbeard beware of the jaws with chains and poles the body of the kur was dragged and thrust from the hall we took it outside the palisade on the rocks it was getting light i knelt beside it it opened its eyes do you know me i asked no it said this is a small kur said the forkbeard they are generally larger note the mottling of white those are disease marks i hope i said that it was not because of me that it came to the hall no said the forkbeard in the dark they have excellent vision if it had been you it sought it would have been you it killed why did it enter the hall i asked kurrii said ivar forkbeard are fond of human flesh humans like other animals i knew are regarded by those of the kurii as a form of food why did it not run or flight i asked the forkbeard shrugged it was feeding he said then he bent to the beast have you hunted here before he asked have you killed a verr here and a bosk and in the hall it said its lips drawing back from its jaws last night a man kill it said ivar forkbeard four spears were raised but they did not strike no said ivar forkbeard it is dead chapter hilda of scagnar so is this the perfume that the highborn women of ar wear to the songdramas in enkara asked the blond girl amused yes lady i assured her bowing before her lisping in the accents of ar it is gross said she meaningless it is a happy scent i whined for the lowborn said she lalamus said i my assistant a large fellow but obviously stupid smoothshaven as are the perfurners in white and yellow silk and golden sandals bent over hurried forward he carried a tray of vials i had not realized lady said i that perception such as yours existed in the north my accent rnight not have fooled one of ar but it was not bad and to those not often accustomed to the swift subtle liquidity of the spfflh of ar melodius yet expressive it was more than adecluate my assistant unfortunately did not speak the eyes of hilda the haughty daughter of thorgard of scagnar flashed you of the south think we of the north are barbarians she snapped such fools we were i admitted putting my head to the floor i might have you fried in the grease of tarsk she said boiled in the oil of tharlarion will you not take pity gr at lady i whined on tho who did not suspect the ci filization the refinements of tl north perhaps said she have you other perfumes my assistant hopefully lifted a vial no i hissed to him in an instant such a woman wi see through such a scent let me smell it said she it is nothing lady i whined though among the highes born and most beautiful of the women of the physicians i is much favored let me smell it she said i removed the cork and turned away my head as thougl shamed she held it to her nose it stinks she said hastily i corked the vial and angrily thrust it back intc the hand of my embarrassed assistant who returned it tc its place hilda sat in a great curule chair carved with the sign o scagnar a serpentship seen frontally on each post of the chair carved was the head of a snarling sleen she smiled coldly i reached for another vial she wore rich green velvet closed high about her neck trimmed with gold she took the next vial which i had opened for her no she said handing it back to me her hair long was braided it was tied with golden string i had no understanding said she that the wares of ar were so inferior ar populous and wealthy the greatest city of known gor was regarded as a symbol of quality in merchandise the stamp of ar a single letter that which appears on its home stone the gorean spelling of the citys name was often forged by unscrupulous tradesmen and placed on their own goods it is not a difflcult sign to forge it has however in spite of that never been changed or embelli hed the stamp of ar is a part of its tradition in my opinion the goods of koroba were as good or better than those of ar but it is true she did not have the reputation of the great city to the southeast across the vosk ar is often looked to by those interested in such matters as the setter of the pace in dress and nanners fashions in ar are eagerly inquired into a garment cut in the fashion of ar may sell for more than one of better cloth but less stylish as it is done in ar is a phrase often heard sometimes i had little objection to the spreadings of such fashions after the restoration of marlenus of ar in contasta ar from the founding of ar he had at his victory feast decreed a twohort about two and one half inches shortening of the already briefly skirted garment ofthe female state slave this was adopted immediately in ar and city by city became rather general proving that i myself am not above fashion i had had this scandalous alteration implemented in my own house surely i would not have wanted my girls to be embarrassed by the excessive length of their livery and in fact i did the ubar of ar one better by ordering their hemlines lifted by an additional quarter inch most gorean slave girls have lovely legs the more i see of them the better i wondered how many girls even as far away as turia knew that more of their legs were exposed to free men because long ago drunkenly marlenus of ar at his victory feast had altered the length of the livery of the female state slaves of ar another custom long practised in the far south below the gorean equator in turia for example is the piercing of the ears of the female slave this custom though of long standing in the far south did not begin to spread with rapidity in the north until again it was introduced in ar at a feast marlenus as a special treat for his high officers presented before them a dancer a female slave whose ears had been pierced she had worn in her degradation golden loops in her ears she had not been able even to finish her dance at a sign from marlenus she had been seized thrown to the tiles on which she had danced an raped by more than a hundred men ear piercing from this time had begun to spread rapidly through the north masters and slavers often inflicting it on thei glrls interestingly the piercing of the septum for the in sertion of a nose ring is regarded generally a great dea more lightly by female slaves than the piercing of the ears perhaps this is partly because in the far south the fre women of the wagon peoples wear nose rings perhaps i is because the piercing does not show i do not know th piercing of the ears however is regarded as being the epito me of a slave girls degradation any woman it is said with pierced ears is a slave girl you insult me said hilda the haughty to present me with such miserable merchandise is this the best that great ar can offer had i been of ar i might have been angry as it was i was somewhat irritated the perfumes i was displaying to her had been taken more than six months ago by the forkbeard from a vessel of cos they were truly perfumes of ar and of the finest varieties who i asked myself is hilda the daughter of a barbarian of a rude uncouth northern pirate living in a high wooden fortress overlooking the sea to so demean the perfumes of ar one might have thought she was a great lady and not the insolent though curvacious brat of a boorish sea rover i put my head to the floor i grovelled in the white and yellow silk of the perfumers oh great lady i whined the finest of ars perfumes may be too thin too frail too gross for one of your discernment and taste her hands wore many rings about her neck she wore looped four chains of gold with pendants on her wrists were bracelets of silver and gold show me others men of the south said she contemptuously again and again we tried to please the daughter of thorgard of scagnar we had little success sometimes she would wince or make a face or indicate disgust with a tiny motion of her hand or a movement of her head we were almost finished with the vials in the flat leather case we have here said i a scent that might be worthy of a ubara of ar i uncorked it and she held it delicately to her nostrils barely adequate she said i restrained my fury that scent i knew a distillation of a hundred flowers nurtured like a priceless wine was a secret guarded by the perfumers of ar it contained as well the separated oil of the thentis needle tree an extract from the glands of the cartius river urt and a preparation formed from a disease calculus scraped from the intestines of the rare hunjer long whale the result of the inadequate digestion of cuttlefish fortunately too this calculus is sometimes found free in the sea expelled with feces it took more than a year to distill age blend and bond the ingredients barely ade uate she said but i could tell she was pleased it is only eight stone of gold said i obsequiously for the vial i shall accept it said she coldly as a gift a gift i cried yes said she you have annoyed me i have been patient with you i am now no onger patient have pity great lady i wept leave me now said she go below ask there to be stripped and beaten then swiftly take your leave of the house of thorgard o scagnar be grateful that i perrnit you your lives i hastily as though frightened made as though to close the flat leather case of vials eave that she said she laughed i shall give it to my bondmaids i smiled though secretly the haughty wench would rob us of our entire stores none of that richness i knew would grace the neck or breasts of a mere bondmaid she hilda he haughty daughter of thorgard of scagnar would kee it for hersel i attempted to conceal one vial which we had not permitted her to sample but her eye was too qwck or me what is that she asked sharply it is nothing i said let me smell it she said please no great ladyl i begged you thought to keep it from me did you she laughed oh no great ladyi wept give it to me she said must i lady asked i i see said she beating is not enough for you it seems you must be boiled in the oii of tharlarion as well i lifted it to her piteously she laughed my assistant and i knelt before her at her feet she wore beneath her green velvet golden shoes uncork it for me you sleen said she i wondered if i had in my life seen ever so scornful so proud so cold a woman i uncorked the vial hold it beneath my nostrils she said she bent forward i held the vial beneath her delicate nostrils she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply expectant y she opened her eyes and shook her head what is this she said capture scent i said i held her forearms ivar forkbeard quickly pulled the bracelets and rings from her wrists and fingers he then threw from her neck the golden chains i pulled her to her feet holding her wrists ivar tore the golden string from her hair loosening it it fell behind her blond below the small of her back he tore the collar of her gown back from her throat opening it at her neck who are you she whispered he snapped fetters of black iron on her wrists they by the fetters and their single link were held about three mches apart who are you she whispered a friend of your father said he he tore away from his c body swiftly the gown of the perfumers that of white and yellow silk i too cast aside the perfumers gown she saw that we wore the leather and fur of torvaldsland no she cried my hand was over her mouth ivars dagger was at her throat while thorgard roves at sea said the forkbeard we rove in scagnar shall i hold again the via beneath her nose i asked soaked in a rag and scarf and hell over the nose and mouth of a female it can render her unconscious in five ihn she squirrned wildly for an ihn or two and then sluggishly and then fell limp it is sometimes used by tarnsmen it is often used by slavers anaesthetic darts too are sometimes used in the taking of females these may be flungj or entered into her body by hand they take effect in about forty ihn she awakens often stripped in a slave kennel no said lvar it is important for my plan that she be conscious i elt the mouth of the daughter of thorgard of scagnar move beneath my hand the forkbeards daggers point thrust slightly into her throat she winced if you speak now above a whisper said he you die is that understood she nodded her head miserably at a gesture from the forkbeard i released her mouth i con inued to hold her arm you will never get me past the guards she hissed the forkbeard was looking about the room from a sm ll chest he took a thick covering cloth orange from he chest he took a scarf there are guari s she hissed you are fools you vill never get me pa t the guards i have no intention of getting you past the guards said ivar forkbeard she looked at him puzzled he went to the high window of her room high in the wooden fortress on its cliff overlooking the dark bay below we could hear waves crashing on rocks ivar went to the window he looked down then he cameback into the room and took a clay lamp lit and went agam to the window he moved the lamp up and down once i went to the window holding the girl together we looked down into the wavecrashing blackness then we saw brlefly uncovered and then covered again a ships lantern below at the nineteenth hour in the longboat of ivars ship was gorm with four oarsmen you have no ropes to lower me to your b at she said she lifted her wrists remove and swiftly said she these dlsgusting fetters ivar orkbeard went to the door of her room and silently slipped the two beams into place in their iron brackets she looked to the floor on it scattered lay her bracelets her rings the golden chains she had worn about her neck her throat where ivar had torn away the coliar o the green gown was now bared do you not want my rings she asked my golden chains my bracelets it is only for you that i have come to this place he said he grinned i too grinned it was mighty insult to thorgard of scagnar the golden chains the rings the bracelets stripped from her would be left behind how could it be made more clear that her captor scorned these as baubles that he had no need of them and that it had been the girl herself and only she her body and her person that had been sought and boldly taken ivar forkbeard then bent to the girls feet and pulled away her golden shoes and his hands at her legs she her eyes closed ren oved from her too her scarlet silken hose she stood her arm held by my hand in the fetters in the dress of green velvet it torn open at the collar to reveal her throat she had been stripped of her rings the bracelets the chains her hair was loose her hose and shoes had been removed are you going to tie my ankles she asked no he said you have no rope to lower me she said no he said she looked at him puzzled i will bring high ransom she said she looked down at her jewelry on the floor i will bring higher ransom she said if i am adorned your adornments said he will be simple a kirtle of white wool a brand a collar of iron you are insane she hissed i am the daughter of thorgard of scagnar wench said he i did not take you for ransom for what reason then begged she have i been taken are you so cold hilda the haughty asked he that you cannot guess oh no she hissed no no you will be well taught to heel and obey said he no she hissed he lifted the orange coverlet to throw it over her head i ask only one thing she begged should you be successful in this mad scheme what is that asked ivar forkbeard never never she said let me fall into the hands of ivar forkbeard i am ivar forkbeard said forkbeard her eyes widened with horror he threw the mantle over her head and with the scarf turned twice about her neck and knotted tightly tied it under her chin he had not rendered her unconscious or gagged her or tied her ankles he wanted her to be able to cry out her cries of course would be muffled they would not be discernible on the height of the fortress they rnight however be heard by gorm and those in the boat too he wanted her to be able to thrash about this too would help gorm to locate her in the darkness the forkbeard then lifted her from her feet lightly he dress slid back over her knees we heard her muffled voice no she wept i cannot swim the forkbeard then hurled her from the window and sh fell twisting and crying out some hundred feet to the black waters below with the waves striking on rocks about we did not hear the splash we gave gorm time to find her and fish her out throwing her in the boat and bindng her ankles then the forkbeard stood on the sill of the tall window poised and then he dived into the darkness after about an ehn giving hirn time to surface and swim to the boat i followed him in less than another ehn soaked and cold teeth chattering i had crawled over the bulwark of the longboat and joined the forkbeard he had already stripped and was rubbing himself with a fur cloak i followed his example and soon both of us were warmed and in dry clothes the forkbeard then bent to the soaked shuddering captive he removed one of the fetters and jerked the girls hands behind her back he then fettered her hands behind her her ankles had already been crossed and bound by gorm the forkbeard then threw hilda the haughty face down in the longboat and fiom gorm took the tiller she lay lengthwise head toward the stem between his booted feet shhh said the forkbeard the men rested on the oars we carried no lights we were much surprised to one of the wharvesof the holding of thorgard of scagnar silently like the serpent of the sea it was carrying two lanterns at its prow came black sleen we had thought thorgards roving his gathering of the harvests of the sea would have taken him much longer we saw men running down the boards ofthe wharf carrying lanterns words were exchanged i looked up i could see the window of the quarters of hilda the haughty daughter of thorgard of scagnar there was a lamp lit still in the room apparently she stayed up late outside the door of the compartment of her five bondmaids curled sleeping on the floor on their strawfilled mats chained by their ankles which area led into her own apartment somnolent and bored were four guards hilda whimpered the forkbeard kicked her with his boot be silent he said to her i saw her hands twist futilely in the manacles she on her belly soaked miserable lay silent go closer said the forkbeard almost noiselessly oars dipped bringing us closer to the hull of black sleen we saw mooring ropes tossed and caught the oars were brought inboard the men were weary we saw shields one by one being tied over the bulwarks a gangplank was slid over the gunwale to the wharf then we saw thorgard of scagnar cloak swirling in his horned helmet descend the gangplank he was met by his men and high among them by his holdings keeper and the keeper of his farms he spoke to them shortly and then in the light of the lanterns strode down the wharf the men did not follow him nor did his men on the ship yet leave it i gasped i heard too the intake of breath of the forkbeard and of gorm and the oarsmen another shape emerged from the darkness of the ship it moved swiftly with an agility startling in so huge a bulk i heard the scrape of claws on the gangplank it w s humped shaggy it followed thorgard of scagnar after it then came his men timidly those who had met thorgard and those too from the ship a wharf crew then busied themselves about the ship the forkbeard looked at me he was puzzled one ofthe kurii he said it was true but the beast we had seen was not an isolated degenerate diseased beast of the sort we had encountered at forkbeard s landfall it had seemed in its full health swift and powerfill what has such a beast to do with thorgard of scagnar what has thorgard of scagnar to do with such a beast smiled ivar forkbeard i do not understand this i said doubtless it means nothing said ivar forkbeard and at least it is of no concern to us i shall hope not i said i have an appointment with svein blue tooth said ivar forkbeard he kicked the captive with the side of his boot she uttered a small noise but made no other sound the thing will soon be held he said i nodded what he had said was true but surely i said you will not dare an outlaw attend the thing perhaps said ivar who knows he grinned then said he if i should survive we will hunt kurii i hunt ony one i sald perhaps the one you hunt said ivar is even now within the holding of thorgard of scagnar it is possible i said i do not know it seemed to me no unlikely that the forkbeards speculation might be true but i had no wish to pursue kurii at random how will you know the one ofthe kurii whom you seek ivar had asked me in his hall i think i had said he will know me of this i had little doubt i was certain that the kur which i sought would know me and well i did not know it but i did not think that would make much difference it was my intention to hunt openly and i expected this understood my quarty hunting too would find me and together we would do war it had doubtless been its plan to lure me to the north i smiled surely its plan had been successful i looked at the holdingof thorgard of scagnar if the kur within it were he whom i sought i had little doubt but that we should later meet if it were not it which i sought i had as far as i knew no quarrel with it but i wondered what it might be doing in the holding of thorgard of scagnar the kurii and men as far as i knew met only in feeding and killing let us go said i to ivar forkbeard oars said he softly to his oarsmen the oars gently noiselessly entered the water and the boat moved aw y into the darkness there was a small sound from the fetters on the prone girls wrists the forkbeard will attend the thing myjarl cried thyri running into my arms i lifted he and swung her about she wore the kirtle of white wool th riveted collar of black iron i drank long at the lips of the bondmaid about me i heard the joyous cries of the men of ivar farm the excited cries of bondmaids ivar forkbeard crushed to his leather pudding and gunn hild kissing first one and then the other as each eagerl sought his lips their hands too those of bondmaids eage upon his body other bondmaids pressed past me to greet favorite among the oarsmen of forkbeards serpent behind forkbeard and to his left her head high disdain ful stood hilda the haughty daughter of thorgard of scag nar the men and the bondmaids many in one another arms fell back to regard her she stood behind the forkbeard and to his left her back was quite straight her head was in the air she was nol fettered her dress of green velvet trimmed in gold she still wore it was torn back from the collar as the forkbeard had done in scagnar revealing the whiteness of her throat hinting at the delights of her bosom the gown however now was discolored stained and torn much of the trip she had been fettered her belly to the mast also on he right side it was torn to the hip revealing her thigh caf and ankle this had happened when on the voyage she had been put on the oar her hose and shoes had been removed in scagnar she stood proudly she was what the forkbeard hadsought she was his prize so that said ottar his hands on his heavy belt inlaid with gold is hilda the haughty daughter of thorgard of scagnar gunnhild is better said pouting lips who is gunnhild asked hilda coldly i am gunnhild said unnhild she stood proudly on the arrn of the forkbeard the white kirtle split to her beliy the black iron at her throat a bondmaid laughed hilda contemptuously gunnhild stared at her in fury gunnhild s better said pouting lips strip them and see said ottar hilda turned white the forkbeard turned about and one arm about pudding the other about gunnhild started from the dock hilda followed him to his left she heels nicely said ottar the men and bondmaids laughed the forkbeard stopped hildas face burned red with fury but she kept her head high pet sleen are taught to heel so too sometimes are bondmaids i was familiar with this sort of thing of course in the south it was quite common for slave girls in various fashions in various cities to heel their masters hiida of coursej was a free woman for her to heel was an incredible humiliation the forkbeard started off again and then again stopped again hilda followed him as before she is heeling laughed ottar there were tears of rage in hildas eyes what he said of course was true she was heeling on his ship the forkbeard had taught her though a free woman to heel it had not been a pleasant voyage for the daughter f thorgard of scagnar she had been from the beginning fettered with her belly to the mast for a filll day too the coverlet had been left tied over her head fastened by the twiceturned knotted scarf about her neck on the secon day it had been thrust up only that the spike of a water ba could be thrust between her teeth and then replaced on he third day the coverlet was torn away and with the scar thrown overboard ivar forkbeard on that day watered he and with a spoon fed her a bit of bondmaid gruel starving she had snatched at jt greedily how eagerly you eat the gruel of bondmaids he had commented then she had refused to eat more but the next day to his amusement she reachedl forth her mouth eagerly for the nourishment on the f th day and thereafter for her feedings he would tie her ankles and release her from the mast her wrsts hen tettered before her that she might feed herself after the fifth day he fed her broths and some meats that she might have good color with the improvement n her diet as was his expectation something of her haughtiness and emper returned on the eighth day he released her from the mast that she mlght walk about the ship atter she had walked about he had said to her are you ready to heel i am not a pet sleen she had cried put her to the oar had said the forkbeard hilda clothed had been roped hand and foot and bodyon her back head down to one of the nineteenfoot oars you cannot do ihis to me she cried then to her misery she felt the oar move i am a free woman she cried then like any bondmaid she found herself plunged beneath the cold green surface of thassa the oar lifted i arn the daughter of thorgard of scagnar she cried sp t ln waer half blinded then ihe oar dipped again when it pulled her next from the water she was ciearly te ified she had swallowed water she had learned what any bondmaid swi tly learns that one must apply oneself and be rational if one will survive on the oar one must follow its rhythm and as soon as th surface is broken expel air and take a deep breath in this fashion a girl may live on the oar for a time the forkbeard watched her leaning on hi elbows on the rail but then he left the rail he did however have gorm watch her with a spear twice in the afternoon gorm struck away sea sleen frorn the girls body once he thrust away one of the white sharks of the northern waters the second of the sea sleen it had been which with its sharp teeth making a strike but falling short had torn away her green velvet gown on the right side from the hip to the hemline a long strip of it like a ribbon was in its teeth as it darted away she had not been on the oar for half an ahn when she had begun to beg her release a few ehn later she had begun to beg to heel the forkbeard but it was not until evening that the oar lifted and she was released she was fed hot broths and fettered again to the mast the forkbeard said nothing to her but the next day when the sun was hot on the deck and he released her for her exercise and he waiked about the deck she though a free woman heeled him perfectly the crew had roared with laughter i too had smiled hilda the haughty daughter of thsrgard o scagn r had been taught to heel ivar forkbeard left the dock his arm about pudding and gunnhild who leaned against him hilda head high followed him pouting lips rall beside her gunnhild is better she cried hilda paid her no attention thick ankles said pretty ankles she has a rowing bench inside her gown said olga broad in the beam laughed another girl suddenly in fury hilda struck at them the forkbeard turned about what is going on here he asked we were telling her how ugly she is said pouting lips i am ot ugly cried hilda remove your clothing said the forkbeard her eyes widened with horror never she cried never the men and bondmaids about laughed you have taught me to heel she said ivar forkbeard but you have not taught me to obey strip her said the forkbeard to the bondmaids they leaped eagerly upon hilda the haughty in moments the proud girl naked was held before the forkbeard olga held one arm pretty ankles the other gunnhild is better said pouting lips it was true but hilda the haughty was a superb piece of female flesh in almost any market she would surely have drawn a high price she struggled held she had a fair throat good shoulders she was marvelously breasted her waist was such that one could get his hands on it well she n ight have been a bit broad in the beam but i had no objection to this in the north it is called the love cradle it was well adapted to cushion the shocks of an oarsmans pleasure in the south she would have been said to be sweetly hipped if the forkbeard wished to breed her she would bear healthy strong young to his thralls enriching his arm her thighs too were lovely and her calves her ankles while not thick as pretty ankles had asserted were heavier than those of thyri or pretty ankles herse hilda was of course a somewhat large girl she was probably some five years oider than pretty ankles and a year or so older than thyri gunnhild was larger than hilda she was also i ex ected about a year or two older i had no objection to hildas ankles i found them quite lovely they would take a common girlf tter nicely with about a quarter inch tolerance then hilda stopped struggling and held head high regarded the forkbeard he examined her with grloat care as he had his satarna and his animals when he had inspected his farm he got up from his knees where he had been feeling the firmness of her left calf and ankle then he said to the bondmaids take her to the whipping post the bondmaids laughing dragged hilda to the post stout of peeled wood which stood outside the hall ottar then with a scrap of binding fiber crossed and rudely bound before her body the wrists of the daughter of thorgard of scagnar he then reaching up fastened her wrists to the heavy iron ring over her head her breasts were against the post she could not place her heels on the ground how dare you place me in this position ivar forkbeard she demanded i am a free woman bring the fivestrap slave slash said ivar forkbeard to gunnhild yes my jarl she said smiling she ran to fetch it i am the daughter of thorgard of scagnar said hilda release me immediately the lash was placed by gunnhild in the hand of ivar forkbeard ottar threw the girls hair forward so that it fell before her shoulders no cried hilda the forkbeard touched her back with the whip his fist held the handle and too beneath his fist folded back were the five straps he tapped her twice no she cried please no we fell back to give the forkbeard room and he shook loose the straps and drew back his arm the first stroke threw her against the post i saw the astonishrnent n her eyes then the pain the daughter of thorgard seemed stunned then she howled in misery it was only then that she realized what the whip might do to a girl i will obey you she screamed i will obey you ivar forkbeard experienced in the disciplining of women did not deliver the second stroke for a full ehn in this time she screamed over and over i will obey you then he struck again her body again was struck against the post her hands twisted in the binding fiber her entire body rubbed on the post in agony pressing against it tears burst from he eyes she was on her tiptoes pressing against the post he thighs were on either side of the post but the post did nol yield she was fastened to it then he struck again sh writhed twisting and howling si ask only to obey you she cried i beg to obey you when he next struck she could only close her eyes in pain she could then scarcely breathe she gasped no longer could she howl or scream she tensed teeth gritted her body itself a silent scream of agony but the blow did not then fall was the beating done then she was struck again the last five blows were de livered with her hanging in the binding fiber her body against the post her face to one side of it she was then released from the post and fell to her hands and knees the beating had been quite light only twenty strokes yet i did not think it would be soon that the daughter of thorgard of scagnar would wish to find herself again at the post the beating had been though light quite adequate to its purpose which was to teach her a captive the whip no female forgets it she looked up at the forkbeard in misery bring her clothing said the forkbeard it was brought garb yourself said the forkbeard painfully almost unable to stand tears in her eyes inch by inch the girl drew on her garments she then stood there among us bent over tears staining her cheeks she wore the dress of green velvet trimmed with gold it torn from the collar it ripped at the right side she looked at him remove your clothing he said she stripped herself gather the clothing said the forkbeard she dld so go now to the kitchen of the hall said he in the fire there burn your clothing completely yes ivar forkbeard she said gunnhild will accompany you he said when you have burned your garments every bit of them then beg gunnhild to set you about your duties what duties my jarl asked gunnhild tonight we feast said ivar forkbeard the feast must be prepared she is to help prepare the feast asked gunnhild and serve it said the forkbeard i see then the nature of her duties said gunnhild smiling yes said ivar forkbeard he regarded hilda you will beg gunnhild to set you about the duties of a bondmaid yes said she ivar forkbeard hurry now laughed he weeping clutching her clothing she ran to the hall the men and bondmaids laughed muchly i too roared with laughter hilda the haughty daughter of thorgard of scagnar had been taught to obey the shrieking of pouting lips as she yielded to gorm supine kicking in the furs rang through the low smoking hall i thrust thyri from my lap and seized olga by the wrist as she hurried past throwing her across my knees she laughing was fleeing ottar who drunkenly was stumbling after her i pulled olgas face to mine and our lips met i forcing my kiss to her teeth her naked body collared suddenly responded to mine and she reached for me with her hands myjarl she whispered but i thrust her up holding her by the arms into the hands of ottar who laughing tbrew her lightly over his shoulder and turned about i saw her head and shoulders and her body to the waist over his shoulder her small fists pounding meaninglessly on his back he carried her into the darkness and threw her to the furs myjarl whimpered thyri crouching beside me touching me with a laugh she crying out with pleasure i took again the young lady of kassau the bondmaid thyri in my arms pretty ankles hurried past carrying a great trencher of roast meat on her small shoulder mead called ivar forkbeard from across from me mead he held out the great curved horn with its rim fillgreed gold pudding and gunnhild knelt on the bench snuggli against him one on either side but they did not run to fet his mead that duty this night befell another hilda the haughty daughter of thorgard of scagnar stripped as any bondmaid from a large bronze vess poured mead for the forkbeard the men

hall of his enemie too they had taught her to heel and obey rich was tl pleasure of ivar forkbeard he reached out his hand to touch the daughter of tho gard of scagnar she shrank back terrified the forkbeard looked upon her amused would you n care to play in the furs he asked her no she said shuddering let me play whimpered pudding let me play whi pered gunnhild do not misunderstand me ivar forkbeard whispere hilda if you order me to the furs i shall obey you an swlftly i will comply with your slightest wish exactly an promptly i will do whatever i am told pudding and gunnhild laughed ottar stumbled up putting his hand on one of the post by a length of ships rope he had tied olga to his belt sh looked at me her eyes shone her lips were parted she pu out her hand i paid her no attention she looked down fis clenched and whimpered i smiled i would use her befor the night was done it is said intoned ottar that hilda the haughty daughter of thorgard of scagnar is the coldest of women do you find men of interest asked the forkbeard c no she said i do not ottar laughed are you not curious asked ivar of the daughter of thorgard of scagnar what it would be to feel on your body their hands their mouths smen are beasts she cried their teeth he asked men are hateful she wept they are terrible beasts using girls as their prey she looked about at the bondmaids resist them she cried resist them pudding threw bac her head and laughed resistance is not permitted she laughed throw her in the furs cried pretty ankles then she will learn whether she knows what she is tal ing

there was silence what asked ivar forkbeard of hilda if i should order you to the furs i would obey you immediately she said i have felt the whip she explained but of your own free will you would be unlikely to enter upon the furs asked ivar of course not she said gorm who had now disentangled himself from pouting lips joined the circle about the table where we sat others standing she was behind him combing her hair with a comb of horn she is hilda the haughty laughed ottar she is the coldest of women hilda stood straight her head high ottar gorm said the forkbeard take her to the ice shed leave her there bound hand and foot the bondmaids shrieked with pleasure men pounded their left shoulders with the palms of their right hand ome pounded their plates on the heavy boards of t wooden table ottar delayed only long enough to untie olga from h belt he had tied her there by ships rope knotted about h stomach he left the rope about her stomach but with i free end pulling her arms about one of the roof posts tie her hands together he then left following gorm who had dragged hild from the hall she tried futilely to free herself she looked at me agc nized untie me she begged i looked at her my body wants you tarl red hair she wept m body needs you i looked away from her paying her no more attention heard her moan and rub her body on the post i need you tarl red hair she whimpered

lengthy use of the gorean master that use in which over an ahn the female slave or bondmaid is shown no mercy mead i called pretty ankles rushed to serve me i again bent to kiss the lips of thyri late and fully were we feasting when the thrallboy tugging on the sleeve of ivar orkbeard said to him myjarl the wench in the ice shed begs to be freed how long has she begged asked the forkbeard for more than two ahn said the boy grinning he was male good boy said the forkbeard and tore him a piece of neat thank you myjarl said the boy the boy unlike the adult male thralls was not chained at ight in the bosk shed ivar was fond of him he slept chained in the kitchen red hair gorrn said the forkbeard fetch the littl ubara of scagnar we smiled gorm said the forkbeard before she is freed see that her thirst is assuaged yes captain said gorm we carried a torch to the ice shed we opened the heavy door lined with leather and lifted the torch closing the door behind us in the light of the torch we saw hilda we approached more closely she lay on her side in misery across great blocks of ice she could lift her head and shoulders no more than six inches from the ice she could draw her ankles toward her body no more than six inches small chips of wood in which the ice is packed clung about her body she was bound hand and foot her wrists behind her her ankles crossed and tied two ropes prohibited her from struggling to either a sitting or kneeling position one running from her right ankle across the ice to a ring in the side of the shed the other runnin from her throat across the ice to a similar ring on the other side of the shed please she wept her teeth chattered her lips were blue she lay before us on her back please she wept piteously i beg to be permitted to run to the furs of ivar forkbeard we looked down on her i beg she cried i beg to be permitted to run to his furs gorm unbound the rope from her ankle that which hadheld her legs straight and that on her throat which had prevented her from lifting her shoulders and head he did not unbind her wrists and ankles he lifted her to a sitting position she trembled with cold whimpering i have brought you a drink he said drink it eagerly hilda the haughty yes yes she whispered her teeth chattering then holding her head back and lifting the cup to her mouth he gave her of the drink he had brought with him and eagerly whimpering shuddering with cold did hilda tke haughty drink down the slave wine gorm unbound her and threw her over his shoulder so stiff and trembling with cold and stiff from the ropes was she that she could not stand i put my hand on her body it was like ice she was whimpering with cold her head hanging down over gorms back her long hair fell to the back of his knees i lit the way with the torch and we took her to the hall of the forkbeard we carried her through the darkness and smoke of the hall between the posts the forkbeard was sitting on the end of his couch his boots on the fioor gorm threw her on her knees at the feet of the forkbeard her head was down her hair was over his boots she trembled with cold men and bondmaids gathered about the left side of her body was illuminated dully redly from the coals of the fire pit the right side of her body was in darkness who are you demanded the forkbeard hilda she wept daughter of thorgard of scagnar hilda the haughty he asked yes she wept head down hilda the haughty what do you want he asked to share your furs she wept are you not a free woman he asked i beg to share your furs ivar forkbeard she wept he rose to his feet and shoved back a long table and a bench on the other side of the fire pit with his heel he drew in the dirt of the floor a bondmaid circle she looked at him then he gestured that she might enter his couch gratefully she crawled upon the couch his section of that furcovered dirt sleeping level and trembling shuddering with cold drawing her body up drew the furs about her she lay huddled in the furs her body shook beneath them we heard her moan mead called ivar forkbeard returning to the table pudding was first to reach him with a horn of mead please come to my side ivar forkbeard wept hilda i freeze hold me please hold me let that be a lesson in passion to you other bondmaids laughed ottar there was much laughter and most from the beautiful nude slaves of the men of torvaldsiand hot collared and eager in their brawny arms the forkbeard laughing drained the horn mead he cried gunnhild served him after this second horn of mead the forkbeard wiping his mouth with his arm turned about and went to his furs he howled with misery she is the coldest of women laughed ottar hold me forkbeard she wept hold me please will you serve me well asked the forkbeard yes she cried yes yes yes yes but the forkbeard did not make her serve him then but firmiy held her body locked in his arms that of his prisoner to his warming her after half of an ahn i saw her delicately eyes frightened lift her head and put her lips to his shoulder softly timidly she kissed him and then looked into his eyes suddenly she was flung on her back and his huge hand roughened from the hilt of the sword the handle of the ax was at her body oh no she cried no bets were made at the table i bet on ivar forkbeard within an ahn hilda the haughty to the jeers of men the taunts of bondmaids on her hands and knees head down hair falling forward crept to the circle of the bondmaid which ivar forkbeard had drawn in the dirt of the hall floor between the posts the coals of the fire pit illuminated the left side of her body she crawled before the bondmaids the oarsmen she entered the circle and then within the circle stood up she stood very straight and her head was up i am yours ivar forkbeard she said i am yours he gestured to her and she fled from the circle to join him to throw herself at his side to beg his touch his bondmaid i collected nine tarn disks and two pieces of broken plate plundered two years ago from a house on the eastern edge of skjern gunnhild had been given by the forkbeard to gorm for the night i saw him holding her by the arm and pushing her ahead of him to his furs this night her ankle wouid be held by his fetter not that of the forkbeard the forkbeard had offered me pudding but generously thinking to have thyri i had after using her once given her for the night to ottar even now she was kneeling on his furs being fettered by the keeper of ivar forkbeards farm you can imagine my irritation when i saw thyri led past me her left wrist in the grip of an oarsman she looked over her shoulder at me agonized i blew her a kiss in the gorean fashion kissing and gesturing my fingers at the right side of my mouth almost vertical then with the kiss brushing gently toward her i had no special claim onthe pretty little bondmaid no more than any other among t he forkbeards men the delicious little thing like the other goods of the hall was for most practical purposes for the use of us all i heard the movements of chain the moans of the bondmaids in the arms of their masters men oftorvaldsland i thought i would sleep alone this night tarl red hair i heard i followed the sound of the voice and to my delight as ottar had left her she slipping his mind apparently as she had mine her hands still tied before her about the post kneeling in the dirt was olga i hate you tarl red hair she said i knelt beside her i had intended to permit her to smolder for a time she much aroused and then later when she had been much heated with need and desire when cruelly deprived she had been aching to break into flame throw her to my furs but unfortunately i had forgotten about her i forgot about you i told her i hate you tarl red hair she said i reached out to touch her she shrank back in fury would you please untie me she asked i did not wish to sleep alone i wondered if the fires in olga which earlier had burned so deeply so hotly could be truly out i wondered if they might be rekindled i slipped kneeling behind her i heard her body move against the post i pushed her collar up under her chin and with two fingers of my right hand and two fingers of my left rubhed the sides of her throat please untie me she whispered her hands writhed in the bonds her body pressed against the post her left cheek was at the right side of the post my hands lowered themselves on her body and then her hands tied about the post we both kneelingg i caressed her she tried to resist in fury but i was patient at last i heard her sob you are master she said tarl red hair i kissed her on the back of the right shoulder she put back her head take me to your filrs she begged i untied her hands from the post taking too the rope from her b lly by which ottar had fastened her to his belt but lett the rope on her right wrist its free end in my hand to lead her but i needed not lead her she followed eagerly trying to press her lips to my left shoulder before my sleeping area my rude couch my furs stopped i stood behind her she stood very still facing the couch at its foot she was a bondmaid she was property she was owned cforce me she whispered bondmaids know they are chattel and relish being treated as such deep in the belly too of e ery female is a desire more ancient than the caves to be forced to yield to the ruthless domination of a magnificent uncompromising male a master deep within them ths y all wish to submit vulnerably and completely nude to such a beast this is completely clear in their fantasies earth culture of course gives little scope to these blood needs of the beauties of our race accordingly these needs frustrated tend to ex pre s themselves in neurosis hys eria and hostility technology and social structures lollowing their own dynamics in egral to their development and expansion have left behind the pitiful rational animals who are their builders and the r vlc ims we have built our own cage and de end it against those who would shatter its locks m lett hand held her left arm with my right hand i forced her right wrist behind her back i thrust it up she cried out suddenly with misery i threw her to the furs scarcf ly had she struck them crying out belly down than i had clasped the tetter of black iron about her ankle chained she turned to face me sitting on the furs tears in her eyes her hands back her legs flexed i discarded the leather and tur of torvaldsland with a movement of the chain she knelr on the turs her head down i entered up n the furs to your belly i said ankles a foot apart yes my jarl she said i then began to caress her beneath th hins on the inside of her feet behind the backs f her knees at the sides of her breasts high between her thighs by he ensility of her muscles the movements of her body sometin es her tiny cries her breathing she ir structed me in her weakness which i as a warrior might then exploit when i was satisfied i threw her to her back i am told i told her that olga is one of the best of the bondmaids she lifted her body to me begging for my touch i fondled th extent o her kissing and licking what have you done to my body she whispered i have never felt this way this deeply this ully before what does your body tell you i asked tha i will be a marvel to you tarl red hair she whispered a marvel please me i told her yes m jarl she wept yes and when she had much pleased me i finished with her in the lirs taking hold me she wept i shall hold you i told her and then in a time bondmaid you will be again used she looled at me startled this i told her is the first taking its purpose is only to warm you for the second she clutched me not speaking i held her tightly can i endure such pleasure she asked frightened you are bond i told her you will have no choice i iy jarl she asked frightened is it the second taking of the gorean master to which you intend to subject me yes i told her i have heard of it she wept in it she gasped the girl is permitted no quarter no mercy that is true i told her we lay together silently i holding her she against me chained for something like half of an ahn then i touched she lifted her head is it beginning she asked yes i told her lay a bondmaid beg one favor of her jarl she asked perhaps i said she leaned over me i felt her hair brush my body be merciless she whispered be merciless she begged that is my intention i told her and threw her to he never have i yielded as i yielded now she wept would not exchange my collar for all the jewels on gor i held her in time she slept i too then slept it wa t vo ahn before dawn in one ahn ottar and the forkbeard would be up arousing the men the serpent the afte noon before had been readied this morning at daw the serpent would leave the small wharf dipping oars gli ing through fog on the inlet the result of the cooler la winds moving over the somewhat warmer water ol the e croaching torvaldstream ivar forkbeard not wisely perhaps was determined to attend the thing he had there his opinion an appointment to keep with svein blue toot a great jarl of torvaldsland who had outlawed him chapter a kur will address the thing roped together by the wrist on the turf of the thingfair we grappled his body slipped in my hand i felt my right wrist drawn back at the side of m head his two hands closed on it he grunted he was strong he was ketil of blue tooths high farm champion of torvaldsland my back began to bend backward i braced myself as i could right leg back bent left leg forward bent the men about cried out i heard bets taken speculations exchanged then my right wrist to cries of wonder began to lift and straighten my arm was then straight before my body i began inch by inch to lower it toward the ground if he did retain his grip he would at my feet be forced to his knees he released my wrist with a cry of fury the rope between us a yard in length pulled taut he regarded me astonished wary enraged i heard hands striking the left shoulders weapons struck on shields suddenly the champions fist struck toward me beneath the rope i caught the blow turning on the side of my left thigh there were cries of fury from the watchers i took then the right arm of the champion his wrist in my right hand my left hand on his upper arm and extended the arm and turned it so that the palm of his hand was up then at the elbow i broke it across my right knee i had had enough of him i untied the rope from my waist and threw it down he knelt on the turf whimpering tears streaming down his face the hands of men pounded on my back i heard their cries of pleasure i turned about and saw the forkbeard his hair was wet he was drying his body in a cloak he was grinning greetings thorgeir of ax glacier said i greetings red hair said he ax glacier was far to the north a glacier spilling between two mountains of stone taking in its path to the sea spreading the form of the ax the men of the country of ax glacier fish for whales and hunt snow sleen they cannot farm that far to the north thorgeir it so happened of course was the only man of the ax glacier country which is usually taken as the northern border of torvaldsland before the ice belts of gors arctic north who was at the thingfair how went the swimming i asked him the talmit of skin of sea sleen is mine he laughed the talmit is a headband it is not unusual for the men of torvaldsland to wear them though none of forkbeards men did they followed an outlaw some talmits have special significance special talmits sometime distinguish officers and jarls or a districts lawmen in the pay of the jarl the different districts too sometimes have different styles of talmit varying in their material and design talmits too can be awarded as prizes that thorgeir of ax glacier had won the swimming must have seemed strange indeed to those of the thingfair immersion in the waters of ax glacier country unprotected will commonly bring about death by shock within a matter of ihn sometimes i wondered if the forkbeard might be mad his sense of humour i thought might cost us all our lives there was probably not one man at the thingfair who took him truly to be of ax glacier most obviously he did not have the epicanthic fold which helps to protect the eyes of the men of ax glacier against extreme cold further he was much too large to be taken easily as a man of ax glacier their diet does not produce on the whole large bodies further their climate tends to select for short fat bodies for such physiologically are easiest to maintain in the therostatic equilibrium in great cold long thin bodies of course are easiest to maintain therostatic equilibrium in great heat providing more exposure for cooling lastly his coloring though his hair was dark was surely not that of the far north but though swarthy more akin to that of torvaldsland particularly western torvaldsland only a madman or a fool might have taken seriously his claim to be of the ax glacier country much speculation had coursed among the contest fields as to the true identity of the smoothshaven thorgeir prior to his winning the swimming he had won talmits for climbing the mast a tall pole of needle wood some fifty feet high smoothed and peeled for jumping the crevice actually a broad jump on level land where marks are made with strings to the point at which the back heel strikes ther earth wlking the oar actually a long pole and throwing the spear a real spear i am pleased to say both for distance and accuracy counting the distance and the accuracy of the spear events as two events which they are he had thus prior to the swimming won five talmits he had done less well in the singing contest though he much prided himself on his singing voice he thought in that one the judges had been against him he did not score highly either in the composition of poetry contest nor in the rhyming games i am not a skald he explained to me later he did much better i might mention in the riddle guessing but not well enough to win he missed the following riddle what is black has eighty legs and eats gold the answer though it might not seem obvious was black sleen the ship of thorguard of scagnar the forkbeards answer had been black shark the legendary ship of torvald reputed discoverer and first jarl of torvaldsland he acknowledged his defeat in this contest however gracefully i was a fool he grumbled to me i should have known though i attempted to console him he remained much put out with himself and for more than an ahn afterward in spite of his various losses he had even in his own modest opinion done quite well in the contests he was in excellent humor perhaps the most serious incident of the contests had occurred in one of the games of bat and ball in this contest there are two men on each side and the object is to keep the ball out of the hands of the other team no one man may hold the ball for more than the referees count of twenty he may however throw it into the air provided it is thrown over his head and catch it again himself the ball may be thrown to a partner or struck to him with the bat the bat of course drives the ball with incredible force the bats are of heavy wood rather broad and the ball about two inches in diameter is also of wood and extremely hard this is something like a game of keep away with two men in the middle i was pleased that i was not involved in the play shortly after the first knock off in which the ball is served to the enemy gorm who was ivars partner was struck cold with the ball it driven from the opponents bat this i gathered is a common trick it is very difficult to intercept or protect oneself from a ball struck at one with great speed from a short distance it looked quite bad for ivar at this point until one of his opponents fortunately broke his leg it coming into violent contact with ivars bat this contest was called a draw ivar then asked me to be his partner i declined it is all right said ivar even the bravest of men may decline a contest of batandball i acceded to his judgment there are various forms of ball game enjoyed by the men of torvaldsland some use bats or paddles in the winter one such game quite popular is played men running and slipping about on ice whether there is any remote connection between this game and ice hockey i do not know it is however ancient in torvaldsland torvald himself in the sagas is said to have been skilled at it ivar forkbeard or thorgeir of ax glacier as we might call him had won all told counting the swimming talmit six talmits he was much pleased in the morning talmits would be awarded personally by the hand of svein blur tooth let us this afternoon said ivar forkbeard give ourselves to strolling that seemed to me not a bad idea unless a better might have been to flee for our lives in the morning we might find ourselves chained at the foot of cauldrons of boiling tharlarion oil but soon i following the forkbeard together with some of his men pressed in among the throngs of the thing i carried my short sword i carried too the great bow unstrung with quiver of arrows the forkbeard too and his men were armed blows are not to be struck at the thing but not even the law of the thing with all its might would have the termerity to advise the man of torvaldsland to arrive or move about unarmed the man of torvaldsland never leaves his house unless he is armed and within his house his weapons are always near at hand usually hung on the wall behind his couch at least a foot beyond the reach of a bondmaid whose ankle is chained should she lying on her back look back and up she sees on the wall the shield the helmet the spear and ax the sword in its sheath of her master they are visible symbols of the force by which she is kept in bondage by which she is kept only a girl whose belly is beneath his sword most of the men at the thing were free farmers blondhaired blueeyed and proud men with strong limbs and workroughened hands many wore braided hair many wore talmits of their district for the thing their holidy best had been donned many wore heavy woolen jackets scrubbed with water and bosk urine which contains ammonia as its cleaning agent all were armed usually with ax or sword some wore their helmets others had them with their shields slung at their back at the thing to which each free man must come unless he work his farm alone and cannot leave it each man must be present for the inspection of his jarls officer a helmet shield and either sword or ax or spear in good condition each man generally save he in the direct hire of the jarl is responsible fot the existence and condition of his own equipment and weapons a man in direct fee with the jarl is in effect a mercenary the jarl himself from his gold and stores where necessary or desirable arms the man this expense of course is seldom necessary in torvaldsland sometimes however a man may break a sword or lose an ax in battle perhaps in the body of a foe falling from a ship in such a case the jarl would make good the loss he is not responsible for similar losses however among free farmers those farmers who do not attend the thing being the sole workers on their farms must nonetheless maintain the regulation armament once annually it is to be presented before a jarls officer who for this purpose visits various districts when the war arrow is carried of course all free men are to respond in such a case the farm may suffer and his companion and children know great hardship in leaving his family the farmer weapons upon his shoulder speaks simply to them the war arrow has been carried to my house he tells them we saw too many chieftains and captains and minor jarls in the crowd each with his retinue these high men were sumptuously garbed richly cloaked and helmeted often with great axes inlaid with gold their cloaks were usually scarlet or purple long and swirling and held with golden clasps they wore them always as is common in torvaldsland in such a way that the right arm the sword arm is free their men too often wore cloaks and about their arms spiral rings of gold and silver and on their wrists jewelstudded bands in the crowd too much in evidence were brazen bondmaids they had been brought to the thing generally by captains and jarls it is not unusual for men to bring such slaves with them though they are not permitted near the law courts or the assemblies of deliberation the voyages to the thing were not after all ventures of raiding they were not enterprises of warfare there were three reasons for bringing such girls they were for the pleasure of men they served as display objects to indicate the wealth of their masters and they could be bought and sold the forkbeard had bought with him too some bondmaids they followed us their eyes were bright their steps were eager they had been long isolated on the farm rural slave girls the forkbeards wenches they were fantastically stimulated to see the crowds they looked upon the thingfields with pleasure and excitement even had they been permitted some of them to look upon certain of the contests it is said that such pleasures improve a female slave sometimes in the south female slaves are dressed in the robes of free women even veiled and taken by their masters to see the tarn races or games or songsdramas many assume that she sitting regally by his side is a companion or being courted for the companionship only he and she know that their true relation is that of master and slave girl but when they return home and the door to his compartment closes their charade done she immediately strips to brand and collar and kneels head to his feet once again only an article of his property how scandalized would have been the free woman had they known that next to them perhaps had been sitting a girl who was only slave but there were no disguises in torvaldsland there was no mistaking thatthe girls that followed the forkbeard or thorgeir of ax glacier were bond to better display his pets and excite the envy of others the forkbeard had had his girls drop their kirtles low upon their hips and hitch them high that their beauty might be well exhibited from their collars to some inches below their navels and too that the turns of their calves and ankles might be similarly displayed i would have thought that they might have groaned with humiliation and attempted to hide themselves among us but instead even pudding and thyri they walked as proud shameless bondmaid the exposure of the females navel on gor is known as the slave belly only female slaves expose their navels from a vendor the forkbeard bought his girls honey cake with their fingers they ate it eagerly crumbs at the side of their mouths look cried pudding a silk girl the expression silk girl is used often among bondmaids of the north to refer to their counterparts in the south the expression reflects their belief that such girls are spoiled excessively pampered indulged and coddled sleek pets who have little to do but adorn themselves with cosmetics and await their masters cuddled cutely on plush scarlet coverlets fringed with gold there is some envy in this charge i think more literally the expression tends to be based on the fact that the brief slave tunic of the south the single garment permitted the female slave is often silk southern girls incidentally in my opinion though scarcely as worked as their northern sisters in bondage a function of the economic distinction between the farm and the city are often worked and worked hard particularly if they have not pleased their masters yet i think their labors less than those often performed by the wife of earth this is a consequence of gors simpler culture in which there is literally less to do less to clean less to care for and so on and also of the fact that the gorean master if pleased with the wench takes care that she is fresh and ready for the couch an overworked weary woman despondent and tired is less responsive to her masters touch she does not squirm as well the gorean master treating her as the animal she is works and handles her in such a way that the responses of his passionate exciting hoteyed slimlegged pet are kept honed to perfection some men are better at this of course than others there are scrolls books on gor which may be purchased inexpensively on the feeding care and training of female slaves there are others who claim as would be expected that the handling of a slave girl in order to get the most out of her is an inborn gift incidentally for what it is worth though the southern girl is i expect worked less hard then the northern girl who is commonly kept isolated on the farm she is more often than her northern sister put to the switch or whip i think she lives under a harsher discipline southern masters are harder with their girls expecting more from them and seeing that they get it northern girls for example are seldom trained in the detailed intricate sensuous arts of the female slave the southern girl to her misery must often learn these to perfection moreover upon command she must perform joyfully and skillfully the silk girl was heeling her master a captain of torvaldsland she wore indeed a brief tunic of the south of golden silk she wore a collar of gold and hanging in her ears were loops of gold highfarm girls she whispered as she passed the bondmaids of ivar forkbeard in the south the southern slave girl commonly regards her northern counterparts as bumpkins dolts from the high farms on the slopes of the mountains of torvaldsland she thinks of them as doing little but swilling tarsk and dunging fields she regards them as essentially nothing more than a form of bosk cow used to work to give simple pleasure to rude men and to breed thralls cold fish cried out pudding stick cried out pouting lips the silk girl passing them did not appear to hear them piercedear girl screamed pouting lips the silk girl turned stricken she put her hands to her ears there were sudden tears in her eyes then weeping she turned away her head in her hands and fled after her master the bondmaids of ivar forkbeard laughed delightedly the forkbeard reached out and seized pudding by the back of the neck he looked at her he also looked at pouting lips who shrank back he turned puddings head you wenches he said might look well with pierced ears oh no my jarl wept pudding no no wept pouting lips please no my jarl perhaps mused the forkbeard i shall have it done to the batch of you upon my return gautrek can perform this small task i expect no whimpered the girls huddled together the forkbeard turned then and we contimued on our way the forkbeard whistled he was in an excellent mood in moments the girls too were again laughing and sporting and pointing out sights to one another there was only one of the forkbeards wenches who did not sport and laugh her name was dagmar there was a strap of binding fibre knotted about her collar she was led by thyri her hands were tied together behind her back she had been brought to the thing to be sold off let us watch duels said the forkbeard the duel is a device by which many disputes legal and personal are settled in torvaldsland there are two general sorts the formal duel and the free duel the free duel permits all weapons there are there are no restrictions on tactics or field at the thing of course adjoining squares are lined out for these duels if the combatants wished however they might choose another field such duels commonly are held on wavestruck skerries in thassa two men are left alone later at nightfall a skiff returns to pick up the survivor the formal duel is quite complex and i shall not describe it in detail two men meet but each is permitted a shield bearer the combatants strike at one another and the blows hopefully are fended by eachs shield bearer three shields are permitted to each combatant when these are hacked to pieces or otherwise rendered useless his shield bearer retires and he must defend himself with his own weapon alone swords not over a given length too are prescribed the duel takes place substantially on a large square cloak ten feet on each side which is pegged down on the turf outside this cloak there are two squares each a foot from the cloak drawn in the turf the outer corners of the second of the two drawn squares are marked with hazel wands there is this a twelvefootsquare fighting area no ropes are stretched between the hazel wands when the first blood touches the cloak the match may at the agreement of the combatants or in the discretion of one of the two referees be terminated a price of three silver tarn disks is then paid to the victor by the loser the winner commonly then performs a sacrifice if the winner is rich and the match of great importance he may slay a bosk if he is poor or the match is not considered a great victory his sacrifice may be less these duels particularly of the formal variety are sometimes used disreputably for gain by unscrupulous swordsmen a man incredibly enough may be challenged risks his life among the hazel wands he may be slain then too of course the stake the farm the companion the daughter is surrendered by law to the challenger the motivation of this custom i gather is to enable strong powerful men to obtain land and attractive women and to encourage those who possess such to keep themselves in fighting condition all in all i did not much approve of the custom commonly of course the formal duel is used for more reputable purposes such as settling grievances over boundaries or permitting an opportunity where in a case of insult satisfaction might be obtained one case interested us in particular a young man not more than sixteen was preparing to defend himself against a large burly fellow bearded and richly helmeted he is a famous champion said ivar whispering to me nodding to the large burly fellow he is bjarni of thorstein camp thorstein camp well to the south but yet north of einars skerry was a camp of fighting men which controlled the countryside about it for some fifty pasangs taking tribute from the farms thorstein of thorsteins camp was their jarl the camp was od wood surrounded by a palisade built on an island in an inlet called the inlet of thorestein camp formally known as the inlet of parsit because of the rich fishing there the stake in this challenge was the young mans sister a comely blond lass of fourteen with braided hair she was dressed in the full regalia of a free woman of the north the clothes were not rich but they were clean and her best she wore two brooches and black shoes the knife had been removed from the sheath at her belt she stood straight but her head was down her eyes closed about her neck knotted was a rope it fastened to a stake in the ground near the dueling square she was not otherwise secured forfeit the girl said bjarni of thorstein camp addressing the boy and i will not kill you i do not care much for the making women of torvaldsland bond said ivar it seems improper he whispered to me they are of torvaldsland where is the boys father i asked one who stood next to me he was slain in an avalanche said the man i gathered then that the boy was then owner of the farm he had become then the head of his household it was accordingly up to him to defend as best he could against such a challenge why do you challenge a baby asked ivar forkbeard bjarni looked upon him not pleasantly i want the girl for thorstein camp he said i have no quarrel with children will she be branded there and collared asked ivar thorstein camp has no need for free women she is of torvaldsland said ivar she can be taught to squirm and carry mead as well as any other wench said bjarni i had no doubt this was true yet the girl was young i doubted that a girl should be put in collar before she was fifteen ivar looked at me would you like to carry my shield he asked i smiled i went to the young man who was preparing to step into the area of hazel wands he was quite a brave lad another youngster about his own age probably from an adjoining farm would carry his shield for him whats your name lad i asked the young man preparing to enter the square marked off with the hazel wands hrolf said he of the inlet of green cliffs i then took both of the boys by the scruff and threw them stumbling more than twenty feet away to the grass i stepped on the leather of the cloak im the champion said i of hrolf of inlet of green cliffs i unsheathed the sword i wore at my belt he is mad said bjarni who is your shield bearer asked one of the two whiterobed referees i am called the forkbeard striding into the area of hazel wands i appreciate the mad bravery said i of the good fellow thorgeir of ax glacier but as we all know the men of ax glacier being of a hospitable and peaceful sort are unskilled in weapons i looked at the forkbeard we are not hunting whales now i told him thorgeir the forkbeard spluttered i turned to the referee i cannot accept his aid i told him it would too much handicap me i explained being forced doubtless to constantly look out for and protect one of his presumed ineptness ineptness thundered the forkbeard you are of ax glacier are you not i asked him innocently i smiled to myself i had i thought hoisted the forkbeard by his own petard he laughed and turned about taking his place on the side who will bear your shield asked one of the referees my weapon is my shield i told him lifting the sword he will not strike me what do you expect to do with that paring knife asked bjarni of thorstein camp looking at me puzzled he thought me mad your long sword i told him is doubtless quite useful in thrusting over the balwarks of ships fastened together by grappling irons as mine would not be but we are not now my dear bjarni engaging in combat over the bulwarks of ships i have reach on you he cried but my blade will protect me i said moreover the arc of your stroke is wider then mine and your blade heavier you shall shortly discover that i shall be behind your guard lying sleen cried out the man of thorstein camp the girl the rope on her throat looked wildly at me the two boys whitefaced stood behind the hazel wands they understood no more of what was transpiring than most others of those present the chief referee looked at me his office was indicated by a golden ring on his arm to his credit he had obviously not much approved of the former match approve me i told him he grinned i approve you said he as the champion of hrolf of inlet of green cliffs then he said to me as you are the champion of the challenged it is your right to strike the first blow i tapped the shield of bjarni of thorstein camp it held by another ruffian from his camp with the point of my sword it is struck i said with a cry of rage the shield bearer of bjarni of thorstein camp rushed at me to thrust me back stumbling hopefully to put me off my balance for the following stroke of his swordsman i stepped to one side the shield bearers charge carried him almost tot he hazel wands bjarni sword high had followed him i now stood beside bjarni the small sword at his neck he turned white let us try again i said quickly he fled back and was joined by his shield bearer in the second charge though i do not know if it were elegant or not given the properties of the formal duel i tripped the shield bearer one is not supposed to slay the shield bearer but as far as i knew tripping though perhaps not in the best of form was acceptable i had at any rate seen it done in an earlier match and as i expected neither of the referees warned me of an infraction i gathered from the swift looks on their faces that they had thought it rather neatly done though they are supposed to be objective in such matters the fellow went sprawling bjarni quite wisely he obviously brighter than his shield bearer had not followed him so closely this time but had hung back our swords met twice and then i was under his guard the point of my sword under his chin shall we try again i asked the shield bearer leaped to his feet let us fight he cried bjarni of thorestein camp looked at me no he said let us not try again he took the point of his sword and made a cut in his own forearm and held it out over the leather drops fell to the leather my blood said bjarni of thorstein camp is on the leather he sheathed his sword the girl and her brother and his friend and others cried with pleasure her brother ran to her and untied the rope from about her neck his friend though she was but fourteen took her in his arms bjarni of thorstein camp went to the boy whom he had challenged from his wallet he took forth three tarn disks of silver and placed them one after the other in the boys hand i am sorry hrolf of the inlet of green cliffs he said for having bothered you then bjarni came to me and put out his hand we shook hands there is fee for you in thorstein camp said he should you care to share our kettles and our girls my thanks said i bjarni of thorstein camp then he with his shield bearer left the leather of the square of hazel wands these i give to you champion said the boy trying to push into my hands the three tarn disks of silver save them said i for your sisters dowry in her companionship with what then asked he have you been paid with sport i said my thanks fighter said the girl my thanks too champion said the boy who held her i bowed my head boy cried the forkbeard the boy looked at him the forkbeard threw him a golden tarn disk buy a bosk and sacrifice it said the forkbeard let there be much feasting on the farms of the inlet of green cliffs my thanks captain cried the boy my thanks there was cheering from the men about as i the forkbeard some of his men and some of his bondmaids left the place of dueling we passed one fellow whom we noted seized up two bars of red hot metal and ran some twenty feet and then threw them from him what is he doing i asked he is proving that he has told the truth said the forkbeard oh i said i noted that the bondmaids of ivar forkbeard attracted more then their expected share of attention they were quite beautiful from collars to low bellies and the turn of their legs your girls walk well i told ivar they are bondmaids said he under the eyes of strange men i smiled the girls wore their kirtles as they did not simply that the riches owned by ivar forkbeard might be well displayed the better to excite the envy of others and brighten his vanity but for another reason as well the female slave knowing she is slave finds it stimulating to be exposed to the inspection of unknown men do they find her body pleasing do they want it is she desired she sees their looks their pleasure these things for example do they wish they owned her she finds gratifying she is female she is proud of her allure her beauty further she is stimulated by knowing that one of these strange men might buy her might own her and that then she would have to please him and well the eyes of a handsome free man and a slave girl meet she sees he wonders how she would be in the furs he sees that she furtively speculates on what it would be like to be owned by him she smiles and in her collar hurries on both receive pleasure when we return to forkbeards landfall said the forkbeard they will be better for having looked and having been looked upon in the south a girl is sometimes sent to the market clad only in her brand and collar not infrequently upon her return home she begs her master for his touch to be seen and desired is stimulating to the female slave a girl must be careful of course should she in anyway irritate or not please her master she may be switched or whipped in some cities once a day a girl must kneel and kiss the whip which if she is not sufficiently pleasing to her master will be used to beat her a farmer in the crowd reached forth his heavy hand swiftly from her left hip to her right breast caressed thyri lingering momentarily on her breast she stopped startled then she darted away buy me my jarl she laughed buy me the forkbeard grinned his girls he knew were good few who looked upon them would not have liked to own them we saw thralls too in the crowd and runepriests with long hair in white robes a spiral ring of gold on their left arms about their waist a bag of omens chips pieces of wood soaked in the blood of the sacrificial bosk slain to open the thing these chips are thrown like dice sometimes several times and are then read by the priests the thingtemple in which the ring of the temple is kept is made of wood nearby in a grove hung from poles were bodies of six verr in past days it is my understanding there might have been decided however a generation ago by one of the rare meetings of the high council of runepriests attended by the high runepriests of each district that thralls should no longer be sacrificed this was not defended however on grounds of the advance of civilization or such but rather on the grounds that thralls like urts and tiny sixtoed tharlarion were not objects worthy of sacrifice there had been a famine and many thralls had been sacrificed in spite of this the famine had not abated for more than four growing seasons this period too incidentally was noted for the large number of raids to the south often involving entire fleets from torvaldsland it had been further speculated that the gods had no need of thralls or if they did they might supply this need themselves or make this need known through suitable signs no signs however luckily for thralls were forthcoming this was taken as a vindication of the judgement of the high council of runepriests after the council the status of runepriests had risen in torvaldsland this may also have had something to do with the fact that the famine finally after four seasons abated the status of the thrall correspondingly however such as it was declined he was now regarded as much in the same category with the urts that one clubs in the satarna sheds or are pursued by small pet sleen kept there for that purpose or with the tiny sixtoed rock tharlarion of southern torvaldsland favored for their legs and tails which are speared by children if the thrall had been nothing in torvaldsland before he was now less than nothing his status was now in effect that of the southern male work slave found often in the quarries and mines and chained on the great farms he a despised animal must obey instantly and perfectly or be subject to immediate slaughter the forkbeard had bought one thrall with him the young man tarsk who even now followed in the retinue of the forkbeard it was thought that if the forkbeard should purchase a crate of sleen fur or a chest of bog iron the young man on his shoulders might then bear it back to our tent pitched among other tents at the thing bog iron incidentally is inferior to the iron of the south the steel and iron of the weapons of the men of torvaldsland interestingly is almost uniformly of southern origin the iron extracted from bog ore is extensively used however for agricultural implements in the crowd too i saw some merchants though few of them in their white and gold i saw too four slavers perfumed in their robes of blue and yellow silk come north to buy women i saw by the cut of their robes they were from distant turia forkbeards girls shrank away from them they feared the perfumed silken slavery of the south in the south the yoke of slavery is much heavier on a girls neck her bondage is much more abject she is often little more than a pleasure plaything of her master it is common for a southern master to care more for his pet sleen than his girls in the north of course it is common for a master to care more for his ship than his girls i saw too in the crowd a physician in green robes from ar and a scribe from cos these cities are not on good terms but they civilized men both in the far north conversed affably send that one to the platform cried out a farmer indicating gunnhild to the platform roared ivar forkbeard he tore away her kirtle soon she barefoot was climbing the wooden steps to the platform this is a wooden walkway about five feet wide and one hundred feet long on the walkway back and forth smiling looking one way then the other turning about parade stripped bondmaids they are not for sale though many are sold from the platform the platform is instituted for the pleasure of the free men it is not unanalogous to the talmit competitions though no talmit is awarded there are judges usually minor jarls and slavers no judge incidentally is female no female is regarded as competent to judge a females beauty only a man it is said can do that smile you shesleen roared the forkbeard gunhild smiled and walked no free woman of course would even think of entering such a contest all who walk on such a platform are slave girls at last only gunnhild and the silk girl she who had worn earrings walked on the platform and it was gunnhild who was thrown the pastry to the delight of the crowds shouting pounding their spear blades on their wooden shields who owns her called the chief judge i do called the forkbeard he was given a silver tarn disk as prize many were the bids on gunnhild shouted from the crowd but the forkbeard waved such offers aside the man laughed clearly he wanted the wench for his own furs gunnhild was very proud kirtle yourself wench said the forkbeard to gunnhild throwing her her kirtle she fixed it as it had been before low on her hips hitched above her calves at the foot of the steps leading down from the platform the forkbeard stopped and bowed low i too bowed the slave girls fell to their knees heads down gunnhild with them how shameful said the free woman sternly the slave girls groveled at her feet slave girls fear free women muchly it is almost as if there were some unspoken war between them almost as if they might be mortal enemies in such a war or such an enmity of course the slave girl is completely at the mercy of the free person she is only slave one of the great fears of a slave girl is that she will be sold to a woman free women treat their female slaves with incredible hatred and cruelty why this is i do not know some say it is because they the free women envy the girls their collars and wish that they too were collared and at the complete mercy of masters free women view the platform with stern disapproval on it female beauty is displayed for the inspection of men this for some reason outrages them perhaps they are furious because they cannot display their own beauty or that they are not themselves as beautiful as women found fit by lusty men with discerning eyes for slavery it is difficult to know what the truth is in such matters these matters are further complicated particularly in the north by the conviction among free women that free women are above such things as sex and that only low and loose girls and slaves are interested in such matters free women of the north regard themselves as superior to sex many are frigid at least until carried off and collared they often insist that even when they have faces and figures that drive men wild that it is their mind on which he must concentrate his attentions some free men to their misery and the perhaps surprising irritation of the female attempt to comply with this imperative they are fools enough to believe what such women claim is the truth about themselves they should listen instead to the dreams and fantasies of women and recall for their instruction the responses of a free woman once collared squirming in the chains of a bondmaid these teach us truths which many women dare not speak and which by others are denied interestingly with a most psychologically revealing hysteria and vehemence no woman it is said knows truly what she is until she has worn the collar some free women apparently fear sex because they feel it lowers the woman this is quite correct in few if any human relationships is there perfect equality the subtle tensions of dominance and submission universal in the animal world remain ineradicably in our blood they may be thwarted and frustrated but thwarted and frustrated they will remain it is the nature of the male among the mammals to dominate that of the female to submit the fact that humans have minds does not cancel the truths of the blood but permits their enrichment and enhancement their expression in physical and psychological ecstasies far beyond the reach of simpler organisms the female slave submits to her master in a thousand dimensions in each of which she is his slave in each of which he dominates her shameful cried the free woman in the lowering of the woman of course a common consequence of her helplessness in the arms of a powerful male her surrenderings her being forced to submit she finds incredibly to some perhaps her freedom her ecstasy her fulfilment her exaltation her joy in the gorean mind this matter is simple it is the nature of the female to submit accordingly it is natural that when she is forced to acknowledge accept express and reveal this nature that she should be almost deliriously joyful and thankful to her master she has been taught her womanhood no longer is she a sexless competitive pseudoman she is then as she was not before female she then finds herself perhaps for the first time clearly differentiated from the male and vulnerably joyfully complementary to him she has of course no choice in this matter it is not permitted her collared she submits i know of no group of women as joyful as spontaneous as loving and vital as healthy and beautiful as excited as free in their delights and emotions as gorean slave girls it is true they must live under the will of men and must fear them and the lash of their whips but in spite of these things they walk with a sensuous beauty and pride they know themselves owned but they wear their collars with a shameless audacity a joy an insolent pride that would scandalize and frighten the bored depressed frustrated women of earth i do not approve of the platform said the free woman coldly forkbeard did not respond to her but regarded her with great deference these females she said indicating the forkbeards girls who knelt at her feet their heads to the turf could be better employed on your farm dunging fields and making butter the free woman was a tall woman large she wore a great cape of fur of white seasleen thrown back to reveal the whiteness of her arms her kirtle was of the finest wool of ar dyed scarlet with black trimmings she wore two brooches both carved of the horn of kailiauk mounted in gold at her waist she wore a jewelled scabbard protruding from which i saw the ornamented twisted blade of a turian dagger free women in torvaldsland commonly carry a knife at her belt too hung her scissors and a ring of many keys indicating that her hall contained many chests or doors her hair was worn high wrapped about a comb matching the brooches of the horn of kailiauk the fact that her hair was worn dressed indicated that she stood in companionship the number of keys together with the scissors indicated that she was mistress of a great house she had gray eyes her hair was dark her face was cold and harsh but i am of ax glacier said the forkbeard in ax glacier country of course there were no farms and there were no verr or bosk there being insufficient grazing accordingly there would be little field dunging to be done there being no fields in the first place and no dung in the second too due to the absence of verr or bosk butter would be in scarce supply the free woman i could see was not much pleased with the forkbeards response thorgeir is it not she asked thorgeir of ax glacier said the forkbeard bowing and what asked she would one of ax glacier need with all these miserable slaves she indicated the kneeling girls of forkbeard in ax glacier country said the forkbeard with great seriousness the night is six months long i see smiled the woman then she said you have won talmits have you not thorgeir of ax glacier six said he lady before you claim them she said i would recommend that you recall your true name he bowed her recommendation did not much please me she lifted the hem of her kirtle of scarlet wool about the ankles of her black shoes and turned away she looked back briefly once she indicated the kneeling slaves kirtle their shame she said then strode away followed by several menatarms kirtle your shame cried the forkbeard his girls quickly frightened tears in their eyes drew about them as well as they could their kirtles they covered as well as they could their bodies having been shamed by the free woman it is a common practice of free women for some reason to attempt to make female slave ashamed of her body who was that i asked bera said he companion of svein blue tooth my heart sank he should put her in a collar said the forkbeard i was scandalized at the very thought she needs the whip he said then he looked at his girls what have you done he asked drop your kirtles and hitch them up laughing once more proud of their bodies the girls of the forkbeard insolently slung their kirtles low on their hips and hitched them high over their calves even half way up their delightful thighs then we again continued on our way leaving the place of the platform the place of gunnhilds triumph where she had received a pastry and where her master the forkbeard had made a silver tarn disk on her beauty she gave the other girls crumbs of the pastry and permitted dagmar who was to be sold off to lick frosting from her fingers in the bondmaid shed there was a rustle of chain as the girls looked up light filtered into the shed from windows cut high in the wall on our right the girls at or knelt or laid on straw along on our right the shed is some two hundred feet long about ten feet wide and eight feet in height an officer of svein blue tooth assisted by two thralls quickly assessed dagmar stripping her feeling her body the firmness of her breasts looking in her mouth a tarn disk of silver he said dagmar had two months ago stolen a piece of cheese from pretty ankles she had been beaten for that at the post fastened there by ottar and switched by pretty ankles until pretty ankles had tired of switching her too she had not been found sufficiently pleasing by several of the forkbeards oarsmen she was accordingly to be sold off as an inferior girl done said the forkbeard dagmar was sold there were some one hundred bondmaids for sale in the shed they all wore collars of the north with the projecting iron ring they were fastened by a single chain but it was not itself run through the projecting loop on their collars rather a heavy padlock passing through a link of the chain and the projecting loop secured them in this way the chain when a girl is taken from the chain or added to it need not be drawn through any of the loops the girls may thus with convenience be spaced on the chain removed from it and added to it the forkbeard was given the tarn disk which he placed in his wallet it had been taken from a sack slung about the right wall there from one of several small wooden boxes projecting an intervals from the wall he took an opened padlock he then walked across the shed still holding dagmar by the arm and threw her to her knees he then lifted the chain and by means of the padlock passing it through the loop on her collar and a link in the chain secured her the forkbeard meanwhile was looking at the bondmaids they were of course stripped for the view of buyers behind the forkbeard were myself his men those bondmaids who had accompanied us and the thrall tarsk who had been bought along should the forkbeard have made any heavy purchases my jarl said thyri yes said the forkbeard should this thrall she asked indicating tarsk once wulfstan of kassau be permitted to look upon the beauty of the bondmaids what do you mean asked ivar forkbeard he is after all said thyri only a thrall i wondered that she would deny the young man this pleasure i recalled that she had said she hated him i personally had no objection tohis presence in the shed thralls i expected had few pleasures it might have been more than a year since he had been permitted a female the young man looked upon the proud thyri with great bitterness she lifted her head and laughed i think said ivar forkbeard that i will send him back to the tent excellent she said she smiled at the thrall chain said the forkbeard one of his men took from over his shoulder a looped chain at each end it terminated in a manacle it had been held looped by these manacles being locked into one another he removed it from his shoulder and opened the manacles the chain itself was about a yard long he handed it to the forkbeard the young man would go chained to the tent wrist said the forkbeard the young man extended his wrists thyri watched delighted the forkbeard closed the manacle about the young mans left wrist thyri laughed then the forkbeard took thyris right wrist and closed it in the other fetter my jarl she cried she is yours until morning the forkbeard told the young thrall use her behind the tent my thanks my jarl he cried my jarl wept thyri tarsk seized the length of chain in his right fist about a foot from her fetter he jerked it the fetter was large on her wrist but she could not slip it she was held she looked at him with horror hurry bondmaid he cried he turned about dragging her by the right wrist and almost running pulled her stumbling crying out after him the forkbeard and i and his men laughed we had not been much pleased at the insolence of the bondmaid with respect to the young thrall once we recalled her taunting of him had almost cost him his life i had intervened and he had only been whipped instead i had little doubt that wulfstan of kassau the thrall tarsk had many scores to settle with the pretty little shesleen once a fine young lady of kassau too i recalled she had once refused his suit he supposedly not being good enough for her i hope said the forkbeard he will not make her scream all night behind the tent i wish to obtain a good nights rest it would be a shame said i to interfere with his pleasure if necessary said the forkbeard i will simply have him gag her with her own kirtle excellent i said the forkbeard then turned his attention to the chained female slaves in the shed some extended their bodies to him some turned to display themselves provocatively for he was obviously a desirable master but others affected not to notice him though i noticed that their bodies were held beautifully as he passed particularly should he pause to regard them other girls perhaps newer to their collars shrank back against the boards trying to cover themselves some regarded him with tears in their eyes some with fear some with open hostility others with sullen resentment all knew that he might like any man own them completely to my surprise he stopped before a darkhaired girl who sat with her legs drawn up her arms about them her ankles crossed her cheek was aid across her knees she seemed startled that the forkbeard stopped before her she looked up at him frightened and then put her face down again across her knees but now her eyes were frightened and every inch of her seemed tense she looked up at him but then could not meet his eyes she seemed a shy introverted girl one who might before her capture have been much alone the she had been caught by slavers i would make a poor slave my jarl she whispered what do you know of this girl asked the forkbeard of the officer of svein blue tooth who was accompanying him she peaks little and as she can when not chained as in the exercise pen she keeps to herself the forkbeard reached his hand toward her knee but she watching terrified did not touch it and then withdrew it she took a deep breath closed her eyes then opened them she had feared to be touched where as fear inhibits sexual performance in a male rendering it impossible because neutralizing aggression essential to male power fear in a woman some fear not terror can interestingly improve her responsiveness perhaps by facilitating her abject submission which can then lead to multiple orgasms this is another reason incidentally why goreans favor the enslavement of desirable women the slave girl knows that she must please her master and that she will be punished and perhaps harshly if she does not this maked her not only desperate to please the brute who fondles her but also produces in her a genuine fear of him this fear on her part enhances her receptivity and responsiveness also of course since fear stimulates aggression which is intimately connected with male sexuality her fear which she is unable to help to her masters amusement deepens and augments the very predation in which she finds herself as quarry and if she should not be afraid it is no great matter any woman if the master wishes can be taught fear after the forkbeard had withdrawn his hand he studied her eyes intently i too detected that for which he had sought the object of his experiment though she had feared his touch yet when he had withdrawn his hand there was momentarily disappointment in her eyes she both feared to be touched and desperately yearned for the touch is she healthy asked the forkbeard yes said the officer of svein blue tooth i had seen such women sometimes on earth they were often studious quiet girls keeping much to themselves lonely girls yet with brilliant minds marvelous imaginations and fantastic suppressed latent sexuality they were often among the greatest surprises and bargains in the gorean slave markets viginia kent whom i had known in ar years ago who had become the companion of the warrior relius of ar been such a girl on earth she had taught acient history and classical languages at a small college on earth to many she might then have seemed a rather bluestocking forbidding girl gorean slavers however with greater perception perhaps then her fellow earthlings had seen her potential she had been one of several such items of cargo abducted to gor on gor given no choice suitably trained she had become one of the most exquisite and delicious female slaves it had ever been my pleasure to see in a collar relius given her had freed her his friend hosorl given another earth girl phyllis robertson had kept the latter in a collar relius was younger that hosorl and a romantic hosorl doubtless was more experienced in the handling of females i wondered if virginia to her astonishment perhaps after a quarrel or after a night of depriving relius in order to obtain some whim of herhad awakened one morning recollared again the slave of a master kneel said the forkbeard to the girl legs apart palms of your hands on your thighs with a movement of the chain she did so he crouched before her i may wish to use you to breed thralls he said you must be healthy for the farm put your head back close your eyes and open your mouth she did as she was told that the forkbeard might examine her teeth much may be told of the age and condition of a female slave as of a kaiila or bosk from her teeth but the forkbeard did not look into her mouth his left hand slipped to the small of her back holding her and his right hand went suddenly to her body she cried out trying to pull back but could not and then her eyes closed whimpering she thrust forward writhing and then sobbing held herself immobile teeth gritted eyes screwed shut trying not to feel when his hands left her body she tried sobbing to strike him but he caught both her small wrists holding them she struggled futilely held kneeling put your head back he said open your mouth she shook her head wildly i am holding your hands he pointed out warily eyes open she opened her mouth he looked at her teeth i may wish to use you to breed thralls he said you must be healthy for the farm he stood up what do you want for her he asked the officer of svein blue tooth i had her for a broken coin he said half a silver tarn disk of tharna i will let you have her for a whole coin the forkbeard returned tot he man the tarn disk of silver which he had received for dagmar the officer of svein blue tooth with a key at his belt unlocked the padlock which held the girls collar to the common chain he tossed the padlock open into one of the wooden boxes projecting from the wall the girl kneeling looked up at the forkbeard why did my jarl buy me she asked you have excellent teeth said the forkbeard for what will my jarl use me she asked doubtless you can learn to swill tarsks he said yes my jarl she said then she put her cheek to our suprise to the side of his leg and lowering her head holding his boot kissed it it was very delicately and lovingly done what is your name he asked peggie stevens she said i smiled it was an earth name you are an earth female i told her once she said now i am only female american i asked prior to my enslavement she said from what state i asked connecticut she said since the nest war the probes of aliens had grown more bold even on gor they had little difficulty in taking female slaves on earth gold exchangeable for materials essential to their enterprises was well guarded on earth it could seldom be obtained in quantities without attracting the attention of the agents of priestkings on the other hand the women of earth dispersed abundant many of them beautiful superb slave stock the sort a gorean master enjoys training to the collar were generally unguarded earth took greater care to guard her gold than her females accordingly the women of earth unprotected vulnerable like luscious fruit on wild trees were free for the pickings of gorean slavers a network i gathered existed for their selection and acquisition earth was helpless to prevent the taking of their most beautiful women they were eventually sold naked from blocks in gorean markets i suppose that the governments of earth or some of them were aware of the slaving perhaps merchants of middle eastern countries were suspected there were however delicate negotiations concerning oil to be respected it would not be well to be too bold in pressing accusations what were a few beautiful women taken as slave girls into harems of middle eastern businessmen and potentates to the commodity which supported civilization and turned the wheels of industry but the evidence would not point to the middle east further the small amount of slaving if any which might be done commercially in western europe or on the eastern seaboard of the united states would not account for the numbers of missing beauties hundreds a year i surmised turned up in gorean markets i speculated that earth governments or some og them were reasonably well aware that their planet must now be the locus of frequent alien slave raids but why would alien power not make itself known and openly demand their jewels among the female resourses of the planet the governments would not know of the power of the priestkings which the agents of the kurii profoundly and wisely feared what could these governments of earth do they could do nothing could they wisely inform their populations that their planet lay under the attacks of technologically advanced aliens with which their own primitive technologies were incapable of copying that they and all of earth seemed to lie at the mercies of invaders from outer space such an announcement could only bring about the loss of confidence in governments panic hoarding crime perhaps a breakdown in communication perhaps anarchy perhaps a shattering of trust and civilizations themselves no it was better to say nothing accordingly i supposed this very night on earth there were completely unsuspecting beautiful girls thinking it a night like any other who would undress themselves and snap off the light and retire not knowing that they had been perhaps for weeks scouted by slavers i wondered if they would awaken in terror the slavers rope on their throat hi needle with its drug thrusting into their side or if days later perhaps weeks they would awaken sluggishly then suddenly alert to the change of gravity and find themselves in a barred cemented slave kennel on their left ankles locked the steel identification device of the agents of the kurii that their manifests be correct their records precise how did you come to the north i asked the slave girl miss stevens i was sold in ar she said to a merchant from cos i was chained in a slave ship with many other girls on tiers in the hold the ship fell to four raiding vessels of torvaldland i have been by my reckoning eight months in the north what did your last jarl call you asked the forkbeard butter pan she said the forkbeard looked to gunnhild what shall we call this pretty little slave he asked honey cake suggested gunnhild you are honey cake said the forkbeard yes my jarl said miss stevens the forkbeard then left the bondmaid shed we all followed him he did not restrain honey cake in any way she nude in her collar back straight accompanied him her head was high she was a bought girl the other girls still on the chain regarded her with envy with resentment hostility she had paid them no attention she had been purchased they remained unbought girls wenches left on the chain they had not yet been found desirable enough to be purchased few suspected on this day in the thing that something unprecedented would occur after we had left the bondmaid shed i had let the forkbeard and his retinue return to their tent honey cake when last i saw her dared to cling to his arm her head to his shoulder he with a laugh thrust her back witht he other girls that she as they might heel him happily she did so i watched them disappear among the crowds ivar had won siv talmits he had done quite well honey cake too i thought would make him a delicious little slave we would all enjoy her i was at the archery range when the announcement was made i had not intended to participate in the competition rather it had been my plan to buy some small gift for the forkbeard long had i enjoyed his hospitality and he had given me many things i did not wish incidentally even if i could to give him a gift commensurate with what he had in his hospitality bestowed upon me the host in torvaldsland should make the greatest gifts it is after all his house or hall if his guest should make him a greater gifts than he makes the guest this is regarded as something in the nature of an insult a betrayal of hospitality after all the host is not running an inn extending hospitality like a merchant for profit and the host must not appear more stingy than the guest who theoretically is the one being welcomed and sheltered in torvaldsland thus the greater the generosity is the hosts prerogative should the forkbeard however have come to port kar then of course it would have been my prerogative to make him the greater gifts than he did me this is it seems to me an intelligent custom the host giving first and knowing what he can afford to give sets the limit to the giving the guest then makes certain that his gifts are less than those of the host the host in giving more wins honor as a host the guest in giving less does the host honor accordingly i was concerned to find a gift for the forkbeard it must not be too valuable but yet of course i wanted it to be something that he would appreciate i was on my way to the shopping booths those near the wharves where the best merchandise is found when i stopped to observe the shooting win leah win leah master i heard i looked upon her and she looked upon me she stood on the thick rounded block it was about a yard high and five feet in diameter she was darkhaired longhaired she had a short luscious body thick ankles her hands were on her hips win leah master she challenged she was naked except for the torvaldsland collar of black iron on her neck with its projecting ring and the heavy chain padlocked about her right ankle the chain was about a yard long it secured her by means of a heavy ring to the block she laughed win leah master she challenged she with the archery talmit was the prize in the shooting i noted her brand it was a southern brand the first letter in cursive script of kajira the most common expression for a gorean female slave it was entered deeply in her left thigh further i noticed that she had addressed me as master rather than my jarl i took it from these indications that she had learned her collar in the south probably originally it had been a lock collar snugly fitting of steel now of course it had been replaced with the riveted collar of black iron with the projecting ring so useful for running a chain through or for padlocking or linking on an anvil with a chain the southern collar commonly lacks such a ring the southern ankle ring however has one and sometimes two one in the front and one in the back will you not try to win leah master she taunted are you trained i asked she seemed startled in ar she whispered but surely you would not make me use my training in the north i looked upon her she seemed the perfect solution to my problem the gift of a female is sufficiently trivial that the honor of the forkbeard as my host would not be in the least threatened further this was a desirable wench whose cuddly slave body would be much relished by the forkbeard and his crew further being trained she would be a rare and exquisite treat for the rude giants of torvaldsland beyond this of course commanded she would impart her skills to the best of her abilities to his other girls you will do i told her i do not understand she said stepping back the chain slid on the wood your name and accent i said bespeak an earth origin yes she whispered where are you from i asked canada she whispered you were once a woman of earth i said yes she said but now you are only a gorean slave girl i told her i am well aware of that master she said i turned away from her the target in the shooting was about six inches in width at a range of about one hundred yards with the great bow the peasant bow this is not difficult work many marksmen warriors peasants rencers could have matched my shooting it was of course quite unusual in torvaldsland i put twenty sheaf arrows into the target until it bristled with wood and the feathers of the vosk gull when i retrieved my arrows to the shouting of the men the pounding of their bows on their shields the girl had been already unchained from the block i gave my name to the presiding official talmits would be officially awarded tomorrow i accepted his congratulations my girl prize knelt at my feet i looked down upon her what are you i asked only a gorean slave girl master she said do not forget it i told her i shall not master she whispered stand i told her she stood and i lashed her wrists tightly together behillc her back it was then that the announcement was heard it swept like oil aflame in the wind through the crowds of the thing men looked at one another many grasped their weapons more tightly a kur it was said one of the kurii would address the assembly of the thing the girl looked at me pulling against the fiber that bound her wrists have her delivered to the tent of thorgeir of ax glacier i told the presiding official tell him that she is a gift to him from tarl red hair it will be done said the official he signaled two burly thralls each of whom seized her by one arm deliver her to the tent of thorgeir of ax glacier he told them tell him that she is a gift to him from tarl redhair the girl was turned about each of the thralls holding one of her arms she looked once over her shoulder then between the thralls moaning crying out stumbling a gift being delivered she was thrust toward the tent of he who was known at the thing as thorgeir of ax glacier my eyes and those of the official who had presided at the archery contest met let us hasten to the place of the assembly he said together we hurried from the field where i had won the talmit in archery and a girl to the place of the assembly chapter the torvaldsberg it lifted its head it stood on the small hill sloping above the assembly field this hill was set with stones rather in the manner of t rraces on these stones set in semicircular lines like terraces stood high men and minor jarls and runepriests and the guard of svein blue tooth just below the top of the small hill cut into the hill there was a level stonepaved platform some twelve feet by twelve feet in dimension on this platform stood svein blue tooth with two high men officers lieutenants to the jarl the thing its head lifted surveyed the assembly of free men the pupils of its eyes in the sunlight were extremely small and black they were like points in the yellowish green cornea i knew that in darkness they could swell like dark moons to fill almost the entire optic orifice some three or four inches in width evolution on some distant perhaps vanished world had adapted this life form for both diurnial and nocturnal hunting doubtless like the cat it hunted when hungry and its efficient visual capacities like those of the cats meant that there was no time of the day or night when it might not be feared its head was approximately the width of the chest of a large man it had a flat snout with wide nostrils its ears were large and pointed they lifted from the side of its head listening and then lay back against the furred sides ofthe head kurii i had been told usually in meeting men laid the ears back against the sides of their heads to increase their resemblance to humans the ears are often laid back also incidentally in hostility or anger and always in its attacks it is apparently physiologically impossible for a kur to attack without its shoulders hunching its claws emerging and its ears lying back against the head the nostrils of the beast drank in what information it wished as they like its eyes surveyed the throng the trailing capacities of the kurii are not as superb as those of the sleen but they were reputed to be the equal of those of larls the hearing similarly is acute again it is equated with that of the larl and not the sharplysensed sleen there was little doubt that the day vision of the kurii was equivalent to that of men if not superior and the night vision of course was infinitely superior their sense of smell too of course was inccmparably superior to that of men and their sense of hearing as well moreover they like men were rational like men they were a singlebrained organism limited by a spinal column their intelligence by priestkings though the brain was much larger was rated as equivalent to that of men ard showed similar random distributions throughout gene pools what made them such dreaded foes was not so much their intelligence or on the steel worlds their technological capacities as their aggressiveness their persistence their emotional commitments their need to populate and expa nd their innate savagery the beast was approximalely nine feet in height i conjectured its weight in the neighborhood of eight or nine hundred pounds interestingly priestkings who are not visually oriented organisms find little difference between kurii and men to me this seems preposterous for ones so wise as priestkings but in spite of its obvious falsity priestkings regard the kurii and men as rather sirnilar almost equivalent species one difference they do remark between the human and the kur and that is that the human commonly has an inhibition against killing this inhibition the kur lacks fellow rational creatures called the kur it was difficult at first to understand it it was horrifying too suppose that at some zoo the tiger in its cage should look at you and in its rumbles its snarls its growls its half roars you should be able to your horror to detect crude approximatlons of the phonemes of your native tongue and you should hear it speaking to you looking at you uttering intelligible sentences i shuddered fellow rational creatures called the kur the kur has two rows of fangs its mouth is large enough to take into it the head of a fullgrown man its canines in the front row of fangs top and bottom are long when it closes its mouth the upper two canines project over the lower lip and jaw its tongue is long and dark the interior of its mouth reddish men of torvaldsland it called i speak to you behind the kur to one side stood two other kurii they like the first were fearsome creatures each carried a wide round shield of iron some four feet in diameter each too carried a great doublebladed iron ax which from blade tip to blade tip was some two feet in width the handle of the ax was of carved green needle wood round some four inches in diameter the axes were some seven or eight feet in height the speaker was not armed save by the natural ferocity of his species as he spoke his claws were retracted about his left arm which was some seven feet in length was a spiral golden armlet it was his only adornment the two kurii behind him each had a golden pendant hangingfrom the bottom of each ear the prehensile paws or hands of the kurii are sixdigited and multiple jointed the legs are thick and short in spite of the shortness of the legs the kur can when it wishes by utilizing its upper appendages in the manner of a prairie simian like the baboon move vvith great rapidity it becomes in running what is in effect a fourfooted animal it has the erect posture permitting brain development and facilitating acute binocular vision of a biped this posture too of course greatly increases the scanning range of the visual sensors but too its anatomy permits it to function in flight and attack much as a fourlegged beast for short distances it can outrun a fullgrown tarsk it is also said to possess great stamina but of this i am much less certain few animals which have not been trained have or need stamina an exception would be pack hunters like the wolves or hunting dogs of earth we come in peace said the kur the men of torvaldsland in the assembly field looked to one another let us kill them i heard one whisper to another in the north in the snows said the kur there is gathering of my kind the men stirred uneasily i listened intently i knew that kurii did not for the most part inhabit areas frequented by men on the other hand the kurii on the platform and other kurii i had encountered had been darkfurred either brownish or brownish red or black i wondered if it were only the darker furred kurii that roamed southward but if these kurii on the platform were snowadapted their fur did not suggest this i wondered if they might be from the steel ships either recently or within too few generations for a snowadaption pattern to have been developed if the kurii were sufficiently successful of course there would be no particular likelihood of evolution selecting for snow adaption too it could be that in summer the kurii shed white fur and developed in effect a summer coat still i regarded it unlikely that these kurii were from as far north as his words might suggest how many gather asked svein blue tooth who was on the platform with the kurii blue tooth was a large man bearded wlth a broad heavy face he had blue eyes and was blond haired his hair came to his shoulders there was a knife scar under his left eye he seemed a shrewd highly intelligent competent avaricious man i thought him probably an effective jarl he wore a collar of fur dyed scarlet and a long cloak over the left shoulder of purpledyed fur of the sea sleen he wore beneath his cloak yellow wool and a great belt of glistening black with a gold buckle to which was attached a scabbard of oiled black leather in this scabbard was a sword a sword of torvaldsland a long sword with a j eweled pommel with double guard we come in peace said the kur how many gather pressed blue tooth about his neck from a fine golden chain pierced hung the tooth of a hunjer whale dyed blue as many as the stones of the beaches said the kur as many as the needles on the needle trees what do you want called one of the men from the field we come in peace said the kur they do not have white fur said i to ivar forkbeard standing now beside me it is not likely that they come from the country of snows of course not said the forkbeard should this information not be brought to the attention of svein blue tooth i asked blue tooth is no fool said the forkbeard there is not a man here who believes kurii to gather in the country of snows there is not enough game to support many in such a place then how far would they be away i asked it is not known said the forkbeard you know us unfortunately said the kur to the assembly only by our outcasts wretches driven from our caves unfit for the gentilities of civilization by our diseased and our misfits and our insane by those who in spite of our efforts and our kindness did not manage to learn our ways of peace and harmony the men of torvaldsland seemed stunned i looked at the great axes in the hands of the two kurii who accompanied the speaker too often have we met in war and killing said the speaker but in this you too are much to blame you have cruelly and without compunction hunted us and when we sought comradeship with you as brothers as fellow rational creatures you have sought to slay us kill them muttered more than one man they are kurrii even now said the kur the skin drawing back from its fangs there are those among you who wish our death who urge our destruction the men were silent the kur had heard and understood their speech though he stood far from us and above us on the platform of the assembly that platform cut into the small sloping hill over the assembly field i admired the acuteness of its hearing again the skin drew back from its fangs i wondered if this were an attempt to simulate a human smile it is in friendship that we come it looked about we are a simple peaceful folk it said interested in the pursuit of agriculture svein blue tooth threw back his head and roared with laughter i regarded him then as a brave man beside me ivar forkbeard too laughed and then others i wondered if the stomach or stomachs of the kurii could digest vegetable food the assembly broke into laughter it filled the field the kur did not seem angry at the laughter i wondered if it understood laughter to the kur it might be only a human noise as meaningless to him as the cries of whales to us you are amused it said the kurii then had some understanding of laugher its own lips then drew back revealing the fangs i then understood this clearly as a smile that the kurii possessed a sense of humor did not much reassure me as to their nature i wondered rather at what sort of situations it would take as its object the cat if rational might find amusement in the twitching and trembling of the mouse which it is destroying particle by particle that a species laughs bespeaks its intelligence its capacity to reason not its goodness not its harrnlessness like a knife reason is innocent like a knife its application is a function of the hand that grasps it the energies and will which drive it we were not always simple farmers said the kur it opened its mouth that horrid orifice lined with its double rows of white heavy curved fangs no it said once we were hunters and our bodies still bear as reminders the stains of our cruel past it dropped its head we are by these it said and then it lifted its right paw suddenly exposing the claws and these reminded that we must be resolute in our attempts to overcome a sometimes recalcitrant nature then it regarded the assembly but you must not hold our past against us what is important is the present what is important is not what we were but what we are what we are striving to become we now wish only to be simple farmers tilling the soil and leading lives of rustic tranquility the men of torvaldsland looked at one another how many of you have gathered asked svein blue tooth again as many said the kur as the stones on the beaches as many as the needles on the needle trees what do you want he asked the kur turned to the assembly it is our wish to traverse your country in a march southward it would be madness said the forkbeard to me to permit large numbers of kurii into our lands we seek empty lands to the south to farm said the kur we will take only as much of your land as the width of our march and for only as long as it takes to pass your request seems reasonable said svein blue tooth we shall deliberate the kur stepped back with the other kurii they spoke together in one of the languages of the kurii for there are i understood in the steel worlds nations and races of such beasts i could hear little of what they said i could detect however that it more resembled the snarls and growling of larls than the converse of rational creatures what crop asked ivar forkbeard who wore a hood of the platform do the kurii most favor in their agricultural pursuits i saw the ears of the kur lie swiftly back against its head then it relaxed its lips drew back from its fangs satarna it said the men in the field grunted their understanding this was the staple crop in torvaldsland it was a likely answer ivar then spoke swiftly to one of his men what will you pay us to cross our land asked one of the free men of torvaldsland let us negotiate such fees said the beast when such negotiations are apt it then stepped back various free men then rose to address the assembly some spoke for granting the permission to the kurii for their march many against it finally it was decided that it was indeed germane to the decision to understand what the kurii would offer to obtain this permission i in this time now came to understand that torvaldsland stood in effect as a wall between the kurii and the more southern regions of gor the kur moreover tends to be an inveterate land animal they neither swim well nor enjoy the water they are uneasy on ships moreover they knew little of the craftsmanship of building a seaworthy ship that now suddenly large numbers of kuru were conjoined and intent upon a march southward could not be a coincidence in the wars of such beasts with priestkings i supposed it quite probable this was in effect a probe and yet one within the laws of the priestkings it was gorean kurii that were clearly substantially involved they carried primitive weapons they did not even use a translator in the laws of priestkings it was up to such species those of kurii and men to resolve their differences in their own way i had little doubt but what the kurii perhaps organized by kurii trom the steel worlds were to begin a march in torvaldsland which might extend in a generation to the southern pole of gor the kurii were now ready to reveal themselves at last they were ready to march if they were successful i had little doubt that the invasion from space in its full power would follow in their mercy or disinterest priestkings had spared many kurii who had been shipwrecked or shot down or marooned on gor these beasts over the centuries grown numerous and strong might now be directed by the kurii of the steel worlds doubtless they had been in contact with them i expected the speaker himself was of the steel ships painfully taught gorean the kurii native to gor or which had been permitted to survive and settle on gor would surely not be likely to have this facility they and men seldom met save to kill one another the kuriu i gathered did not wish to fight their way to more fertile lands south but to reach them easily thus conserving their numbers and in effect cutting torvaldsland from the south there was little to be gained by fighting an action the length of torvaldsland and little to be lost by not doing so which could not be later recouped when power in the south had been consolidated i had strong doubts of course as to whether a kur invasion of the south was practical unless abetted by the strikes of kur ships from the steel worlds the point of the probe indeed might be to push kur power as far south as possible and perhaps too for the first time result in the engagement of the forces of priestkings to turn them back this would permit an assessment of the power of priestkings the extent and nature of which was largely unknown to the kurii and perhaps to lure them into exposing themselves in such a way that a space raid might be successfully launched all in all i expected the invasion of the south was at this point primarily a probe if it was successful the priestkings to preserve men on the planet might be forced to intervene thus breaking their own laws if the priestkings did not do this perhaps for reasons of pride their laws having been given then in effect gor might become a kur world in which given local allies the priestkings might finally be isolated and destroyed this was to my knowledge the boldest and most dangerous move of the others the kurii to this date it utilized large forces on gor itself largely native kurii in its schemes kurii from the ships of course as organizers as officers might be among them and doubtless there would be communication with the ships somehow this march might be the first step in an invasion to culminate with the beaching of silver ships in their thousands raiders from the stars on the shores of gor it was possible of course that the kurii would attack torvaldsland when well within it without large forces marshaled against them once within the country before an army could be massed against them they might cut it to pieces farm by farm it was possible too of course that the kurii had become gentle beasts fond of farming renouncing their warlike ways and turning humbly to the soil and the labors of the earth setting perhaps therein an excellent example for the still halfsavage human animals of gor so predatory so savage so much concerned with wars and their codes and honor perhaps we could learn much from the kurii perhaps we could learn from them not to be men but a more benign animal more content more bovine perhaps they could teach us having overcome their proud restless natures to become too a gentler sweeter form of being a more pleasant a softer a happier animal perhaps together with them tilling the soil we could construct a more placid world a world in which discipline and courage and curiosity and adventure and doing what pleases one would become no more than the neglected scorned halfforgotten anachronisms of remote barbarians we would then have overcome our manhood and become one with the snails the kurii and the flowers what will you pay asked svein blue tooth for permission to traverse our land should that permission be granted we will take little or nothing said the kur and so must be asked to pay nothing there was an angry murmur from the men in the field but said the kur as there are many of us we will need provisions which we will expect you to furnish us that we will furnish you asked svein blue rooth i saw spear points lifted among the crowd we will require said the kur for each day of the march as provisions a hundred verr a hundred tarsk a hundred bosk one hundred healthy propertyfemales of the sort you refer to as bondmaids as provisions asked the blue tooth puzzled among the kurii in their various languages were words referring to edible meat food these general terms in their scope included human beings these terms were sometimes best ranslated as meat animal and sometimes cattle or sometimes simply food the human being was regarded by kurii as falling within the scope of application of such terms the term translated cattle was sometimes qualified to discriminate between fourlegged cattle and twolegged cattle of which the kurii were familiar with two varieties the bounding hurt and the human yes said the kur svein blue tooth laughed the kur this time did not seem amused we do not ask for any of your precious free females it said the soft flesh of the human female i knew was regarded as a delicacy among the kurii we have better uses for our bondmaids said svein blue tooth than to feed them to kurii there was great laughter in the field i knew however that if such a levy was agreed upon the girls would be simply chained and like the cattle they would be given to the kurii march camps female slaves are at the mercy of their masters completely but i did not expect men of torvaldsland to give up female slaves they were too desirable they would elect to keep them for themselves we will require too said the kur one thousand male slaves as porters to be used too in their turn as provlslons and if all this be granted to you asked svein blue tooth what will you grant us in return your lives said the kur there was much angry shouting the blood of the men of torvaldsland began to rage they were free men and free men of gor weapons were brandished consider carefully your answer my friends said the kur in all our requests are reasonable he seemed puzzled at the hostility of the men he had apparently regarded his terms as generous and i supposed that to one of the kurii they had indeed been generous would we have offered as much to a herd of cattle that might stand between us and a desired destination i saw then the man of ivar forkbeard whom he had earlier sent from his side climbing to the platform he carried a wooden bucket and another object wrapped in leather he conferred with svein blue tooth and the blue tooth smiled i have here called svein blue tooth a bucket of satarna grain this in token of hospitality i offer to our guest the kur looked into the bucket at the yellow grain i saw the claws on the right paw briefly expose themselves then swiftly draw within the softness of the furred multiple digited appendage i thank the great jarl said the beast and fine grain it is it will be our hope to have such good fortune with our own crops in the south but i must decline to taste your gift for we like men and unlike bosk do not feed on raw grain the jarl then took from the hands of ivar forkbeards man the leatherwrapped object it was a round flat sixsectioned loafof satarna bread the kur looked at it i could not read his expression feed invited svein blue tooth the kur reached out and took the loaf i shall take this to my camp it said as a token of the good will of the men of torvaldsland feed invited svein blue tooth the two kurii behind the speaker growled soft like irritated larls it made the hair on my neck rise to hear them for i knew they had spoken to one another the kur looked upon the loaf as we might have looked on grass or wood or the shell of a turtle then slowly he put it in his mouth scarcely had he swallowed it than he howled with nausea and cast it up i knew then that this kur if not all was carnivorous it then stood on the platform its shoulders hunched i saw the claws expose themselves the ears were back flat against its head its eyes blazed a spear came too close to it it seized it ripping it from the man and with a single snap of its teeth bit the shaft in two snapping it like i might have broken a dried twig then it lifted its head and fangs wild like a maddened larl roared in fury i think there was not a man in the field who was not for that instant frozen in terror the roar of the beast must have carried even to the ships do we free men of torvaldsland called our svein blue tooth grant permission to the kurii to traverse our land no cried one man no cried others then the entire field was aflame with the shouts of angry men a thousand of you can die beneath the claws of a single kur cried the kur there were more angry shouting brandishing of weapons the speaker the kur with the golden spiral bracelet turned angrily away he was followed by the two others fall back cried out svein blue tooth the peace of the thing is upon them men fell back and between them shambling swiftly moved the three kurs we are done with them said ivar forkbeard tomorrow called svein blue tooth we will award the talmits for excellence in the contests he laughed and tomorrow night we shall feast there was much cheering much brandishing of weapons i have won six talmits ivar forkbeard reminded me will you dare to claim them i asked he looked at me as though i might be mad of course said he i have won them in leaving the thing field i saw in the distance a high snowcapped mountain steep sharp almost like the blade of a bent spear i had seen it at various times but never so clearly as from the thing field i suppose the thing field might partly have been selected for the aspect of this mountain it was a remarkable peak what mountain is that i asked it is the torvaldsberg said ivan forkbeard the torvaldsberg i asked in the legends it is said that torvald sleeps in the mountain smiled ivar forkbeard to awaken when once more he is needed in torvaldsland then he put his arm about my shoulder come to my camp said he you must still learn to break thejarls ax gambit i smiled not yet had i mastered a defense against this powerful gambit of the north chapter lvar forkbeard introduces himself to svein blue tooth about my forehead were bound two talmits one which i had won in wrestling the other in archery the men of the forkbeard and many others clapped me on the back i was much pleased on the other hand i was not certain that i had much longer to live soon it would come the time to award the talmits to the mysterious thorgeir of ax glacier two men of svein blue tooth rose to their feet and silenced the crowd with two blasts on curved bronze signal horns of a sort often used for communication between ships the men of torvaldsland have in common a code of sound signals given by the horns consisting of some forty messages messages such as attack heave to regroup and communication desired have each their special combination of sounds this sort ofthing is done moreeffectively in my opinion in the south by means of flags run commonly from the prow cleats to the height of the stern castle flags of course are useless at night at night ships lanterns may be used but there is no standardization in their use even among the ships of a given port there are shield signals too however it might be mentioned in torvaldsland though these are quite limited two that are universal in torvaldsland are the red shield for war the white for peace the men of torvaldsland hearing the blasts on the bronze horns were silent the blasts had been the signal for attention on the wooden dais draped in purple set on the contest fields in heavy carved chairs sat svein blue tooth and his woman bera both wore their fnery about them some on the dais and some below it stood his high officers and his men of law his counselors his captains and the chief men from his scattered farms and holdings too much in evidence were more than four hundred of his menatarms in the crowd too in their white robes were runepriests svein blue tooth rose to his feet standing before the heavy carved wooden chair bera remained sitting about his neck on its golden chain hung the tooth of the hunjer whale dyed blue never in the history ofthe thing called svein has there been so high a winner in the contests as he whom we now proceed to honor i was not surprised that this was true ivar forkbeard had won six talmits he had won a talmit for climbing the mast a tall pole of needle wood it was some fifty feet high and was peeled and smoothed he had won one for leaping the crevice which was actually a broadjump performed on level ground one for walking the oar which was actually a long pole two in contests of the spear one for distance and one for accuracy and one in swimming he had done less well in singing poetry composition rhyming and riddle guessing he had come in however in second place in riddle guessing this man called out svein blue tooth obviously impressed has earned in these contests six talmits never in the history of the thing has there been so high a winner svein blue tooth was of torvaldsland himself he well understood the mightiness of the winners exploits it was rare for one man to win even two talmits thousands entered the contests only one in each contest could achieve the winners talmit i distinguish myself and enter into the history of our land said the blue tooth in being the high jarl to award these talmits in the games as we honor this man we in doing this similarly do honor unto ourselves this was cultural in torvaldsland one is regarded as being honored when one rightly bestows honor it is not like one man taking some thing from another so much as it is like an exchanging of gifts to a somewhat lesser extent it might be mentioned this is also cultural in the south svein blue tooth was obviously pleased that it had been in hisjarlship that six talrnits had been won at the thing by a single redoubtable champion ivar forkbeard large robed in gray hooded in gray stood beside me his features could not be well seen from a leather box proffered to him by a high officer who too had been the presiding official at the contests svein blue tooth lifted a fistful of talmits there was much cheering much shouting much lifting of weapons spear blades struck the surfaces of the round painted wooden shields there were steps leading to the dais he who calls himself thorgeir of ax glacier proclaimed svein blue tooth let him approach ivar forkbeard eagerly bounded up the stairs toward the dais there was not one of his men who did not tense and reach to his weapons reassuring himself as to their readiness i looked about considering the most opportune paths of flight if one is immersed in boiling tharlarion oil one dies quickly on the other hand if it is heated slowly over a tiny fire this same process consumes several hours i studied the face of svein blue tooth i had little doubt that he was a patient man i shuddered ivar forkbeard thorgeir of ax glacier now stood hooded on the top stair of the dais before his enemy i hoped that svein blue tooth would simply hand him the talmits and he might rapidly back down and we might run for the ship my heart sank it was obviously the intent of svein blue tooth himself to honor this great winner to bind on his forehead with his own hands the talmits the blue tooth reached to brush back the hood ivar drew back his head svein blue tooth laughed do not fear champion said he there is none here who believes your name truly to be thorgeir of ax glacier ivar forkbeard shrugged and spread his hands as though he had been found out as though his ruse had failed i felt like beating his head in with the handle of an ax what is your name champion asked bera the woman of jarl svein blue tooth ivar was silent that you have disguised yourself tells us said the blue tooth that you are outlaw ivar looked at him as though startled at his perception but the peace of the thing is upon you said svein blue tooth you are safe among us do not fear great champion we meet here not to threaten you but to do you honor be not afraid for the peace of the thing is upon you as on all men here great jarl said ivar forkbeard will you swear upon me the oath of peace for the time of the thing your personal oath sworn upon the ring of the temple of thor it is not necessary said the blue tooth but if you wish this oath i will swear the forkbeard bowed his head in humble petition the great ring of the temple of thor stained in the blood of the sacrificial ox was brought it was held in the hands of the high runepriest of the thing svein blue tooth grasped it in both hands i swear upon you the peace of the thing said he and i make this oath of peace for the time of the thing mine own as well i breathed more easily i saw the forkbeards men about me visibly relax only the forkbeard did not seem satisfied swear too he suggested by the side of the ship by the shields rim by the swords edge svein blue tooth looked at him puzzled i so swear he sald and too begged the forkbeard by the fires of your llearth by the timbers of the hall and the pillars of your high seat come now said svein blue tooth myjarl begged the forkbeard very well said the blue tooth i swear by the ships side the shields rim the swords edge the fires of my hearth the timbers of my hall and the pillars of the high seat in my house he then made ready to brush back the hood but the forkbeard drew back once more will you swear too he asked by the grains of your fields the boundary stones of your holdings the locks on your chests and the salt on your table yes yes said svein blue tooth irritatedly i so swear the forkbeard seemed lost in thought i assumed he was trying to think of ways to strengthen the blue tooths oath it seemed to me a mighty oath already i thought it quite sufficient and too i swear said svein blue tooth by the bronze of my ladles and the bottoms of my butter pansl that will not be necessary said the forkbeard generously what is your name champion asked svein blue tooth ivar forkbeard threw back his hood my name is ivar forkbeard he said chapter visitors in the hall of svein blue tooth ihe hall of svein blue tooth was of wood and magnificent the interior hall not counting rooms leading from it on various sides or the balcony which lined it leading to other rooms was some forty feet high and forty feet in width some two hundred feet in length it on the western side was lined with a great long table behind this table its back to the western wall facing the length of the hall facing east was the high seat or the rightful seat the seat of the master of the house it was wide enough for three or four men to sit together on it and as a great honor sometimes others were invited to share the high seat on each side of this high seat were two pillars about eight inches in diameter and some eight feet high the highseat pillars or rightfulseat pillars they marked the seat or bench which might be placed between them as the high seat or rightful seat these pillars had been carved by craftsmen in the time of svein blue tooths great grandfather and bore the luck signs of his house on each side of the high seat were long benches opposite on the other side of the table too were long benches a seat of honor incidentally was that opposite the high seat where one might converse with the host the high seat though spoken of as high was the same height as the other benches the men of torvaldsland thus look across the table at one another not one down upon the other the seat is high in the sense of being a seat of great honor there was extending almost the length of the hall a pit for a long fire over which food was prepared for retainers on the long sides of the hall on the north and south there were long tables with benches salt in its bowls on the tables divided men into rankings those sitting above the salt were accorded greater prestige than those sitting below it if one sat between the salt and the high seat one sat above the salt if one sat between the salt and the entrance to the hall one sat below the salt at the highseat table that at which the high seat sat all counted as being above the salt similarly at the tables parallel to the highseat table smaller tabies flanking the long fire on both sides the tables nearest the high seat counted as being above the salt those farthest away being below the salt the division was made approximately at the third of the hall closest to the high seat but could shift depending on the numbers of those in attendance worthy to be above the salt the line so to speak imaginary to be sure but definitely felt as a social reality dividing those above from those below the salt was uniformly drawn across the width of the hall thus it was not the case that one at a long side table who was above the salt would be farther away from the high seat than one at one of the center tables who was below the salt in ivar forkbeards hall incidentally the salt distinctions were not drawn in his hall all being comrades in arms all were above the salt svein blue tooths holdings on the other hand were quite large and complexly organized it would not have seemed proper at least in the eyes of svein blue tooth and others for a high officer to sit at the same table with a fellow whose main occupation was supervising thralls in the tending of verr salt incidentally is obtained by the men of torvaldsland most commonly from sea water or from the burning of seaweed it is also however a trade commodity and is sometimes taken in raids the red and yellow salts of the south some of which i saw on the tables are not domestic to torvaldsland the arrangements of tables incidentally varies in different halls i describe those appointments characterizing the hall of blue tooth it is common however for the entrance of the hall to be oriented toward the morning sun and for the high seat to face the entrance none may enter without being seen from the high seat similarly none are allowed to sit behind the high seat in a rude country these defensive measures are doubtless a sensible precaution about the edges of the hall hung the shields of warriors with their weapons even those who sat commonly at the center tables and were warriors kept their shields and spears at the wall at night each man would sleep in his furs behind the tables under his weapons high officers of course and the blue tooth and members of his family would retire to private rooms the hall was ornately carved and above the shields decorated with cunningly sewn tapestries and hangings on these were usually warlike scenes or those dealing with ships and hunting there was a lovely scene of the hunting of tabuk in a forest another tapestry showing numerous ships in a war fleet dated from the time of the famine in torvaldsland a generation ago that had been a time of great raids to the south svein blue tooth had not been much pleased on the fields of the contests on his purpledraped dais when ivar forkbeard had announced his identity seize him and heat oil had been the first cry of the blue tooth your oath your oath had cried the horrified startled runepriests seize him screamed the blue tooth but his men had forcibly restrained him they glaring at ivar forkbeard with illdisguised disapproval you tricked me cried out the blue tooth yes adrnitted the forkbeard it is true svein blue tooth held in the arms of his men struggled to unsheath his great sword of blued steel the high runepriest of the thing interposed himself between the violent blue tooth and the forkbeard who was innocently regarding cloud formations the runepriest held up the heavy golden ring of thor the temple ring itself stained in the blood of the sacrificial ox on this ring you have sworn he cried and by many other things as well added the forkbeard unnecessarily to my mind the veins stood out on the forehead and neck of svein blue tooth he was a powerful man it was not easy for his officers to restrain him at last eyes blazing he subsided we will hold parley he said he with his high officers retired to the back of the dais many heated words were passed between them more than one cast a rather dark look in the direction of the forkbeard who then his disguise cast off was cheerily waving to various acquaintances in the crowd long live the forkbeard cried a man in the throng the menatarms of svein blue tooth stirred uneasily they edged more closely about the dais i ascended the steps of the dais and stood at the back of the forkbeard hand on the hilt of the sword to protect him if necessary you are insane i informed him look he said there is hafnir of the inlet of iron walls i have not seen him since i was outlawed good i said he waved to the man ho there hafnir he cried yes it is i ivar forkbeard the menatarms ofsvein blue tooth were now uncornfortably close i pushed away spear points with my left hand meanwhile the debate at the back of the dais went on the issues seemed reasonably clear though i could catch only snatches of what was said they concerned the pleasures of boiling the forkbeard and his retinue alive as opposed to the dangerous precedent which rnight be set if the peace of the thing was sundered and the loss of credit which might accrue to svein blue tooth if he reneged on his pledged oaths deep oaths publicly and voluntarily given there were also considerations to the effect that the runepriests would be distressed if the oaths were broken and that the gods too might not look lightly upon such a violation of faith and might too more seriously evidence their displeasure by such tokens as blights plagues hurricanes and famines against these considerations it was argued that not even the gods thernselves could blarne svein blue tooth under these circumstances for not honoring a piddling oath extracted under false pretenses one bold fellow even went so far as to insist that under these special circumstances it was a solemn obligation incumbent on the blue tooth to renounce his oath and commit the forkbeard and his followers with the exception of slaves who would be confiscated to the oil pots fortunately in the midst of his eloquence this fellow sneezed which omen at once decisively wiped away the weightiness of his point at last the blue tooth turned to face the forkbeard sveins face was red with rage the high runepriest lifted the sacred temple ring the peace of the thing said the blue tooth and the peace of my house for the time of the thing is upon you this i have sworn this i uphold there was much cheering the forkbeard beamed i knew it would be so my jarl he said the high runepriest lowered the temple ring i rather admired svein blue tooth he was a man of his word by his word he would stand even though as in the present case any objective observer would have been forced to admit that his provocation to betray it his temptation to betray it must have been unusual in the extreme in honor such a high jarl must set an example to the men of torvaldsland he had nobly if not cheerfully set the example by tomorrow night said he when the thing is done be free of this place my oath is for the time of the thing and for no longer you have six talmits of mine i believe said the forkbeard svein blue tooth looked at him in rage there is one for swimming said the forkbeard one for climbing the mast one for leaping the crevice one for walking the oar and two for prowess with the spear blue tooth was speechless that is six said the forkbeard never before in the history of the thing has a champion done this well the blue tooth thrust the talmits toward the forkbeard but the forkbeard humbly inclined his head then svein blue tooth as high jarl in torvaldsland one by one tied about the forehead of ivar forkbeard the six talmits there was much cheering i too cheered svein blue tooth was in his way not a bad fellow by tomorrow night repeated svein blue tooth to the forkbeard when the thing is done be free of this place my oath is for the time of the thung and for no longer you frown upon me and would put me below the salt said ivar forkbeard because i am outlaw i frown upon you and would not let you within the doors of my hall said svein blue tooth because you are the greatest scoundrel and rogue in torvaldsland i could see that this compliment much pleased the forkbeard who a vain fellow was jealous of his reputation but i have said the forkbeard the means wherewith to buy myself free of the outlawry you yourself pronounced upon me that is preposterous snorted the blue tooth several of his men laughed no man said the blue tooth looking suddenly at ivar forkbeard could pay such wergild as i set for you you have heard inquired ivar forkbeard of the freeing of chenbar the sea sleen from the dungeons of port kar he smiled you have heard he inquired of the sack of the temple of kassau you cried the blue tooth i saw the eyes of the blue tooth suddenly gleam with avarice i knew then surely that he was of torvaldsland there is a streak of the raider in them all the wergild i set you said he slowly was such that no man by my intent could pay it it was one hundred stone of gold the weight of a grown man in the sapphires of schendi and the only daughter of my enemy thorgard of scagnar may i pay my respects to you this night in your hall asked the forkbeard svein blue tooth looked at him startled he fingered the heavy tooth on its chain which hung about his neck that tooth of a hunjer whale dyed blue bera his woman rose to her feet i could see that her mind was moving with rapidity come tonight to our hall champion said she the blue tooth did not gainsay her the woman of the jarl had spoken free women in the north have much power thejarls woman in the kaissa oit the north is a more powerful piece than the ubara in the kaissa of the south this is not to deny that the ubara in the south in fact exercises as much or more power than her northern counterpart it is only to recognize that her power in the south is iess explicitly acknowledged the forkbeard looked to svein blue tooth svein fingered the tooth on its chain yes said he come tonight to my hallchampion there had then been again much cheering svein bue tooth high jarl of torvaldsland followed by his woman and high officers and counselors and other followers then took his way from the dais we had fed well in the hall of svein blue tooth many were the roast tarsk and roast bosk that had roasted over the long fire on the iron spits splendid was the quality of the ale at the tables of the blue tooth sweet and strong was the mead the smoke from the fire found its way high into the rafters and eventually out of the holes cut in the peaked roof some of these were eighteen inches square light was furnished from the cooking fire but too from torches set in rings on the wall backed with metal plating too here and there on chains from the beams high above there hung large tharlarion oil lamps which could be raised and lowered from the sides at places too there were bowls with oil and wicks with spikes on their bottoms set in the dirt floor some six inches from the floor others as high as five feet this mode of lamp incidentally is more common in the private chambers it was not unusual incidentally tha the floor of the great hall rich as it was was of dirt strewn with rushes this is common in the halls of torvaldsland when the forkbeard and i and other followers many oi them bearing riches entered the hall we had been given a room to one side in which we might wash and dry ourselves before the feast in this room unusual in halls was a window i had put my finger against it and pressed outward i was not paned with glass but with some sort of membrane but the membrane was almost as clear as glass what is this i had asked the forkbeard it is the dried afterbirth membrane of a bosk fetus he said it will last many months even against rain looking out through the window i could see the palisade about the hall and its associated buildings the palisade inclosed some two acres within it were many shops and storage houses even an ice house in the center of course reared the great hall itself that rude highroofed palace of the north the house of svein blue tooth through the membrane hardly distorted i saw the palisade the catwalk about it the guards and over it the moons of gor in the far distance the moonlight reflected from its snowy heights i saw too the torvaldsberg in which the legendary torvald was reputed to sleep supposedly to waken again if needed once more in torvaldsland i smiled i turned to ivar forkbeard i saw that treasures borne by his men had been placed in this side room he grinned the forkbeard was in a good mood the last night had been quite a pleasant one for him he had handed off pudding and gunnhild to his men for the night and had ordered to his furs honey cake the former miss stevens of earth and the wench leah the canadian girl whom i had won at archery and given to him as a gift honey cake like many shy introverted timid girls fearing her own sexuality and fearing that of men sensing them in terror as her natural masters was the mistress of secret incredible depths of repressed sexual emotion and feeling the forkbeard of course a rude barbarian was not in the least concerned with the walls which she had carefully over years built to conceal her own needs and desires from herself he simply shattered them he had forced her unable to resist as only a bondmaid without choice to look deeply and openly on her own naked needs and desires then he had used her as a slave she had yielded to him helplessly wondrously laughing weeping crying out with joy the wench leah whom i had won at archery had tried to resist the forkbeard he had her beaten and thrown back to his furs soon she too in her turn was moaning with pleasure helplessly she was responding beautifully to him by morning both girls on and about him fighting one another jealous of one another were begging for his touch at dawn he had ordered one of his men that he might get some sleep to chain them prone head to foot the right ankle of each chained to the projecting ring on the collar of the other the forkbeard did not rise until afternoon he was then much refreshed i had in my turn with several of the other of the forkbeards men enjoyed pudding and gunnhild both were superb toward morning too i had felt olgas small fingers at my ankle she was like several of the other bondmaids chained by the right ankle the chain some eight feet in length to a stake driven into the earth near the center of the forkbeards tent she had crawled to the extent of her chain her right leg extended behind her and had stretched her right hand toward me i took the furs to her side wrapped her within them with me and had much pleasure with her we fell asleep two ahn afterwards she still held in my arms her head on my shoulder when the forkbeard himself rose of course the camp became quite active and the slaves were put about many menial labors the thrall tarsk was unchained from thyri and set about the sawing of wood thyri herself her kirtle thrown to her was ordered to pound grain to make flour she could not even look tarsk in the face i noted she looked down shyly from her cries the night before i knew that she had behind the tent yielded to him the other girls much teased her for yielding to a thrall i would have been beaten had i not yielded she said in defense then she looked down once more and smiled she did not seem discontent i saw her late in the afternoon unbidden secretly bringing him water at his work thank you bondmaid said he she put down her head you are pretty bondmaid he said thank you my jarl she said he looked after her as she sped away he grinned he then whistling worked with gusto he did not then seem to me unlike a free man if you are washed and readied said a young thrall collared in a kirtle of white wool it is permissible to present yourselves before the high seat of the house before my master svein blue tooth jarl of torvaldsland we are honored had said the forkbeard he designated four of his men to guard the treasures we looked at one another i feel i said as though i were walking into the jaws of a larl do not fear said ivar i forkbeard am at your side were you not at my side i said i doubt that i should feel as i do i see said the forkbeard could we not i suggested simply leap naked into a pit of venomous osts or perhaps race madly across the plains of the wagon peoples during a lightning storm our swords raised over our heads the trick said the forkbeard is not simply to walk into the jaws of a larl any fool can do that i am well aware of that i said the trick said the forkbeard winking but not thereby much reassuring me is to walk back out again you have some intention then i asked of emerging from this escapade alive that is a portion of my plan acknowledged the forkbeard and failing that we will die nobly against heavy odds thus my plan is foolproof you have reasoned it out well i admitted lead on the forkbeard lifted his head boldly and smiling emerged from the side room at the entrance to which he stopped and raised his hands saluting the tables he was greeted with warmth from the many warriors there he had won six talmits the forkbeard greets you shouted ivar i blinked the hall was light i had not understood it to be so large at the tables lifting ale and knives to the forkbeard were more than a thousand men then he took his way to the bench opposite the high seat stopping here and there to exchange pleasantries with the men of svein blue tooth i and his men followed him the blue tooth i noted did not look too pleased at the forkbeards popularity with his men near him beside the high seat sat his woman bera her hair worn high on her head in a kirtle of yellow wool with scarlet cape of the fur of the red sea sleen and about her neck necklaces of gold we had fed well in the hall of svein blue tooth during the meal for svein was a rich man there had been acrobats and jugglers and minstrels there had been much laughter when one of the acrobats had fallen into the long fire to leap scrambling from it rolling in the dirt two other men to settle a grievance had had a tug of war a bosk hide stretched between them across the long fire when one had been pulled into the fire the other had thrown the hide over him and stomped upon him before the fellow in the fire could free himself he had been much burned this elicited much laughter from the tables the juggiers had a difficult tiine too for their eyes on the cups and plates they were juggling they were not infrequently tripped to the hilarity of the crowd more than one minstrel too was driven from the hall the target of barrages of bones and plates the forkbeard was at one point so furious at the ineptness of the musicians that he informed me of his own intention to regale the tables with song he was extremely proud of his singing voice i prevailed upon him to desist you are a guest i told him it would not be seemly for you by your talents to shame the entertainers and thereby perhaps reflect upon the honor of your host who doubtless has provided the best he can true admitted the forkbeard i breathed more easily had ivar forkbeard broken into song i would have given little for our chances male thralls turned the spits over the long fire female thralls bondmaids served the tables the girls though collared in the manner of torvaldsland and serving men were fully clothed their kirtles of white wool smudged and stained with grease fell to their ankles they hurried about they were barefoot their arms too were bare their hair was tied with strings behind their heads to keep it free from sparks their faces were on the whole dirty smudged with dirt and grease they were worked hard bera i noted kept much of an eye upon them one girl seized by a warrior her waist held his other hand sliding upward from her ankle beneath the single garment permitted her the long stained woolen kirtle making her cry out with pleasure dared to thrust her lips eagerly furtively to his but she was seen by bera orders were given by male thralls she was bound and weeping thrust to the kitchen there to be stripped and beaten i presumed that if bera were not present the feast might have taken a different turn her frigid cold presence was doubtless not much welcomed by the men but she was the woman of svein blue tooth i supposed in time normally she would retire doubtless taking svein blue tooth with her it would be then that the men might thrust back the tables and hand the bondmaids about no jarl i knew can hold men in his hall unless there are ample women for them i felt sorry for svein blue tooth this night however it seemed bera had no intention of retiring early i suspected this might have accounted somewhat for the ugliness of the men with the entertainers not that the men of torvaldsland under any circumstances constitute an easily pleased audience generally only kaissa and the songs of skalds can hold their attention for long hours that and stories told at the tables after the entertainers had been driven from the hall and much food had been eaten svein blue tooth who had showed much patience said to ivar forkbeard it is my understanding that you believe yourself to have that wherewith your deeds wergild might be met perhaps admitted the forkbeard svein blue tooths eyes gleamed he fingered the tooth of the hunjer whale on its golden chain slung about his neck the wergild was high said the blue tooth the forkbeard stood up bring gold and sapphires said he and bring scales to the astonishment of all those in the hall from the side room boxes and sacks of gold were brought forth by the forkbeards men and too a large heavy sack of leather filled with tiny objects men left the back tables men crowded about even the thralls and the bondmaids astonished disbelieving crowded near room make room here called the forkbeard for more than two ahn gold was weighed on two pairs of scales one furnished by the forkbeard the other by the house of svein blue tooth to my relief the scales alrnost perfectly agreed the gold accumulated the eyes of svein blue tooth and bera narrow shining were filled with pleasure there is forty weight of gold here said svein blue tooths man almost as though he could not believe it four hundred stone of gold there was a gasp from the throng the forkbeard then went to the heavy leather sack and ripping the leather away at its throat poured onto the dirt lustrous scintillating a shower of jewels mostly a deep blue but some were purple and other white and yellow the carved sapphires of schendi each in the shape of a tiny panther aiii cried the throng svein blue tooth leaned forward his fists clenched bera her eyes blazing could not speak the forkbeard shook his sack further more jewels fell forth some among them more unusual varieties of sapphire pale pink orange violet brown and even green ah cried the throng how beautiful cried a bondmaid who did not herself own even her collar of iron weigh them said the forkbeard i had not myself realized there were so many varieties of sapphires until this time i had been familiar only with the bluish stones i had little doubt however that the stones were genuine chenbar the sea sleen would have insisted on the fee for his rescue being paid in genuine stones as a matter of pride too the forkbeard in dealing with his jarl svein blue tooth would not use false stones he would be above that it is one thing to cheat one not of torvaldsland quite another to attempt to defraud one of ones own country particularly ones jarl i had no doubt that the spilled glory heaped gleaming in the dirt of the hall of svein blue tooth was what it seemed true stones and an incredible treasure the jewels like the gold were patiently weighed there were many exclamations from the warriors present and others in the throng the weight of the stones was more than that of a fullgrown man ivar forkbeard stood behind these riches and grinned and spread his hands i did not think there were such riches in all of torvaldsland whispered bera svein blue tooth was much impressed he could scarcely speak with such riches there would be no jarl in torvaldsland who could even remotely compare to him his power would be the equal of that of a ubar of the south but the men of torvaldsland are not easily pleased the blue tooth leaned back there was forkbeard said he smiling a third condition to the wergild oh my jarl asked ivar it seems i must keep this treasure said he and you remain outlaw it may however count as the first two installments of a completed transaction i shall revoke your outlawry when and only when too you deliver to me the daughter of my enemy thorgard of scagnar the blue tooths men not pleased murmured angrily the forkbeard surely has more than paid wergild cried one what man has been set such a price and has paid it cried another silence cried svein blue tooth standing behind the table he scowled at his men no one not an army or a fleet cried another could take the daughter of so powerful a jarl as thorgard of scagnar you seem to ask the impossible my jarl observed ivar forkbeard i do ask the impossible said svein blue tooth of you my friend ivar forkbeard i choose to ask the irnpossible the forkbeards men muttered angrily weapons were grasped even the men of svein blue tooth perhaps a thousand in the hall were angry yet the blue tooth boldly their jarl matched his will to theirs which one of them would dare to challenge the will of their jarl i admired the blue tooth in his way he was courageous in the final analysis i had little doubt that his men would abide by his decision the blue tooth sat down again in the high seat yes friend forkbeard said he of you as is my right i ask what cannot be done the impossible the forkbeard turned and facing the entrance of the hall called out bring forth the female there was no sound in the great hall save the crackle of the fires and torches the men and the thralls and bondmaids parted from the doors to the hall swung wide now approaching came four figures ottar who had accompanied the forkbeard to the thing two of the forkbeards men with spears and between them clad in rich robes of concealment such as are worn in the south even to the veils the figure of a girl these four stopped before the table opposite the high seat of svein blue tooth the girl stood among the gold and the heaped sapphires her robes were marvously wrought subtle soft seeming almost in their sheens like the jewels to shift their colors in the light of the lamps and the flickering torches the robes were hooded she was twice veiled once in white silk and under it in purple silk what mockery is this demanded the blue tooth sternly no mockery my jarl said the forkbeard he extended his hand toward the girl may i present to my jarl he asked hilda daughter of thorgard of scagnar the girl reached to her hoods and brushed them back freeing her hair and then pin by pin she unfastened the two veils one after the other and dropped them it is she whispered a man at the table of svein bluetooth i was once in the hall of thorgard it is she are youare you asked svein blue tooth the daughter of thorgard thorgard of scagnar yes my jarl she said before thorgard of scagnar had the ship black sleen said svein slowly he had another ship what was its name horned tharlarion she said he still has this ship too she added but it does not now serve as his flagship how many oars has it he asked eighty said she who keeps the fisheries of thorgard asked a man grim once of hunjer she said once in battle said svein blue tooth i wounded thorgard of scagnar the scar she said is on his left wrist concealed unde a studded wristlet svein leaned back in this same engagement she said he wounded you and more grievously you will bear the scar in your left shoulder bera flushed it is true said svein blue tooth i tell you cried the man at the table it is hilda daughter of thorgard of scagnar i have been in his hall it is she the women of the north commonly do not veil themselves how were you taken asked svein blue tooth by trickery my jarl said she in my own compartments was i taken braceleted and hooded how were you conveyed past guards asked the blue tooth from the window of my compartments braceleted and hooded late at night helpless in darkness i was hurled into the sea more than a hundred feet below a boat was waiting like a fish i was retrieved and made prisoner forced to lie on my belly in the boat like a common maid my captors followed there was a great cheer from the men in the hall both those of ivar forkbeard and those of svein blue tooth you poor miserable girl cried bera it could happen to any female said hilda even you great lady men are beasts bera cried she regarded ivar and me and his men with fury shame be upon you you beasts she cried svein blue tooth jarl of torvaldsland meet hilda daughter of thorgard of scagnar said ivar hilda daughter of thorgard of scagnar meet svein blue tooth jarl of torvaldsland hilda inclined her head in deference to the jarl there was another great cheer in the hall poor girl cried bera how you must have suffered hilda lowered her head she did not respond to bera i thought she smiled never had i thought to have hilda daughter of thorgard of scagnar stand prisoner before me before the high seat of my house said svein blue tooth before you i stand more than prisoner my jarl said she i do not understand said svein blue tooth she did not raise her head you need not address me as your jarl my dear said svein blue tooth i am not your jarl but every free man is my jarl she said you see my jarl said she lifting her head proudly and pulling her rich glistening robes some inches down upon her shoulders i wear the collar of ivar forkbeard the collar of black iron with its heavy hinge its riveted closure its projecting ring of iron for a chain or padlock showed black heavy against the whiteness of her lovely throat you have dared to collar the daughter of thorgard of scagnar cried bera to ivar forkbeard my master does what he pleases lady said hilda i wondered what bera would say if she knew that hilda had been put at the oar and taught to heel that she had been whipped and taught to obey that she had been caressed and taught to respond silence bondmaid cried bera hilda put down her head to think cried bera that i expressed solicitude for a collargirl hilda dared not speak for a bondmaid to speak in such a situation might be to invite a sentence of death she shuddered in fury bera lifting her skirt from about her ankles took her way from the long table retiring to her own quarters you collared her laughed svein blue tooth of course said the forkbeard superb laughed svein blue tooth rubbing his hands together lift your head wench he said his attitude toward hilda had changed completely she did so she had a beautiful face blue eyes long loose blond hair is she pretty asked svein blue tooth remove your slippers said the forkbeard the girl did so she stepped from them she did not wear stockings roughly the forkbeard then his hands at her shoulders tore away the robes of concealment the men and the bondmaids cried out with pleasure with admiration hilda stood proudly her head high amidst the heaped gold jewels sapphires in the dirt about her feet she had been branded it had been done by the hand of ivar forkbeard himself before dawn some days ago shortly before the ship had left for the thing she had been carried weeping over his shoulder her brand fresh aboard his ship the collar too before the brand that very morning had been closed about her neck and riveted shut i observed the brand she was now only another girl whose belly lay beneath the sword a propertygirl a collargirl a slave a bondmaid the eyes of svein blue tooth and those of his men glistened as they feasted upon her bared beauty it seems said svein blue tooth that the wergild has been well met yes said the forkbeard it might seem so in the morning i shall proclaim the lifting of your outlawry said the blue tooth i relaxed it seemed we would come alive after all out of the hall of the blue tooth i had only feared some treachery or trickery upon his part some northern trick yet he had now before his men spoken and i knew him by this time to be one who stood with his word and stood well with it and proudly his word was to him as his land and his sword as his honor and his ship it would be kept it would be neither demeaned nor broken i think there is some mistake said ivar forkbeard inwardly i groaned how is that asked the blue tooth how is it that the wergild is met asked ivar forkbeard the blue tooth looked puzzled he pointed to the jewels the gold the girl you have that here wherewith to meet the wergild said he that is true said the forkbeard then he drew himselfup to a not inconsiderable full height but who has told you that i choose to meet it suddenly the men in the hall both those of the forkbeard and of svein blue tooth began to cheer i too was on my feet among them none of us had suspected it and yet it was what one should have expected of such a man as the forkbeard never in the north had there been such a coup of honor though it might mean the death of us all those who followed the forkbeard and that of perhaps hundreds of the men of svein blue tooth we cheered my heart bounded my blood raced i struck again and again my left shoulder with the palm of my right hand i heard swords clashing against the sides of plates spear blades clattering on shields and ringing one against the other slowly svein blue tooth rose to his feet he was livid with rage there was not a man in the hall but knew that his kinsman a distant cousin finn broadbelt whom the forkbeard had slain had fallen in fair duel and that wergild should not have been levied and there was not a man in that hall but knew that the blue tooth had decreed even were such justified a wergild to the deed of the forkbeard whose conditions were outrageous deliberately formulated to preclude their satisfaction a wergild contrived to make impossible the meeting of its own terms a wergild the intent of which was in its spitefulness to condemn the forkbeard to perpetual outlawry then to the astonishment of all torvaldsland and most to that of svein blue tooth the forkbeard redoubtable after earning six talmits in the contests delivered to his hall the very wergild no man had supposed it possible to pay and had then arrogantly before the high seat of the blue tooth itself refused to pay in this land said ivar forkbeard rather than accept pardon at the hands of such a jarl one such as you svein blue tooth i make what choice a free man must i choose the sleen the forest and the sea svein blue tooth regarded him i do not pay the wergild said the forkbeard i choose to remain outlaw once again there was much cheering i clapped the forkbeard about the shoulders gorm and ottar too stood with him and his other men hilda knelt at his feet among the gold the jewels her lips pressed to his furred boots my jarl my jarl she wept then there was silence in that highroofed hall all eyes turned to svein blue tooth he stood before the high seat of his house standlng before the long table behind him on each side were the highseat pillars of his house he prepared to speak suddenly he lifted his head i too and several of the others at the same time detected it it was smoke the hall is afire cried one man flames above and behind us crept at the southeast corner of the interior roof above and as we faced it to the right of the doors smoke too began to drift in from one of the side rooms we saw something move within it what is going on cried a man at one of the tables the doors behind us both of them great carved doors suddenly thrust open in the doorway silhouetted against flames behind them we saw great black shaggy figures then one leapt within the hall in one hand it carried a gigantic ax whose handle was perhaps eight feet long whose blade from tip to tip might have been better than two feet in length on its other arm it carried a great round iron shield double strapped it lifted it and the ax its arms were incredibly long perhaps some seven feet in length about its left arm was a spiral band of gold it was the kur which had addressed the assembly it threw back its head and opened its jaws eyes blazing and uttered the blood roar of the aroused kur then it bent over regarding us shoulders hunched its ciaws leaping from its soft furred sheaths it then laid its ears back flat against the sides of its great head no one could move then other kurii behind it crowding about it past it it shrieked lips drawn back with a hideous sound which somehow from its lips and mien and mostly from its eyes i took to be a sign of pleasure of anticipation i would learn later that this sound is instinctively uttered by kurii when they are preparing to take blood this cry like a stimulus acted upon the others as well almost instantly with the velocity that the stranger signal can course through a pack of urts this shriek was picked up by those with it then the hall filled with their horrid howling eyes blazing led by the kur with the golden band frenzied by the blood shriek they leaped forward great axes flailing chapter the forkbeard and i depart from the hall of svein blue tooth i saw half of the body of a man spinning crazily past kurii leapt down the long sides of the hall slashing cutting men down as they fled to their weapons the wooden shields of torvaldsland no more stopped the great axes than dried skins of larma fruit stretched on sewing frames might have resisted the fourbladed dagger cestus of anango or the hatchet gauntlet of eastern skjern more than once the blades of the kurii axes bit through the spines of men reaching for their weapons and splintered gouging in the beams of the hall i choked in the smoke my eyes stung near me a man screamed i was knocked from my feet buffeted in the crowd for an instant i was conscious only of the dirt floor the reeds strewn upon it the mad forest of running feet my left liand slipped in the dirt in blood i was knocked again but then managed to force my way to my feet i was carried in the panicstricken throng a dozen yards in one direction then meaninglessly carried back in the other i could not even draw my weapon the kur axes fel again and again the hall rang with their howling i saw a manatarms lifted back broken in the black furred tentacled hand of one of the marauders the thing roared head back the white fangs seemed scarlet in the light of the fires from the roof then it threw the man more than a hundred feet against the back ot the llall i saw another manatarms hanging from the jaws of a kur he was still alive his eyes betrayed shock staring blindly outward i do not think he saw i suspect he was in pain he was alive but i did not think he any longer felt he doubtless understood what was occurring but to him somehow it did not seem of concern it was as though it were happening to someone else then the kurs jaws closed for the least instant there was a terrifying recognition in the eyes then he was bitten through i briefly saw ivar forkbeard he was trying to thrust hilda held by the arm toward one of the side rooms between killing kurii he was shouting orders to his men who clustered about him svein blue tooth stood on the long table behind which was his high seat i could not hear him in the shouting the screams the howling of the frenzied kurii a great kur ax swept near me four men trying to back away but held as though against a wall by the throng were cut down those nearest the kurii tried to crawl back within the throng the kurii axes in their sweeps at the edges of the throng kept us helpless crowded together few men could as much as draw their weapons some men behind kurii fled away out of the great opened double doors of the hall i saw them fleeing outlined briefly against the fires outside but outside too i saw silhouetted against the flames waiting kurii many fled into the axes of the kurii in the yard of the hall then kurii stood before the threshold snarling axes lifted men came before them and threw themselves to their knees that they might be spared even were it but for the ahn but these like others no differences drawn between them were cut down destroyed by strokes of the swift axes kurii take prisoners only when it pleases them i saw several of the forkbeards men manage to slip into one of the side rooms gorm and ottar were among them i hoped they might make good their escape perhaps they could tear out trhe membrane in one of the windows and crawl through and in the confusion outside make away the forkbeard to my surprise momentarily reappeared trom within the room looking about his face looked red in the fires he carried his sword i did not see hilda i assumed she had with the men entered the small room it was my hope that she and the others could manage to slip away somehow perhaps climbing to the catwalk and dropping over the side of the palisade to the ground below i saw then the forkbeard one hand on the arm of the strange giant rollo leading him to the door of the small room rollo though the room about him was frenzied wlth kurii and their killing did not seem disturbed his eyes were vacant he was led like a child to the small room i noted that his ax which he always carried was bloodied the blood of kurii like that of men is red and of simllar chemical composition it is another similarity adduced by priestkings when they wish to argue the equivalence of the warring species the major difference between the blood content of the kur and of men is that the plasma of the kur contains a greater percentage of salt this acting in water primarily as a protein solvent the kur can eat and digest quantities of meat which would kill a man rollo disappeared within the small room from my right i heard the scream of a bondmaid i saw a kur leash her he pulled her struggling by the neck choking to a place to the left of the door there there waited another kur who held in his tentacled hand the leashes of more than twenty bondmaids who knelt terrified about its legs the kur who had leashed his catch then handed the leash to the other kur who accepted it addmg it to the others the girl knelt swiftly among the others i knew human females were regarded as delicacies by kurii the kur who had taken the girl then took another leash from the interior of his shield where there were several wrapped about the shield straps and surveyed the hall a girl kneeling in the dirt near the long fire saw him and ran screaming away methodically moving her toward a corner of the hall leash swinging he followed her behind me i heard the blows of axes i fought to free myself of the throng the axes behind me were the axes of men and strikin on wood turning i saw svein blue tooth and four others trying to splinter their way from the hall they had difficulty though for many men pressed against them i saw ivar forkbeard nearby he had not chosen to escape his sword was drawn but it would prove of little efficacy against the great metal shields the sweeping axes of the kurii they could cut a man down before he could approach them even with the long blade of the north the forkbeard looked about there had been more than a thousand men in the hall surely at least two or three hundred lay dead most at the walls at the foot of the walls under the weapons which for the most part they had been unable to touch saw the kur who had pursued the bondmaid now again gomg toward that holding area near the door on her back then on her side then on her stomach rolling and squirming eyes wild her fingers hooked inside the collar trying to keep it from choking her was dragged the bondmaid then her leash was surrendered into the keeping of the kur who held the others and then the first kur leaving his prize in the care of the other turned about to hunt yet another delicacy from the herd within the hall the kurii now on both sides stood between us and the weapons the side doors leading from the hall were now all closed to us kurii too stood before the entrance to the hall axes ready eyes fiaming we were some six or seven hundred men crowded together effectively surrounded at our backs was the western wall of the hall clear rooml cried svein blue tooth let us use our axes trying to draw back from the kurii approaching slowly great blood axes ready terrified men pushed back further and further i managed to free myself from the crowd and take a position on its fringe between men and kurii if i were cut down i would prefer it to be in a situation where i might move freely i unsheathed my sword i saw the lips of one of the kurii drawing back your blade is useless said ivar forkbeard now standing at my side the kurii crept closer i heard a scream from a height and looking up saw a human thrown from the balcony which ringed the hall some thirty feet above the dirt floor some ten feet below the roof beams i saw then that kurii held the balcony i did not think they would long delay finishing us the smoke was thick in the hall men choked men coughed i saw too the nostrils of the kurii closing to narrow slits sparks fell in their fur i brushed asde one of the hanging vessels of bronze a tharlarionoil lamp which on its chain hung from the ceiling some forty feet above it is such that it can be raised ancl lowered by a side chain spears cried ivar we need spears but there were few spears in the fearmaddened terrified crowd of men cringing back from the beasts what spears there were could not be thrown because of the press to one side i saw the kur with the golden band on its arm at the side of its mouth were saliva and blood the fur matted it looked at me i knew then it was my enemy we had found one another an ax struck toward me it had been wielded by the kur whose lips had drawn back i darted to one side the ax buried itself in the dirt i found myself within the beasts guard i thrust the blade to its hilt into the chest of the beast it gave a puzzled snarl which i heard jerking the blade free only as i leaped back the other kurii looked at it puzzled then it fell into the dirt there was silence save for the crackling of flames the horror of what i had done then was understood by the leader of the kurii a kur has been killed attack cried ivar forkbeard attack are you docile tarsk that you dare not attack men of torvaldsland attack but no man moved mere humans they dared not set themselves agamst kurll they would rather helpless await their slaughter they could not move so struck with terror they were the body of the dead kur inert lay heavy crooked in the dirt the bloodied ax was to one side the shield arm was twisted in one of the straps the other strap was broken the eyes of the leader of the kurii whom i knew to be my enemy blazed upon me his horror seeing his fallen brother of the killing blood had now become rage outrage i one of the herd of the cattle had dared to strike one of the master species a superior form of life a kur had been killed i set myself again in the hall of svein blue tooth rang the blood shriek of the kurii on each side of the leader plunging toward us howling swept kurii too they pressed in from the sides axes falling i do not choose to speak in detail of what followed kurii themselves axes like sheets of iron rain shattered that fearful throng splitting it into hundreds of screaming fragments of terror a man not more than a yard from me was cut half in two from the head to the belt in one stroke i managed as the kur was twisting his ax trying to free it of the body to drive my blade through its neck under the left ear i saw ivar forkbeard his sword gone lost in the body of a nearby kur his knife in his hand one hand thrusting away and upward the jaws of a kur repeatedly plunge his knife into the huge chest of the beast there was uneven footing in the hall we slipped in the blood it filled the pit of the long fire it was splashed about our trousers and turucs near one wall i yanked a spear free from the hands of a fallen manatarms momentarily i sickened at the sight of the exposed lungs sucking air the hand scratching at the wall beside him i hurled the spear it had a shaft of seven foot gorean a head of tapered bronze some eighteen inches in length at close range it can pierce a southern shield shatter its point through a seveninch beam it passed half through the body of a kur its ax fell my act had saved a man but in the next instant he had fallen beneath the ax of another i pressed my back against the wall a beam fell burning from the roof at the southeastern corner of the hall i heard bondmaids screaming kurii looked upward their nostrils were shut against the smoke the eyes of many of them commonly blackpupiled yellowish in the cornea seemed red swollen veined i saw one suflering in the smoke and sparks look up from feeding and then again thrust his head down to the meat clothes torn away from the chest on which it was feeding i saw ivar forkbeard with a spear set himself against the charge of an unarmed kur he set the butt of the spear deep in the earth behind him the spears shaft gouged a trench six inches deep behind him and then stopped and the kur biting in the air eyes like fire backed away and fell backward ivar leaped away as another ax sought him i saw across the room the leader of the kurii it with the golden band on its arm i recalled its words on the platform of the assembly in the field of the thing in rage it had cried a thousand of you can die beneath the claws of a single kur there were perhaps now no more than a hundred or a hundred and fifty men left alive in the hall follow me cried svein blue tooth his ax and those of his men had shattered through the rear of the hall like panicstricken urts thirtyfive or forty men thrust through the hole sometimes jamming themselves momentarily within it some tearing the flesh from their bodies and the sides of their faces on the splintered wood hurry hurry cried the blue tooth his garments were half torn from him but still about his neck on its chain was the tooth of the hunjer whale dyed blue by which men in torvaldsland knew him svein thrust two more of his men through the aperture kurii were between me and the opening ivar forkbeard and others too were similarly cut off another beam fell flaming and smoking from the roof striking into the dirt floor and leaning against the wall the hangings which had decorated the hall were now gone burned away the walls scorched behind them the only portion of the wall that was clearly afire however and threatening to cave in was the eastern edge of the southern wall i saw ten kurii leap to the back of the hall to where svein blue tooth and his men had made their opening to prevent the escape of others they stood before the opening axes lifted snarling one man who approached too closely was slashed to the spine with a sweep of the bluish ax one who begged mercy in the center of the hall was cut in twain the blade of the ax driving into the very dirt itself emerging covered with dirt and blood streaked with ash the lamps cried the forkbeard to me red hair he cried the lamps another beam from the roof burning dropped heavily to the floor of the hall i saw the kur who held the leashes of the caught bondmaids dragging the girls from the hall he held the leashes several in each hand of more than forty catches the collars were of thick leather with metal insert locks flat tnetal bolts slipping locking into spring catches when closed two rectangular metal plates adjoined sewn into each collar was a light welded metal ring about this was closed the leash snap the action of the leash snap was mechanical but apparently it was beyond the strength of a woman to open it the leashes were some fifteen feet in length allowing in this radius one kur to hold several captives at once the kur left the hall screaming stumbling helplessly the caught women followed their beast master i saw kurii methodically blow after blow striking the fallen lest any might have sought to hide among the dead some men tangled in the bodies screamed the axes falling upon them the wounded too were methodically dispatched i observed the patterns they were regular linear of narrow width no body was missed the kurii i realized were efficient they were of course intelligent they were of course like men rational animals one man leaped screaming to his feet and ran he was cut down immediately running almost headlong into a kur one of the kurii set before the killing line to intercept such fugitives men it seemed to me could be no match for such animals kurii now encircled the group of men near the western wall of the hall most of them moaned crying out with misery many fell to their knees i saw two kurii turn in my direction i saw ivar forkbeard standing among the huddled men near the western wajl of the hall he was easily visible being one of the few standing he looked red and terrible in the reflection of the flames the veins on his forehead looked like red cables his eyes almost like those of the kurii themselves blazed his long sword now again in his hand which he had recovered from the body of the kur in which he had left it was again bloodied and freshly so his left sleeve was torn away there were claw marks on his neck on your feet he cried to the men on your feet do battle but even those who stood seemed numb with terror are you of torvaldsland he asked do battle do battle but no man dared to move in the presence of kurii they seemed only cattle i saw the lips of kurii draw back i saw axes lift then again the forkbeards voice through the smoke the sparks suddenly half choking drifted across the hall to me the lamps he cried again as he had before red hair he cried the lamps then i understood him as i had not before the tharlarionoil lamps on their chains hanging from rings on the roof beams the apertures in the ceiling of the hall through which smoke might pass he had intended that i would escape but i had played kaissa with him first i called the forkbeard i would not leave without him we had played kaissa you are a fool he cried i have not yet learned to break thejarls axs gambit i rejoined i sheathed my sword i leaned back casually against the wall my arms were folded fool he cried he looked about at the men who could not fight who could not move who could not stir he slammed his sword into its sheath and leaped up seizing one of the lamps on its chain the two kurii who had turned toward me now lifted their axes i turned over the table behind which i stood the two axes hit the heavy beams simultaneously exploding wood in great chunks between the walls shattering it as high as the ceiling itself i vaulted the table i heard the startled snarls of the kurii then i had my hands on one of the large swinging bronze lamps oil spilled flamed from the wick i swung wildly my right sleeve caught afire i heard a kur below me scream with pain i looked down and hauled myself up to avoid the stroke of an ax one kur reeled about the left side of its furred head wet drenched in oil was aflame it screamed hideously it clawed at its left eye hand over hand i crawled up the chain then the chain shook wildly i struggled to hold it the fire at my right sleeve snapped back and forth i lost my breath i feared my neck would break blood was on the chain i held it kurii howled beneath me i moved further up the chain then the chain stretched down taut an ax flew wheeling past half cutting into one of the crossbeams in the roof i climbed higher then suddenly i realized why the chain had been pulled taut the beam above me creaked the chain was now tight like a cable the links strained grating on one another it now bore besides mine the weight of a kur rapidly climbing the ring above me through which the chain passed pulled part way from the wood i scrambled up the last few feet of the chain i threw my arm over the beam i felt claws seize at my leg then close about it i released the beam screaming the war cry of koroba falling tearing and ripping with fingers and teeth about the neck and head of the startled kur stiffened fingers like daggers drove at its eyes my teeth tore at the veins in its wrist in the arm that held the chain in that instant the kur realized and i realized too for the first time that there were on the surface of gor animals as savage as its kind slighter animals smaller weaker but no less vicious in their way no less terrible fending me away screaming biting it released me but i clung about its shoulders and neck i bit through half of its ear i pulled myself up to the beam an orifice red projecting fangs like white nails stretched below me i drew the sword and as it climbed eyes bleeding ear torn after me i cut away its hand it fell back growing smaller until it struck heavily on the reeded earth stained with its churned reddish mud forty feet below it broke its neck i tore away the flarning sleeve of my garment and thrust it on the sword point into the face of the next kur the hand of the first still clung to the chain with its six multiple jointed fingers the kur with a shake of its head dislodged the burning cloth and pulled its pierced face from the sword it bit at the sword cutting its mouth it reached to the beam i cut at the fingers it lost its balance it too fell backward come i heard i saw the forkbeard on a nearby beam hurry he cried i choked in the smoke i thrust at the next kur driving the blade through its ear into the brain part of the roof fell away tumbling burning to the ground below hurry i heard as though from far away i cut down at the next kur it snarled grasping for me the ring through which the chain passed unable to bear longer the weight of kurii splintered free of the wood i saw the ring and chain dart downward four kurii climbing two leaping free two clinging to the chain fell to the earth below another portion of the roof fell not more than twenty feet from me below covered with sparks scarcely visible in the smoke i saw kurii looking up cheated of their prey a beam fell not more than a dozen fee from them their leader uttered some sound to them his eyes blazing looked up at me about his left arm was the spiral golden band then he with the others turned abou and swiftly shambling some looking back fled the hall i sheathed my sword hurry cried the forkbeard i leaped from beam to beam to join him after him i squeezed through one of the smoke holes in the roof of the burning hall then we were standing on the woodenshingled blaz lng roof of the hall of svein blue tooth i looked up and saw the stars and moons of gor follow me cried ivar in the distance i saw the torvaldsberg there was moonlight reflecting from its snows he sped to the northwesl corner of the hall he disappeared over the edge of the roof i looked over and saw him in the moonlight making his way downward hand by hand foot by foot using the clefts projections and niches in the ornate carvings of the exterior corner beams of the blue tooths hall swiftly my arm scorched from the fire which had torn at my sleeve hear pounding breathing heavily i followed him chapter on the height of the torvaldsberg it was noon on the snowy slopes of the torvaldsberg ivar and i looked behind us we could see them following four of them like black dots let us rest said ivar i shut my eyes against the glare of the sun on the snow he sat down with his back against a rock i too sat down crosslegged as a warrior sits we had climbed down from the roof of the blue tooths burning hall using the projections and relief of the ornately carved corner beams climbing down i had seen kurii moving about but near the front of the hall in the light of the burning hall here and there scattered in the dirt of the courtyard we saw sprawled scattered bodies and parts of bodies some kurii squatting among them fed in one corner of the stockade huddled together their white bodies now stripped red in the light of the flames were the bondmaids in their leather collars leashed the straps in the furred fists of their master several kurii not feeding carrying shields axes moved to and fro we dropped to the courtyard unseen we slipped behind the hall keeping where possible buildings between us and the yard we reached the palisade climbed to its catwalk and unnoticed leaped over i opened my eyes and looked down into the valley the four dots were larger now the forkbeard after our escape from the stockade of svein blue tooth had been intent upon reaching his camp it had been dangerous furtive work to our astonishment the countryside was swarming with kurii i could not conjecture their numbers there might have been hundreds there might have been thousands they seemed everywhere twice we were pursued but in the midst of the scents and distracted by fresh blood our pursuers turned aside we saw at one point two kurii fighting over a body sometimes we threw ourselves to the ground among the fallen once a kur passed within a yard of my hand it howled with pleasure at the moons and then was gone as many as four or five times we crept within yards of feeding kurii oblivious to our presence the attack had been simultaneously launched obviously on the hall and the surrounding thingcamps even more to our astonishment than the kurii and their numbers about was the presence of men wearing yellow scarves among them men whom they did not attack my fists clenched in rage kurii as is often the case had enlisted human allies look had said the forkbeard pointing from a height on which we lay prone to the beach offshore some few yards among the other ships lay new ships many of them strange ships they lay black rocking on the sparkling water one ship was prominent among them it was large it had eighty oars black sleen said ivar the ship of thorgard of scagnar there were hundreds of kurii between us and the ships ivar and i had looked at one another we now understood the meaning of the kur we had seen on black sleen long ago who had accompanied thorgard of scagnar into his holding we had seen the beast from the darkness from our longboat when we were escaping scagnar thorgards daughter hooded and secured bound hand and foot lying between our feet kurii are land animls not fond of water in their march south the fleet of thorgard of scagnar would cover their western flank more importantly it would give them the means of communication with the gorean islands and if desirable a means whereby their invasion might be accomplished the fleet further could if necessary provision the advancing horde and if necessary if danger should threaten evacuate large portions of it the kurii march would have its sea arm its naval support kurii as i have indicated are rational animals the strategies seemed elementary but sound the full extent of the strategy however i suspected was known only on the steel worlds the steel worlds in space on which it had doubtless been constructed and from which perhaps it might be conducted if kurii native to gor could within the laws of priestkngs not violating technology restrictions much advance the kurii cause on the planet those on the ships had little to lose and much to gain it was even possible that priestkings a usually consistent form of life might permit the kurii conquest of gor rather than surrender their accustomed neutrality i could imagine the words on misks translator one after the other ticked off mechanically we have given our word but if priestkings eventually should halt the invasion that too might be of interest to the kurii of the steel ships remote prowling outside the fifth ring that of the planet on earth called jupiter that on gor called hersius after one of ars legendary heroes not only would the decision to halt the invasion be in violation of the practices and commitments of priestkings which would doubtless create dissension in the nest producing a leverage the kurii might be able to exploit but if the invasion were halted it being a large movement complex its termination might provide useful data on the nature and disposition of the powers of the priestkings it might provide the equivalent of drawing a snipersfire using a dupe or fool to do so in order to ascertain his position in the nest war when the priestkings had been locked in internecine warfare their powers had been severely reduced and disrupted the nest itself had been severely damaged i knew that ships of priestkings flew but i knew little of their numbers or power or of the retained power in general of the delicate tall golden masters of gor i thought it quite likely that they would be unable to resist a fullscale invasion probes i had learned from misk had become increasingly frequent slave raids on earth i recalled had become a matter of course routine these were small matters in the scope of planetary politics but were indicative in just the past few days we had encountered even in far torvaldsland two earth females suitably collared peggy stevens of connecticut honey cake and the girl leah of canada the movements of kurii and their allies were becoming bolder their boldest move had begun most recently the gathering of the gorean kurii the initiation of the march to the south the incursion into lands of human habitation the beginning of the invasion from the north this was the boldest and most fearful probe of the kurii of the ships directed toward humans but doubtless in fact a testing of the will and nature of priestkings their true foes if priestkings permitted the conquest of gor perhaps over a generation or two by kurii they would have lost the security of their own base they would become an island in the midst of a hostile sea it would then be a matter of tirne until the end until adequate weaponry could be smuggled to gor or built upon it to destroy them this would now be no simple matter of policing primitive weapons crude attempts at the art of gunnery or explosives but of protecting themselves against perfected weapons of great technological power sooner or later if gor fell to native kurii those of the ships would destroy the denizens of the sardar earth too then would inevitably fall earth was so proud it had managed to put a handful of men for a few hours on the surface of its moon the kurii for more than twenty thousand years at least had possessed deepspace capability ivar had motioned me to silence we lay still within yards of us strung out approaching was a column of pairs of men each wearing a yellow scarf some carried torches kurii were not among them they were led by a large man in swirling cape and horned helmet a bearded man it was thorgard of scagnar he too tied at his shoulder wore a yellow scarf they passed would we not move about more freely inquired ivar forkbeard if we too sported scarves of yellow it is not impossible i said let us borrow some then suggested he very well i agreed two shadows enveloped the last two men in the column of pairs led by thorgard of scagnar ivar had thrust the yellow scarf into his belt i looped mine over the right shoulder fastening it loosely at the left hip we left thorgards two men for the kurii in the journey to ivars tent a kur loomed before us snarling foolish beast stupid animal said ivar brandishing his scarf can you not see the yellow scarf he then brushed past the kur i felt its fur as i moved by it it was smooth not unpleasant to the touch some two inches or so in depth its body beneath the fur was hot large the kur doubtless could not understand gorean if it had it might have slain us both it could see the scarf however reluctantly snarling it let us pass it shortly thereafter ivar fists clenched stood on the site of his camp the tent had been half burned and poles were down it was deserted there was no sign of life boxes lay about an overturned pan lay in ashes we saw spilled coins a piece of rope cut lay to one side the stake to which the chains of the bondmaids had been fixed had been torn from the ground look i said to him throwing back a part of the tent ivar joined me we looked down on the carcass of a dead kur its jaws opened its eyes staring at the moons its head was half cut from its body some man of mine did well said the forkbeard then he look about in the morning i said we will be recognized as not being of thorgards forces in the morning we will be hunted it is quite possible said ivar looking at me that we are being hunted now by those from the hall our scent is known i said yellow scarves will not protect us from those from the hall what do you propose asked ivar we must flee i told him no said ivar we must go to the torvaldsberg i do not understand i said it is time he said he looked about himself at the ruins of his camp in the distance we could see buring tents too in the distance there was a great redness in the sky beneath this redness blirned the hall of svein blue tooth far off we could hear the howls of kurii it is time said ivar forkbeard turning away from me to go to the torvaldsberg he strode from his camp i followed him it was shortly past noon on the snowy slopes of the torvaldsberg i looked down into the valley we could not make out clearly the lineaments of the kurii pursuing us they moved rapidly they were perhaps a pasang and a halfaway they carried shlelds axes let us continue our journey said ivar shall we meet them here i asked no said ivar let us continue our journey i looked up at the looming crags of the torvaidsberg it is madness to attempt to climb i said we do not have ropes equipment neither of us are of the mountain people i looked back the kurii were now a pasang away on the rocky lower slopes scrambling upward they had slung thelr shields and axes on their backs when they came to a sheet of steep ice they did not go around it but extending thelr claws climbed it rapidly the forkbeard and i had lost several ehn in circling such obstacles in snow the kurii spreading their large sixdigited appendages dropped to all fours for their weight they did not sink deeply it had taken the forkbeard and me an ahn wading through crusts of snow to reach our present position kurii it was evident would accomplish the same distance in a much shorter time when snow gave way to patches of rock they would pause momentarily nostrils lowered reading signs that would have been undetectable to a human then they would lift their heads scan the rocks above them and proceed swiftly ivar forkbeard stood up there was no cover now for us between our present position and the beginning of the steeper heights below us we heard kurii seeing him howl with pleasure one pointed us out to a fourth who had not yet seen us then all of them stood below leaping lifting their arms they are pleased i said the kurii then with redoubled speed began to move toward us let us continue our journey suggested the forkbeard my foot slipped and i hung by the hands from the rocky ledge then i had my footing again the sun struck the cliff my fingers ached my feet were cold from the ice the snow but the upper part of my body sweated move only one hand or a foot at a time said ivar it was now the twelfth hour two ahn past the gorean noon i would not look down a rock struck near me shattering into the granite of the mountain scarring it it must have been the size of a tarsk startled i almost lost my grip i tried to remain calm i heard a kur climbing below me the torvaldsberg is all things considered an extremely dangerous mountain yet it is clearly not unscalable as i learned without equipment it has the shape of a spear blade broad which has been bent near the tip it is something over four and a half pasangs in height or something over seventeen thousand earth feet it is not the highest mountain on gor but it is one of the most dramatic and most impressive it is also in its fearful way beautiful i followed as closely as i could the forkbeard it did not take me long to understand that he knew well what he was dolng he seemed to have an uncanny sense for locating tiny ledges and cuts in the stone which were almost invisible from even two or three feet below kurii are excellent climbers well fitted for this activity with their multiple jointed hands and feet their long fingers thelr suddenly extendable claws but they followed us nonetheless with difficulty i suspected why this was it must have been about the fourteenth ahn when ivar reached down and helped me to a ledge i was breathing heavily kurii he said cannot reach this ledge by the same route why i asked the hand holds said he are too shallow their weight hand holds i asked yes said he surely you have noticed their convemence i looked at him more than once i had almost slipped down the escarpment and you have noticed how they have become shallower i noticed the climbing was more difficult i admitted you seem to know the mountain well i told him ivar smiled it had been no accident that he had seemed to have an uncanny knack for locating an ascent path where none seemed to promise you have been here before i told him yes he said as a boy i climbed the torvaldsberg you spoke of hand holds i said i cut them he said it then seemed to me no wonder that he had moved with such confidence on the escarpment i had suspected earlier that he knew the mountain this facilitating our ascent and that this explained why the pursuing kurii natively better climbers than men could do little better than keep our pace if that i had not suspected however that the forkbeard was taking advantage of a previously wrought path and one which in part at least he had made for himself in years past the forkbeard leaned back grinning he rubbed his hands his fingers were cold we heard some sixty feet below us a kur scraping with its claws on the mountain below us feeling for crevices or chinks this ledge said the forkbeard is a kur trap in my youth i was hunted by a kur in this vicinity it had trailed me for two days i took to the mountain it was sufficiently unwise to follow me i chose and cut a path which it might follow to the last twenty feet for the last twenty feet i cut shallow holds in the surface adequate for a man climbing carefully but too shallow for the fingers of a kur below us i heard a snarl of frustration as a boy thus said ivar i slew my first kur he rose to his feet he went to a corner of the ledge where heaped there were several large stones the stones i then gathered are still here he said i found several on the ledge some i found higher i did not envy the kur below i looked over the edge it is still climbing i whispered i drew my sword it would not be difficult to prevent the animal from reaching the ledge by any direct route it is stupid said the forkbeard behind the first kur some feet below was a second two others were far down the slope where it was less sheer the two closest to us had left their weapons below with the others the first kur was some eight or ten feet below us when suddenly it slipped on the rock and with a wild shriek scratching at the stone slid some four feet downward and then plunged backward turning in the air howling and some five ihn later struck the rocks far below the hand holds said ivar were not cut to be deep enough to support the weight of a kur the second kur was some twentyfive feet below it looked up snarling the rock hurled by ivar struck it from the almost vertical wall of stone it like its confrere fell to the rocks below the trap laid for an enemy by a boy of torvaldsland many years ago was still effective i admired ivar forkbeard even in his youth he had been resourceful cunning even as a boy he had been a dangerous foe in guile and wit the match even for an adult kur the other two kurii crouched below on the slopes looking up they carried their shields their axes on their back they made no attempt to approach us our position was not now a desirable one we were isolated on a ledge here there was not food nor water we could with some climbing obtain ice or snow but there was no food in time we would weaken be unable to climb well as hunters kurii were patient beasts if these had fed well before taking up our pursuit they would not need food for days i had little doubt they had fed well there had been much available meat there was little possibility of leaving the ledge undetected kurii have superb night vision furthermore it would be extremely dangerous to attempt to move on the torvaldsberg in the night it was extremely dangerous even in full daylight i rubbed my hands together and blew on them my feet too were cold the sweat in my shirt now that i was not climbing was frozen the shirt was stiff cold in the night on the torvaldsberg even in the middle of the summer without warm garments a man might freeze the wind then began to rise sweeping the ledge from where we stood we could see the black ruins of svein blue tooths hall and holdings the desolated thing fields the sea thassa with the ships at the beach i looked at the forkbeard let us continue our journey he said let us descend and meet the kurii while we still have strength i said let us continue our journey he said moving carefully he began to climb i followed him after perhaps half an ahn i looked back the two kurii by a parallel route were following that night on the torvaldsberg we did not freeze we huddled on a ledge between rocks sheltered from the wind shivering with cold miserable listening for kurii but they did not approach we had chosen our ledge well twice rocks rained down to the ledge but we were protected by an overhang would you like to hear me sing asked ivar yes i said it might drive the kurii away undeterred by my sarcasm brilliant though it was ivar broke into song he knew it seemed a great many songs no more rocks rained down to the ledge song you see said ivar soothes even kurii more likely i said they have withdrawn from earshot you jest delightfully acknowledged the forkbeard i had not thought it in you yes i admitted i will teach you a song he said and we shall sing lt together the song dealt with the problems of a man attempting to content one hundred bondmaids one after the other it is rather repetitious and the number of bondmaids decreases by one in each round needless to say it is a song which is not swiftly dispatched i have incidentally a very fine singing voice in singing we little noticed the cold yet toward dawn we took turns napping we will need our strength said the forkbeard how marvelous in the morning seemed the sun if the kurii are above us i said recalling the rain of stones is this not out opportunity to descend kurii corner their pray said the forkbeard in the light they will be below us they will wish to keep between us and escape further we would have little opportunity to escape even if they were above us the descent is difficult i recalled the two kurii precariously clinging to the wall of rock one of which had fallen attempting to reach us the other of which ivar had struck from the wall with a heavy stone i shuddered there they are said ivar looking over the brink he waved to them then he turned cheerily to me let us continue our journey he said you speak i said as though you had some objective i do said the forkbeard again we began climbing not long after we had again taken to the rocks we heard and saw the kurii some two hundred feet below and to one side following us it was shortly after the tenth hour the gorean noon that we reached the peak of the torvaldsberg although there is much snow on the heights of the torvaldsberg there were also on the peak many areas of bare rock swept by the wind which on the peak seems almost constant i crossed a patch of snow ankle deep crusted to ascend a snowfree rounded rock i cannot express the beauty of the view from the torvaldsberg i have climbed it i thought and i am here there had been danger there had been the struggle the challenge and then here suddenly torturously purchased humbling me exalting me was a victory which i felt was not mine so much as that of a world that of vision that of beauty i had not conquered a mountain the mountain when i had paid its price that i might understand the value of the gift had lifted me to where i might see how insignificant i was and how beautiful and precious was reality and life and the sun on a bleak cold land ivar stood beside me not speaking you were here once i said as a boy yes said ivar i have never forgotten it did you come here to die i asked no he said but i have been unable to find it i looked at him puzzled i could not find it beforehe said i cannot find it now what i asked it does not matter nowhe said he turned about approaching were the two kurii we watched them they too interestingly stopped they stood together in the snow looking out over the world then they regarded us we loosened our weapons the kurii unslung their shields their axes we drew our swords the kurii fixed on their left arms the heavy rounded iron shields took the great axes seven feet in length grasped some two feet from the bottom of the handle in their massive right fists i had never thought much of it before but kurii like men were dominantly right handed i conjectured then that like men the left hemisphere of their brains were dominant ivar and i leaped from the rock the two kurii one to each of us approached their ears were laid back they were cautious they leaned slightly forward shambling crouching priestkings i recalled regarded kurii and men as rather equivalent species similar products of similar processes of evolution similar products of similarly cruel selections though on worlds remote from one another kur i wondered are you my brother the great ax swept toward me i rolled over it hitting the snow slipping i tried to drive in to thrust with my blade i slipped again the ax fell where i had been a piece of granite shattered from the rock stung me i stumbled backward the kur not hurrying ax ready stalked me i saw its eyes over the shield the ax light in its great fist hah i cried feinting as though to charge the ax tensed but did not swing then it snarled and drew back the ax to the full length of its long arm i knew the blade could not reach me in time i charged it was what the kur desired i had been outwitted the heavy shield with fantastic force with a sidelong motion a sweep struck me fending me away hurtling me for forty feet through the air i struck snow rolling halfblinded the ax fell again shattering granite i was on my feet again the shield struck me like a hammer the striking surface of which is more than a yard across again i was hurled to one side i stumbled to my feet i could not move my left arm i thought it broken the shoulder was like wood the ax swung again i stumbled back crying out i lost my balance turning and plunged from the peak i fell to a ledge twenty feet below the ax like a pendulum swept down i hugged the surface of the ledge the ax swept past me i saw to my right a small dark opening irregular jagged about a foot in width and height i leaped to my feet and ran to the brink of the edge there was no descent the lips of the kur drew back revealing the fangs i saw ivar on the flat above wildeyed ivarl i cried ivar i heard the blood shriek of an unseen kur ivar turned and leaped to the ledge below joining me the two kurii stood on the flat above snarling look i cried to him indicating the opening his eyes saw the opening they glinted i moved the fingers of my left hand there was feeling i did not know if the arm were broken or not i thrust the sword into its scabbard ivar nodded one of the kurii snarling leaped to the ledge with us i hurled a rock at it the rock struck the shield bounding with a clang away down into the abyss i thrust the forkbeard toward the hole he leaped to it and squirmed through the second kur dropped to the ledge i threw another rock weightier than the first it too with a sound of granite on metal was fended away this time by the shield of the second kur i leaped to the hole and forced my body through the opening the forkbeard caught my hand and dragged me inside one of the long arms of a kur thrust inside reaching for us the forkbeard thrust at it with his sword but the blade was diverted his arm striking against stone the kur withdrew its arm we crawled back further in the tiny opening outside we could see the heads of the two kurii peering within their tentacled paws felt the width of the opening one of them thrust his head within and half a shoulder the forkbeard sword poised crawled to thrust at it the kur withdrew then both of them squatted down some feet out on the ledge kurii are patient hunters they would wait i rubbed my left arm and shoulder i lifted the arm and moved it it was not broken i had learned that the kur shield could be as devastating a weapon as the war hammer of hunjer i wondered how many who had learned that had lived i looked outside the kurii were waiting come with me said ivar his voice was excited i turned to face him i wondered how deep might be this little cave i expected not more than twenty or thirty feet at most on my hands and knees i crawled to join him here said ivar on the wall he took my fingers and pressed them to the wall i felt marks rather vertical with angular extensions you have found it he cried you have found it tarl red hair i do not understand i said follow me whispered ivar forkbeard follow me chapter the war arrow following the forkbeard on hands and knees i crawled down the narrow passage at one point turning to my left side to slide through a narrow aperture within this aperture i extended my hands and then carefully hands held up feeling i stood up to one side i heard the forkbeard fumbling about in the darkness i heard the strike of two small pieces of iron pyrite on one another taken from the forkbeards belt wallet and saw a scattering of sparks then it was dark again there is cut moss against the edge said the forkbeard there was another scattering of sparks this time the sparks fell into a heap one of several each about five inches high and four inches wide of miniscule lacelike moss twigs this tinder flared immediately into flame in that instant i saw we were in a large squared passage i saw a torch in a ring one of others there was carving in the passage rune letterings and pictographs in linear borders before the bit of flaring moss turned to a million red pin points the forkbeard took one of the torches and thrust it to the moss i saw that near some of the patches of moss were pieces of flint and steel near others tiny piles of iron pyrites i shivered the forkbeard lifted the torch i too took a torch neither of us spoke the passage extended beyond us disappearing in the darkness beyond the light of our torches it was about eight feet in height and width it was carved from the living rock along its edges spaced some twelve feet from one another on both sides were torch rings with unlit torches which might be lit the piles of tinder and flint and steel or iron pyrites lay now behind us or to one side i lifted the torch to the borders running linearly down the chamber disappearing into the darkness before us the lettering was in the high angular script of the north the pictographs seemed primitive these are old runes said ivar can you read them i asked no said ivar my hair rose on the back of my neck i looked at one of the pictographs it was a man astride a quadruped look said i to the forkbeard interesting said the forkbeard it is a representation of a man riding a mythological beast doubtless an illustration based upon some saga with which i am unfamiliar he continued on i lingered by the pictograph i had seen nothing like it on gor follow me said the forkbeard i left the pictograph to follow him i wondered on the man who had carved it it was indeed old perhaps ancient it was drawn by one who had been familiar with a world unknown to ivar forkbeard there was no mistaking the quadruped on which the rider was mounted it was a horse the passage now enlarged we felt lost in it it was still squarish some twenty feet in height and width it was now much more decorated and carved than it had been and in the light of the torches we could see that much color had been used in its decoration pictographs were much more numerous now and instead of being linearly bordered the walls were now decorated in columns of runes and designs and pictographs torches unlit in wall rings were still illuminated as we passed near them many of the columns carved with painted surfaces on the walls reminded me of rune stones these stones incidentally are normally quite colorful and can often be seen at great distances each year their paint is freshened commonly on the vigil of the vernal equinox which in the north as commonly in the south marks the new year religious rune stones are repainted by runepriests on the vigil of the festseason of odin which on gor takes place in the fall if the stones were not tended either by farmers on whose lands they lie or by villagers in whose locales they lie or by runepriests in a few years the paint would be gone leaving only the plain stone the most famous rune stone in the north is that on einars skerry which marks the northlands southern border can you not read these runes i asked ivar again i am not a runepriest he said ivars reply was not a little belligerent i knew him able to read some rune markings i gathered that these perhaps because of antiquity or dialect were beyond him ivars attitude toward reading was not unlike that of many of the north he had been taught some rune signs as a boy that he could understand important stones for in these stones were the names of mighty men and songs of their deeds but it had not been expected of him that he would be in any sense a fluent reader ivar like many of those in the north was a passable reader but took care to conceal this fact he belonged to the class of men who could hire their reading done for them much as he could buy thralls to do his farming it was not regarded as dignified for a warrior to be too expert with letters such being a task beneath warriors to have a scribes skills would tend to embarrass a man of arms and tend to lower his prestige among his peers many of the north then were rather proud of their illiteracy or semlilliteracy it was expected ofthem it honored them his tools were not the pen and parchment but the sword the bow the ax and spear besides simple runes the boy in the north is also taught tallying counting addition and subtraction for such may be of use in trading or on the farm he is also taught weighing much of his education of course consists in being taken into a house and taught arms hunting and the sea he profits too from the sagas which the skalds sing journeying from hall to hall in the festseason of odin a fine skald is difficult to bring to ones hall one rnust bid high sometimes they are kidnapped and after the seasons singing given much gold and freed i had not of course intended to insult the forkbeard there is one sign here of course said the forkbeard which any fool might read he pointed to the sign i had seen it frequently in the writings naturally i could not read it what does it say i asked do you truly not know he asked no i said i do not know he turned away and again i followed him we lit new torches from the wall rings and discarded our old ones we then continued on our journey now to one side and the other we passed opened chests in which we could see treasures the spillings and tangles of coins and jewelries rings bracelets we came then to a great arch which marked the entrance to a vast room lost in darkness beyond the flickering spheres of our uplifted torches we stopped over the arch deeply incised in the stone was the single mighty sign that which the forkbeard had not explained to me we stood in silence in that dark lofty threshold the forkbeard was trembling i had never seen him so the hair on the back of my neck lifted short stiff i felt cold i knew of course the legends he lifted his torch to the sign over the door do you not know that sign he asked i know what sign it must be i said what sign asked he the sign the namesign of torvald yes said he i shuddered torvald i said to the forkbeard is only a figure of legend each country has its legendary heroes its founders its discoverers its mythic giants this said the forkbeard looking up at the sign is the chamber of torvald he looked at me we have found it he said there is no torvald i said torvald does not exist this said the forkbeard is his chamber his voice shook torvald said he sleeps in the torvaldsberg and has done so for a thousand years he waits to be wakened when his land needs him he shall awake he shall then lead us in battle again he will lead the men of the north there is no torvald i said the forkbeard looked within for a thousand years he whispered has he slept torvald does not exist i said we must waken him said the forkbeard ivar forkbeard lifting his torch entered the great chamber i felt grief it seemed to me not impossible that at the root of the legends the sagas of torvald there might be some particles of truth i did not think it impossible that there had once been a torvald one who had come to this land with followers perhaps more than a thousand years ago he might have been a great leader a mighty warrior the first of the jarls of the north but that had been if it had ever been more than a thousand years ago there was now no torvald i felt grief at what misery what disappoint ment what disillusionment must now fall to my friend the forkbeard in his hope to find one strong enough to stand against kurii one who could rally the men of the north he was bound to be disillusioned the myth that dream of succor of final recourse would be shown barren fraudulent this chamber i knew had been built by men and the passages carved from the very stone of the mountain itself that must be accounted for but it was not difficult to do so perhaps there had once been a torvald hundreds of years ago if so it was not impossible that it had been his wish to be interred in the great mountain we stood perhaps within or at the brink of the tomb of torvald lost for long ages until now until we two fleeing from kurii from beasts had stumbled upon it perhaps it was true that torvald had been buried in the torvaldsberg and that the tomb the funeral chamber had been concealed to protect it from the curious or from robbers and in such a case legends might well have arisen legends in which the mystery of the lost tomb might figure these would have spread from village to village from remote farm to remote farm from hall to hall one such legend quite naturally might have been that torvald the great torvald was not truly dead but only asleep and would waken when once again his land had need of him wait i called to the forkbeard but he had entered the chamber torch high moving quickly i followed him swiftly tears in my eyes when he looked down torch lifted upon the bones and fragile cloths of what had once been a hero when the myth had been shattered the crystal of its dream beneath the iron of reality i wanted to stand near him i would not speak to him but i would stand behind him and near him the forkbeard stood at the side of the great stone couch which was covered with black fur at the foot of the couch were weapons at its head hanging on the wall under a great shield were two spears crossed under it and to one side a mighty sword in its scabbard near the head of the couch on our left as we looked upon the couch was on a stone platform a large helmet horned the forkbeard looked at me the couch was empty he did not speak he sat down on the edge of the couch on the black fur and put his head in his hands his torch lay on the floor and after some time burned itself out the forkbeard did not move the men of torvaldsland unlike most gorean men do not permit themselves tears it is not cultural for them to weep but i heard him sob once i did not of course let him know that i had heard this sound i would not shame him we have lost he said finally red hair we have lost i had lit another torch and was examining the chamber the body of torvald i conjectured had not been buried in this place it did not seem likely that robbers would have taken the body and left the various treasures about nothing it seemed had been disturbed torvald i conjectured doubtless as cunning and wise as the legends had made him out had not elected to have himself interred in his own tomb it was empty the wiliness the cunning of a man who had lived more than a thousand years ago made itself felt in its effects a millennium later in this strange place deep within the living stone of a great mountain in a bleak country where is torvald cried out ivar forkbeard i shrugged there is no torvald said the forkbeard torvald does not exist i made no attempt to answer the forkbeard the bones of torvald said the forkbeard even the bones of torvald are not here torvald was a great captain i said perhaps hewas burned in his ship which you have told me was called black shark i looked about it is strange though i said if that were the case why this tomb would have been built this is not a tomb said ivar forkbeard i regarded him this is a sleeping chamber he said there are no bones of animals here or of thralls or urns or the remains of foodstuffs offerings he looked about why he asked me would torvald have had carved in the torvaldsberg a sleeping chamber that men might come to the torvaldsberg to waken him i said ivar forkbeard looked at me from among the weapons at the foot of the couch from one of the cylindrical quivers still of the sort carried in torvaldsland i drew forth a long dark arrow it was more than a yard long its shaft was almost an inch thick with iron barbed its feathers were five inches long set in the shaft on three sides feathers of the blacktipped coasting gull a broadwinged bird with black tips on its wings and tail feathers similar to the vosk gull i lifted the arrow what is this i asked the forkbeard it is a war arrow he said and what sign is this carved on its side i asked the sign of torvald he whispered why do you think this arrow is in this place i asked that men might find it he asked i think so i said he reached out and put his hand on the arrow he took it from me send the war arrow i said the forkbeard looked down on the arrow i think i said i begin to understand the meaning of a man who lived more than a thousand winters ago this man call him torvald built within a mountain a chamber for sleep in which he would not sleep but to which men would come to waken him here they would find not torvald but themselves themselves ivar alone and an arrow of war i do not understand said ivar i think i saidthat torvald was a great and a wise man ivar looked at me in building this chamber i said it was not the intention of torvald that it should be he who was awakened within it but rather those who came to seek hirn the chamber is empty said ivar no i said we are within it i put my hand to his shoulder it is not torvald who must awaken in this chamber rather it is we here hoping for others to do our work we find only ourselves and an arrow of war is this not torvalds way of telling us from a thousand years ago that it is we on whom we must depend and not on any other if the land is to be saved it is by us and others like us that lt must be saved there are no spells no gods no heroes to save us in this chamber it is not torvald who must awaken it is you and i i regarded the forkbeard evenly lift said i the arrow of war i stood back from the couch my torch raised slowly his visage terrible the forkbeard lifted his arm the arrow in his fist i am not even of torvaldsland but it was i who was present when the arrow of war was lifted at the side of the couch of torvald deep within the living stone of the torvaldsberg then the forkbeard thrust the arrow in his belt he crouched down at the foot of the couch of torvald he sorted through the weapons there he selected two spears handing me one we have two kurii to kill he said chapter torvaldslanders visit the camp of kurii it was very quiet the men did not speak below us in the valley spread out for more than ten pasangs we saw the encampment of kurii at the feet of ivar forkbeard head to the ground nude waiting to be commanded knelt hilda the haughty daughter of thorgard of scagnar go said ivar to her she lifted her head to him may i not have one last kiss my jarl she whispered go said he if you live you will be more than kissed yes my jarl she said and obediently slipped away into the darkness the ax i carried was bloodied it had tasted the blood of a kur guard we stood downwind of the encampment not far from me was svein blue tooth he stood not moving it was cold i could see the outline of his helmet the rim of the shield the spear dark against darkness near us behind us stood gorm ottar and rollo and others of forkbeards landfall it was some ehn before the gorean dawn on a distant world lit by the same star at a comparable time men turned in their beds mercury vapor lamps burned lonely heavy lorries rumbled down streets keeping their delivery schedules parts of yesterdays newspapers fluttered down lonely sidewalks with us stood bjarni of thorstein camp and with him he who had in the formal duel carried his shield at bjarnis shoulder too stood the young man scarcely more than a boy whom he had in that duel intended to fight with the boy too was his friend who would have carried the shield for him the war arrow had been carried it had been carried to the inlet of green cliffs to thorstein camp from ax glacier to einars skerry it had been carried to the high farms to the lakes to the coast it had been carried on foot and by swift ship a thousand arrows each touched to the arrow of torvald had been carried and where the arrow had been carried men had touched it saying i will come they came captains and rovers farmers fishermen hunters weavers of nets smiths carvers of wood tradesmen and traders men with little more than leather and an ax to their name and jarls in purple cloaks with golden pommels on their swords and among them stood too thralls their heads were not lower than those with whom they stood among them was the lad called tarsk formerly wulfstan of kassau to whom thyri had once been given for the night in the night of the attack he at the forkbeards encampment near the thing field with an ax had slain a kur i remembered finding the carcass of the animal beneath the fallen halfburned canvas of the forkbeards tent thralls are not permitted to touch the war arrow but they are permitted to kneel to those who have wulfstan had handed the forkbeard the ax disarming himself and had then knelt before him putting his head to his feet thralls may be slain for so much as touching a weapon he had taken dirt from beneath the feet of the forkbeard and kneeling had poured it on his head rise thrall had said the forkbeard the young man had then stood and straightly head high before the forkbeard the forkbeard threw him back the ax carry it said the forkbeard on another world lit by the same star in another place dawn too drew near the distant light in the great cities unknowing soon to be occupied with the concerns of their days piercing the haze of daily customary poisons first struck the heights of the lofty buildings reflecting from the rectangular windows like sheets of burnished copper reflecting the fire of the sun men would soon be up and about their duties hurrying from one nothing to another to compromises to banal degradations anxious lest they fail to be on time they would not care for the blackened grass growing between the bricks they would take no note of the spiders architecture nor marvel at the flight of a wren darting to its nest among the smokeblackened carved stones there would be no time there would be no time for them no time for seeing or feeling or touching or loving or finding out what it might be to be alive clouds would be strangers to them rain an inconvenience snow a nuisance a tree an anachronism a flower an oddity cut and frozen in a florists refrigerator these were the men without meaning so full and so empty so crowded so desolate so busy so needlessly occupied these were the gray men the hurrying men the efficient smug tragic insects noiseless on soft feet in the billion iron hills of technology how few of them gazed ever on the stars is grandeur so fearful that men must shield themselves with pettiness from its glory do they not understand that in themselves and in perhaps a thousand other intelligences reality has openeel its eyes upon its own immensity do they shut their eyes lest they see gods we could see now a glimmer of light on the peak of the torvaldsberg i wondered how many men would die i wondered if i myself this morning in torvaldsland in bleak light would die i gripped the ax it had good weight the balance was apt across the valley there were others men waiting too the signal would be a shield signal taking the morning sun a flash and then the attack hundreds of war cries would be mingled as men poured down the slopes there were men here too even from hunjer sjkern helmutsport and scagnar itself on whose cliffs thorgards fortress ruled never before to my knowledge had men attacked kurii i gazed at the giant rollo his eyes seemed vacant he stood as a child with his great ax about his neck was a golden medallion his chest was bare beneath a leather vest svein blue tooth fingered the tooth of the hunjer whale dyed blue on its chain about his neck he was a good jarl he had been the third after ivar forkbeard and tarl cabot a warrior of koroba to lift the arrow of torvald not far away from him was even ketil of his high farm the wrestler whose arm i had broken it was splinted with a third of a spear shaft in his left hand he carried a sword among the men too was a large fellow as large as or larger than rollo whom i did not know he was fiercely bearded and carried a spear he had told us he was hrolf and from the east none had questioned him below us in the valley we could see the coals of thousands of fires in the camp of the kurii they slept curled several in each shelter the field shelters of the kurii are made of skins and furs arched over bent saplings each is little more than four or five feet high with a comparable width but is fifty or sixty feet in length some being as long as a hundred feet in length these shelters too are often curved and irregular in outline sometimes they adjoin one another with entrances giving mutual access they resemble caves sometimes networks of caves constructed in the open kurii drop to all fours to enter and leave them no kur enjoys sleeping exposed if in a field they will sometimes even burrow into the ground almost like a sleen and cover the opening with grass and sticks from the bottom it always sleeps with its head toward the opening the kurii herds were quiet there was little stirring in them i could see the white herd of verr hundreds of the animals penned in the northwest quadrant of the camp in the northeast quadrant were the tarsk pens i could smell them in the early morning air i could smell too the odors of kurii and the tramped dung of bosk the bosk were at the south of the camp they would effectively prevent the kurii from slipping free on the south the herd numbered some several thousand the northern pole of the camp would be left free as a seeming avenue of escape to lure embattled kurii should the tide of the war turn against them into flight northward it would be in the language of gorean strategists the bridge of jewels beckoning alluring promising safety prophetic of escape near the center of the camp but somewhat to the south and east of the center like the verr the tarsk the bosk was another herd of kurii animals it too resided in its pen a wide pen more than a quarter of a pasang in diameter formed of poles and crossbars lashed together this pen however waspatrolled by prowling domesticated sleen the animals huddled together within the pen hundreds of them terrified of the sleen these were herd sleen trained to group and control animals to the north and west of the camps center i could see the tents of thorgard of scagnar and his men i smiled the kurii had been in no hurry to initiate their march to the south they had failed several days ago in the thing assembly to intimidate the men of torvaldsland into furnishing them provisions for their march after their devastating victory of the night of svein blue tooths feast in which his hall was burned and the thing encampments laid waste they had formed their own camp and set methodically about gathering supplies for their southern march hundreds of sorties had penetrated the hills and valleys burning farms and gathering goods generally tools and weapons and livestock there were collection points to which such materials were brought from which by short marches they were conveyed to the camp during this time a hundred pasangs to the south svein blue tooth had set the rallying point of the men of torvaldsland in these days i had much spied on kurii living on the land returning more than once to the blue tooths war camp it is nothing for a warrior to cover ninety pasangs on foot in a day this is usually done by alternating the warriors pace with the warriors stride and allowing for periods of rest few who have been invested in the scarlet of the warriors cannot match this accomplishment i and many others can considerably improve upon it a typical kurii foraging squad consists of six animals called a hand with its eye or leader two such hands with their eyes constitutes a kur or beast the military kur in this sense a unit is commanded by a blood this seems peculiar perhaps but is explained by ancient kurii belief that thought is a function of the blood one thinks thus with ones entire body not just the brain contemporary kurii understand naturally that cognitive processes braincentered or largely braincentered but the anc terminology in their songs poetry and even military con remains analogously humans continue to speak of affairs of the heart a man of good heart that someone h big heart etc which terminology perhaps lingers from ti when the heart was regarded not as a chemomechanical pump but as the throne and home of the emotions the commander of a military kur thus might better be thought of as the brain or mind but continues in their languages to be spoken of as the blood a blood thus commands the two eyes and the two hands twelve kurs the sense of military units constitutes one band this one hundred and eight animals including subalterns leaders and is itself commanded by a blood whose rank is indicated by two rings on the left arm twelve of these bands constitutes a march a march thus consists of animals or counting the commanders of each band animals a march is commanded by a blood whose rank is indicated by one ring on the left arm the ring rank are quite plain being of some reddish alloy and are distinguished from decorative rings of which many kurii are fond kurii generally like men seem vain beasts there appears to be an inverse correlation between height of rank and intricacy and variety of ornamentation the higher the rank the simpler is likely to be the ornamentation the commander or blood of a march wears only a single sin reddish ring whether or not this simplicity is honored duty so to speak or in their privacy i do not know i fur do not know the full significance of the rings i do not understand how they are earned or what is involved in moving from the second ring to the first ring i do know that rings are welded on the wrists of the beasts the iron files of the goreans incidentally will not cut the alloy they may be obtained of course by the severing of the arm why the conjunction of bands is spoken of as a march is also unclear this may refer to a military march of course but i suspect the term being apparently ancient that it may also refer to migrations in the remote history of the kurii on their own world putatively no longer existent or viable there is some indirect evidence that this may be the case because twelve marches are referred to not as a division or army or some such unit but rather as a people a people would be commanded by a blood of the people such a commander is said to stand outside the rings i do not fully understand the meaning of this expression the kurii as i may have mentioned consist of several peoples not all of these peoples speak the same language and i gather there are differences among and within each people for example differences in marking in texture of fur in temperament in tooth arrangement in ear shape and so on these differences negligible from the point of view of humans are apparently of considerable importance among the kurii themselves the human pursued by such an animal is not likely to be concerned about the width of its ears or the mottling of its fur kurii in their past at least were apparently torn by internecine strife disrupted by racial and civil wars among themselves it is not impossible that the defertilization or destruction of their former home was a consequence of such altercations no kur however i am told of whatever race or type will eat the meat of another this is interesting considering the ferocity of their carnivorous dispositions they hold the human unfortunately in no such regard it will be noted that the military arrangements of the kurii are based on the number twelve or divisors and multiples of twelve kurii use i understand a basetwelve mathematics the prehensible appendage of the normal kur is six digited sometimes the foraging squads of the kurii had been accompanied by trained sleen often four of them twice in my reconnoitering i had had to kill such beasts the sleen have various uses some are merely used as watch animals or guard animals others are used as points in the advance of squads some trained to attack putative enemies others to return to the squad thus alerting it to the presence of a possible enemy others are even more highly trained and are used to hunt humans of the humanhunting sleen some are trained merely to kill and others to hurry the quarry to a kurii holding area one type of sleen is trained to destroy males and herd females distinguishing between the sexes by scent a sleen may bring a girl in stumbling and weeping from pasangs away driving her as kurii take little notice through their very camp until she is entered into a herd four days ago i had seen a girl drive in which several sleen fanning out over a large area of territory had scented out scattered hiding slave girls and from various points driven them into a blind canyon where a waiting kur had swung shut a wooden gate on them fastening them inside sleen are also used to patrol the large return marches of groups of foraging expeditions those marches between the temporary holding areas and the main camp the order of such a march is typically as follows captured humans in single file form its center these humans are usually thralls and bondmaids but not always the spoils are carried by the captured male humans unless there are too many and then the residue is divided among the bondmaids kurii burden the males heavily they can think of little more than the weight they carry and the next step furthermore their wrists are usually tied to the straps of their improvised backpacks kurii unlike goreans do not subject bondmaids to heavy labor it toughens their meat the bondmaids are separated from the males that they be deprived of leadership furthermore the technique of keeping prisoners in single file separating them by some feet and preventing speech between them tends to make conjoint action between them unlikely prowling the long singlefile of prisoners male and female in alternate groups bondmaids thus used to separate files of men from one another will be sleen should any individual either male or female depart by so much as a yard from the line of march or attempt to close the gap between himself and a fellow prisoner the sleen prevent this once i saw a girl stumble and two sleen immediately snarling and hissing sprang toward her she leaped weeping to her feet and darted to her precise place in the line keeping it perfectly casting terrified glances at the vicious predators the line of prisoners and sleen is on both sides flanked by the kurii foragers there are thus five lines the center line of prisoners and spoils its flanking lines of sleen and on either side the flanking lines of the kur foragers human prisoners of kurii incidentally are usually stripped kurii see no reason to give animals clothing i glanced to the torvaldsberg the sun now glinted more fully on its height below us in the broad valley the camp of the kurii lay still in darkness we heard below the howling of a sleen lonely i wondered if kurii dreamed i supposed they did it is almost time said ivar forkbeard to me i nodded then from below we heard the hunting cry of a sleen and then of two others then others i did not envy hilda ivars slave the kurii would take little note of the sleen their cries were neither of alarm nor offury they were only gathering in another animal perhaps a new one wandered too close to the camp or a stray to be expeditiously returned to its herd the first light then began to touch the valley from the noises of the sleen we could detect the progress of their hunt and the location of the imbonded daughter of thorgard of scagnar there said ivar pointing they caught her north of the bosk herd we could see her white body and the dark sinuous furred shapes converging upon it then she was surrounded and she stopped then the spleen opened a passage for her indicating to her which direction she was to go where else she turned she was met with the fangs and hisses of the accompanying animals when she tried to move in any direction other than that of the opened passage they snapped at her viciously a single snap could tear off a hand or foot then two of the sleen fell in behind her and snarling and snapping at her heels drove her before them we saw her fleeing before them trying to escape the swift terrible jaws we feared more than once that they would kill her a female who cannot be herded is destroyed by the herding sleen in the northwest quadrant of the camp was the herd of verr in the northeast quadrant were the tarsk pens the bosk were penned at the southern end of the camp near the center of the camp but somewhat to the south and east of the center behind its poles and crossbars lashed together was a different herd of kurii livestock it was to this pen that the daughter of thorgard of scagnar running before the snapping snarling sleen was driven she darted between the crossbars and in a moment no longer harried by sleen found herself on the trampled turf within another member of the herd it was as we had planned the sleen now resumed their rounds patrolling the perimeter of the pen the new animal had been added to the herd they were no longer interested in it unless it should attempt to leave the pen we saw hilda a speck in the grayish light hurrying to the herd within it huddled on the damp soiled trampled turf i wish said ivar forkbeard that i had such a herd the herd indeed consisted of sleek beautiful animals fair and twolegged there must have been three or four thousand chattels confined in the great pen some of the girls are yours i reminded him and i intend to have them back he said in that herd i surmised were several of our women thyri aelgifu or pudding gunnhild oiga pouting lips pretty ankles the former miss stevens of connecticut now honey cake the girl named leah from canada whose last name was of no interest and others too among them now prisoner was hilda perhaps ivars preferred slave hilda even now would be conveying our instructions to the frightened girls for the most part bondmaids we would soon see if such feared sleen and kurii more or gorean males their masters if they did not obey they would be slain as slaves they were commanded as slaves did they fail to comply they would be put to death they had no choice they would obey the sun was now sharp and beautiful on the heights of the torvaldsberg tie on the scarves said svein blue tooth the word slipped from man to man on the other side of the valley too men would be performing the same action each of us tied about our left shoulder a yellow scarf it was by such a device that the kurii had recognized their confederates in the men of thorgard of scagnar we would too wear such scarves this was our vengeance on those who had betrayed their kind loosen your weapons said svein blue tooth the men shifted swords were withdrawn from scabbards arrows were fitted to the string spears more firmly gripped it seemed strange to me that men only men would dare to pit themselves against kurii i did not know then of course about the fury svein blue tooth had his head down i sensed it first in the giant rollo it was not a human noise it was a snarl a growl like the sound of a larl awakening from its sleep the hair on my neck stood on end i turned the giant head was slowly lifting itself and turning its eyes were closed i could see blood beginning to move through the veins of its forehead then the eyes opened and no longer were they vacant but deep within them as though beginning from far away there seemed the glint of some terrible light i saw his fists close and open his shoulders were hunched down he half crouched as though waiting tense while the thing the frenzy the madness began to burn within him it is beginning said ivar forkbeard to me i do not understand i said be quiet said he it is beginning i saw then svein blue tooth the mighty jarl of torvaldsland lift his own head but it did not seem then to be him it seemed rather a face i had not seen before the eyes did not seem those of the noble blue tooth but of something else unaccountable not understood i saw him suddenly thrust his left forearm against the broad blade of his spear to my horror i saw him sucking at his own blood i saw a man fighting the frenzy tear handfuls of his own hair from his head but it was coming upon him and he could not subdue it other men were restless some dug at the earth with their boots others looked about themselves frightened the eyes of one man began to roll in his head his body seemed shaken trembling he muttered incoherently another man threw aside his shield and jerked open the shirt at his chest looking into the valley i heard others moan and then the moans give way to the sounds of beasts utterances of incontinent rage those who had not yet been touched stood terrified among their comrades in arms they stood among monsters kurii i heard someone say kill kurii i heard kill kurii what is it i asked ivar forkbeard i saw a man with his fingernails blind himself and feel no pain with his one remaining eye he stared into the valley i could see foam at the side of his mouth his breathing was deep and terrible look upon rollo said the forkbeard the veins in the neck and on the forehead of the giant bulged swollen with pounding blood his head was bent to one side i could not look upon his eyes he bit at the rim of his shield tearing the wood splintering it with his teeth it is the frenzy of odin said the forkbeard it is the frenzy of odin man by man heart by heart the fury gripped the host of svein blue tooth it coursed through the thronged warriors it seemed a tangible thing communicating itself from one to another it was almost as though one could see it but one could not see it only its effects i could trace its passage it seemed first a ghastly infection a plague then it seemed like a fire invisible and consuming then it seemed like the touching of these men by the hands of gods but no gods i knew none to whom a woman or child might dare pray but the gods of men and of the men of torvaldsland the dread harsh divinities of the cruel north the gods of torvaldsland and the touch of these gods like their will was terrible ivar forkbeard suddenly threw back his head and silently screamed at the sky the thing had touched him the breathing of the men their energy their rage the fury was all about me a bowstring was being drawn taut i heard the grinding of teeth on steel the sound of men biting at their own flesh i could no longer look on ivar forkbeard he was not the man i had known in his stead there stood a beast i looked down into the valley there were the lodges of the kurri i recalled them well did i remember their treachery well did i remember the massacre hideous merciless in the hall of svein blue tooth kill kurii i heard within me then irrational like lava i felt the beginning of a strange sensation i must consider the beauty of the torvaldsberg i told myself but i could not look again at the cold bleak beauty of the mountain i could look only into the valley where unsuspecting lay the enemy it is madness i told myself madness in the lodges below slept kurii who had killed who had massacred in the night in my pouch even now there lay the golden armlet which once had been worn by the woman telima below unsuspecting they lay the enemy the kurii no i said i must resist this thing i drew forth the golden armlet which had been worn by telima on a bit of fiber i tied it about my neck i held it below lay the enemy i closed my eyes then i sucked in the air between my teeth somewhere far off on another world lit by the same star rnen hurried to work i fought the feelings which were rearing within me as well might i have fought the eruption of the volcano the shifting of the strata of the earth i heard the growling the fury of those about me below us lay the kurii i opened my eyes the valley seemed to me red with rage the sky red the faces of those about me i felt a surge of frenzy building within me i wanted to tear to cut to strike to destroy it had touched me and i stood then within its grip in that red burning world of rage the bowstring was taut there was foam at the mouth of svein blue tooth his eyes were those of a madman i lifted my ax the thousands of the men of torvaldsland on either side of the valley made ready one could sense their seething the unbearable power the tenseness the signal spear in the hand of the frenzied blue tooth its scarlet talmit wrapped at the base of its blade was lifted the breathing of thousands of men waiting to be unleashed to plunge to the valley for an instant was held the sun flashed on the shield the signal spear thrust to the valley with one frenzied cry the host in its fury from either side of the valley plunged downward the men of torvaldsland they cried are upon you chapter what then occurred in the camp of the kurii the kur dropped back from the blade howling i leapt upon another striking it before it could rise and then another simultaneously with the attack from the slopes the girls in the cattle pen following the orders of masters conveyed to them by hilda crying out fled in their hundreds from the pen streaming throughout the camp the herd sleen rushed among them but confused in the numbers found lt diffcult to single out women for returning to the pen similarly the marine predator attacking a school of shimmering flashing bodies makes fewer successful strikes than he would if he were able undistracted to single out individual quarries a sleen would no sooner mark out a girl for return to the pen than three or four others would constantly enter and disappear from his ken often luring him into their pursuit while the first slips free in her turn later perhaps to save another similarly furthermore when a sleen would fasten on a given girl she would permit herself rapidly to be returned to the pen thus the sleen obedient to its training would not harm her as soon as she was back in the pen of course she would leave it again escaping from a different sector any girl found remaining in the pen by a man of torvaldsland seeking her own safety unless she had been ordered there by a free attacker was to be summarily slain i was pleased to note that the women feared more the men of torvaldsland than even sleen and kurii danger to them was of no interest to us their lives were unimportant they were slaves accordingly we used them to create a diversion many kurii springing from their tents emerging from the leather and fur shelter tunnels confused first saw only the sleek twolegged cattle streaming past until perhaps axes fell upon them the nature of the attack and its extent would not be clear to them a kur lifted its great ax i charged him my ax swift before he could strike i wrenched free the blade of the ax as it slumped down breaking it free from its jawbone and shoulder tarl red hair i heard cry it was the voice of a girl wild slender i turned i realize now it was thyri but i did not recognize her at the time i stood mighty and terrible the ax ready my clothes drenched with blood the kur rolling and jerking at my feet she put her hand before her mouth her eyes terrified and fled away i saw a kur seize a man of thorgard of scagnars camp and tear his head from his body the attackers as well as the men of thorgard of scagnar wore yellow scarves at their shoulders many kurii confused in the beginning had fallen to the axes of scarved men putatively their allies now however indiscriminately they sought to destroy all armed male humans many were the men of thorgard who fell beneath the teeth and steel of kurii and several were the kurii who fell to the weapons of thorgards men as they fought madly to defend themselves once i saw thorgard of scagnar and ivar forkbeard trying to reach him but ivar was blocked by kurii and warriors and joined in their combat i heard the screaming of slave girls i saw two kurii converging on gormtwice from behind the ax swept laterally once to the left the second time to the right chopping through the spines a sleen more than eleven feet in length sixlegged slid past its fur wiping against my thigh gorm in his madness was cutting at the bodies of the kurii fallen now before him shrieking shoulder to shoulder fighting i saw bjarni of thorstein camp and the young man whom i had championed on the dueling ground in the thing i smelled fire there was the howling of kurii i saw a kur barred with brown turning backing away snarling limping from ottar who kept the forkbeards farm ottar pursued it heedless of his safety his eyes wild killing it cutting its body then in two with repeated blows of his ax i saw the huge littleknown man of torvaldsland who had joined the host late calling himself hrolf from the east who had come from the direction of the torvaldsberg with a cry he thrust his spear through the chest of a kur he fought magnificently a kur charged i sidestepped catching it in the belly with the ax i saw another kur undecided startled i slipped in gut it charged i reared the handle of the ax catching it in the stomach turning it to one side it grunted i leapt up catching it in the side of the neck before it could rise its head half to one side it rose to its feet and ran for a dozen yards before it slipped falling sideways rolling into the fur and burning leather of one of their lodges protect me i heard a female threw herself to my feet putting her head to my ankle protect me she wept i looked down she lifted her face terrified tearstained she had dark hair dark eyes i saw the iron collar dark on her white throat it was leah the canadian girl with my foot i thrust her weeping to one side there was mens work to do i met the attack of the kur squarely the handle of its ax smote down across the handle of mine forcing me to one knee slowly i reared up forcing the handle now held in the two paws of the kur upward and backward it again thrust down with its full weight and strength certain that it could crush the puny strength of a human i held it only long enough to satisfy myself that i could then i withdrew the handle swiftly twisting to one side and lifting the ax it fell forward startled i stepped on the handle of the ax it tried to dislodge it my ax was raised it roiled wildly to one side my blow fell against its left shoulder blade dividing it howling it leapt to its feet backing away from me baring its fangs i followed it it turned suddenly and leapt away i caught it before the opening of a pavilion tent one of those of thorgard of scagnar perhaps his own the tent was striped the kur turning now facing me moved backward it stumbled against a tent rope jerking loose its peg i leaped forward striking it again at the left hip the side of its furred leg was drenched with blood hunched over snarling it backed into the tent where i followed it there was screaming from within the tent the screaming of thorgards silken girls many of them short plump lusciously bodied some were chained by the left ankle the silks they wore clinging and diaphanous were designed not to conceal their beauty but to reveal it to enhance and accentuate it to expose it sensuously to the survey of a master they collared shrank back cowering on the cushions drawing back to the side of the tent i scarcely glanced at them they would belong to the victors the kur backing away with its right arm reaching across its body tore up one of the tent poles wrenching it free of the earth the tent the tent sagged near him he snarled he thrust out with the tent pole using the spike at its top like a spear then he swung the pole striking at me i waited it was weak from the loss of blood it turned about again and fled to the opposite wall of the tent it tried to tear the siik and it was at the wall of the tent that i caught it i lifted my ax from the body and turned to face the women i strode to them they knelt huddled together holding one another at the side of the tent they put down their eyes trembling i left the tent where is thorgard of scagnar asked ivar forkbeard his shirt was half torn away there was kur blood on his chest and against the side of his face i do not know i told him behind ivar forkbeard naked wearing his collar i saw hilda thorgards daughter there is a rallying of kurii by the verr pens cried a man quickly ivar and myself hurried to the verr pens the rally was ill fated spears fell among the determined kurii several fell in the mud and filth of the verr pens themselves the bleating animals frightened darting about leaping over the bodies near the verr pens we found chained male slaves picked up by kurii on foraging expeditions and used as porters there were more than three hundred such wretches svein blue tooth was at the pens leading the attack that had broken the rally the rally had been led by the kur who had been foremost in the attack on his hall this kur it seemed had disappeared scattering with the others the blue tooth stepped over the body of a fallen kur he gestured to the chained male slaves free them he said and give them weapons there is yet work to do eagerly the slaves when their manacles had been struck away picked up weapons and sought kurii do not permit kurii to escape to the south said svein blue tooth to ketil keeper of his high farm who had been famed as a wrestler the bosk herd blocks their escape in numbers said ketil some have even been trampled we have been tricked cried a man across the camp is the true rally hundreds of kurii all falls before them this was a ruse to draw men here permitting kurii to regroup in numbers elsewhere my heart leaped no wonder the commander of the kurii had left his forces here disappearing i wondered if they knew his real intent had been elsewhere i admired him he was a true general a most dangerous and lethal foe unscrupulous brilliant it seems grinned ivar forkbeard we have a worthy adversary the battle turns against us cried a man they must be held said ivar forkbeard we heard the howling of kurii from almost a pasang away on the other side of the camp drifting to us too were the cries of men let us join the fray tarl red hair invited the forkbeard fleeing men rushed past us the forkbeard struck one felling him to the battle said he the man turned and taking his weapon fled back to the fighting to the battle cried the forkbeard to the battle they cannot be held cried a man they will sweep the camp to the battle cried the forkbeard we ran madly toward the fighting there already lifted we saw the signal spear of svein blue tooth about it swept kurii it was like a flag on an island at its foot stood the mighty rollo striking to the left and right with his ax no kur who approached the signal spear did not die hundreds of men in ragged scattered lines strung out laterally accompanied us kwrii overextended meeting this new resistance to piercing howls fell back to regroup for another charge form lines cried svein blue tooth form lines the blue tooth their jarl was with them men fought to take their place under his eyes in the first line the blue tooth himself now stood with rollo his own hand on the signal spear we saw the overlapping shields of the kurii line the axes there must have been better than two thousand kurii formed then to our surprise from within the kurii lines we saw two or three hundred slave girls whipped forth they were bound together in fours and fives some were bound together by the wrists others by the ankles some by the waist many by the throat they were cattle caught and tethered in the camp in the confusion by kurii they were to be used to break our lines i saw ael gifu pudding among them her wrists were pulled out from the side of her body bound to the wrist of a girl on either side as they themselves were fastened we heard the cracking of whips and the cries of pain faster and faster ran the girls toward us fleeing the whips behind them rapidly the kurii advanced charge cried the svein blue tooth the lines of men too hurtled forward not ten yards before the clash took place svein blue tooth and his lieutenants before the running line as the girls under the whips of kurii fled terrified seeing the axes the leveled weapons toward them made a sign no bondmaid of the north mistakes the belly sign almost as one the girls crying out flung themselves to their bellies among the bodies and the charge of the men of torvaldsland missing not a step took its way over them striking the startled kurii with an unimpeded impact i cut down one of the kurii with its whip when the whip is put to the back of slaves i told it it is we who shall do so there was instantly fierce fighting in and among and over the bodies of the tethered bondmaids those who could covered their heads with their hands bodies human and kur fell bloodied to the grass bondmaids half crushed some with broken bones screamed they struggled some to rise but tethered few could do so most lay prone trembling as the feet shifted about them weapons clashing over their heads the kurii some seventeen or eighteen hundred of them fell back cut the wenches free ordered svein blue tooth blades swiftly freed the prone hysterical bondmaids many were covered with blood svein blue tooth and others by the hair hurled bondwenches to their feet get to the pen he cried they stumbled away hurrying to the pen help her ordered the blue tooth to two frightened girls they bent to lift and support one of their sisters in bondage whose leg was broken binding fiber still knotted about the ankle tarl red hair wept gunnhild my blade flashed at her throat cutting the tether that bound her on either side to two other girls get to the pen i told her yes my jarl she cried running toward the pen the girls those who could fled the field to return to the pen in which the kurii had originally confined them those who could not walk were under the orders ofmen by other bondmaids carried or aided to the pen i saw pretty ankles put out her hand to ivar forkbeard severed binding fiber was knotted tight about her belly to the pen commanded the forkbeard weeping she hurried to the pen they charge cried a man with a great howling again kurll ran toward us our lines buckled but again after minutes of terrible fighting they fell back on one side of me fought the mighty rollo his lips foaming his eyes wild on the other side he who called himself hrolf from the east the bearded giant with bloodied spear well did he acquit himself then others stood with me rollo went to the signal spear he who spoke of himself as hrolf disappeared twice more were there charges once by kurii once by men we were thrown back from the shield wall with devastating losses had it not been for the force of svein blue tooth the power of his voice the mightiness of his presence kurii might then have taken the initiative form lines he cried regroup spears to the second line a hedge of spears projecting from the lines of men men with axes between them waited for kurii should they try to press their advantage then the spear line faced the shield wall a hundred yards of bloodied grass of bodies of men and kurii separated two species of warring animal kurii from within the camp where they could streamed to join their comrades men too where they could break away from small battles individual combats found their way to our lines it seemed startling to me that we had stood against kurii but we had the kurii showed no signs of emerging from the shield wall it consists of two lines one on the ground the other at chest level of overlapping shields the shields turn only for the blows of axes we could see the two front lines one kneeling one standing of kurii similar lines fierce obdurate protective extended about the formation on all sides forming the edges of the kurii war square within the square formed into ragged hands kurii and bands with their appropriate leaders were massed a considerable number of kurii ready to charge forth should the shield wall open or to support it if it seemed in danger of weakening it was my supposition that their square contained now better than twentythree hundred beasts let us again attack the square cried a man no said svein blue tooth we cannot break the square they will wait for night said ivar forkbeard men shuddered the kur has excellent night vision men would for practical purposes be blind they will slaughter us with the fall of night said a man let us withdraw now said another do you not think they will hunt us in the darkness asked svein blue tooth he looked up it is past noon he said then he said i am hungry he looked to some of his men go to kurii fallen cut meat roast it before our lines good said ivar forkbeard perhaps they will break the square for us but the square did not break not a beast moved svein blue tooth threw kur meat into the dirt in disgust your plan has failed said ivar forkbeard yes said svein blue tooth grimly they are waiting for night i saw the general within their square the huge kur whom i had seen before in the hall of svein blue tooth it with the golden ring on the left arm the ring of gold as far as i knew had no military significance many kurii wear such rings and necklaces and earrings that no ring of reddish alloy was worn which would distinguish the leader of a band or march was of interest the leader of a band wears two welded reddish rings the leader of the march which contains twelve bands only one the general in the form tion against which we stood wore not even one reddish rin surely he was not a blood of a people yet there w little doubt of his authority or his right to such authority expected he stood as a commander from one of the stcworlds themselves sent to unite and command native kur sometimes said i kurii react to blood reflexively they have had their fill of blood said ivar forkbeard the air is heavy with it even i could smell blood mixing with the smoke of fires where kurii lodges burned but the kurii square held it did not move they are patient said svein blue tooth they wait for night at the same time ivar forkbeard and myself looked one another i smiled he grinned we shall break the square i told svein blue tooth we shall do so in one ahn find what food and water you can feed the men give them drink be ready he looked at us as though we might be mad i shall he said fingering the stained tooth of the hunjer whale whi ch hung about his neck kurii lifted their heads apprehensive they heard bellowing before it came to the ears of men the earth began to tremble dust like smoke like the earth was burning rolled in the air they looked to one another then the air was filled with the thunder of hoofs bellowing of the bosk the bosk in their charging hundreds heads down hooves pounding maddened relentless driven struck the square we heard even from behind the herd ivar and i and a hundred men screaming and shouting the howling the startled shrieks of kurii the enraged roars of kurii we heard the scraping of horns on metal the screams of gored kurii the howls of kurii fallen beneath the hoofs nothing on gor withstands the charge of the maddened bosk larls themselves will flee before it the herd thrust through the square and half milling half still running emerged from its other side making for the slopes of the valley dazed injured kurii their formations disrupted reeled only to find among them screaming men the launched horde of svein blue tooth his charge was unleashed while the last of the bosk were still striking the western edge of the square and other animals were streaming bellowing goring through it screaming men axes raised emerged from the dust running falling upon the devastated kurii not an instant had they been given to regroup themselves kurii howling fled knots of men following individuals press them press them screamed the blue tooth no quarter no quarter once again the camp became a melee of small combats only now the kurii where they could fled if they fled north they were permitted to do so for north lay the bridge of jewels since morning this bridge had lain in wait more than four hundred archers surmounting the pass that there is an apparent avenue of escape serves to make the enemy think in terms of escape a cornered foe desperate is doubly dangerous a foe who thinks he may by swift decision save himself is less likely to fight with ferocity he is quicker to abandon his lines quicker to give up the combat ivar and i strode through the burning camp axes in our hand men followed us where we came on them we killed kurii we passed the poles of the vast pen within it looking through the bars not daring to leave it were hundreds of bondmaids we saw pouting lips within behind her was leah the canadian girl ivar blew pouting lips a kiss in the gorean fashion brushing the kiss with his fingertips toward her she extended her hands through the poles but we turned away leaving her and the canadian girl behind them we saw a sleen herding a girl back to the pen she was turning about crying scolding it but it snarling relentlesssnapped at her cutting at her heels with its fangs she before it weeping running to the pen ivar and i laughed they are useful beasts in herding women he observed my jarl said a voice we turned about hilda knelt before ivar forkbeard her hair to his feet may i not follow my jarl she begged a lowly bondmaid begs to heel her jarl then heel said ivar goodnaturedly turning away thank you my jarl she wept leaping to her feet falling into step on his left two steps behind him we heard behind a tent the snarl of a kur ivar and i swiftly circled the tent it was a large kur brownish with blazing eyes rings its ears in its right hand it dragged a human female it was thyri ivar motioned me back blocking the path of the kur was a man in a kirtle of white wool a collar of black iron at his throat he held his ax lifted the kur snarled but the man tarsk thrall of the forkbeard once wulfstan of kassau did not move more than once today had i seen the fellow tarsk at work in the fighting in the lines of svein blue tooth once he had fought not more than six men from my right his ax and his kirtle were much bloodied many times had his ax in the ferocities of combat drunk the blood of kurii the kur threw the girl to one side in her collar she f whimpering her eyes filled with terror the kur cast about and suddenly darted its great hand down and clutched an ax a kur ax wulfstan did not strike he waited the lips of the kur drew back he now had the ax firmly in his two heavy fists he snarled thyri lay on her side the palms of her hands on the ground her right leg under her she watched the two beasts contesting her the kur and the human beast terrible with the bloodied ax wulfstan of kassau the fight was swift and sharp ivar was pleased you did well he told the young man you did well earlier today and now you are free at his feet lay the bloodied kur he stood over it a free man wulfstan cried thyri she sprang to her feet and ran to him burying her head weeping in her hair against his chest i love you she wept i love you the wench is yours laughed ivar forkbeard i love you wept thyri kneel said wulfstan startled thyri did so you are mine now said wulfstan but surely you will free me wulfstan she cried wulfstan lifted his head and uttered a long shrill whistle of the sort with which kurii summon herd sleen one of the animals must have been within a hundred yards for it came immediately wulfstan lifted thyri by one arm and threw her before the beast take her to the pen said wulfstan to the animal wulfstan cried thyri then the beast snarling halfcharged her stopping short hissing eyes blazing wulfstan cried thyri backing away from the beast shaking her head no wulfstan if i still wish you later he said i will retrieve you from the pen with others which i might claim as my share of the booty wulfstan she cried protesting the sleen snapped at her and weeping she turned and fled to the pen the beast hissing and biting at her driving her before it the three of us laughed ivar and i had little doubt that wulfstan upon reflection would indeed retrieve his pretty thyri vital and slim from the pen and indeed perhaps others as well once the proud young lady of kassau had spurned his suit regarding herself as being too good for him now he would see that she served him completely deliciously helplessly as a bondmaid an article of his property his to do with as he wished and perhaps serve him as only one of several such lowly wenches we laughed thyri would wear her collar well for a master such as wulfstan once of kassau now of torvaldsland we looked after her we saw her furious running helplessly for the pen the sleen at her heels ivar forkbeard followed by tarl red hair and wulfstan of torvaldsland heeled by the bondmaid hilda picked his way toward the burned looted tents of thorgard of scagnar in the valley there burned still a thousand fires here and there mounted on stakes were the heads of kurii w stepped over broken axes shattered poles torn leather from the lodges of the kurii we passed a dozen men emptying kegs of ale it had become cloudy we heard a ships song from two hundred yards to our right we passed a group of men who had captured a kur a heavy block of wood had been thrust into its jaws and with leather bound there it was bleeding at the left side of its face its paws had been tied together at its belly and its legs tied in leather ankle shackles they were beating it back and forth between them with the butts of spears down roll over commanded one of the men it was beaten to its knees and then belly prodded by spears it rolled over a girl fled past us a sleen brown and black padding at her heels i slipped once the dirt in many places was soft from the blood we picked our way among bodies mostly those of kurii for the sur prise the fury had been ours we passed five men about fire roasting a haunch of kur the smell was heavy and sweet like blood in the distance visible was the height the torvaldsberg i saw hrolf from the east the bearded giant who had joined our forces asking only to fight with us leaning on his spear soberly surveying the field in a other place we saw a framework of poles set on the field from the crossbar hung by their ankles were the bodies five kurii two were being dressed for the spit two as yet had been untouched blood was being drained into a helm from the neck of the fifth ivar forkbeard cried the man holding the helmet he lifted the helmet to ivar over the helmet ivar doubled a nd held his fist making the sign of thor then he drank a handed to me the helmet i poured a drop from the helm to the reddish muddied earth tasardargor said i the priestkings of gor i looked into the blood i saw nothing only the blood of a kur then i drank may the ferocity of the kur be in you cried the man then taking the helmet back and throwing his head back he drained it blood running at the side of his mouth trickling to the fur at the collar of his jacket men about cheered come said ivar to us look said a man nearby he was cutting with a ships knife a ring of reddish alloy from the arm of a fallen kur the knife could not cut the ring he lifted it obdurate and bloody it was the only ornament the beast wore a high officer said ivar yes said the man be hind him stood a blond slave girl naked her hair falling to her waist i gathered she belonged to him we are victorious said the man to her brandishing the ring over her iron collar she wore a heavy leather kur collar high heavily sewn with its large ring he thrust her two wrists before her body into the ring he had cut from the kur he then tied them inside and to the ring he then from his belt took a long length of binding fiber and doubling it looped it securing it at its center to the ring leaving two long ends he then threw her on her back over the body head down of the fallen kur he took the two loose ends of the binding fiber and taking them under the body of the fallen kur dragged her wrists elbows bent over and above her head he then bending her knees tied one of the loose ends about her left ankle and the other about her right it was the gorean love bow he then regarding her cut the kur collar from her throat with the ships knife he threw it aside she now wore only one collar his she closed her eyes she moved lying across it on the body of the kur it was still warm it is we who are victorious said he she opened her eyes it is you who are victorious master she said already her hips were moving i am only a slave girl she wept with a roaring laugh he fell upon her ivar ivar cried a voice we heard the slave girl cry out with pleasure ivar cried a voice ivar forkbeard looked up to see ottar up the slope of the valley waving to him we made our way toward ottar who stood near the burned fallen tents of thorgard of scagnar here are prisoners and much loot said ottar he gestured at some eleven men of thorgard of scagnar thewere stripped of their helmets belts and weapons the stood chained by the neck their wrists shackled befor them i see only loot said the forkbeard kneel ordered ottar sell them as slaves in lydius said the forkbeard he turned away from the men heads down commanded ottar they knelt their heads to the muddied dirt the forkbeard looked at many of the boxes and chests and sacks of wealth i had seen this or much of it earlier in the morning when i had pursued the kur to the tent of thorgard of scagnar to one side knelt the silken girls i had seen in the tent there were seventeen of them under the dark sky kneeling in the mud they looked much different than they had in the tent their silks were soiled their legs and the bottom of their feet stained with mire their hands were tied behind their backs they were fastened to one another by binding fiber in throat coffle those that had been wearing chains had had the locks unfastened the keys found in one of the chests in a nearby tent over them proud and regal a switch in her hand stood olga she waved the switch at them i took them all for you my jarl she elated i simply ordered them with confidence and authority to kneel in a line facin away from me to be bound they did so the forkbeard laughed at the lovely chattels they are slaves he said none of the girls even dared to lift her eyes to him we saw too to one side the former miss peggy stevens of earth now honey cake her eyes were joyous seeing the fork beard seeing that he lived she ran to the forkbeard kneeling putting her head to his feet she too like pretty ankle had severed binding fiber knotted about her belly by the ring of the kur collar which she wore ivar forkbeard jerked he to her feet so that she stood on her tiptoes looking up a him he grinned to the pen with you slave he said sh looked at him adoringly yes master she whispered wait said olga do not permit her to go alone how is this asked ivar recollect you my jarl asked olga the golden girl she with ringed ears from the south who lost in the assessments of beauty to gunnhild well do i do so responded ivar licking his lips behold laughed olga she went to a piece of tent canvas which casually loosely was thrown over some object she threw it back lying in the dirt her legs drawn up her wrists tied behind her back was the deliciously bodied little wench darkhaired in gold silk now dirtied and torn in golden collar and gold earrings who had exchanged words with ivars woolkirtled wenches at the thing she was the trained girl the southern silk girl in fury she squirmed to her feet i am not a kur girl she cried indeed she did not wear the heavy leather collar with ring and lock which kurii fastened on their female cattle she wore a collar of gold and earrings and torn and muddied a slip of golden silk of the sort with which masters sometimes display their girl slaves it was incredibly brief i have a human master she said angrily to whom i demand to be imrnediately returned we took her honey cake and i said olga your master said ivar thinking recollecting the captain behind whom he had seen her heeling at the thing is rolf of red fjord rolf of red fjord i knew was a minor captain he and his men had participated in the fighting no laughed the girl after the contest of beauty in which through the cheating of the judges i lost i was sold to the agent of another a much greater one than a mere rolf of red fjord my master is truly powerful release me this instant fear him olga to the girls outrage tore away her golden silk revealing her to the forkbeard oh she cried in fury gunnhild had won the contest and won it fairly but i was forced to admit that the wench now before us struggling to free her wrists now revealed to us luscious sensuous short squirming infuriated was incredibly desirable we considered her body her face her obvious intelligence she would bring a high price she would make a delicious armful in the furs how is it that you have dared to strip me demanded the girl who is your master inquired ivar forkbeard she drew herself up proudly she threw back her shoulders in her eyes hot with fury was the arrogance of the highowned slave she smiled insolently contemptuously then she said thorgard of scagnar thorgard of scagnar called a voice that of gorm we turned thorgard of scagnar raiment torn bloodied a broken spear shaft bound behind his back and before his arms his wrists pulled forward held at the sides of his rib cage fastened by a rope across his belly herded by men with spears stumbled forward a length of simple coarse tent rope some seven feet in length had been knotted about his neck by this tether gorm dragged him before ivar forkbeard the golden girl regarded thorgard of scagnar with horror then eyes terrified she regarded ivar forkbeard of forkbeards landfall you are mine now said the forkbeard then he said to honey cake take my new slave to the pen yes master she laughed then she took the golden girl the southern girl by the hair come slave she said she dragged the bound silk girl bent over behind her i think said ivar forkbeard i will give her for a month to gunnhild and my other wenches they will enjoy having their own slave then when the month is done i will turn her over to the crew and she will be then as my other bondmaids no more or less ivar turned to regard thorgard of scagnar he stood proudly bound feet spread hilda naked in her collar knelt to one side and behind the forkbeard she covered herself with her hands as best she could her head down the forkbeard gestured to the several captive slave girls loot from thorgards tent kneeling wrists bound behind their backs in their brief mired silk in throat coffle those girls olga lightheartedly had secured for him take them to the pen he said to olga olga slapped her switch in the palm of her hand on your feet slaves she said the girls struggled to their feet to the pen hurry she snapped you will be given to men the girls began to run as each one passed olga she below the small of the back was expedited with a sharp stroke of the switch then olga much pleased laughing trotting beside them herded the running weeping stumbling coffle toward the pen now the forkbeard returned his attention to thorgard of scagnar who regarded him evenly some of his men escaped said gorm then gorm said shall we strip him no said the forkbeard kneel said gorm to thorgard of scagnar roughly he prodded him with the butt of a spear no said the forkbeard the two men faced one another then the forkbeard said cut him loose it was done give him a swordsaid the forkbeard this too was done and the men and the girl too hilda stepped back clearing a circle for the two men thorgard gripped the hilt of the sword it was cloudy you were always a fool said thorgard to the forkbeard no man is without his weakness said ivar suddenly crying with rage his beard wild behind him thorgard of scagnar a mighty foe now armed rushed upon the forkbeard who fended away the blow i could tell the weight of the stroke by the way it fell on the blade and how the forkbeards blade responded to it thorgard was an immensely strong man i had little doubt that he could beat the arm of a man to weakness and then when it was slowed tired no longer able to respond with sureness with reflexive swiftness in a great attack he would hack through to the body i had seen such men fight before once the sheer weight of the attackers blows had turned and driven interposed his opponents sword half through the mans own neck but i did not think the forkbeard would weary on his own ship he not unoften drew oar he accepted the driving blows like iron thunderbolts on his own blade turning them aside but he struck little hilda her hand before her mouth eyes frightened watched this war of two so mighty combatants too of course the weight of such blows particularly with the long heavy swords of torvaldsland take their toll from the striking arm as well as the fending arm suddenly thorgard stepped back the forkbeard grinned at him the forkbeard was not weakened thorgard stepped back another step warily the forkbeard followed him i saw stress in the eyes of thorgard and for the first time apprehension he had spent much strength it is i who am the fool said thorgard you could not know said the forkbeard then ivar forkbeard as we followed step by step drove thorgard back for more than a hundred yards did he drive him back blow following blow they stopped once regarding one another there seemed to be now little doubt as to the outcome of the battle then we followed further even up the slope of the valley and to a high place cliffed which overlooked thassa it puzzled me that the forkbeard had not yet struck the final blow at last his back to the cliff thorgard of scagnar could retreat no further he could no longer lift his arm behind him green and beautifill stretched thassa the sky was cloudy there was a slight wind which moved his hair and beard strike said thorgard on thassa some hundreds of yards offshore were ships one of these i noted was black sleen the ship of thorgard gorm had told us that some of his men had escaped they had managed to flee to the ship and make away beside me agonized i saw the eyes of hilda strike said thorgard it would have been a simple blow the men of ivar forkbeaard were stunned ivar returned to us i slipped he said gorm and others ran to the cliff thorgard seizing his opportunity had turned and plunged to the waters below we could see him swimming from black sleen we saw a small boat being lowered rowing toward him it was careless of me admitted the forkbeard hilda crept to him and knelt before him she put her head softly to his feet and then lifted her head and tears in her eyes looked up at him a girl is grateful she said my jarl to the pen with you wench said the forkbeard yes she said my jarl yes she leapt up when she turned about the forkbeard dealt her a mighty blow swift and stinging with the flat of his sword she was after all only a common bondmaid she cried out startled sobbing and stumbled more than a dozen steps before she regained her balance then she turned and sobbing laughing cried out joyfully i love you my jarl i love you he raised the weapon again flat side threatening her and she turned and laughing sobbing only one of his girls fled to the pen the forkbeard and i and the others returned to the tents of thorgard of scagnar svein blue tooth was there we saw in a long line shackled fur matted kurii being herded with spear butts through the camp the bridge of jewels worked well said svein blue tooth to ivar forkbeard hundreds fleeing were slain by our archers arrows of torvaldsland found the slaughter pleasing did any escape inquired ivar the blue tooth shrugged several he said but i think the men of torvaldsland now need fear little the return of any kur army i thought what he said doubtless true single or scattered kurii might as before forage south but i did not think they would again regroup in vast numbers they had learned and so too had the men of torvaldsland that men could stand against them this fact red with blood of both beasts and men had been demonstrated in a remote valley of the north i smiled to myself the demonstration would not have been lost either on the advanced kurii of the steel worlds it was ironic i tarl cabot who had abandoned the service of priestkings had yet in this far place been instrumental in their work the forkbeard and i it had been who had found the arrow of war in the torvaldsberg who had touched it to other arrows which in hundreds of villages and camps over thousands of square pasangs of rugged inletcleft terrain had been carried to the free men of the north that they might fetch their weapons rally and shoulder to shoulder do battle and too i had fought it was strange as it seemed to me that it should be so i thought of golden misk the priestking of once long ago when his antennae had touched the palms of my uplifted hands and nest trust had been pledged between us then i dismissed the thought i saw to one side large hrolf from the east who had fought with us he leaning on his spear we knew little of him but he had fought well what else need one know of a man what is to be done with these captive kurii i asked svein blue tooth indicating the line of imprisoned beasts some wounded being driven past us survivors of the slaughter on the bridge of jewels we shall break the teeth from their jaws he said we shall tear the claws from their paws they suitably chained will be used as beasts of burden the great plan of the others of the kurii of the steel worlds their most profound and brilliant probe of the defenses of priestkings had failed native kurii bred from ships survivors over centuries would not it seemed if limited to the primitive weapons permitted men be capable of conquering gor isolating the priestkings in the sardar until they could be destroyed or alternatively be used to lure the priestkings into a position where they would be forced to betray their own weapons laws arming men which would be dangerous or utilizing their own significant technology thereby perhaps revealing the nature location and extent oftheir power information that might then be exploited at a later date by the strategists of the steel worlds the plan had been brilliant though careless of the value if any placed on kurii life i supposed native kurii did not command the respect of the educated trained kurii of the ships they were regarded perhaps as a different lesser or inferior breed expendable in the strategems of their betters the failure of the kurii invasion of course moved the struggle to a new dimension i wondered what plans now alternate plans doubtless formed years or centuries ago would now be implemented perhaps already such plans were afoot i looked at the ragged line of defeated shackled kurii they had failed but already i suspected kurii fresh brilliant calculating masters in the steel worlds in their command rooms their map rooms and strategy rooms were even before the ashes in this remote valley in the north had cooled engaged in the issuance of orders i looked about at the field of battle under the cloudy sky new coded instructions doubtless had already been exchanged among the distant steel worlds the kur is a tenacious beast it seems well equipped by its remote savage evolution to be a dominant life form ivar forkbeard and svein blue tooth might congratulate themselves on their victory i myself more familiar with kurii with the secret wars of priestkings suspected that men had not yet heard the last of such beasts but these thoughts were for others not for bosk of port kar not for tarl red hair let others fight for priestkings let others do war let others concern themselves with such struggles if i had had any duty in these matters long ago i had discharged it suddenly for the first time since i had left port kar my left arm my left leg the left side of my body felt suddenly cold and numb for an instant i could not move them i nearly fell then it passed my forehead was covered with sweat the poison of the blade of tyros lurked yet in my system i had come north to avenge the slaying of the wench telima this resolution the hatred had driven me yet it seemed i had failed in my pouch now lay the armlet which hohak had given me in port kar that found where telima had been attacked i had failed are you all right asked ivar yes i said i have found your bow and your arrows said gorm they were among weapons in the loot i am grateful i said i strung the bow and drew it and unstrung it i slipped the quiver with its arrows flight and sheaf over my left shoulder in four days when supplies can be gathered said svein blue tooth we shall have a great feast for this has been a great victory yes i said let us have a great feast for this has been a great victory chapter the note the kur came that night the night of the battle in the light of torches ringed by men with spears it held in sign of truce over its head the two parts of a broken ax many men stood about armed several with torches down a hall of men standing in the field came the kur it stopped before svein blue tooth and ivar forkbeard who on seats of rock awaited it ivar chewing on a vulo wing motioned hilda and gunnhild pudding and honey cake who naked and collared his girls knelt about him to withdraw they crept back bondmaids behind him their flesh was in the shadows they knelt at the feet of the two leaders the kur laid the pieces of the broken ax then it surveyed the grouping to the astonishment of all the beast did not address itself to the two leaders it came and stood before me with one hand i thrust leah to one side i stood the lips of the beast drew back from its teeth it towered over me it did not speak it reached into a pouch slung over its shoulder and handed me a paper rolled bound incongruously with a ribbon then the beast went to svein blue tooth and ivar forkbeard and there from the ground at their feet lifted again the two parts of the ax there were angry cries from the men spears were lowered but svein blue tooth regal stood the peace of the camp is on him he said again the lips of the kur drew back from its teeth then holding the pieces of the ax over his head he departed escorted by armed men from the fire to the edge of the camp past the guards the eyes of those of the camp in the torchlight were upon me i stood holding the piece of paper rolled bound with its ribbon i looked at leah standing back the light of the torches felicitous and provocative on her flesh her eyes were terrified she trembled her breasts in her agitation rose and fell her hand at them i smiled women fear kurii terribly i was pleased that i had not given her clothing she looked at me her collar became her kneel slave i said swiftly leah the slave girl obeyed the word of a free man i opened the note and unrolled it where is the skerry of vars i asked it is five pasangs to the north said ivar forkbeard and two pasangs offshore take me there i said very well he said i crumpled the note i threw it away but inside the note curled within it was a length of hair long and blond it was the hair of telirna i put it in my pouch chapter what occurred on the skerry of vars the girl approached me she wore a long gown white she threw back the hood she shook loose the long blond hair i have been a fool i said i have come to the north thinking you slain i had come north in fury tricked to avenge you it was near dusk she faced me it was necessary she said speak i told her the skerry of vars is roughly a hundred foot gorean square it is rough but on the whole flat it rises some fif teen to twenty feet from the water it is grayish rock bleak upthrust igneous forbidding we stood alone facing one another are you unarmed she asked yes i told her i have arranged this meeting she said speak i told her it is not i she smiled who wish to speak to you i had supposed as much i said does samos know of this i asked he knows nothing she said you are acting then independently i asked yes she said drawing herself up beautifully i wondered if she were wise to stand so beautifully before a gorean warrior you fled my house i said you returned to the marshes she tossed her head you sought talena she said talena once i said was my companion telima shrugged she looked at me irritably i had forgotten how beautiful she was when i in the hall of samos before leaving for the northern forests to seek talena learned of your flight i wept always she said you were weak then she said we have more important things to discuss i regarded her in the marshes she said i was contacted by kurii she looked at me they desire peace she said i smiled it is true she said angrily doubtless she said you find it difficult to believe but they are sincere there has been war for centuries they weary of strife they need an envoy one known to priestkings yet one independent of them one whom they respect a man of valiance and judgment with whom to negotiate one to carry their proposals to priestkings i thought you knew little of these matters i said what little i know said telima is more than enougn in the marshes was i contacted by a mighty kur but one courteous one strong and gentle it would be difficult to speak directly with you it would be difficult to begin this work if priestkings understood our enterprise and so i said you pretended to be slain in the marshes a kur was seen your screams were heard a bloodied armlet bloodied hair was found on the rence the kur departed north i as expected informed of this deed took pursuit and now she smiled you are here it is the first act in the drama wherewith peace will be purchased between warring peoples your plan said i was brilliant in the gown long and white flowing telima straightened glowing your raiment said i is of high quality there is little like that in the rence the kurii misunderstood she said are a gentle people they have treated me as a ubara i looked now beyond telima i saw now head first then shoulders then body a kur climbing to the surface of the skerry it was large even for a kur some nine feet in height its weight i conjectured was some eight or nine hundred pounds its arms were some seven feet m length about its left arm was a spiral band of gold it carried on its shoulder a large long flattish object wrapped in purple cloth dark in the dusk i knew the kur it had been he who had addressed the assembly it had been he who had been first in the hall of svein blue tooth the night of the attack it had been he who had rallied the kurii in the raid on their camp in the ensuing battle it had been he doubtless a kur from the steel worlds themselves who had commanded the kurii army who had been the leader of their forces i inclined my head to it we have met before have we not i asked the kur rested back on its haunches some twenty feet from me it laid the large flattish object wrapped in dark cloth on the stone before him may i present inquired telima rog emissary of peace from the kurii are you tarl cabot asked the beast yes i said have you come unarmed it asked yes i said we have sought you before it said once in port kar by poison yes i said that attempt failed it said that is true i said he unwrapped the object which lay before him the woman has told you my name is rog that is sufficient yet my true name could not be pronounced in your mouth yet you shall hear it it then regarding me uttered a sound a modulated emanation from the cords in its throat which i could not duplicate it was not a human noise that it said is whom you face it is unfortunate that you do not know the ways of kurii or the dynasties of our clans in my way to use concepts you may grasp i am a prince among my people not only in blood but by battle for in such a way only does one become prince among the kurii i have been trained in leadership and have in assuming such a leadership killed for the rings i say this that you may understand that it is much honor that is done to you the kurii know you and though you are a human an animal this honor they do to you he now lifted the object from the cloth it was a kur ax its handle some eight feet in length the broad head better than two feet in sharpened width you are a brilliant foe said i i have admired your strategies your efficiency and skills the rally at the camp misdirecting our attention by a diversion was masterful that you should stand first among such beasts as kurii says much for your worth the terribleness of your power your intellect though i am only human neither kur nor priestking i give you salute i wish it said tarl cabot i had known you better it stood there then the ax in its right fist telima eyes wide with horror screamed with his left paw the beast brushed her rolling and sprawling twenty feet across the stone it lifted the ax now over its right shoulder gripping it in both hands had you known me better said i you would not have come to the skerry the ax drew back to the terrnination of its arc ready for the flashing circular flattish sweep that would cut me in two then the beast stopped puzzled scarcely had it seen the flash of tuchuk steel the saddle knife its blade balanced nine inches in length which had slipped from my sleeve turned and hurled struck him it tottered eyes wild not understanding then understanding the hilt protruding from its chest stopped only by the guard the blade fixed in the vast eightvalved heart it took two steps forward then it fell the ax clattering on the stone it rolled on its back long ago at a banquet in turia kamchak of the tuchuks had taught me this trick where one may not go armed there it is well to go armed the huge chest shook i saw it rise and fall its eyes turned toward me i thought it said humans were honorable you are mistaken i said it reached out its paw toward me foe it said yes i said the paw gripped me and i it long ago in the sardar misk the priestking had told me that priestkings see little difference between kurii and men that they regarded them as equivalent species the lips of the kur drew back i saw the fangs it was i suppose a frightening expression terrifying but i did not see it that way it was a kur smile then it died i rose to my feet and regarded telima she stood some ten feet away her hand before her mouth i have something for you i told her from my pouch i withdrew the golden armlet which had been hers it had been that which presented to me in port kar bloodied had lured me to the north seeking to avenge her she placed the golden armlet on her upper left arm i shall return to the rence she said i have something else for you i told her come here she approached me from my pouch i drew forth a leather kur collar with its lock and sewn in leather its large rounded ring what is it she asked apprehensively i took it behind her neck and then closing it about her throat thrust the large flattish bolt snapping it into the locking breech the two edges of metal bordered by the leather fitted closely together the collar is some three inches in height the girl must keep her chin up it is the collar of a kur cow i told her no she cried i turned her about and taking a pair of the rude iron slave bracelets of the north black and common which which bondmaids are cormnonly secured locked her wrists behind her back i then with the bloodied quiva the tuchuk saddle knife cut her clothes from her then by a length of binding fiber looped double in the ring of her collar tied her on her knees to the toot of the kur then with the knife i knelt at the kurs throat tarl tarl red hair i heard call it was ivar forkbeard i could see the longboat four torches uplifted in it men at the oars putting in to the skerry i stood on the surface of the skerry then i went down to meet the boat finding my way among the rocks on the tiny rock promontory footing the skerry some eight or nine feet in width i met ivar forkbeard and his men with him were gorm ottar and wulfstan of torvaldsland the torches were lifted the men lifted i lifted the head of the kur in my right hand over my head in my belt was thrust the spiral ring of gold taken from its arm to my belt too looped twice about it was the length of binding fiber which went to the ring on telimas collar she knelt to my left a bit behind rne on the stone i have here three objects i said acquired on the skerry the head of a kur he who was commander of the kur army a spiral ring of gold taken as loot from his carcass and a slave girl i threw the head into the longboat i then threw the ring after it then unlooping the bindmg fiber from my belt but leaving it looped double in her collar ring with its loose ends i crossed telimas ankles and tied them together her wrists were still confined behmd her back in the rude black bracelets of the north with their one heavy link i carried her wading on the stones to the side of the longboat she looked at me then i threw her into the boat between the feet of the oarsmen chapter drink to the honor of tyros permit me to kiss you master begged leah she snuggled against me she was naked on the rough bench of the north my right arm was about her holding her to me in my right hand held in its grip of golden wire was a great horn of steaming mead the girl in her need pressed herself against the coarse woolen tunic of torvaldsland i looked down into her uplifted eyes pleading it was the need of a slave girl i turned from her and drank she sobbed i laughed and turned toward her i looked into the large dark eyes moist about her throat she wore the north s collar of black iron riveted then our lips met mead was replenished in the drinking horn by a darkhaired bondmaid who filled it head down shyly not looking at me she was the only one in the hall who was not stripped though to be sure her kirtle by order of her master was high on her hips and over the shoulders was split to the belly like any other wench on her neck riveted was a simple collar of black iron she had worn a kur collar before and with hundreds of others had been rescued from the pens the fixing of the kur collar it had been decided by svein blue tooth was equivalent to the fixing of the metal collar and in itself was sufficient to reduce the subject to slavery which condition deprives the subject of legal status and rights attached thereto such as the right to stand in companionship accordingly to her astonishment bera who had been the companion of svein blue tooth discovered suddenly that she was only one wench among others from a line as part of his spoils the blue tooth picked her out she had displeased him mightily in recent years yet was the blue tooth fond of the arrogant wench it was not until he had switched her like any other girl that she understood that their relationship had undergone a transformation and that she was truly precisely what she seemed to be now his bondmaid no longer would her dour presence deprive his feasts of joy no longer would she in her free womans scorn shower contempt on bondmaids trying to make them ashamed of their beauty she too now was no more than they she now had new tasks to which to address herself cooking and churning and carrying water the improvement of her own carriage and beauty and attractiveness and the giving of inordinate pleasure in the furs to her master svein blue tooth jarl of torvaldsland if she did not do so well she knew as an imbonded wench that others would it was not indeed until her reduction to slavery that she realized for the first time how fine a male how attractive and how powerful was svein blue tooth whom she had for years taken for granted seeing him objectively for the first time from the perspective of a slave girl who is nothing herself and comparing him with other free men she realized suddenly how mighty how splendid and magnificent he truly was she set herself diligently to please him in service and in pleasure and if he would permit it in love bera went to the next man to fill his cup with mead from the heavy hot tankard gripped with cloth which she carried she was sweating she was barefoot the bondmaid was happy i drank the wench leah again pressed herself against me i looked down upon her you are a wanton slave i said she looked up at me laughing a girl in a collar is not permitted inhibitions she said it was true slave girls must reveal their sexual nature totally do they not do so they are beaten on earth leah had been a prim girl reserved even haughty and formal i had forced these truths from her but on gor as with others of her ilk such lies and false dignities were not permitted her on gor should the girl be so unfortunate as to fall into slavery the total depth of her needs her sensations her deepest and most concealed sensualities must expose themselves helplessly to the master even though he may if he choose mock her cruelly to her misery for her vulnerabilities an example will make this clear every woman of glandular normality has an occasional desire often frightening her to writhe lasciviously naked before a powerful male should she miserably fall to slavery the passion dance of a nude slave girl will surely be among the least of what is commanded of her consider then the plight of the girl she is forced to her shame to do what she has for years in the secret heart of her yearned to do but how helpless how vulnerable she is the dance ended she falls to the sand or tiles has she pleased him she can do no more she looks up her pride is gone like her clothing save for brand and collar stripped away there are tears in her eyes she is at his mercy if he repudiates her she is shamed she has failed as a female probably she will be sold in disgust but if she discovers to her terror that she has pleased him and he gestures her to him she knows that she after such a performance cannot be respected but can be only a slave in his arms she has danced as a slave she will be used as a slave she is a slave leah looked up at me i kissed her again full on her rouged slave mouth she kissed well trembling and earlier too she had danced well and then too later at first given no choice then excited helplessly aroused unrestrainable abandoned uncontrollable had performed superbly serving me well in the furs i looked down upon her eyes moist she lifted her lips eagerly to mine i kissed her again i was pleased that the forkbeard had given her to me i would speak called svein blue tooth rising to his feet lifting a horn of mead outlawry said he once proclaimed by the hall of blue tooth against the person of ivar forkbeard he of forkbeards landfall is herewith in this hall in this place in the name of svein blue tooth jarl of torvaldsland lifted there was a great cheer charges appertaining thereto roared the blue tooth spilling mead are revoked there were more cheers among the ashes the blackened fallen timbers of the blue tooths razed hall amidst which the benches and tables of the feast were set many were the lamps bowls on spears which burned and torches too and brightly glowed the long fire in the hall over which tarsk and bosk crackling and glistening with hot fat roasted turned heavily on spits by eager laughing bondmaids svein blue tooth and i said ivar forkbeard rising spilling hilda from his lap have had our differences there was much laughter the forkbeard had had a price on his head the blue tooth had sought his life doubtless said he it is possible we shall have them again there was again much laughter for a man to be great needs great enemies great foes the forkbeard then lifted his mead to svein blue tooth you are a great man svein blue tooth said he and you have been a great enemy i shall now said the blue tooth if it be within my power prove to be so good a friend then the blue tooth climbed to the tables top and stood there and the forkbeard astonished climbed too to the surface of the table then the men strode to one another meeting one another and weeping embraced few eyes i think in the ruins of that hall under the torchlight beneath the stars the height of the torvaldsberg in the distance illuminated in the light of the three moons were dry svein blue tooth his arms about the forkbeard cried out hoarsely know this that from this day forward ivar forkbeard stands among the jarls of torvaldsland we stood and cheered the fortune the honor that the blue tooth did unto the forkbeard ivar no longer outlaw now stood among the jarls of the north spear blades rang on shields i stood proudly strong in my happiness for the fortune of my friend but as the men cried out and cheered and the weapons clashed on shields i looked to a place in the hall where mounted on a great stake was the huge savage head of the kur which i had slain on the skerry of vars for a man to be great had said ivar forkbeard he must need great enemies i looked at the huge somber shaggy head of the kur mounted on its stake some eight feet from the ground i wondered if men truly knew how great their enemies were and i wondered if men in ways so weak so puny were adequate to such foes the kur it seemed to me in virtue of its distant doubtless harsh evolution was well fitted to be a dominant form of life it would prove indeed to be a great foe i wondered if man could be so great a foe if he in his own terribleness his ferocity his intelligence could match such a beast on his own worlds in a sense man had no natural enemies save perhaps himself i regarded the huge somber head of the kur now he had one a predator a foe could man be a match for such a beast i wondered on what might be the magnitude of man gifts cried ivar forkbeard his men bearing boxes trunks bulging sacks came forward they spilled the contents of these containers before the table it was the loot of the temple of kassau and the sapphires of schendi which had figured in the wergild imposed upon him by svein blue tooth in the days of his outlawry knee deep in the riches waded ivar and laughing hurled untold wealth to those in the hall then his men too distributed the riches then too naked slave girls were ordered to the riches to scoop up sapphires in goblets and carry them about the tables serving them to the men kneeling head down arms extended as though they might be wine and the warriors iaughing reached into the cups and seized jewels i saw hrolf from the east the giant mysterious torvaldslander take one jewel from the goblet proffered him kneeling by a naked collared beauty he slipped it in his pouch as a souvenir ivar forkbeard himself came to me and pressed into my hand a sapphire of schendi thank you said ivar forkbeard i too slipped the sapphire into my pouch to me too it was rich with meaning ivar called svein blue tooth when the loot was distributed pointing to hilda who in her collar stripped cuddled at the forkbeards side are you not too going to give away that pretty little trinket no laughed the forkbeard this pretty little trink this pretty little bauble i keep for myself he then took hilda in his arms and holding her across his body kissed her she melted to him in the fantastic total yielding of the slave girl guests shouted a man guests to enter the hall svein blue tooth we looked to where once had stood the mighty portals the hall of svein blue tooth bid them welcome said the blue tooth and he himself left the table taking a bowl of water and towel to meet the guests at the portal refresh yourselves said he to them and enter two men with followers acknowledged the greeting svein blue tooth they washed their hands and their faces and they came foward i stood we have sought you said samos of port kar i had feared we might be too late i did not speak he turned to regard the huge shaggy head of the kur mounted on its stake what is this he asked grendel i said to him i do not understand he said it is a joke i said beside me naked in her collar leah shrank back her hand before her mouth i look at her yes i said she had been of earth a free girl until brought as a slave to gor she understood my meaning new understanding new recognition figured in her eyes the wars of priestkings and others the kurii were of an cient standing i did not know nor i suppose did others outside the nest when the first contacts had been made the first probes initiated the first awareness registered on the part of priestkings that there were visitors within their system strangers at the gates intruders dangerous and unwelcome threatening bent upon the acquisition of territories planetary countries it seemed to me not unlikely that the grendel of legend had been a kur a survivor perhaps of a forced landing or a decimated scouting party perhaps even as a punishment perhaps for impermissible murder or for violation of ships discipline he had been put to shore marooned how is it that you have sought me i asked the poison said he that which lay upon the blades of the men of sarus of tyros lurks yet in your body there is no antidote i told him this i had from iskander of turia who knew the toxin warrior said the man who stood with samos i bring the antidote you are sarus of tyros i said you sought my capture my life we have fought as foes in the forests speak said samos to sarus sarus regarded me he was a lean man hard scarred with clear eyes he was not of high family in tyros but had risen through the ranks to captainship in tyros his accent was not of high caste it had been formed on the jetties of the island ubarate of cliffed tyros where he had for years i had learned led gangs of ruffians caught he had been dragged before chenbar the sea sleen for sentencing to impalement rather chenbar had liked the looks of him and had had him taught the sword swiftly given his skills and intelligence had the young rugged brigand risen in the service of the ubar they were as brothers there was i was sure no man in tyros more loyal to her ubar than sarus it was to him as soon as chenbar freed of the dungeon of port kar to which i had seen him consigned had returned to tyros that the task had been given to hunt and capture the ubar of ar marlenus and an admiral of port kar bosk of these matters i have elsewhere written the weapons of my men and myself unknown to us before we left tyros said he were treated with a toxin of the compounding of sullius maximus once a ubar of port kar sullius maximus had been one of the five ubars of port kar whose reigns dividing the city had been terminated when the council of captains under the leadership of samos first captain of port kar had assumed the sovereignty the others had been chung nigel eteocles and henrius sevarius the last of which however had ruled in name only the true power being controlled by his uncle claudius acting in the role of regent eteocles had fled i had known him last to be in terraced cos an advisor to her ubar gross lurius of the cosian city of jad nigel and chung were in port kar though now only as powerful captains high in her council they had fought against the united fleets of tyros and cos and without their help doubtless port kar could not have won the great victory of the th of sekara in the first year of the reign of the council of captains in the year contasta ar from the founding of ar claudius who had been regent for henrius sevarius and had slain his father and sought the life of the boy had been slain by a young seaman a former slave named fish in my house the whereabouts of henrius sevarius on whose head a price had been set were unknown to the council of captains the boy named fish incidentally was still in my service in port kar he now called himself henrius sullius maximus most cultured ofthe former ubars of port kar a chemist and poet and poisoner had sought refuge in tyros it had been granted him i swear to you that this is so said sarus we of tyros are warriors and we do not deal in poisons upon my return to tyros sullius inquired if our foes had been wounded and i informed him that indeed we had struck you drawing blood his laughter as if demented he turning away alarmed me i forced the truth from him i was in agony it was to you that my men and myself those who survived owed their lives marlenus would have carried us to ar for mutilation and public impalement you were magnanimous honoring us as warriors and sword brothers i demanded an antidote laughing sullius maximus adjusting his cloak informed me that there was none i determined to slay him and then take ship to port kar that you might then if you chose cut my throat with your own hands when my blade lay at the heart of the poisoner chenbar my ubar aroused by his weeping bade me desists swiftly did i inform my ubar of the shame that sullius maximus had wrought upon the ubarate i have ridded you of an enemy cried sullius be grateful reward mepoison said chenbar is the weapon of women not warriors you have dishonored me let me live cried the poisoner do you sarus retain the poisoned steel inquired my ubar yes my ubar replied i in ten days wretched sullius decreed my ubar your flesh will be cut with the steel of sarus on the tenth day if you would again move your body of your own will it would be well for you to have devised an antidote sullius maximus then shaken whitefaced tottering was hurried by guards to his chambers his vials and chemicals sarus smiled he removed a vial from his pouch it contained a purplish fluid has it been tested asked samos on the body of sullius maximus said sarus on the tenth day on his arms and legs and twice transversely across his right cheekbone that his face be scarred and his shame known i drew the poisoned blade drawing blood with each stroke i smiled sullius maximus was a handsome man extremely vain even foppish he would not appreciate the alteration of his physiognomy wrought by the blade of sarus within seconds said sarus the spiteful fluid took its effect the eyes of sullius were wild with fear the antidote the antidote he begged we sat him in a curule chair vested as a ubar and left him we wished the poison to work to be truly fixed within his system the next day when the bar of noon was struck on the wharves we administered to him the antidote it was effective he is now again in the court of chenbar much chastened but serving again as laureate and advisor he is not much pleased incidentally with the scarring of his countenance much amusement on account of it is taken at his expense by his fellows of the court he holds little affection for you or for me bosk of port kar he called you bosk of port kar said ivar forkbeard standing near me i smiled it is a name i am sometimes known by i said sarus proffered to me the vial i took it there is i discover attendant upon its assimilation said sarus of tyros delirium and fever but in the end the body finds itself freed of both poison and antidote i give it to you bosk of port kar and with it the apologies of my ubar chenbar and those of myself a seaman in his service i am surprised i said that chenbar the sea sleen is so solicitous of my welfare sarus laughed he is not solicitous of your welfare warrior he is solicitous rather of the honor of tyros little would please chenbar more than to meet you with daggers on the fighting circle of tyros he owes you much a defeat and chains and a dungeon and he has a long memory my ubar no he is not solicitous of your welfare if anything he wants you well and strong that he may meet you evenly with cold steel and you sarus i inquired i said sarus simply am solicitous of your welfare bosk of port kar you gave on the coast of thassa freedom and life to me and my men i shall not ever forget this you were a good leader i said to bring your men some wounded from high on thassas coast to tyros sarus looked down there is place in my house in port kar i said for one such as you if you wish to serve me my place said sarus is in tyros then he said drink bosk of port kar and restore the honor of chenbar and the honor of sarus and of tyros i removed the stopper from the vial it may itself be poison said samos i smelled it it smelled sweet not unlike a syrup of turia yes i said it may be it was true what samos had said it could be indeed that i held in my hand not an antidote but a lethal dose of some unknown toxin i thought of turia of its baths and wines the plan of tyros might thus foiled upon the coast of thassa be in ef ect accomplished in the hall of svein blue tooth at least with respect to him known as bosk of port kar do not drink it said the forkbeard to me but i had felt after the battle again in my body the effects of the poison though briefly i had ittie doubt but that it still linger d in my body i had little doubt but that in time it would again force me to the blankets and chair of a recluse in a hall in port kar if not countered it would eventually doubtless have its way i shall drink it i told ivar forkbeard the forkbeard looked upon sarus of tyros if he dies he said your death will be neither swift nor pleasant i am your hostage said sarus you you called sarus of tyros said ivar you drink first there is not enough said sarus of tyros chain him said the forkbeard chains were brought sarus of tyros i said to ivar is a guest in the hall of svein blue tooth the chains were not placed on sarus i lifted the vial to sarus of tyros i drink i said i drink to the honor of tyros then i downed the contents of the vial chapter i take ship from the north slave girls naked carrying burdens loaded the ship of ivar forkbeard the hilda moored at the wharf of the thing fields we stood on the wooden boards of the wharf will you not return to port kar with sarus and myself asked samos i think said i smiling i will take ship south with ivar forkbeard for i have yet to learn to break the jarls axs gambit perhaps said samos when you reach port kar we may talk of weighty matters i smiled perhaps i said i think said samos that i detect a difference in you i think that here somehow in the north you have found yourself i shrugged a seaman dragged telima by the arm before us she was stripped her hair was before her face her wrists were fastened behind her by the rude bracelets of the north the kur collar leather some three inches in height hoding her chin up with its ring was still on her throat she had spent the last five days chained in a small log slave kennel she looked at samos and then swiftly lowered her eyes he looked upon the vulnerable stripped girl with fury he knew well now what had been her role her willing role in the plan of the kurii i will see that she is well punished he said you are speaking of one of my slave girls i said ah he said i will see that she is punished i said she looked at me there was fear in her eyes put her on the ship i said to the seaman he thrust her ahead of him stumbling up the narrow gangplank and put her on the ship in port kar i would remove the kur collar and put her in one of my own i would too have her beaten afterwards she would serve in my house as one of my slave girls about my forehead i wore a jarls talmit this morning svein blue tooth before cheering men had tied it about my head tarl red hair had said he with this talmit accede to jarlship in torvaldsland i had been lifted on the shields of shouting men in the distance i had seen the torvaldsberg and to the west gleaming thassa never before had said svein blue tooth has one not of the north been named jarl amongst us there had been much shouting much clashing of weapons conscious i was indeed of the signal honor seen fit to be bestowed upon me i had lifted my hands to them standing on the shields a jarl of torvaldsland one who might now in his own name if need be send forth the arrow of war sumrnoning adherents one who might as it pleased him comrnand ships and men one who might now say to the rough bold seamen of the north as it pleased him follow me there is work to be done and whom they would then follow gathering weapons opening the sheds sliding their ships on rollers to the sea raising the masts spreading the striped sails to the wind saying our jarl has summoned us let us aid him there is work to be done i am grateful said i to svein blue tooth i wish you well bosk of port kar said samos tarl cabot said i to him he smiled i wish you well tarl cabot he said i wish you well samos said i i wish you well warrior said sarus i too wish you well warrior said i sarus of tyros samos and sarus turned about and left the wharf they were going to the ship of samos on which they had come north coast gulls screamed overhead the air was sharp and clear the sky was very blue i watched the girls loading the ship aelgifu or pudding passed me and then gunnhild and olga bent under boxes carried on their backs pouting lips and pretty ankles returned from the ship down the gangplank barefoot to fetch more burdens hilda bent over a heavy sack of salt over her shoulders staggered up the gangplank thyri returned down the gangplank a yoke on her shoulders from which dangled two empty baskets on ropes she had been carrying tospits and vegetables to the deck locker to fill it wulfstan once of kassau now of torvaldsland in charge of supplying the ship leaned over the rail fetch more tospits slave girl he called yes master said thyri i saw rollo board the ship he carried a great ax weapons a sleenskin bag filled with gear he was the first of the oarsmen to board now came slave girls bearing skins of water they walked slowly bent over placing each step carefully that they not lose thelr balance heavy skins bulging and damp across their shoulders i saw honey cake among them and the forkbeards golden girl the southern silk girl too she labormg as any other bondmaid i do not think that in the south she had been forced so to work she staggered hurry said the girl behind her or we will be beaten the girl moaned and staggered to the gangplank and slowly foot by foot her bare feet pressed by the weight deeply into the rough boards climbed carrying her burden to the deck of the shlp among the girls too i saw bera she one of the blue tooths girls one of several who had been placed under the orders of wulfstan to assist in the loading she was naked the other girls resenting the tunic she had been given had stripped her svein blue tooth had laughed masters do not interfere in the squabbles of slaves i looked up at the sky it was very blue for more than a day i had lain in fever in delirium while in my body had been fought the battle of poison and antidote i had sweated and cried out and raged but in the end i had thrown the furs from me i want meat i had said and a woman the forkbeard who had sat near me through the hours of the lonely contest clasped me about the shoulders he had ordered roast bosk and hot milk and then yellow bread and paga then when i had finished leah had been thrown to my feet i walked up the gangplank and stood on the decking looking out to sea there was a sweet wind on thassa my delirium this time interestingly to me had been much different than it had when long ago the poison had first raged in my body at that time i had been miserable and weak even calling out to a woman who was only a slave to love me but somehow in the north in torvaldsland i had changed this i knew there was a different tarl cabot than ever there had been once there had been a boy by this name one with simple dreams naive vain one shattered by a betrayal of his codes the discovery of a weakness where he had thought there was only strength that boy had died in the delta of the vosk in his place had come bosk of port kar ruthless and torn but grown into his manhood and now there was another one whom i might if i wished choose to call again tarl cabot i had changed here with the forkbeard with the sea the wind in his hall and in battle i had become somehow much different in the north my blood had found itself learning itself in the north i had learned strength and how to stand alone i thought of the kurii they were terrible foes suddenly incredibly i felt love for them i recollected the head of the giant kur mounted on its stake in the ruins of the hall of svein blue tooth one cannot be weak who meets such beasts i laughed at the weaknesses instilled into the men of earth only men who are strong without weakness can meet such beasts one must match them in strength in intellect in terribleness in ferocity in the north i had grown strong i suddenly realized the supreme power of the united gorean will not divided against itself not weak not crippled like the wills of earth i telt a surge of power of unprecedented unexpected joy i had discovered what it was to be gorean i had discovered what it was truly to be male to be a man i was gorean leah boarded the ship she was barefoot i had given her a briei woolen slave tunic which came high aboul her hips it was sleeveless it was split to the belly belted with binding ber she carried in a sleenskin bag over her shoulders much ot my gear i indicated to her the bench beneath which she mlght put it she wore the black collar of the north she turned and lelt the ship going down the gangplank to fetch more of my things she walked well she knew my eyes were on her the sleek shesleen i enjoyed owning her i looked again out to sea last summer in journeying to the forests to attempt to rescue talena i had in a tavern in lydius encountered a wench once known vella elizabeth cardwell she had made a delicious paga slave i recalled her licking my lips intent on the rescue of talena not wishing to be burdened by another wench i had not yielded to the entreaties of the girl to buy her and free her what a stupid request i thought to make of a gorean male it would have occurred only to an earth girl but if elizabeth was stupid or more likely naive she was at least pretty i thought then too of talena she had been disowned by marlenus of ar but she lived now in ar sequestered she had insulted me in port kar i smiled i had left vella elizabeth cardwell slave in lydius she had once against my wishesj fled the saridar when i had wished as a foolish earthling to return her to her home planet for safety such a courageous act on her part had not been without its risks she had fallen slave i had met her in a tavern in lydius gor is a perilous world and particularly so perhaps for beautiful women it is seldom that they if not protected by a city and a home stone escape the slave collar the brand the chains of a master elizabeths act had been courageous but she had lost her wager i left her slave in lydius to the mercies of sarpedon the tavernkeeper and his customers it had been as i now thought a mistake it had been a mistake because elizabeth had been quite pretty i would have been a fool to return so pretty a wench to earth when i returned to port kar i would arrange for an agent to buy her if she had not already been sold to one who lusted for her and could pay her price i would have been a fool to return so pretty a wench to earth i mused yes i would if it were commercially feasible buy her and keep her on gor as my own slave i recalled that in my first delirium fighting the poison long ago i had wept and in my fevered ragings had begged for her comfort that she love me that seemed to me now incredible but i recalled it clearly but i had changed in the north this time in my delirium the wench i recalled had figured quite differently no longer this time did i call out to her or beg for her comfort or love this time it had seemed i had seen her on a slave block naked under torchlight guided by the whip turning for buyers i dreamed in the delirium i had purchased her do not return me to earth she had begged i will not i told her then she had looked at me with horror and i had upon my return to my house thrown her among my other slaves ivar forkbeard with great strides climbed the gangplank then laughing giggling thrilled to be soon underway approachng between two lines of seamen came his slave girls with them less pleased was the golden girl she with dark hair and earrings she dallied one of the seamen took her by the back of the neck and thrust her running stumbling half up the gangplank she too then weeping boarded the forkbeards ship on your back said a seaman to her and lift your legs ankles crossed the girl did so he put the two piece hinged double ankle ring on her this is a simple fetter without links holding the ankles crossed it does not permit the girl to rise to her feet when she had learned to be more pleasing more radiant her movements would be less restricted i had little doubt that by the time we reached port kar she would be precisely what the forkbeard wanted her to be i looked at her our eyes met she looked down tears in her eyes i had used her she was quite good but it had taken longer to arouse her than is com mon in a slave girl the forkbeard i and the crew would improve her the trip south would be long whereas it com monly takes a third of an ahn to arouse a free woman female slave is often responsive from almost the first touch of the master why this should be i do not know i suspec it is due primarily to two factors the first is psychological the collar itself and the state of bondage for no reason clear in my mind commonly transforms even the tepid free woman into an orgasmic marvel of a slave perhaps the fear to be whipped if they are not pleasing perhaps be haviorally given no choice but to act as a passionate female slave they find suddenly through simple psychological relationshlps they to their horror have become only a passionate female slave perhaps it is the knowing that they are rightless owned dominated which so deeply so incredibly trlggers the profound web of yielding piteously receptive helplessly submitting reflexes perhaps in the depth of their bodies lies the secret need to be sexually subjugated totally without which they cannot attain their full sexuality i do not know the second reason is presumably simple it is merely that the female slave abandoned responsive owned constantly at her masters beck and call ready constantly for his least pleasure is frequently used female slaves are sometimes used when the masters time permits three and four or more times a day it is not unusual to give an entire day to sport with a female slave something unthinkable with a free woman the slave girl of course has no rights she may be used for hours what counts is not her will bu her masters frequent use of the female slave i suspect keeps her body honed to submissive perfection whatever be the reasons a common female slave and one of no unusual heat for a slave will be carried through a series of multiple yieldings dozens before the average free woman can be warmed then when the master wishes scorning perhaps her helplessness in his arms despising perhaps to her misery her vulnerability to him he takes ruthlessly perhaps contemptuously his delight with her as a note it might be added that the slave female in her masters arms must if he so commands under the threat of the whip or death vocalize her sensations then ventilating and reinforcing multiplying deepening and increasing and intensifying them thus cruelly she is forced to help arouse herself and contribute to her own pleasures and consequently of course those of the master this command sometimes implicit sometimes a matter of the masters policy with his girl or girls under which she is placed to vocalize her pleasures and abundantly as well as in her abandon nudity and beauty manifest them physically guides accurately and surely the master in the detailed exploitation of her weaknesses in his depredations practiced on her body she must betray herself do not blame her no choice is given her she is an instrument of passion on which he plays delighting himself with the music of her expressions her movements her cries even the wild unrestrainable odors of her collared slave body she is forced to contribute to her own sexual subjugation do not blame her no choice is given her following the rast of the girls carrying the last of my gear came leah who stood small beside me ottar then and gorm and the other men of the forkbeard boarded the craft thyri who had boarded earlier stood near the bench of wulfstan where already he gripped an oar near the mast chained to it by the neck eyes down knelt telima moorings were cast off poles thrust the hilda from the wharf gorm held the tiller mounted at the stern on the starboard side the seamen brought their shields inboard stowed their gear beneath their benches grasped their oars slowly the tarnhead prow of the forkbeards sleek craft turned toward the sweep of thassa then oars dipped slowly the great red and white striped sail fell opening snapping from the spar of needlewood i turned back to the wharf the forkbeard and i raised our hands in salute to the men there we saw svein blue tooth the tooth of the hunjer whale stained blue on its chain about his neck he lifted his hand near him kneeling beside her master behind the line of his heels was bera one of his girls i saw toc bjarni of thorstein camp who lifted his spear to me an beside him too the young man his friend he too lifting his hand whom i had it now seemed long ago champione at the dueling field there were many men there armed and wenches too one of the seamen lifted the golden girl her crossed ankles in the fetter that she might see then he threw her back to the deck where on her stomach and elbows head down hair falling to the deck she lay i saw telima standing by the mast to which she wa chained by the neck i looked at her harshly immediately she knelt eyes down in my pouch there was a sapphire from distant schendi there too heavy and spiraled was a ring of gold which i had taken from the arm of the kur i had slain in the dis tance as the ship moved to sea the wind in its sail oar dipping l saw the bleak white heights of the torvaldsberg hrolf from the east had agreed to return the war arrow to the torvaldsberg we had given it to him when he had left the ruins of the hall of svein blue tooth i had run after him and a pasang from the camp had stopped him what is your true name i had inquired he had looked at me and smiled it was strange what he said my name he said is torvald then he had turned away i watched him return to the mountain i thought of the stabilization serums my name is torvald he had said then he had turned away ho cried ivar forkbeard striking me on the back clasping me about the shoulders it is a good wind then he turned away to his duties on the ship i walked between the benches to the prow and standing on the high decking at the stem put one arm about the prow and looked out to sea leah heeled me there i turned to face her i could see the lovely curves of the interior cleavage of her breasts revealed in the parting of the rough slave tunic i looked at the collar her eyes i pulled the tunic down from her shoulders to her waist it is your girls hope that she pleases you she said slip from the tunic i told her she untied the binding fiber belting the tunic and thrust it over her hips to her ankles and then stepped from it to my feet i told her yes master she whispered she lay on her side her head on her arm she did not look up at me i turned again to look out to sea i thought of many things of ar of marlenus of talena with whom i was not pleased when i had been crippled she had derided me she had expressed contempt pride she had then held herself too good for me i had had her returned to ar i wondered if somehow somewhere we might once again encounter one another did we do so i thought now she might find me different i pondered trying chain luck in ar i wondered how she might feel the gag hood drawn over her head from behind locked shut behind her neck stripped thrown on her back over the saddle of a tarn bound swept away with a beating of wings into total bondage publius my kitchen master i speculated might find use for such a wench in his kitchens after she had much pleased me i would see that she was assigned to publius i had little doubt that the daughter or she who had once been the daughter of marlenus of ar properly instructed by the switch would make an excellent addition to the slaves of the kitchen perhaps before i chose my wench for the night one of her duties might be to scrub the tiles of my chamber i recalled how in the forests long ago i had sought her it had been my intention to repledge the companionship and to become great on gor to raise high the chair of bosk climbing in riches and power to the heights of the planet to become even perhaps in time a worlds ubar incredibly perhaps the values wealth and power which had driven me in the forest when i had sought talena no longer seemed of much interest to me the sky now seemed more important to me and the sea and the ship beneath my feet no longer did i dream of becoming a ubar in the north i found i had changed what had driven me in the forests seemed now paltry irrelevant to the true needs the concerns of man i had been blinded by the values of civili zation everything that i had been taught had been false i had suspected this when i had stood on the heights of the torvaldsberg on a windswept rock looking upon the land beneath white and bleak and beautiful even kurii on it height stunned had stopped to gaze i had learned much in the north i looked again to sea and to the sky there were now white clouds in it somewhere beyond the fourth ring mixed in the belt of asteroids intruding within the perimeters refused to them by priestkings were the patient orbiting steel worlds this i had from samos they were nearer now somewhere above that placid sky with its swift white clouds doser now were kurii i remembered the huge head mounted upon the stake when i returned to port kar i must speak to samos i stood long at the prow then after some hours it grew dark with my foot i nudged leah at my feet she awoke she knelt and kissed my feet take your garment i told her but do not don it go to the waterproof sleenskin sleeping bag by my bench spread it on the deck between the benches then get within it and await me yes master she whispered i turned in time to see her creep feet first with a turn of her hips into the bag i passed telima chained at the mast the chain was attached to the large sturdy circular ring sewn in the locked kur collar she did not meet my eyes she knelt turning her head and putting its right side to the deck i heard the chain touch the deck i saw her hair on the sanded boards in the light of the three moons i passed her i removed my tunic i thrust it beneath the bench then wrapping my sword belt about my scabbard the blade within placed the weapon belt and scabbard within the bag that they be protected from moisture i then slipped into the bag may your slave leah
