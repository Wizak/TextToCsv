 driven from home chapter i driven from home a boy of sixteen with a small gripsack in his hand trudged along the country road he was of good height for his age strongly built and had a frank attractive face he was naturally of a cheerful temperament but at present his face was grave and not without a shade of anxiety this can hardly be a matter of surprise when we consider that he was thrown upon his own resources and that his available capital consisted of thirtyseven cents in money in addition to a good education and a rather unusual amount of physical strength these last two items were certainly valuable but they cannot always be exchanged for the necessaries and comforts of life for some time his steps had been lagging and from time to time he had to wipe the moisture from his brow with a fine linen handkerchief which latter seemed hardly compatible with his almost destitute condition i hasten to introduce my hero for such he is to be as carl crawford son of dr paul crawford of edgewood center why he had set out to conquer fortune singlehanded will soon appear a few rods ahead carls attention was drawn to a widespreading oak tree with a carpet of verdure under its sturdy boughs i will rest here for a little while he said to himself and suiting the action to the word threw down his gripsack and flung himself on the turf this is refreshing he murmured as lying upon his back he looked up through the leafy rifts to the sky above i dont know when i have ever been so tired its no joke walking a dozen miles under a hot sun with a heavy gripsack in your hand its a good introduction to a life of labor which i have reason to believe is before me i wonder how i am coming out at the big or the little end of the horn he paused and his face grew grave for he understood well that for him life had become a serious matter in his absorption he did not observe the rapid approach of a boy somewhat younger than himself mounted on a bicycle the boy stopped short in surprise and leaped from his iron steed why carl crawford is this you where in the world are you going with that gripsack carl looked up quickly going to seek my fortune he answered soberly well i hope youll find it dont chaff though but tell the honest truth i have told you the truth gilbert with a puzzled look gilbert first leaning his bicycle against the tree seated himself on the ground by carls side has your father lost his property he asked abruptly no has he disinherited you not exactly have you left home for good i have left home i hope for good have you quarreled with the governor i hardly know what to say to that there is a difference between us he doesnt seem like a roman father one who rules his family with a rod of iron no he is quite the reverse he hasnt backbone enough so it seemed to me when i saw him at the exhibition of the academy you ought to be able to get along with a father like that carl so i could but for one thing what is that i have a stepmother said carl with a significant glance at his companion so have i but she is the soul of kindness and makes our home the dearest place in the world are there such stepmothers i shouldnt have judged so from my own experience i think i love her as much as if she were my own mother you are lucky said carl sighing tell me about yours she was married to my father five years ago up to the time of her marriage i thought her amiable and sweettempered but soon after the wedding she threw off the mask and made it clear that she disliked me one reason is that she has a son of her own about my age a mean sneaking fellow who is the apple of her eye she has been jealous of me and tried to supplant me in the affection of my father wishing peter to be the favored son how has she succeeded i dont think my father feels any love for peter but through my stepmothers influence he generally fares better than i do why wasnt he sent to school with you because he is lazy and doesnt like study besides his mother prefers to have him at home during my absence she worked upon my father by telling all sorts of malicious stories about me till he became estranged from me and little by little peter has usurped my place as the favorite why didnt you deny the stories asked gilbert i did but no credit was given to my denials my stepmother was continually poisoning my fathers mind against me did you give her cause did you behave disrespectfully to her no answered carl warmly i was prepared to give her a warm welcome and treat her as a friend but my advances were so coldly received that my heart was chilled poor carl how long has this been so from the beginning ever since mrs crawford came into the house what are your relations with your stepbrother whats his name peter cook i despise the boy for he is mean and tyrannical where he dares to be i dont think it would be safe for him to bully you carl he tried it and got a good thrashing you can imagine what followed he ran crying to his mother and his version of the story was believed i was confined to my room for a week and forced to live on bread and water i shouldnt think your father was a man to inflict such a punishment it wasnt he it was my stepmother she insisted upon it and he yielded i heard afterwards from one of the servants that he wanted me released at the end of twentyfour hours but she would not consent how long ago was this it happened when i was twelve was it ever repeated yes a month later but the punishment lasted only for two days and you submitted to it i had to but as soon as i was released i gave peter such a flogging with the promise to repeat it if i was ever punished in that manner again that the boy himself was panicstricken and objected to my being imprisoned again he must be a charming fellow you would think so if you should see him he has small insignificant features a turnup nose and an ugly scowl that appears whenever he is out of humor and yet your father likes him i dont think he does though peter by his mothers orders pays all sorts of small attentions bringing him his slippers running on errands and so on not because he likes it but because he wants to supplant me as he has succeeded in doing you have finally broken away then yes i couldnt stand it any longer home had become intolerable pardon the question but hasnt your father got considerable property i have every reason to think so wont your leaving home give your stepmother and peter the inside track and lead perhaps to your disinheritance i suppose so answered carl wearily but no matter what happens i cant bear to stay at home any longer youre badly fixed thats a fact said gilbert in a tone of sympathy what are your plans i dont know i havent had time to think chapter ii a friend worth having gilbert wrinkled up his forehead and set about trying to form some plans for carl it will be hard for you to support yourself he said after a pause that is without help there is no one to help me i expect no help i thought your father might be induced to give you an allowance so that with what you can earn you may get along comfortably i think father would be willing to do this but my stepmother would prevent him then she has a great deal of influence over him yes she can twist him round her little finger i cant understand it you see father is an invalid and is very nervous if he were in perfect health he would have more force of character and firmness he is under the impression that he has heart disease and it makes him timid and vacillating still he ought to do something for you i suppose he ought still gilbert i think i can earn my living what can you do well i have a fair education i could be an entry clerk or a salesman in some store or if the worst came to the worst i could work on a farm i believe farmers give boys who work for them their board and clothes i dont think the clothes would suit you i am pretty well supplied with clothing gilbert looked significantly at the gripsack do you carry it all in there he asked doubtfully carl laughed well no he answered i have a trunkful of clothes at home though why didnt you bring them with you i would if i were an elephant being only a boy i would find it burdensome carrying a trunk with me the gripsack is all i can very well manage i tell you what said gilbert come round to our house and stay overnight we live only a mile from here you know the folks will be glad to see you and while you are there i will go to your house see the governor and arrange for an allowance for you that will make you comparatively independent thank you gilbert but i dont feel like asking favors from those who have illtreated me nor would i of strangers but dr crawford is your father it isnt right that peter your stepbrother should be supported in ease and luxury while you the real son should be subjected to privation and want i dont know but you are right admitted carl slowly of course i am right now will you make me your minister plenipotentiary armed with full powers yes i believe i will thats right that shows you are a boy of sense now as you are subject to my directions just get on that bicycle and i will carry your gripsack and we will seek vance villa as we call it when we want to be hightoned by the most direct route no no gilbert i will carry my own gripsack i wont burden you with it said carl rising from his recumbent position look here carl how far have you walked with it this morning about twelve miles then of course youre tired and require rest just jump on that bicycle and ill take the gripsack if you have carried it twelve miles i can surely carry it one you are very kind gilbert why shouldnt i be but it is imposing up on your good nature but gilbert had turned his head in a backward direction and nodded in a satisfied way as he saw a light open buggy rapidly approaching theres my sister in that carriage he said she comes in good time i will put you and your gripsack in with her and ill take to my bicycle again your sister may not like such an arrangement wont she though shes very fond of beaux and she will receive you very graciously you make me feel bashful gilbert you wont be long julia will chat away to you as if shed known you for fifty years i was very young fifty years ago said carl smiling hi there jule called gilbert waving his hand julia vance stopped the horse and looked inquiringly and rather admiringly at carl who was a boy of fine appearance let me introduce you to my friend and schoolmate carl crawford carl took off his hat politely i am very glad to make your acquaintance mr crawford said julia demurely i have often heard gilbert speak of you i hope he said nothing bad about me miss vance you may be sure he didnt if he should now i wouldnt believe him youve made a favorable impression carl said gilbert smiling i am naturally prejudiced against boys having such a brother said julia but it is not fair to judge all boys by him that is outrageous injustice said gilbert but then sisters seldom appreciate their brothers some other fellows sisters may said carl they do they do did you ever see such a vain conceited boy mr crawford of course you know him better than i do come carl its too bad for you too to join against me however i will forget and forgive jule my friend carl has accepted my invitation to make us a visit i am very glad i am sure said julia sincerely and i want you to take him in bag and baggage and convey him to our palace while i speed thither on my wheel to be sure i will and with great pleasure cant you get out and assist him into the carriage jule thank you said carl but though i am somewhat old and quite infirm i think i can get in without troubling your sister are you sure miss vance you wont be incommoded by my gripsack not at all then i will accept your kind offer in a trice carl was seated next to julia with his valise at his feet wont you drive mr crawford said the young lady dont let me take the reins from you i dont think it looks well for a lady to drive when a gentleman is sitting beside her carl was glad to take the reins for he liked driving now for a race said gilbert who was mounted on his bicycle all right replied carl look out for us they started and the two kept neck and neck till they entered the driveway leading up to a handsome country mansion carl followed them into the house and was cordially received by mr and mrs vance who were very kind and hospitable and were favorably impressed by the gentlemanly appearance of their sons friend half an hour later dinner was announced and carl having removed the stains of travel in his schoolmates room descended to the diningroom and it must be confessed did ample justice to the bounteous repast spread before him in the afternoon julia gilbert and he played tennis and had a trial at archery the hours glided away very rapidly and six oclock came before they were aware gilbert said carl as they were preparing for tea you have a charming home you have a nice house too carl true but it isnt a home to me there is no love there that makes a great difference if i had a father and mother like yours i should be happy you must stay here till day after tomorrow and i will devote tomorrow to a visit in your interest to your home i will beard the lion in his den that is your stepmother do you consent yes i consent but it wont do any good we will see chapter iii introduces peter cook gilbert took the morning train to the town of edgewood center the residence of the crawfords he had been there before and knew that carls home was nearly a mile distant from the station though there was a hack in waiting he preferred to walk as it would give him a chance to think over what he proposed to say to dr crawford in carls behalf he was within a quarter of a mile of his destination when his attention was drawn to a boy of about his own age who was amusing himself and a smaller companion by firing stones at a cat that had taken refuge in a tree just as gilbert came up a stone took effect and the poor cat moaned in affright but did not dare to come down from her perch as this would put her in the power of her assailant that must be carls stepbrother peter gilbert decided as he noted the boys mean face and turnup nose stoning cats seems to be his idea of amusement i shall take the liberty of interfering peter cook laughed heartily at his successful aim i hit her simon he said doesnt she look seared you must have hurt her i expect i did ill take a bigger stone next time he suited the action to the word and picked up a rock which should it hit the poor cat would in all probability kill her and prepared to fire put down that rock said gilbert indignantly peter turned quickly and eyed gilbert insolently who are you he demanded no matter who i am put down that rock what business is it of yours i shall make it my business to protect that cat from your cruelty peter who was a natural coward took courage from having a companion to back him up and retorted youd better clear out of here or i may fire at you do it if you dare said gilbert quietly peter concluded that it would be wiser not to carry out his threat but was resolved to keep to his original purpose he raised his arm again and took aim but gilbert rushed in and striking his arm forcibly compelled him to drop it what do you mean by that you loafer demanded peter his eyes blazing with anger to stop your fun if thats what you call it ive a good mind to give you a thrashing gilbert put himself in a position of defense sail in if you want to he responded help me simon said peter you grab his legs and ill upset him simon who though younger was braver than peter without hesitation followed directions he threw himself on the ground and grasped gilbert by the legs while peter doubling up his fists made a rush at his enemy but gilbert swiftly eluding simon struck out with his right arm and peter unprepared for so forcible a defense tumbled over on his back and simon ran to his assistance gilbert put himself on guard expecting a second attack but peter apparently thought it wiser to fight with his tongue you rascal he shrieked almost foaming at the mouth ill have you arrested what for asked gilbert coolly for flying at me like a a tiger and trying to kill me gilbert laughed at this curious version of things i thought it was you who flew at me he said what business had you to interfere with me ill do it again unless you give up firing stones at the cat ill do it as long as i like shes gone said simon the boys looked up into the tree and could see nothing of puss she had taken the opportunity when her assailant was otherwise occupied to make good her escape im glad of it said gilbert goodmorning boys when we meet again i hope you will be more creditably employed you dont get off so easy you loafer said peter who saw the village constable approaching here mr rogers i want you to arrest this boy constable rogers who was a stout broadshouldered man nearly six feet in height turned from one to the other and asked what has he done he knocked me over i want him arrested for assault and battery and what did you do i i didnt do anything that is rather strange young man what is your name gilbert vance you dont live in this town no i live in warren what made you attack peter because he flew at me and i had to defend myself is this so simon you saw all that happened ye es admitted simon unwillingly that puts a different face on the matter i dont see how i can arrest this boy he had a right to defend himself he came up and abused me the loafer said peter that was the reason you went at him yes have you anything to say asked the constable addressing gilbert yes sir when i came up i saw this boy firing stones at a cat who had taken refuge in that tree over there he had just hit her and had picked up a larger stone to fire when i ordered him to drop it it was no business of yours muttered peter i made it my business and will again did the cat have a white spot on her forehead asked the constable yes sir and was mouse colored yes sir why its my little girls cat she would be heartbroken if the cat were seriously hurt you young rascal he continued turning suddenly upon peter and shaking him vigorously let me catch you at this business again and ill give you such a warming that youll never want to touch another cat let me go cried the terrified boy i didnt know it was your cat it would have been just as bad if it had been somebody elses cat ive a great mind to put you in the lockup oh dont please dont mr rogers implored peter quite panicstricken will you promise never to stone another cat yes sir then go about your business peter lost no time but scuttled up the street with his companion i am much obliged to you for protecting floras cat then said the constable to gilbert you are quite welcome sir i wont see any animal abused if i can help it you are right there wasnt that boy peter cook yes dont you know him no but i know his stepbrother carl a different sort of boy have you come to visit him no he is visiting me in fact he has left home because he could not stand his stepmothers illtreatment and i have come to see his father in his behalf he has had an uncomfortable home dr crawford is an invalid and very much under the influence of his wife who seems to have a spite against carl and is devoted to that young cub to whom you have given a lesson does carl want to come back no he wants to strike out for himself but i told him it was no more than right that he should receive some help from his father that is true enough for nearly all the doctors money came to him through carls mother i am afraid peter and his mother wont give me a very cordial welcome after what has happened this morning i wish i could see the doctor alone so you can for there he is coming up the street gilbert looked in the direction indicated and his glance fell on a thin fragilelooking man evidently an invalid with a weak undecided face who was slowly approaching the boy advanced to meet him and taking off his hat asked politely is this dr crawford chapter iv an important conference dr crawford stopped short and eyed gilbert attentively i dont know you he said in a querulous tone i am a schoolmate of your son carl my name is gilbert vance if you have come to see my son you will be disappointed he has treated me in a shameful manner he left home yesterday morning and i dont know where he is i can tell you sir he is staying for a day or two at my fathers house where is that asked dr crawford his manner showing that he was confused in warren thirteen miles from here i know the town what induced him to go to your house have you encouraged him to leave home inquired dr crawford with a look of displeasure no sir it was only by chance that i met him a mile from our home i induced him to stay overnight did you bring me any message from him no sir except that he is going to strike out for himself as he thinks his home an unhappy one that is his own fault he has had enough to eat and enough to wear he has had as comfortable a home as yourself i dont doubt that but he complains that his stepmother is continually finding fault with him and scolding him he provokes her to do it he is a headstrong obstinate boy he never had that reputation at school sir we all liked him i suppose you mean to imply that i am in fault said the doctor warmly i dont think you know how badly mrs crawford treats carl sir of course of course that is always said of a stepmother not always sir i have a stepmother myself and no own mother could treat me better you are probably a better boy i cant accept the compliment i hope youll excuse me saying it dr crawford but if my stepmother treated me as carl says mrs crawford treats him i wouldnt stay in the house another day really this is very annoying said dr crawford irritably have you come here from warren to say this no sir not entirely perhaps carl wants me to receive him back i will do so if he promises to obey his stepmother that he wont do i am sure then what is the object of your visit to say that carl wants and intends to earn his own living but it is hard for a boy of his age who has never worked to earn enough at first to pay for his board and clothes he asks or rather i ask for him that you will allow him a small sum say three or four dollars a week which is considerably less than he must cost you at home for a time until he gets on his feet i dont know said dr crawford in a vacillating tone i dont think mrs crawford would approve this it seems to me you are the one to decide as carl is your own son peter must cost you a good deal more do you know peter i have met him answered gilbert with a slight smile i dont know what to say you may be right peter does cost me more and carl is entitled to be treated as well as he i think i ought to speak to mrs crawford about it and by the way i nearly forgot to say that she charges carl with taking money from her bureau drawer before he went away it was a large sum too twentyfive dollars that is false exclaimed gilbert indignantly i am surprised that you should believe such a thing of your own son mrs crawford says she has proof said the doctor hesitating then what has he done with the money i know that he has but thirtyseven cents with him at this time and he only left home yesterday if the money has really been taken i think i know who took it who peter cook he looks mean enough for anything what right have you to speak so of peter because i caught him stoning a cat this morning he would have killed the poor thing if i had not interfered i consider that worse than taking money i i dont know what to say i cant agree to anything till i have spoken with mrs crawford did you say that carl had but thirty seven cents yes sir i presume you dont want him to starve no of course not he is my son though he has behaved badly here give him that and dr crawford drew a tendollar bill from his wallet and handed it to gilbert thank you sir this money will be very useful besides it will show carl that his father is not wholly indifferent to him of course not who says that i am a bad father asked dr crawford peevishly i dont think sir there would be any difficulty between you and carl if you had not married again carl has no right to vex mrs crawford besides he cant agree with peter is that his fault or peters asked gilbert significantly i am not acquainted with the circumstances but mrs crawford says that carl is always bullying peter he never bullied anyone at school is there anything else you want yes sir carl only took away a little underclothing in a gripsack he would like his woolen clothes put in his trunk and to have it sent where perhaps it had better be sent to my house there are one or two things in his room also that he asked me to get why didnt he come himself because he thought it would be unpleasant for him to meet mrs crawford they would be sure to quarrel well perhaps he is right said dr crawford with an air of relief about the allowance i shall have to consult my wife will you come with me to the house yes sir i should like to have the matter settled today so that carl will know what to depend upon gilbert rather dreaded the interview he was likely to have with mrs crawford but he was acting for carl and his feelings of friendship were strong so he walked beside dr crawford till they reached the tasteful dwelling occupied as a residence by carl and his father how happy carl could be here if he had a stepmother like mine gilbert thought they went up to the front door which was opened for them by a servant jane is mrs crawford in asked the doctor no sir not just now she went to the village to do some shopping is peter in no sir then you will have to wait till they return cant i go up to carls room and be packing his things yes i think you may i dont think mrs crawford would object good heavens hasnt the man a mind of his own thought gilbert jane you may show this young gentleman up to master carls room and give him the key of his trunk he is going to pack his clothes when is master carl coming back asked jane i i dont know i think he will be away for a time i wish it was peter instead of him said jane in a low voice only audible to gilbert she showed gilbert the way upstairs while the doctor went to his study are you a friend of master carls asked jane as soon as they were alone yes jane and where is he at my house is he goin to stay there for a short time he wants to go out into the world and make his own living and no wonder poor boy its hard times he had here didnt mrs crawford treat him well asked gilbert with curiosity is it trate him well she was ajawin an ajawin him from mornin till night ugh but shes an ugly cratur how about peter hes just as bad the manest bye i iver set eyes on it would do me good to see him flogged she chatted a little longer with gilbert helping him to find carls clothes when suddenly a shrill voice was heard calling her from below shure its the madam said jane shrugging her shoulders i expect shes in a temper and she rose from her knees and hurried downstairs chapter v carls stepmother five minutes later as gilbert was closing the trunk jane reappeared the doctor and mrs crawford would like to see you downstairs she said gilbert followed jane into the library where dr crawford and his wife were seated he looked with interest at the woman who had made home so disagreeable to carl and was instantly prejudiced against her she was light complexioned with very lightbrown hair cold gray eyes and a disagreeable expression which seemed natural to her my dear said the doctor this is the young man who has come from carl mrs crawford surveyed gilbert with an expression by no means friendly what is your name she asked gilbert vance did carl crawford send you here no i volunteered to come did he tell you that he was disobedient and disrespectful to me no he told me that you treated him so badly that he was unwilling to live in the same house with you answered gilbert boldly well upon my word exclaimed mrs crawford fanning herself vigorously dr crawford did you hear that yes and what do you think of it well i think you may have been too hard upon carl too hard why then did he not treat me respectfully this boy seems inclined to be impertinent i answered your questions madam said gilbert coldly i suppose you side with your friend carl i certainly do mrs crawford bit her lip what is the object of your coming does carl wish to return i thought dr crawford might have told you carl wants his clothes sent to him said the doctor he only carried a few with him i shall not consent to it he deserves no favors at our hands this was too much even for dr crawford you go too far mrs crawford he said i am sensible of the boys faults but i certainly will not allow his clothes to be withheld from him oh well spoil him if you choose said the lady sullenly take his part against your wife i have never done that but i will not allow him to be defrauded of his clothes i have no more to say said mrs crawford her eyes snapping she was clearly mortified at her failure to carry her point do you wish the trunk to be sent to your house asked the doctor yes sir i have packed the clothes and locked the trunk i should like to examine it before it goes put in mrs crawford spitefully why to make sure that nothing has been put in that does not belong to carl do you mean to accuse me of stealing madam demanded gilbert indignantly mrs crawford tossed her head i dont know anything about you she replied dr crawford am i to open the trunk asked gilbert no answered the doctor with unwonted decision i hate that boy he has twice subjected me to mortification thought mrs crawford you know very well she said turning to her husband that i have grounds for my request i blush to mention it but i have reason to believe that your son took a wallet containing twentyfive dollars from my bureau drawer i deny it said gilbert what do you know about it i should like to ask sneered mrs crawford i know that carl is an honorable boy incapable of theft and at this moment has but thirtyseven cents in his possession so far as you know if the money has really disappeared madam you had better ask your own boy about it this is insufferable exclaimed mrs crawford her light eyes emitting angry flashes who dares to say that peter took the wallet she went on rising to her feet there was an unexpected reply jane entered the room at this moment to ask a question i say so maam she rejoined what ejaculated mrs crawford with startling emphasis i didnt mean to say anything about it till i found you were charging it on master carl i saw peter open your bureau drawer take out the wallet and put it in his pocket its a lie said mrs crawford hoarsely its the truth though i suppose you dont want to believe it if you want to know what he did with the money ask him how much he paid for the gold ring he bought of the jeweler down at the village you are a spy a base dishonorable spy cried mrs crawford i wont say what you are maam to bring false charges against master carl and i wonder the doctor will believe them leave the house directly you hussy shrieked mrs crawford if i do i wonder wholl get the dinner remarked jane not at all disturbed i wont stay here to be insulted said the angry lady dr crawford you might have spirit enough to defend your wife she flounced out of the room not waiting for a reply leaving the doctor dazed and flurried i hope sir you are convinced now that carl did not take mrs crawfords money said gilbert i told you it was probably peter are you sure of what you said jane asked the doctor yes sir i saw peter take the wallet with my own eyes it is his mothers money and they must settle it between them i am glad carl did not take it really this has been a very unpleasant scene i am sorry for my part in it carl is my friend and i feel that i ought to stand up for his rights remarked gilbert certainly certainly that is right but you see how i am placed i see that this is no place for carl if you will allow me i will send an expressman for the trunk and take it with me to the station yes i see no objection i i would invite you to dinner but mrs crawford seems to be suffering from a nervous attack and it might not be pleasant i agree with you sir just then peter entered the room and looked at gilbert with surprise and wrath remembering his recent discomfiture at the hands of the young visitor my stepson peter announced dr crawford peter and i have met before said gilbert smiling what are you here for asked peter rudely not to see you answered gilbert turning from him my motherll have something to say to you went on peter significantly she will have something to say to you retorted gilbert she has found out who stole her money peters face turned scarlet instantly and he left the room hurriedly perhaps i ought not to have said that dr crawford added gilbert apologetically but i dislike that boy very much and couldnt help giving him as good as he sent it is all very unpleasant responded dr crawford peevishly i dont see why i cant live in peace and tranquility i wont intrude upon you any longer said gilbert if you will kindly tell me whether you will consent to make carl a small weekly allowance i cant say now i want time to think give me your address and i will write to carl in your care very well sir gilbert left the house and made arrangements to have carls trunk called for it accompanied him on the next train to warren chapter vi mrs crawfords letter how did you like my stepmother asked carl when gilbert returned in the afternoon shes a daisy answered gilbert shrugging his shoulders i dont think i ever saw a more disagreeable woman do you blame me for leaving home i only wonder you have been able to stay so long i had a long conversation with your father mrs crawford has made a different man of him i should have no trouble in getting along with him if there was no one to come between us he gave me this for you said gilbert producing the tendollar bill did my stepmother know of his sending it no she was opposed to sending your trunk but your father said emphatically you should have it i am glad he showed that much spirit i have some hopes that he will make you an allowance of a few dollars a week that would make me all right but i dont expect it you will probably hear from your father tomorrow or next day so you will have to make yourself contented a little longer i hope you are not very homesick mr crawford said julia coquettishly i would ask nothing better than to stay here permanently rejoined carl earnestly this is a real home i have met with more kindness here than in six months at my own home you have one staunch friend at home said gilbert you dont allude to peter so far as i can judge he hates you like poison i mean jane yes jane is a real friend she has been in the family for ten years she was a favorite with my own mother and feels an interest in me by the way your stepmothers charge that you took a wallet containing money from her drawer has been disproved by jane she saw peter abstracting the money and so informed mrs crawford i am not at all surprised peter is mean enough to steal or do anything else what did my stepmother say she was very angry and threatened to discharge jane but as no one would be left to attend to the dinner i presume she is likely to stay i ought to be forming some plan said carl thoughtfully wait till you hear from home julia will see that your time is well filled up till then dismiss all care and enjoy yourself while you may this seemed to be sensible advice and carl followed it in the evening some young people were invited in and there was a round of amusements that made carl forget that he was an exile from home with very dubious prospects you are all spoiling me he said as gilbert and he went upstairs to bed i am beginning to understand the charms of home to go out into the world from here will be like taking a cold shower bath never forget carl that you will be welcome back whenever you feel like coming said gilbert laying his band affectionately on carls shoulder we all like you here thank you old fellow i appreciate the kindness i have received here but i must strike out for myself how do you feel about it carl i hope for the best i am young strong and willing to work there must be an opening for me somewhere the next morning just after breakfast a letter arrived for carl mailed at edgewood center is it from your father asked gilbert no it is in the handwriting of my stepmother i can guess from that that it contains no good news he opened the letter and as he read it his face expressed disgust and annoyance read it gilbert he said handing him the open sheet this was the missive carl crawford as your father has a nervous attack brought on by your misconduct he has authorized me to write to you as you are but sixteen he could send for you and have you forcibly brought back but deems it better for you to follow your own course and suffer the punishment of your obstinate and perverse conduct the boy whom you sent here proved a fitting messenger he seems if possible to be even worse than yourself he was very impertinent to me and made a brutal and unprovoked attack on my poor boy peter whose devotion to your father and myself forms an agreeable contrast to your studied disregard of our wishes your friend had the assurance to ask for a weekly allowance for you while a voluntary exile from the home where you have been only too well treated in other words you want to be paid for your disobedience even if your father were weak enough to think of complying with this extraordinary request i should do my best to dissuade him small doubt of that said carl bitterly in my sorrow for your waywardness i am comforted by the thought that peter is too good and conscientious ever to follow your example while you are away he will do his utmost to make up to your father for his disappointment in you that you may grow wise in time and turn at length from the error of your ways is the earnest hope of your stepmother anastasia crawford it makes me sick to read such a letter as that gilbert said carl and to have that sneak and thief as he turned out to be peter set up as a model for me is a little too much i never knew there were such women in the world returned gilbert i can understand your feelings perfectly after my interview of yesterday she thinks even worse of you than of me said carl with a faint smile i have no doubt peter shares her sentiments i didnt make many friends in your family it must be confessed you did me a service gilbert and i shall not soon forget it where did your stepmother come from asked gilbert thoughtfully i dont know my father met her at some summer resort she was staying in the same boarding house she and the angelic peter she lost no time in setting her cap for my father who was doubtless reported to her as a man of property and she succeeded in capturing him i wonder at that she doesnt seem very fascinating she made herself very agreeable to my father and was even affectionate in her manner to me though i couldnt get to like her the end was that she became mrs crawford once installed in our house she soon threw off the mask and showed herself in her true colors a coldhearted selfish and disagreeable woman i wonder your father doesnt recognize her for what she is she is very artful and is politic enough to treat him well she has lost no opportunity of prejudicing him against me if he were not an invalid she would find her task more difficult did she have any property when your father married her not that i have been able to discover she is scheming to have my father leave the lions share of his property to her and peter i dare say she will succeed let us hope your father will live till you are a young man at least and better able to cope with her i earnestly hope so your father is not an old man he is fiftyone but he is not strong i believe he has liver complaint at any rate i know that when at my stepmothers instigation he applied to an insurance company to insure his life for her benefit the application was rejected you dont know anything of mrs crawfords antecedents no what was her name before she married your father she was a mrs cook that as you know is peters name perhaps in your travels you may learn something of her history i should like to do so you wont leave us tomorrow i must go today i know now that i must depend wholly upon my own exertions and i must get to work as soon as possible you will write to me carl yes when i have anything agreeable to write let us hope that will be soon chapter vii ends in a tragedy carl obtained permission to leave his trunk at the vance mansion merely taking out what he absolutely needed for a change when i am settled i will send for it he said now i shouldnt know what to do with it there were cordial goodbys and carl started once more on the tramp he might indeed have traveled by rail for he had ten dollars and thirtyseven cents but it occurred to him that in walking he might meet with some one who would give him employment besides he was not in a hurry to get on nor had he any definite destination the day was fine there was a light breeze and he experienced a hopeful exhilaration as he walked lightly on with the world before him and any number of possibilities in the way of fortunate adventures that might befall him he had walked five miles when to the left he saw an elderly man hard at work in a hay field he was leaning on his rake and looking perplexed and troubled carl paused to rest and as he looked over the rail fence attracted the attention of the farmer i say young feller where are you goin he asked i dont know exactly you dont know where you are goin repeated the farmer in surprise carl laughed i am going out in the world to seek my fortune he said you be would you like a job asked the farmer eagerly what sort of a job id like to have you help me hayin my hired man is sick and hes left me in a hole its goin to rain and going to rain repeated carl in surprise as he looked up at the nearly cloudless sky yes it dont look like it i know but old job hagar say itll rain before night and what he dont know about the weather aint worth knowin i want to get the hay on this meadow into the barn and then ill feel safe rain or shine and you want me to help you yes you look strong and hardy yes i am pretty strong said carl complacently well what do you say all right ill help you carl gave a spring and cleared the fence landing in the hay field having first thrown his valise over youre pretty spry said the farmer i couldnt do that no youre too heavy said carl smiling as he noted the clumsy figure of his employer now what shall i do take that rake and rake up the hay then well go over to the barn and get the hay wagon where is your barn the farmer pointed across the fields to a storyandahalf farmhouse and standing near it a goodsized barn brown from want of paint and exposure to sun and rain the buildings were perhaps twentyfive rods distant are you used to hayin asked the farmer well no not exactly though ive handled a rake before carls experience however had been very limited he had to be sure had a rake in his hand but probably he had not worked more than ten minutes at it however raking is easily learned and his want of experience was not detected he started off with great enthusiasm but after a while thought it best to adopt the more leisurely movements of the farmer after two hours his hands began to blister but still he kept on i have got to make my living by hard work he said to himself and it wont do to let such a little thing as a blister interfere when he had been working a couple of hours he began to feel hungry his walk and the work he had been doing sharpened his appetite till he really felt uncomfortable it was at this time just twelve oclock that the farmers wife came to the front door and blew a fish horn so vigorously that it could probably have been heard half a mile the old womans got dinner ready said the farmer if you dont mind takin your pay in victuals you can go along home with me and take a bite i think i could take two or three sir ho ho thats a good joke moneys scarce and id rather pay in victuals if its all the same to you do you generally find people willing to work for their board asked carl who knew that he was being imposed upon well i might pay a leetle more you work for me till sundown and ill give you dinner and supper and fifteen cents carl wanted to laugh at this rate of compensation he felt that it would take a long time to make a fortune but he was so hungry that he would have accepted board alone if it had been necessary i agree he said shall i leave my rake here yes itll be all right ill take along my valise for i cant afford to run any risk of losing it jest as you say five minutes brought them to the farmhouse can i wash my hands asked carl yes you can go right to the sink and wash in the tin basin theres a roll towel behind the door mis perkins that was the way he addressed his wife this is a young chap that ive hired to help me hayin you can set a chair for him at the table all right silas he dont look very old though no maam i aint twentyone yet answered carl who was really sixteen i shouldnt say you was you aint no signs of a mustache i keep it short maam in warm weather said carl it dont dull a razor any to cut it in cold weather does it asked the farmer chuckling at his joke well no sir i cant say it does it was a boiled dinner that the farmers wife provided corned beef and vegetables but the plebeian meal seemed to carl the best he ever ate afterwards there was apple pudding to which he did equal justice i never knew work improved a fellows appetite so reflected the young traveler i never ate with so much relish at home after dinner they went back to the field and worked till the supper hour five oclock by that time all the hay had been put into the barn weve done a good days work said the farmer in a tone of satisfaction and only just in time do you see that dark cloud yes sir in half an hour therell be rain or im mistaken old job hagar is right after all the farmer proved a true prophet in half an hour while they were at the supper table the rain began to come down in large drops forming pools in the hollows of the ground and drenching all exposed objects with the largesse of the heavens where war you agoin tonight asked the farmer i dont know sir i was thinkin that id give you a nights lodgin in place of the fifteen cents i agreed to pay you moneys very skeerce with me and will be till ive sold off some of the crops i shall be glad to make that arrangement said carl who had been considering how much the farmer would ask for lodging for there seemed small chance of continuing his journey fifteen cents was a lower price than he had calculated on thats a sensible idea said the farmer rubbing his hands with satisfaction at the thought that he had secured valuable help at no money outlay whatever the next morning carl continued his tramp refusing the offer of continued employment on the same terms he was bent on pursuing his journey though he did not know exactly where he would fetch up in the end at twelve oclock that day he found himself in the outskirts of a town with the same uncomfortable appetite that he had felt the day before but with no hotel or restaurant anywhere near there was however a small house the outer door of which stood conveniently open through the open window carl saw a table spread as if for dinner and he thought it probable that he could arrange to become a boarder for a single meal he knocked at the door but no one came he shouted out is anybody at home and received no answer he went to a small barn just outside and peered in but no one was to be seen what should he do he was terribly hungry and the sight of the food on the table was tantalizing ill go in as the door is open he decided and sit down to the table and eat somebody will be along before i get through and ill pay whatever is satisfactory for eat i must he entered seated himself and ate heartily still no one appeared i dont want to go off without paying thought carl ill see if i can find somebody he opened the door into the kitchen but it was deserted then he opened that of a small bedroom and started back in terror and dismay there suspended from a hook a man of middle age was hanging with his head bent forward his eyes wide open and his tongue protruding from his mouth chapter viii carl falls under suspicion to a person of any age such a sight as that described at the close of the last chapter might well have proved startling to a boy like carl it was simply overwhelming it so happened that he had but twice seen a dead person and never a victim of violence the peculiar circumstances increased the effect upon his mind he placed his hand upon the mans face and found that he was still warm he could have been dead but a short time what shall i do thought carl perplexed this is terrible then it flashed upon him that as he was alone with the dead man suspicion might fall upon him as being concerned in what might be called a murder i had better leave here at once he reflected i shall have to go away without paying for my meal he started to leave the house but had scarcely reached the door when two persons a man and a woman entered both looked at carl with suspicion what are you doing here asked the man i beg your pardon answered carl i was very hungry and seeing no one about took the liberty to sit down at the table and eat i am willing to pay for my dinner if you will tell me how much it amounts to wasnt my husband here asked the woman i i am afraid something has happened to your husband faltered carl what do you mean carl silently pointed to the chamber door the woman opened it and uttered a loud shriek look here walter she cried her companion quickly came to her side my husband is dead cried the woman basely murdered and there pointing fiercely to carl there stands the murderer madam you cannot believe this said carl naturally agitated what have you to say for yourself demanded the man suspiciously i only just saw your husband continued carl addressing himself to the woman i had finished my meal when i began to search for some one whom i could pay and so opened this door into the room beyond when i saw him hanging there dont believe him the redhanded murderer broke out the woman fiercely he is probably a thief he killed my poor husband and then sat down like a coldblooded villain that he is and gorged himself things began to look very serious for poor carl your husband is larger and stronger than myself he urged desperately how could i overpower him it looks reasonable maria said the man i dont see how the boy could have killed mr brown or lifted him upon the hook even if he did not resist he murdered him i tell you he murdered him shrieked the woman who seemed bereft of reason i call upon you to arrest him i am not a constable maria then tie him so he cannot get away and go for a constable i wouldnt feel safe with him in the house unless he were tied fast he might hang me terrible as the circumstances were carl felt an impulse to laugh it seemed absurd to hear himself talked of in this way tie me if you like he said i am willing to wait here till some one comes who has a little common sense just remember that i am only a boy and havent the strength of a fullgrown man the boy is right maria its a foolish idea of yours i call upon you to tie the villain insisted the woman just as you say can you give me some rope from a drawer mrs brown drew a quantity of strong cord and the man proceeded to tie carls hands tie his feet too walter even if you didnt tie me i would promise to remain here i dont want anybody to suspect me of such a thing put in carl how artful he is said mrs brown tie him strong walter the two were left alone carl feeling decidedly uncomfortable the newlymade widow laid her head upon the table and moaned glancing occasionally at the body of her husband as it still hung suspended from the hook oh william i little expected to find you dead she groaned i only went to the store to buy a pound of salt and when i come back i find you cold and still the victim of a young ruffian how could you be so wicked she demanded fiercely of carl i have told you that i had nothing to do with your husbands death madam who killed him then she cried i dont know he must have committed suicide dont think you are going to escape in that way i wont rest till i see you hung i wish i had never entered the house thought carl uncomfortably i would rather have gone hungry for twenty four hours longer than find myself in such a position half an hour passed then a sound of voices was heard outside and half a dozen men entered including besides the messenger the constable and a physician why was he not cut down asked the doctor hastily there might have been a chance to resuscitate him i didnt think of it said the messenger maria was so excited and insisted that the boy murdered him what boy carl was pointed out that boy what nonsense exclaimed dr park why it would be more than you or i could do to overpower and hang a man weighing one hundred and seventyfive pounds thats what i thought but maria seemed crazed like i tell you he did it are you going to let him go the redhanded murderer loose the cord and i will question the boy said dr park with an air of authority carl breathed a sigh of relief when freed from his bonds he stood upright ill tell you all i know he said but it wont throw any light upon the death dr park listened attentively and asked one or two questions did you hear any noise when you were sitting at the table he inquired no sir was the door closed yes sir that of itself would probably prevent your hearing anything mrs brown at what hour did you leave the house at ten minutes of twelve it is now five minutes of one the deed must have been committed just after you left the house had you noticed anything out of the way in your husbands manner no sir not much he was always a silent man had anything happened to disturb him he got a letter this morning i dont know what was in it we had better search for it the body was taken down and laid on the bed dr park searched the pockets and found a half sheet of note paper on which these lines were written maria i have made up my mind i can ive no longer i have made a terrible discovery when i married you i thought my first wife who deserted me four years ago dead i learn by a letter received this morning that she is still living in a town of illinois the only thing i can do is to free you both from my presence when you come back from the store you will find me cold and dead the little that i leave behind i give to you if my first wife should come here as she threatens you can tell her so goodby william the reading of this letter made a sensation mrs brown went into hysterics and there was a scene of confusion do you think i can go carl asked dr park yes there is nothing to connect you with the sad event carl gladly left the cottage and it was only when he was a mile on his way that he remembered that he had not paid for his dinner after all chapter ix a plausible stranger three days later found carl still on his travels it was his custom to obtain his meals at a cheap hotel or if none were met with at a farmhouse and to secure lodgings where he could and on as favorable terms as possible he realized the need of economy and felt that he was practicing it he had changed his tendollar bill the first day for a five and several ones these last were now spent and the fivedollar bill alone remained to him he had earned nothing though everywhere he had been on the lookout for a job toward the close of the last day he overtook a young man of twentyfive who was traveling in the same direction goodafternoon said the young man sociably goodafternoon sir where are you bound may i ask to the next town fillmore yes if that is the name so am i why shouldnt we travel together i have no objection said carl who was glad of company are you in any business no but i hope to find a place oh a smart boy like you will soon find employment i hope so i am sure i havent much money left and it is necessary i should do something just so i am a new york salesman but just now i am on my vacation taking a pedestrian tour with knapsack and staff as you see the beauty of it is that my salary runs on just as if i were at my post and will nearly pay all my traveling expenses you are in luck besides you have a good place to go back to there isnt any vacancy is there you couldnt take on a boy asked carl eagerly well there might be a chance said the young man slowly you havent any recommendations with you have you no i have never been employed it doesnt matter i will recommend you myself you might be deceived in me said carl smiling ill take the risk of that i know a reliable boy when i see him thank you what is the name of your firm f brandes co commission merchants pearl street my own name is chauncy hubbard at your service i am carl crawford thats a good name i predict that we shall be great chums if i manage to get you a place in our establishment is mr brandes a good man to work for yes he is easy and goodnatured he is liberal to his clerks what salary do you think i get i couldnt guess forty dollars a week and i am only twentyfive went into the house at sixteen and worked my way up you have certainly done well said carl respectfully well im no slouch if i do say it myself i dont wonder your income pays the expenses of your vacation trip it ought to thats a fact though im rather free handed and like to spend money my prospects are pretty good in another direction old fred brandes has a handsome daughter who thinks considerable of your humble servant do you think there is any chance of marrying her asked carl with interest i think my chance is pretty good as the girl wont look at anybody else is mr brandes wealthy yes the old mans pretty well fixed worth nearly half a million i guess perhaps he will take you into the firm suggested carl very likely thats what im working for at any rate you ought to save something out of your salary i ought but i havent the fact is carl said chauncy hubbard in a burst of confidence i have a great mind to make a confession to you i shall feel flattered i am sure said carl politely i have one great fault i gamble do you said carl rather startled for he had been brought up very properly to have a horror of gambling yes i suppose its in my blood my father was a very rich man at one time but he lost nearly all his fortune at the gaming table that ought to have been a warning to you i should think it ought and may be yet for i am still a young man mr hubbard said carl earnestly i feel rather diffident about advising you for i am only a boy but i should think you would give up such a dangerous habit say no more carl you are a true friend i will try to follow your advice give me your hand carl did so and felt a warm glow of pleasure at the thought that perhaps he had redeemed his companion from a fascinating vice i really wish i had a sensible boy like you to be my constant companion i should feel safer do you really have such a passion for gambling then yes if at the hotel tonight i should see a party playing poker i could not resist joining them odd isnt it i am glad i have no such temptation yes you are lucky by the way how much money have you about you five dollars then you can do me a favor i have a tendollar bill which i need to get me home now i would like to have you keep a part of it for me till i go away in the morning give me your five and i will hand you ten out of that you can pay my hotel bill and hand me the balance due me in the morning if you really wish me to do so enough said here is the ten carl took the bill and gave mr hubbard his fivedollar note you are placing considerable confidence in me he said i am it is true but i have no fear of being deceived you are a boy who naturally inspires confidence carl thought mr chauncy hubbard a very agreeable and sensible fellow and he felt flattered to think that the young man had chosen him as a guardian so to speak by the way carl you havent told me said hubbard as they pursued their journey how a boy like yourself is forced to work his own way i can tell you the reason very briefly i have a stepmother i understand is your father living yes but he thinks more of the stepmother than of you i am afraid he does you have my sympathy carl i will do all i can to help you if you can only get a place in our establishment you will be all right step by step you will rise till you come to stand where i do that would satisfy me has mr brandes got another daughter no there is only one then i shall have to be content with the forty dollars a week if i ever get it i will save half i wish i could you can if you try why you might have two thousand dollars saved up now if you had only begun to save in time i have lost more than that at the gaming table you will think me very foolish yes i do said carl frankly you are right but here we are almost at the village is there a good hotel yes the fillmore we will take adjoining rooms if you say so very well and in the morning you will pay the bill certainly the two travelers had a good supper and retired early both being fatigued with the journey it was not till eight oclock the next morning that carl opened his eyes he dressed hastily and went down to breakfast he was rather surprised not to see his companion of the day before has mr hubbard come down yet he asked at the desk yes he took an early breakfast and went off by the first train that is strange i was to pay his bill he paid it himself carl did not know what to make of this had hubbard forgotten that he had five dollars belonging to him fortunately carl had his city address and could refund the money in new york very well i will pay my own bill how much is it a dollar and a quarter carl took the tendollar bill from his wallet and tendered it to the clerk instead of changing it at once the clerk held it up to the light and examined it critically i cant take that bill he said abruptly why not because it is counterfeit carl turned pale and the room seemed to whirl round it was all the money he had chapter x the counterfeit bill are you sure it is counterfeit asked carl very much disturbed i am certain of it i havent been handling bank bills for ten years without being able to tell good money from bad ill trouble you for another bill thats all the money i have faltered carl look here young man said the clerk sternly you are trying a bold game but it wont succeed i am trying no game at all said carl plucking up spirit i thought the bill was good where did you get it from the man who came with me last evening mr hubbard the money he gave me was good what did he give you a fivedollar bill it was my fivedollar bill said carl bitterly your story doesnt seem very probable said the clerk suspiciously how did he happen to get your money and you his he told me that he would get to gambling and wished me to take money enough to pay his bill here he handed me the tendollar bill which you say is bad and i gave him five in return i think now he only wanted to get good money for bad your story may be true or it may not said the clerk whose manner indicated incredulity that is nothing to me all you have to do is to pay your hotel bill and you can settle with mr hubbard when you see him but i have no other money said carl desperately then i shall feel justified in ordering your arrest on a charge of passing or trying to pass counterfeit money dont do that sir i will see that you are paid out of the first money i earn you must think i am soft said the clerk contemptuously i have seen persons of your stripe before i dare say if you were searched more counterfeit money would be found in your pockets search me then cried carl indignantly i am perfectly willing that you should havent you any relations who will pay your bill i have no one to call upon answered carl soberly couldnt you let me work it out i am ready to do any kind of work our list of workers is full said the clerk coldly poor carl he felt that he was decidedly in a tight place he had never before found himself unable to meet his bills nor would he have been so placed now but for hubbards rascality a dollar and a quarter seems a small sum but if you are absolutely penniless it might as well be a thousand suppose he should be arrested and the story get into the papers how his stepmother would exult in the record of his disgrace he could anticipate what she would say peter too would rejoice and between them both his father would be persuaded that he was thoroughly unprincipled what have you got in your valise asked the clerk only some underclothing if there were anything of any value i would cheerfully leave it as security wait a minute though he said with a sudden thought here is a gold pencil it is worth five dollars at any rate it cost more than that i can place that in your hands let me see it carl handed the clerk a neat gold pencil on which his name was inscribed it was evidently of good quality and found favor with the clerk ill give you a dollar and a quarter for the pencil he said and call it square i wouldnt like to sell it said carl you wont get any more for it i wasnt thinking of that but it was given me by my mother who is now dead i would not like to part with anything that she gave me you would prefer to get off scotfree i suppose retorted the clerk with a sneer no i am willing to leave it in your hands but i should like the privilege of redeeming it when i have the money very well said the clerk who reflected that in all probability carl would never come back for it ill take it on those conditions carl passed over the pencil with a sigh he didnt like to part with it even for a short time but there seemed no help for it all right i will mark you paid carl left the hotel satchel in hand and as he passed out into the street reflected with a sinking heart that he was now quite penniless where was he to get his dinner and how was he to provide himself with a lodging that night at present he was not hungry having eaten a hearty breakfast at the hotel but by one oclock he would feel the need of food he began to ask himself if after all he had not been unwise in leaving home no matter how badly he had been treated by his stepmother there at least he was certain of living comfortably now he was in danger of starvation and on two occasions already he had incurred suspicion once of being concerned in a murder and just now of passing counterfeit money ought he to have submitted and so avoided all these perils no he finally decided i wont give up the ship yet i am about as badly off as i can be i am without a cent and dont know where my next meal is to come from but my luck may turn it must turn it has turned he exclaimed with energy as his wandering glance suddenly fell upon a silver quarter of a dollar nearly covered up with the dust of the street that shall prove a good omen he stooped over and picked up the coin which he put in his vest pocket it was wonderful how the possession of this small sum of money restored his courage and raised his spirits he was sure of a dinner now at all events it looked as if providence was smiling on him two miles farther on carl overtook a boy of about his own age trudging along the road with a rake over his shoulder he wore overalls and was evidently a farmers boy goodday said carl pleasantly noticing that the boy regarded him with interest goodday returned the country lad rather bashfully can you tell me if there is any place near where i can buy some dinner there aint no tavern if thats what you mean im goin home to dinner myself where do you live over yonder he pointed to a farmhouse about a dozen rods away do you think your mother would give me some dinner i guess she would mams real accommodatin will you ask her yes just come along of me he turned into the yard and followed a narrow path to the back door ill stay here while you ask said carl the boy entered the house and came out after a brief absence mam says youre to come in he said carl glad at heart and feeling quite prepared to eat fifty cents worth of dinner followed the boy inside a pleasantlooking matronly woman plainly but neatly attired came forward to greet him nat says you would like to get some dinner she said yes answered carl i hope youll excuse my applying to you but your son tells me there is no hotel near by the nearest one is three miles away from here i dont think i can hold out so long said carl smiling sit right down with nat said the farmers wife hospitably mr sweetser wont be home for half an hour weve got enough such as it is evidently mrs sweetser was a good cook the dinner consisted of boiled mutton with several kinds of vegetables a cup of tea and two kinds of pie followed it was hard to tell which of the two boys did fuller justice to the meal nat had the usual appetite of a healthy farm boy and carl in spite of his recent anxieties and narrow escape from serious peril did not allow himself to fall behind your mothers a fine cook said carl between two mouthfuls aint she though answered nat his mouth full of pie when carl rose from the table he feared that he had eaten more than his little stock of money would pay for how much will it be mrs sweetser he asked oh youre quite welcome to all youve had said the good woman cheerily its plain farmers fare i never tasted a better dinner said carl mrs sweetser seemed pleased with the compliment to her cooking come again when you are passing this way she said you will always be welcome to a dinner carl thanked her heartily and pressed on his way two hours later at a lonely point of the road an illlooking tramp who had been reclining by the wayside jumped up and addressed him in a menacing tone young feller shell over all the money you have got or ill hurt you im hard up and i wont stand no nonsense carl started and looked into the face of the tramp it seemed to him that he had never seen a man more illfavored or villainouslooking chapter xi the archery prize situated as he was it seemed on second thought rather a joke to carl to be attacked by a robber he had but twentyfive cents in good money about him and that he had just picked up by the merest chance do i look like a banker he asked humorously why do you want to rob a boy the way youre togged out you must have something growled the tramp and i havent got a penny your business doesnt seem to pay then dont you make fun of me or ill wring your neck just hand over your money and be quick about it i havent time to stand fooling here all day a bright idea came to carl he couldnt spare the silver coin which constituted all his available wealth but he still had the counterfeit note you wont take all my money will you he said earnestly how much have you got asked the tramp pricking up his ears carl with apparent reluctance drew out the tendollar bill the tramps face lighted up is your name vanderbilt he asked i didnt expect to make such a haul cant you give me back a dollar out of it i dont want to lose all i have i havent got a cent youll have to wait till we meet again so long boy youve helped me out of a scrape or into one thought carl the tramp straightened up buttoned his dilapidated coat and walked off with the consciousness of being a capitalist carl watched him with a smile i hope i wont meet him after he has discovered that the bill is a counterfeit he said to himself he congratulated himself upon being still the possessor of twentyfive cents in silver it was not much but it seemed a great deal better than being penniless a week before he would have thought it impossible that such a paltry sum would have made him feel comfortable but he had passed through a great deal since then about the middle of the afternoon he came to a field in which something appeared to be going on some forty or fifty young persons boys and girls were walking about the grass and seemed to be preparing for some interesting event carl stopped to rest and look on whats going on here he asked of a boy who was sitting on the fence its a meeting of the athletic association said the boy what are they doing they try for prizes in jumping vaulting archery and so on this interested carl who excelled in all manly exercises i suppose i may stay and look on he said inquiringly why of course jump over the fence and ill go round with you it seemed pleasant to carl to associate once more with boys of his own age thrown unexpectedly upon his own resources he had almost forgotten that he was a boy face to face with a cold and unsympathizing world he seemed to himself twentyfive at least those who wish to compete for the archery prize will come forward announced robert gardiner a young man of nineteen who as carl learned was the president of the association you all understand the conditions the entry fee to competitors is ten cents the prize to the most successful archer is one dollar several boys came forward and paid the entrance fee would you like to compete asked edward downie the boy whose acquaintance carl had made i am an outsider said carl i dont belong to the association ill speak to the president if you like i dont want to intrude it wont be considered an intrusion you pay the entrance fee and take your chances edward went to the president and spoke to him in a low voice the result was that he advanced to carl and said courteously if you would like to enter into our games you are quite at liberty to do so thank you responded carl i have had a little practice in archery and will enter my name for that prize he paid over his quarter and received back fifteen cents in change it seemed rather an imprudent outlay considering his small capital but he had good hopes of carrying off the prize and that would be a great lift for him seven boys entered besides carl the first was victor russell a lad of fourteen whose arrow went three feet above the mark the prize is mine if none of you do better than that laughed victor goodnaturedly i hope not for the credit of the club said the president mr crawford will you shoot next i would prefer to be the last said carl modestly john livermore your turn now john came a little nearer than his predecessor but did not distinguish himself if that is a specimen of the skill of the clubmen thought carl my chance is a good one next came frank stockton whose arrow stuck only three inches from the center of the target good for fred cried edward downie just wait till you see me shoot are you a dangerous rival asked carl smiling i can hit a barn door if i am only near enough replied edward edward downie called the president edward took his bow and advanced to the proper place bent it and the arrow sped on its way there was a murmur of surprise when his arrow struck only an inch to the right of the centre no one was more amazed than edward himself for he was accounted far from skillful it was indeed a lucky accident what do you say to that asked edward triumphantly i think the prize is yours i had no idea you could shoot like that said carl nor i rejoined edward laughing carl crawford called the president carl took his position and bent his bow with the greatest care he exercised unusual deliberation for success meant more to him than to any of the others a dollar to him in his present circumstances would be a small fortune while the loss of even ten cents would be sensibly felt his heart throbbed with excitement as he let the arrow speed on its mission his unusual deliberation and the fact that he was a stranger excited strong interest and all eyes followed the arrow with eager attentiveness there was a sudden shout of irrepressible excitement carls arrow had struck the bullseye and the prize was his christopher exclaimed edward downie youve beaten me after all im almost sorry said carl apologetically but the light in his eyes hardly bore out the statement never mind everybody would have called it a fluke if i had won said edward i expect to get the prize for the long jump i am good at that so am i but i wont compete i will leave it to you no no i want to win fair carl accordingly entered his name he made the second best jump but edwards exceeded his by a couple of inches and the prize was adjudged to him i have my revenge he said smiling i am glad i won for it wouldnt have been to the credit of the club to have an outsider carry off two prizes i am perfectly satisfied said carl i ought to be for i did not expect to carry off any carl decided not to compete for any other prize he had invested twenty cents and got back a dollar which left him a profit of eighty cents this with his original quarter made him the possessor of a dollar and five cents my luck seems to have turned he said to himself and the thought gave him fresh courage it was five oclock when the games were over and carl prepared to start again on his journey where are you going to take supper asked downie i dont know come home with me if you are in no hurry you may as well stay overnight and go on in the morning are you sure it wont inconvenience you not at all then ill accept with thanks chapter xii an odd acquaintance after breakfast the next morning carl started again on his way his new friend edward downie accompanied him for a mile having an errand at that distance i wish you good luck carl he said earnestly when you come this way again be sure to stop in and see me i will certainly do so but i hope i may find employment at any rate thought carl as he resumed his journey alone i am better off than i was yesterday morning then i had but twentyfive cents now i have a dollar this was satisfactory as far as it went but carl was sensible that he was making no progress in his plan of earning a living he was simply living from hand to mouth and but for good luck he would have had to go hungry and perhaps have been obliged to sleep out doors what he wanted was employment it was about ten oclock when looking along the road his curiosity was excited by a man of very unusual figure a few rods in advance of him he looked no taller than a boy of ten but his frame was large his shoulders broad and his arms were of unusual length he might properly be called a dwarf i am glad i am not so small as that thought carl i am richer than he in having a good figure i should not like to excite attention wherever i go by being unusually large or unusually small some boys would have felt inclined to laugh at the queer figure but carl had too much good feeling his curiosity certainly was aroused and he thought he would like to get acquainted with the little man whose garments of fine texture showed that though short in stature he was probably long in purse he didnt quite know how to pave the way for an acquaintance but circumstances favored him the little man drew out a handkerchief from the side pocket of his overcoat with it fluttered out a bank bill which fell to the ground apparently unobserved by the owner carl hurried on and picking up the bill said to the small stranger as he touched his arm here is some money you just dropped sir the little man turned round and smiled pleasantly thank you are you sure it is mine yes sir it came out with your handkerchief let me see so it is mine i was very careless to put it loose in my pocket you were rather careless sir of what denomination is it it is a twodollar note if you had been a poor boy said the little man eying carl keenly you might have been tempted to keep it i might not have known carl smiled what makes you think i am not a poor boy he said you are well dressed that is true but all the money i have is a dollar and five cents you know where to get more you have a good home i had a home but now i am thrown on my own exertions said carl soberly dear me that is bad if i were better acquainted i might ask more particularly how this happens are you an orphan no sir my father is living and your mother is dead yes sir is your father a poor man no sir he is moderately rich yet you have to fight your own way yes sir i have a stepmother i see are you sure you are not unreasonably prejudiced against your stepmother all stepmothers are not bad or unkind i know that sir yours is i presume you can judge for yourself carl recited some incidents in his experience with his stepmother the stranger listened with evident interest i am not in general in favor of boys leaving home except on extreme provocation he said after a pause but in your case as your father seems to take part against you i think you may be justified especially as at your age you have a fair chance of making your own living i am glad you think that sir i have begun to wonder whether i have not acted rashly in undertaking to support yourself yes sir how old are you sixteen at fourteen i was obliged to undertake what you have now before you to support yourself yes i was left an orphan at fourteen with no money left me by my poor father and no relatives who could help me how did you make out sir asked carl feeling very much interested i sold papers for a while in newark new jersey then i got a place at three dollars a week out of which i had to pay for board lodging and clothes well i wont go through my history i will only say that whatever i did i did as well as i could i am now a man of about middle age and i am moderately wealthy i am very much encouraged by what you tell me sir perhaps you dont understand what a hard struggle i had more than once i have had to go to bed hungry sometimes i have had to sleep out but one mustnt be afraid to rough it a little when he is young i shouldnt like to sleep out now or go to bed without my supper and the little man laughed softly yes sir i expect to rough it but if i could only get a situation at no matter what income i should feel encouraged you have earned no money yet yes sir i earned a dollar yesterday at what kind of work archery the little man looked surprised is that a business he asked curiously ill explain how it was and carl told about the contest so you hit the mark said the little man significantly somehow there was something in the little mans tone that put new courage into carl and incited him to fresh effort i wonder sir he said after a pause that you should be walking when you can well afford to ride the little man smiled it is by advice of my physician he said he tells me i am getting too stout and ought to take more or less exercise in the open air so i am trying to follow his advice are you in business near here sir at a large town six miles distant i may not walk all the way there but i have a place to call at near by and thought i would avail myself of the good chance offered to take a little exercise i feel repaid i have made a pleasant acquaintance thank you sir there is my card and the little man took out a business card reading thus henry jennings furniture warehouse milford i manufacture my furniture in the country he continued but i ship it by special arrangements to a house in new york in which i am also interested yes sir i see do you employ many persons in your establishment about thirty do you think you could make room for me do you think you would like the business i am prepared to like any business in which i can make a living that is right that is the way to look at it let me think for two minutes mr jennings seemed to be plunged in thought then he turned and smiled encouragingly you can come home with me he said and i will consider the matter thank you sir said carl gladly i have got to make a call at the next house not on business though there is an old schoolmate lying there sick i am afraid he is rather poor too you can walk on slowly and i will overtake you in a few minutes thank you sir after walking half a mile if i have not overtaken you you may sit down under a tree and wait for me all right sir before i leave you i will tell you a secret what is it sir the two dollars you picked up i dropped on purpose on purpose asked carl in amazement yes i wanted to try you to see if you were honest then you had noticed me yes i liked your appearance but i wanted to test you chapter xiii an unequal contest carl walked on slowly he felt encouraged by the prospect of work for he was sure that mr jennings would make a place for him if possible he is evidently a kindhearted man carl reflected besides he has been poor himself and he can sympathize with me the wages may be small but i wont mind that if i only support myself economically and get on to most boys brought up in comfort not to say luxury the prospect of working hard for small pay would not have seemed inviting but carl was essentially manly and had sensible ideas about labor it was no sacrifice or humiliation to him to become a working boy for he had never considered himself superior to working boys as many boys in his position would have done he walked on in a leisurely manner and at the end of ten minutes thought he had better sit down and wait for mr jennings but he was destined to receive a shock there under the tree which seemed to offer the most inviting shelter reclined a figure only too wellknown it was the tramp who the day before had compelled him to surrender the tendollar bill the illlooking fellow glanced up and when his gaze rested upon carl his face beamed with savage joy so its you is it he said rising from his seat yes answered carl doubtfully do you remember me yes i have cause to remember you my chicken that was a mean trick you played upon me and he nodded his head significantly i should think it was you that played the trick on me how do you make that out growled the tramp you took my money so i did and much good it did me carl was silent you know why dont you carl might have denied that he knew the character of the bill which was stolen from him but i am glad to say that it would have come from him with a very ill grace for he was accustomed to tell the truth under all circumstances you knew that the bill was counterfeit didnt you demanded the tramp fiercely i was told so at the hotel where i offered it in payment for my bill yet you passed it on me i didnt pass it on you you took it from me retorted carl with spirit that makes no difference i think it does i wouldnt have offered it to anyone in payment of an honest bill humph you thought because i was poor and unfortunate you could pass it off on me this seemed so grotesque that carl found it difficult not to laugh do you know it nearly got me into trouble went on the tramp how was that i stopped at a bakers shop to get a lunch when i got through i offered the bill the old dutchman put on his spectacles and he looked first at the bill then at me then he threatened to have me arrested for passing bad money i told him id go out in the back yard and settle it with him i tell you boy id have knocked him out in one round and he knew it so he bade me be gone and never darken his door again where did you get it it was passed on me by a man i was traveling with how much other money have you got asked the tramp very little give it to me whatever it is this was a little too much for carls patience i have no money to spare he said shortly say that over again said the tramp menacingly if you dont understand me i will i have no money to spare youll spare it to me i reckon look here said carl slowly backing youve robbed me of ten dollars youll have to be satisfied with that it was no good it might have sent me to prison if i was nicely dressed i might pass it but when a chap like me offers a tendollar bill its sure to be looked at sharply i havent a cent and ill trouble you to hand over all youve got why dont you work for a living you are a strong ablebodied man youll find i am if you give me any more of your palaver carl saw that the time of negotiation was past and that active hostilities were about to commence accordingly he turned and ran not forward but in the reverse direction hoping in this way to meet with mr jennings ah thats your game is it growled the tramp you neednt expect to escape for ill overhaul you in two minutes so carl ran and his rough acquaintance ran after him it could hardly be expected that a boy of sixteen though stout and strong could get away from a tall powerful man like the tramp looking back over his shoulder carl saw that the tramp was but three feet behind and almost able to lay his hand upon his shoulder he dodged dexterously and in trying to do the same the tramp nearly fell to the ground naturally this did not sweeten his temper ill half murder you when i get hold of you he growled in a tone that bodied ill for carl the latter began to pant and felt that he could not hold out much longer should he surrender at discretion if some one would only come along was his inward aspiration this man will take my money and beat me too as if in reply to his fervent prayer the small figure of mr jennings appeared suddenly rounding a curve in the road save me save me mr jennings cried carl running up to the little man for protection what is the matter who is this fellow asked mr jennings in a deep voice for so small a man that tramp wants to rob me dont trouble yourself he wont do it said jennings calmly chapter xiv carl arrives in milford the tramp stopped short and eyed carls small defender first with curious surprise and then with derision out of my way you midget he cried or ll hurt you try it said the little man showing no sign of fear why youre no bigger than a kid i can upset you with one finger he advanced contemptuously and laid his hand on the shoulder of the dwarf in an instant jennings had swung his flaillike arms and before the tramp understood what was happening he was lying flat on his back as much to carls amazement as his own he leaped to his feet with an execration and advanced again to the attack to be upset by such a pigmy was the height of mortification im going to crush you you mannikin he threatened jennings put himself on guard like many small men he was very powerful as his broad shoulders and sinewy arms would have made evident to a teacher of gymnastics he clearly understood that this opponent was in deadly earnest and he put out all the strength which he possessed the result was that his largeframed antagonist went down once more striking his head with a force that nearly stunned him it so happened that at this juncture reinforcements arrived a sheriff and his deputy drove up in an open buggy and on witnessing the encounter halted their carriage and sprang to the ground what is the matter mr jennings asked the sheriff respectfully for the little man was a person of importance in that vicinity that gentleman is trying to extort a forced loan mr cunningham ha a footpad yes the sheriff sprang to the side of the tramp who was trying to rise and in a trice his wrists were confined by handcuffs i think i know you mike frost he said you are up to your old tricks when did you come out of sing sing three weeks since answered the tramp sullenly they want you back there come along with me he was assisted into the buggy and spent that night in the lockup did he take anything from you carl asked mr jennings no sir but i was in considerable danger how strong you are he added admiringly strength isnt always according to size said the little man quietly nature gave me a powerful though small frame and i have increased my strength by gymnastic exercise mr jennings did not show the least excitement after his desperate contest he had attended to it as a matter of business and when over he suffered it to pass out of his mind he took out his watch and noted the time it is later than i thought he said i think i shall have to give up my plan of walking the rest of the way then i shall be left alone thought carl regretfully just then a man overtook them in a carriage he greeted mr jennings respectfully are you out for a long walk he said yes but i find time is passing too rapidly with me are you going to milford yes sir can you take two passengers you and the boy yes of course i will see that you dont lose by it i ought not to charge you anything mr jennings several times you have done me favors and i hope to again but this is business if a dollar will pay you the boy and i will ride with you it will be so much gain as i dont go out of my way you can take the back seat carl said mr jennings i will sit with mr leach they were soon seated and on their way relative of yours mr jennings asked leach with a backward glance at carl like most country folks he was curious about people those who live in cities meet too many of their kind to feel an interest in strangers no a young friend answered jennings briefly goin to visit you yes i think he will stay with me for a time then the conversation touched upon milford matters in which at present carl was not interested after his fatiguing walk our hero enjoyed the sensation of riding the road was a pleasant one the day was bright with sunshine and the air vocal with the songs of birds for a time houses were met at rare intervals but after a while it became evident that they were approaching a town of considerable size is this milford mr jennings asked carl yes answered the little man turning with a pleasant smile how large is it i think there are twelve thousand inhabitants it is what western people call a right smart place it has been my home for twenty years and i am much attached to it and it to you mr jennings put in the driver that is pleasant to hear said jennings with a smile it is true there are few people here whom you have not befriended that is what we are here for is it not i wish all were of your opinion why mr jennings when we get a city charter i think i know who will be the first mayor not i mr leach my own business is all i can well attend to thank you for your compliment though carl do you see yonder building he pointed to a threestory structure a frame building occupying a prominent position yes sir that is my manufactory what do you think of it i shouldnt think a town of this size would require so large an establishment answered carl mr jennings laughed you are right he said if i depended on milford trade a very small building would be sufficient my trade is outside i supply many dealers in new york city and at the west my retail trade is small if any of my neighbors want furniture they naturally come to me and i favor them as to price out of friendly feeling but i am a manufacturer and wholesale dealer i see sir shall i take you to your house mr jennings asked leach yes if you please leach drove on till he reached a twostory building of quakerlike simplicity but with a large pleasant yard in front with here and there a bed of flowers here he stopped his horse we have reached our destination carl said mr jennings you are active jump out and i will follow carl needed no second invitation he sprang from the carriage and went forward to help mr jennings out no thank you carl said the little man i am more active than you think here we are he descended nimbly to the ground and drawing a onedollar bill from his pocket handed it to the driver i dont like to take it mr jennings said mr leach why not the laborer is worthy of his hire now carl let us go into the house chapter xv mr jennings at home mr jennings did not need to open the door he had scarcely set foot on the front step when it was opened from inside and carl found a fresh surprise in store for him a woman apparently six feet in height stood on the threshold her figure was spare and ungainly and her face singularly homely but the absence of beauty was partially made up by a kindly expression she looked with some surprise at carl this is a young friend of mine hannah said her master welcome him for my sake i am glad to see you said hannah in a voice that was another amazement it was deeper than that of most men as she spoke she held out a large masculine hand which carl took as seemed to be expected thank you said carl what am i to call you asked hannah carl crawford thats a strange name it is not common i believe you two will get acquainted by and by said mr jennings the most interesting question at present is when will dinner be ready in ten minutes answered hannah promptly carl and i are both famished we have had considerable exercise here he nodded at carl with a comical look and carl understood that he referred in part to his contest with the tramp hannah disappeared into the kitchen and mr jennings said come upstairs carl i will show you your room up an oldfashioned stairway carl followed his host and the latter opened the door of a side room on the first landing it was not large but was neat and comfortable there was a cottage bedstead a washstand a small bureau and a couple of chairs i hope you will come to feel at home here said mr jennings kindly thank you sir i am sure i shall carl responded gratefully there are some nails to hang your clothing on went on mr jennings and then he stopped short for it was clear that carls small gripsack could not contain an extra suit and he felt delicate at calling up in the boys mind the thought of his poverty thank you sir said carl i left my trunk at the house of a friend and if you should succeed in finding me a place i will send for it that is well returned mr jennings looking relieved now i will leave you for a few moments you will find water and towels in case you wish to wash before dinner carl was glad of the opportunity he was particular about his personal appearance and he felt hot and dusty he bathed his face and hands carefully dusted his suit brushed his hair and was ready to descend when he heard the tinkling of a small bell at the foot of the front stairs he readily found his way into the neat diningroom at the rear of the parlor mr jennings sat at the head of the table a little giant diminutive in stature but with broad shoulders a large head and a powerful frame opposite him sat hannah tall stiff and upright as a grenadier she formed a strange contrast to her employer i wonder what made him hire such a tall woman thought carl being so small himself her size makes him look smaller there was a chair at one side placed for carl sit down there carl said mr jennings i wont keep you waiting any longer than i can help what have you given us today hannah roast beef answered hannah in her deep tones there is nothing better the host cut off a liberal slice for carl and passed the plate to hannah who supplied potatoes peas and squash carls mouth fairly watered as he watched the hospitable preparations for his refreshment i never trouble myself about what we are to have on the table said mr jennings hannah always sees to that shes knows just what i want she is a capital cook too hannah is hannah looked pleased at this compliment you are easily pleased master she said i should be hard to suit if i were not pleased with your cooking you dont know so well carls taste but if there is anything he likes particularly he can tell you you are very kind sir said carl there are not many men who would treat a poor boy so considerately he thought he makes me an honored guest when dinner was over mr jennings invited carl to accompany him on a walk they passed along the principal street nearly every person they met giving the little man a cordial greeting he seems to be very popular thought carl at length they reached the manufactory mr jennings went into the office followed by carl a slender darkcomplexioned man about thirtyfive years of age sat on a stool at a high desk he was evidently the bookkeeper any letters mr gibbon asked mr jennings yes sir here are four where are they from from new york chicago pittsburg and new haven what do they relate to orders i have handed them to mr potter potter as carl afterwards learned was superintendent of the manufactory and had full charge of practical details is there anything requiring my personal attention no sir i dont think so by the way mr gibbon let me introduce you to a young friend of mine carl crawford the bookkeeper rapidly scanned carls face and figure it seemed to carl that the scrutiny was not a friendly one i am glad to see you said mr gibbon coldly thank you sir by the way mr jennings said the bookkeeper i have a favor to ask of you go on mr gibbon rejoined his employer in a cordial tone two months since you gave my nephew leonard craig a place in the factory yes i remember i dont think the work agrees with him he seemed a strong healthy boy he has never been used to confinement and it affects him unpleasantly does he wish to resign his place i have been wondering whether you would not be willing to transfer him to the office i could send him on errands to the post office and make him useful in various ways i had not supposed an office boy was needed still if you desire it i will try your nephew in the place thank you sir i am bound to tell you however that his present place is a better one he is learning a good trade which if he masters it will always give him a livelihood i learned a trade and owe all i have to that true mr jennings but there are other ways of earning a living certainly and i thought of giving leonard evening instruction in bookkeeping that alters the case good bookkeepers are always in demand i have no objection to your trying the experiment thank you sir have you mentioned the matter to your nephew i just suggested that i would ask you but could not say what answer you would give it would have been better not to mention the matter at all till you could tell him definitely that he could change his place i dont know but you are right sir however it is all right now now carl said mr jennings i will take you into the workroom chapter xvi carl gets a place i suppose that is the bookkeeper said carl yes he has been with me three years he understands his business well you heard what he said about his nephew yes sir it is his sisters son a boy of about your own age i think he is making a mistake in leaving the factory and going into the office he will have little to do and that not of a character to give him knowledge of business still if he takes lessons in bookkeeping mr jennings smiled the boy will never make a bookkeeper he said his reason for desiring the change is because he is indolent the world has no room for lazy people i wonder sir that you have had a chance to find him out little things betray a boys nature or a mans for that matter when i have visited the workroom i have noticed leonard and formed my conclusions he is not a boy whom i would select for my service but i have taken him as a favor to his uncle i presume he is without means and it is desirable that he should pay his uncle something in return for the home which he gives him how much do you pay him sir if it is not a secret oh no he receives five dollars a week to begin with i will pay him the same in the office and that reminds me how would you like to have a situation in the factory would you like to take leonards place yes sir if you think i would do i feel quite sure of it have you ever done any manual labor no sir i suppose you have always been to school yes sir you are a gentlemans son proceeded mr jennings eying carl attentively how will it suit you to become a working boy i shall like it answered carl promptly dont be too sure you can tell better after a week in the factory those in my employ work ten hours a day leonard craig doesnt like it all i ask mr jennings is that you give me a trial that is fair responded the little man looking pleased i will tell you now that not knowing of any vacancy in the factory i had intended to give you the place in the office which mr gibbon has asked for his nephew it would have been a good deal easier work i shall be quite satisfied to take my place in the factory come in then and see your future scene of employment they entered a large room occupying nearly an entire floor of the building part of the space was filled by machinery the number employed carl estimated roughly at twentyfive quite near the door was a boy who bore some personal resemblance to the bookkeeper carl concluded that it must be leonard craig the boy looked round as mr jennings entered and eyed carl sharply how are you getting on leonard mr jennings asked pretty well sir but the machinery makes my head ache your uncle tells me that your employment does not agree with you no sir i dont think it does he would like to have you in the office with him would you like it also yes sir answered leonard eagerly very well you may report for duty at the office tomorrow morning this boy will take your place here leonard eyed carl curiously not cordially i hope youll like it he said i think i shall you two boys must get acquainted said mr jennings leonard this is carl crawford glad to know you said leonard coldly i dont think i shall like that boy thought carl as he followed mr jennings to another part of the room chapter xvii carl enters the factory when they left the factory mr jennings said with a smile now you are one of us carl tomorrow you begin work i am glad of it sir you dont ask what salary you are to get i am willing to leave that to you suppose we say two dollars a week and board to begin with that is better than i expected but where am i to board at my house for the present if that will suit you i shall like it very much if it wont inconvenience you hannah is the one to be inconvenienced if anyone i had a little conversation with her while you were getting ready for dinner she seems to have taken a liking for you though she doesnt like boys generally as for me it will make the home brighter to have a young person in it hannah and i are oldfashioned and quiet and the neighbors dont have much reason to complain of noise no sir i should think not said carl with a smile there is one thing you must be prepared for carl said mr jennings after a pause what is that sir your living in my house i being your employer may excite jealousy in some i think i know of one who will be jealous leonard craig and his uncle however dont borrow any trouble on that score i hope you wont take advantage of your position and thinking yourself a favorite neglect your duties i will not sir business and friendship ought to be kept apart that is right sir i am going back to the house but you may like to take a walk about the village you will feel interested in it as it is to be your future home by the way it may be well for you to write for your trunk you can order it sent to my house all right sir i will do so he went to the post office and buying a postal card wrote to his friend gilbert vance as follows dear gilbert please send my trunk by express to me at milford care of henry jennings esq he is my employer and i live at his house he is proprietor of a furniture factory will write further particulars soon carl crawford this postal carried welcome intelligence to gilbert who felt a brotherly interest in carl he responded by a letter of hearty congratulation and forwarded the trunk as requested carl reported for duty the next morning and though a novice soon showed that he was not without mechanical skill at twelve oclock all the factory hands had an hour off for dinner as carl passed into the street he found himself walking beside the boy whom he had succeeded leonard craig goodmorning leonard said carl pleasantly goodmorning have you taken my place in the factory yes do you think you shall like it i think i shall though of course it is rather early to form an opinion i didnt like it why not i dont want to grow up a workman i think i am fit for something better mr jennings began as a factory hand i suppose he had a taste for it i havent then you like your present position better oh yes its more genteel how much does jennings pay you two dollars a week and board how is that where do you board with him oh said leonard his countenance changing so you are a favorite with the boss are you i dont know he gave me warning that he should be just as strict with me as if we were strangers how long have you known him carl smiled i met him for the first time yesterday he answered thats very queer well perhaps it is a little singular are you a poor boy i have to earn my own living i see you will grow up a common workman i shall try to rise above it i am not ashamed of the position but i am ambitious to rise i am going to be a bookkeeper said leonard my uncle is going to teach me i would rather be a bookkeeper than a factory hand then you are right in preparing yourself for such a post here the two boys separated as they were to dine in different places leonard was pleased with his new position he really had very little to do twice a day he went to the post office once or twice to the bank and there was an occasional errand besides to carl the idleness would have been insupportable but leonard was naturally indolent he sat down in a chair by the window and watched the people go by the first afternoon he was in luck for there was a dog fight in the street outside he seized his hat went out and watched the canine warfare with the deepest interest i think i will buy you a system of bookkeeping said his uncle and you can study it in the office put it off till next week uncle julius i want to get rested from the factory work it seems to me leonard you were born lazy said his uncle sharply i dont care to work with my hands do you care to work at all i should like to be a bookkeeper do you know that my work is harder and more exhausting than that of a workman in the factory you dont want to exchange with him do you asked leonard no thats where i agree with you mr jennings took several weekly papers leonard was looking over the columns of one of them one day when he saw the advertisement of a gift enterprise of a most attractive character the first prize was a house and grounds valued at ten thousand dollars following were minor prizes among them one thousand dollars in gold leonards fancy was captivated by the brilliant prospect of such a prize price of tickets only one dollar he read think of getting a thousand dollars for one oh if i could only be the lucky one he took out his purse though he knew beforehand that his stock of cash consisted only of two dimes and a nickel i wonder if i could borrow a dollar of that boy carl he deliberated ill speak to him about it this happened more than a week after carl went to work in the factory he had already received one weeks pay and it remained untouched in his pocket leonard joined him in the street early in the evening and accosted him graciously where are you going he asked nowhere in particular i am out for a walk so am i shall we walk together if you like after talking on indifferent matters leonard said suddenly oh by the way will you do me a favor what is it lend me a dollar till next week in former days carl would probably have granted the favor but he realized the value of money now that he had to earn it by steady work i am afraid it wont be convenient he answered does that mean that you havent got it asked leonard no i have it but i am expecting to use it i wouldnt mind paying you interest for it say twentyfive cents continued leonard who had set his heart on buying a ticket in the gift enterprise i would be ashamed to take such interest as that but i have a chance of making a good deal more out of it myself in what way that is my secret why dont you borrow it of your uncle he would ask too many questions however i see that youre a miser and i wont trouble you he left carl in a huff and walked hastily away he turned into a lane little traveled and after walking a few rods came suddenly upon the prostrate body of a man whose deep breathing showed that he was stupefied by liquor leonard was not likely to feel any special interest in him but one object did attract his attention it was a wallet which had dropped out of the mans pocket and was lying on the grass beside him chapter xviii leonards temptation leonard was not a thief but the sight of the wallet tempted him under the circumstances he had set his heart on buying a ticket in the gift enterprise and knew of no way of obtaining the requisite sum except this it was indeed a little shock to him to think of appropriating money not his own yet who would know it the owner of the wallet was drunk and would be quite unconscious of his loss besides if he didnt take the wallet some one else probably would and appropriate the entire contents it was an insidious suggestion and leonard somehow persuaded himself that since the money was sure to be taken he might as well have the benefit of it as anyone else so after turning over the matter in his mind rapidly he stooped down and picked up the wallet the man did not move emboldened by his insensibility leonard cautiously opened the pocketbook and his eyes glistened when he saw tucked away in one side quite a thick roll of bills he wont miss one bill thought leonard anyone else might take the whole wallet but i wouldnt do that i wonder how much money there is in the roll he darted another glance at the prostrate form but there seemed no danger of interruption he took the roll in his hand therefore and a hasty scrutiny showed him that the bills ran from ones to tens there must have been nearly a hundred dollars in all suppose i take a five thought leonard whose cupidity increased with the sight of the money he wont miss it and it will be better in my hands than if spent for whiskey how specious are the arguments of those who seek an excuse for a wrong act that will put money in the purse yes i think i may venture to take a five and as i might not be able to change it right away i will take a one to send for a ticket then i will put the wallet back in the mans pocket so far all went smoothly and leonard was proceeding to carry out his intention when taking a precautionary look at the man on the ground he was dumfounded by seeing his eyes wide open and fixed upon him leonard flushed painfully like a criminal detected in a crime and returned the look of inquiry by one of dismay what you doing inquired the victim of inebriety i is this your wallet sir stammered leonard course it is what you got it for i i saw it on the ground and was afraid some one would find it and rob you said leonard fluently somebody did find it rejoined the man whose senses seemed coming back to him how much did you take i you dont think i would take any of your money said leonard in virtuous surprise looked like it cant tell who to trust i assure you i had only just picked it up and was going to put it back in your pocket sir the man drunk as he was winked knowingly smart boy he said you do it well ol fella but sir it is quite true i assure you i will count over the money before you do you know how much you had nev mind help me up leonard stooped over and helped the drunkard to a sitting position where am i where is hotel leonard answered him take me to hotel and ill give you a dollar certainly sir said leonard briskly he was to get his dollar after all and would not have to steal it i am afraid he is not to be praised for his honesty as it seemed to be a matter of necessity i wish hed give me five dollars thought leonard but didnt see his way clear to make the suggestion he placed the man on his feet and guided his steps to the road as he walked along the inebriate whose gait was at first unsteady recovered his equilibrium and required less help how long had you been lying there asked leonard dont know i was taken sick and the inebriate nodded knowingly at leonard who felt at liberty to laugh too do you ever get sick not that way answered leonard smart boy better off they reached the hotel and leonard engaged a room for his companion has he got money asked the landlord in a low voice yes answered leonard he has nearly a hundred dollars i counted it myself thats all right then said the landlord here james show the gentleman up to no come too said the stranger to leonard the latter followed the more readily because he had not yet been paid his dollar the door of no was opened and the two entered i will stay with the gentleman a short time said leonard to the boy if we want anything we will ring all right sir whats your name asked the inebriate as he sank into a large armchair near the window leonard craig never heard the name before whats your name sir what you want to know for asked the other cunningly the landlord will want to put it on his book my name phil stark philip stark yes who told you it will be seen that mr stark was not yet quite himself you told me yourself so i did scuse me certainly sir by the way you told me you would pay me a dollar for bringing you to the hotel so i did take it and philip stark passed the wallet to leonard leonard felt tempted to take a twodollar bill instead of a one as mr stark would hardly notice the mistake still he might ask to look at the bill and that would be awkward so the boy contented himself with the sum promised thank you sir he said as he slipped the bill into his vest pocket do you want some supper no i want to sleep then you had better lie down on the bed will you undress no too much trouble mr stark rose from the armchair and lurching round to the bed flung himself on it i suppose you dont want me any longer said leonard no come round tomorrer yes sir leonard opened the door and left the room he resolved to keep the appointment and come round the next day who knew but some more of mr starks money might come into his hands grown man as he was he seemed to need a guardian and leonard was willing to act as such for a consideration its been a queer adventure thought leonard as he slowly bent his steps towards his uncles house ive made a dollar out of it anyway and if he hadnt happened to wake up just as he did i might have done better however it may turn out as well in the end you are rather late leonard said his uncle in a tone that betrayed some irritation i wanted to send you on an errand and you are always out of the way at such a time ill go now said leonard with unusual amiability ive had a little adventure an adventure what is it mr gibbon asked with curiosity leonard proceeded to give an account of his finding the inebriate in the meadow and his guiding him to the hotel it may readily be supposed that he said nothing of his attempt to appropriate a part of the contents of the wallet what was his name asked gibbon with languid curiosity phil stark he calls himself a strange change came over the face of the bookkeeper there was a frightened look in his eyes and his color faded phil stark he repeated in a startled tone yes sir what brings him here gibbon asked himself nervously but no words passed his lips do you know the name asked leonard wonderingly i have heard it before but no i dont think it is the same man chapter xix an artful scheme does this mr stark intend to remain long in the village inquired the bookkeeper in a tone of assumed indifference he didnt say anything on that point answered leonard he did not say what business brought him here i presume no he was hardly in condition to say much he was pretty full said leonard with a laugh however he wants me to call upon him tomorrow and may tell me then he wants you to call upon him yes uncle are you going yes why shouldnt i i see no reason said gibbon hesitating then after a pause he added if you see the way clear find out what brings him to milford yes uncle i will uncle julius seems a good deal interested in this man considering that he is a stranger thought the boy the bookkeeper was biting his nails a habit he had when he was annoyed and leonard he added slowly dont mention my name while you are speaking to stark no sir i wont if you dont want me to answered leonard his face betraying unmistakable curiosity his uncle noted this and explained hurriedly it is possible that he may be a man whom i once met under disagreeable circumstances and i would prefer not to meet him again should he learn that i was living here he would be sure to want to renew the acquaintance yes sir i see i dont think he would want to borrow money for he seems to be pretty well provided i made a dollar out of him today and that is one reason why i am willing to call on him again i may strike him for another bill there is no objection to that provided you dont talk to him too freely i dont think he will want to stay long in milford i wouldnt if i had as much money as he probably has do you often meet the new boy carl crawford yes i see him on the street quite often he lives with mr jennings i hear so he tells me it is rather strange i didnt suppose that jennings would care to receive a boy in his house or that tall grenadier of a housekeeper either i expect she rules the household she could tuck him under her arm and walk off with him said leonard laughing the boy must be artful to have wormed his way into the favor of the strange pair he seems to be a favorite yes uncle i think he is however i like my position better than his he will learn his business from the beginning i dont know but it was a mistake for you to leave the factory i am not at all sorry for it uncle your position doesnt amount to much i am paid just as well as i was when i was in the factory but you are learning nothing you are going to teach me bookkeeping even that is not altogether a desirable business a good bookkeeper can never expect to be in business for himself he must be content with a salary all his life you have done pretty well uncle but there is no chance of my becoming a rich man i have to work hard for my money and i havent been able to lay up much money yet that reminds me leonard i must impress upon you the fact that you have your own way to make i have procured you a place and i provide you a home you take my wages said leonard bluntly a part of them but on the whole you are not selfsupporting you must look ahead leonard and consider the future when you are a young man you will want to earn an adequate income of course i shall uncle but there is one other course what is that i may marry an heiress suggested leonard smiling the bookkeeper winced i thought i was marrying an heiress when i married your aunt he said but within six months of our wedding day her father made a bad failure and actually had the assurance to ask me to give him a home under my roof did you do it no i told him it would not be convenient what became of him he got a small clerkship at ten dollars a week in the counting room of a mercantile friend and filled it till one day last october when he dropped dead of apoplexy i made a great mistake when i married in not asking him to settle a definite sum on his daughter it would have been so much saved from the wreck did aunt want him to come and live here yes women are always unreasonable she would have had me support the old man in idleness but i am not one of that kind every tub should stand on its own bottom i say so too uncle do you know whether this boy carl crawford has any father or mother from a word jennings let fall i infer that he has relatives but is not on good terms with them i have been a little afraid he might stand in your light how so uncle should there be any good opening for one of your age i am afraid he would get it rather than you i didnt think of that said leonard jealously living as he does with mr jennings he will naturally try to ingratiate himself with him and stand first in his esteem that is true is mr jennings a rich man do you think yes i think he is the factory and stock are worth considerable money but i know he has other investments also as one item he has over a thousand dollars in the carterville savings bank he has been very prudent has met with no losses and has put aside a great share of his profits every year i wonder he dont marry marriage doesnt seem to be in his thoughts hannah makes him so comfortable that he will probably remain a bachelor to the end of his days perhaps he will leave his money to her he is likely to live as long as she she is a good deal longer than he said leonard with a laugh the bookkeeper condescended to smile at this joke though it was not very brilliant before this boy carl came he resumed thoughtfully i hoped he might take a fancy to you he must die some time and having no near blood relative i thought he might select as heir some boy like yourself who might grow into his favor and get on his blind side is it too late now asked leonard eagerly perhaps not but the appearance of this new boy on the scene makes your chance a good deal smaller i wish we could get rid of him said leonard frowning the only way is to injure him in the estimation of mr jennings i think i know of a way mention it here is an advertisement of a lottery said leonard whose plans in view of what his uncle had said had experienced a change well i will write to the manager in carls name inquiring about tickets and of course he will answer to him to the care of mr jennings this will lead to the suspicion that carl is interested in such matters it is a good idea it will open the way to a loss of confidence on the part of mr jennings i will sit down at your desk and write at once three days later mr jennings handed a letter to carl after they reached home in the evening a letter for you to my care he explained carl opened it in surprise and read as follows office of gift enterprise mr carl crawford your letter of inquiry is received in reply we would say that we will send you six tickets for five dollars by disposing of them among your friends at one dollar each you will save the cost of your own you had better remit at once yours respectfully pitkins gamp agents carl looked the picture of astonishment when he read this letter chapter xx reveals a mystery please read this letter mr jennings said carl his employer took the letter from his hand and ran his eye over it do you wish to ask my advice about the investment he said quietly no sir i wanted to know how such a letter came to be written to me didnt you send a letter of inquiry there no sir and i cant understand how these men could have got hold of my name mr jennings looked thoughtful some one has probably written in your name he said after a pause but who could have done so if you will leave the letter in my hands i may be able to obtain some information on that point i shall be glad if you can mr jennings dont mention to anyone having received such a letter and if anyone broaches the subject let me know who it is yes sir i will mr jennings quietly put on his hat and walked over to the post office the postmaster who also kept a general variety store chanced to be alone goodevening mr jennings he said pleasantly what can i do for you i want a little information mr sweetland though it is doubtful if you can give it mr sweetland assumed the attitude of attention do you know if any letter has been posted from this office within a few days addressed to pitkins gamp syracuse new york yes two letters have been handed in bearing this address mr jennings was surprised for he had never thought of two letters can you tell me who handed them in he asked both were handed in by the same party and that was a boy in your employ mr jennings looked grave was it possible that carl was deceiving him the boy who lives at my house he asked anxiously no the boy who usually calls for the factory mail the nephew of your bookkeeper i think his name is leonard craig ah i see said mr jennings looking very much relieved and you say he deposited both letters yes sir do you happen to remember if any other letter like this was received at the office here he displayed the envelope of carls letter yes one was received addressed to the name of the one who deposited the first letters leonard craig thank you mr sweetland your information has cleared up a mystery be kind enough not to mention the matter i will bear your request in mind mr jennings bought a supply of stamps and then left the office well carl he said when he reentered the house i have discovered who wrote in your name to pitkins gamp who sir asked carl with curiosity leonard craig but what could induce him to do it said carl perplexed he thought that i would see the letter and would be prejudiced against you if i discovered that you were investing in what is a species of lottery would you sir i should have thought you unwise and i should have been reminded of a fellow workman who became so infatuated with lotteries that he stole money from his employer to enable him to continue his purchases of tickets but for this unhappy passion he would have remained honest leonard must dislike me said carl thoughtfully he is jealous of you i warned you he or some one else might become so but the most curious circumstance is he wrote a second letter in his own name i suspect he has bought a ticket i advise you to say nothing about the matter unless questioned i wont sir the next day carl met leonard in the street by the way said leonard you got a letter yesterday yes i brought it to the factory with the rest of the mail thank you leonard looked at him curiously he seems to be closemouthed leonard said to himself he has sent for a ticket ill bet a hat and dont want me to find out i wish i could draw the capital prize i would not mind old jennings finding out then do you ever hear from your friends he asked a minute later not often i thought that letter might be from your home no it was a letter from syracuse i remember now it was postmarked syracuse have you friends there none that i am aware of yet you receive letters from there that was a business letter carl was quietly amused at leonards skillful questions but was determined not to give him any light on the subject leonard tried another avenue of attack oh dear he sighed i wish i was rich i shouldnt mind being rich myself said carl with a smile i suppose old jennings must have a lot of money mr jennings i presume is very well off responded carl emphasizing the title mr if i had his money i wouldnt live in such quaker style would you have him give fashionable parties asked carl smiling well i dont know that he would enjoy that but ill tell you what i would do i would buy a fast horse a twoforty mare and a bangup buggy and id show the old farmers round here what fast driving is then id have a stylish house and i dont believe youd be content to live in milford leonard i dont think i would either unless my business were here id go to new york every few weeks and see life you may be rich some time so that you can carry out your wishes do you know any easy way of getting money asked leonard pointedly the easy ways are not generally the true ways a man sometimes makes money by speculation but he has to have some to begin with i cant get anything out of him thought leonard well goodevening he crossed the street and joined the man who has already been referred to as boarding at the hotel mr stark had now been several days in milford what brought him there or what object he had in staying leonard had not yet ascertained he generally spent part of his evenings with the stranger and had once or twice received from him a small sum of money usually however he had met mr stark in the billiard room and played a game or two of billiards with him mr stark always paid for the use of the table and that was naturally satisfactory to leonard who enjoyed amusement at the expense of others leonard bearing in mind his uncles request had not mentioned his name to mr stark and stark though he had walked about the village more or less had not chanced to meet mr gibbon he had questioned leonard however about mr jennings and whether he was supposed to be rich leonard had answered freely that everyone considered him so but he doesnt know how to enjoy his money he added we should said stark jocularly you bet we would returned leonard and he was quite sincere in his boast as we know from his conversation with carl by the way said stark on this particular evening i never asked you about your family leonard i suppose you live with your parents no sir they are dead then whom do you live with with my uncle answered leonard guardedly is his name craig no what then ive got to tell him thought leonard well i dont suppose there will be much harm in it my uncle is bookkeeper for mr jennings he said and his name is julius gibbon philip stark wheeled round and eyed leonard in blank astonishment your uncle is julius gibbon he exclaimed yes well ill be blowed do you know my uncle asked leonard hesitating i rather think i do take me round to the house i want to see him chapter xxi an unwelcome guest when julius gibbon saw the door open and philip stark enter the room where he was smoking his noon cigar his heart quickened its pulsations and he turned pale how are you old friend said stark boisterously funny isnt it that i should run across your nephew very strange ejaculated gibbon looking the reverse of joyous its a happy meeting isnt it we used to see a good deal of each other and he laughed in a way that gibbon was far from enjoying now ive come over to have a good long chat with you leonard i think we wont keep you as you wouldnt be interested in our talk about old times yes leonard you may leave us added his uncle leonards curiosity was excited and he would have been glad to remain but as there was no help for it he went out when they were alone stark drew up his chair close and laid his hand familiarly on the bookkeepers knee i say gibbon do you remember where we last met gibbon shuddered slightly yes he answered feebly it was at joliet joliet penitentiary your time expired before mine i envied you the six months advantage you had of me when i came out i searched for you everywhere but heard nothing how did you know i was here asked the bookkeeper i didnt know i had no suspicion of it nor did i dream that leonard who was able to do me a little service was your nephew i say hes a chip of the old block gibbon and stark laughed as if he enjoyed it what do you mean by that i was lying in a field overcome by liquor an old weakness of mine you know and my wallet had slipped out of my pocket i chanced to open my eyes when i saw it in the hands of your promising nephew ha ha he told me that but he didnt tell you that he was on the point of appropriating a part of the contents i warrant you he didnt tell you that did he acknowledge it perhaps you misjudged him he didnt acknowledge it in so many words but i knew it by his change of color and confusion oh i didnt lay it up against him we are very good friends he comes honestly by it gibbon looked very much annoyed but there were reasons why he did not care to express his chagrin on my honor it was an immense surprise to me proceeded stark when i learned that my old friend gibbon was a resident of milford i wish you had never found it out thought gibbon biting his lip no sooner did i hear it than i posted off at once to call on you so i see stark elevated his eyebrows and looked amused he saw that he was not a welcome visitor but for that he cared little havent you got on though here i find you the trusted bookkeeper of an important business firm did you bring recommendations from your last place and he burst into a loud guffaw i wish you wouldnt make such references snapped gibbon they can do no good and might do harm dont be angry my dear boy i rejoice at your good fortune wish i was equally well fixed you dont ask how i am getting on i hope you are prosperous said gibbon coldly i might be more so is there a place vacant in your office no and if there were you might not recommend me eh there is no need to speak of that there is no vacancy upon my word i wish there were as i am getting to the end of my tether i may have money enough to last me four weeks longer but no more i dont see how i can help you said gibbon how much salary does mr jennings pay you a hundred dollars a month answered the bookkeeper reluctantly not bad in a cheap place like this it takes all i make to pay expenses i remember you have a wife i have no such incumbrance there is one question i would like to ask you said the bookkeeper fire away dear boy have you an extra cigar here is one thanks now i shall be comfortable go ahead with your question what brought you to milford you didnt know of my being here you say neither did i i came on my old business what i heard there was a rich manufacturer here i allude to your respected employer i thought i might manage to open his safe some dark night no no protested gibbon in alarm dont think of it why not asked stark coolly because answered gibbon in some agitation i might be suspected well perhaps you might but i have got to look out for number one how do you expect me to live go somewhere else there are plenty of other men as rich and richer where you would not be compromising an old friend its because i have an old friend in the office that i have thought this would be my best opening surely man you dont expect me to betray my employer and join with you in robbing him thats just what i do expect dont tell me you have grown virtuous gibbon the tiger doesnt lose his spots or the leopard his stripes i tell you theres a fine chance for us both ill divide with you if youll help me but ive gone out of the business protested gibbon i havent come old boy i cant let any sentimental scruples interfere with so good a stroke of business i wont help you said gibbon angrily you only want to get me into trouble you wont help me said stark with slow deliberation no i cant honorably cant you let me alone sorry to say i cant if i was rich i might but as it is it is quite necessary for me to raise some money somewhere by all accounts jennings is rich and can spare a small part of his accumulations for a good fellow thats out of luck youd better give up the idea its quite impossible is it asked stark with a wicked look then do you know what i will do what will you do asked gibbon nervously i will call on your employer and tell him what i know of you you wouldnt do that said the bookkeeper much agitated why not you turn your back upon an old friend you bask in prosperity and turn from him in his poverty its the way of the world no doubt but phil stark generally gets even with those who dont treat him well tell me what you want me to do said gibbon desperately tell me first whether your safe contains much of value we keep a line of deposit with the milford bank do you mean to say that nothing of value is left in the safe overnight asked stark disappointed there is a box of government bonds usually kept there the bookkeeper admitted reluctantly ah thats good returned stark rubbing his hands do you know how much they amount to i think there are about four thousand dollars good we must have those bonds gibbon chapter xxii mr stark is recognized phil stark was resolved not to release his hold upon his old acquaintance during the day he spent his time in lounging about the town but in the evening he invariably fetched up at the bookkeepers modest home his attentions were evidently not welcome to mr gibbon who daily grew more and more nervous and irritable and had the appearance of a man whom something disquieted leonard watched the growing intimacy with curiosity he was a sharp boy and he felt convinced that there was something between his uncle and the stranger there was no chance for him to overhear any conversation for he was always sent out of the way when the two were closeted together he still met mr stark outside and played billiards with him frequently once he tried to extract some information from stark youve known my uncle a good while he said in a tone of assumed indifference yes a good many years answered stark as he made a carom were you in business together not exactly but we may be some time returned stark with a significant smile here well that isnt decided where did you first meet uncle julius the kids growing curious said stark to himself does he think he can pull wool over the eyes of phil stark if he does he thinks a good deal too highly of himself i will answer his questions to suit myself why dont you ask your uncle that i did said leonard but he snapped me up and told me to mind my own business he is getting terribly cross lately its his stomach i presume said stark urbanely he is a confirmed dyspeptic thats whats the matter with him now ive got the digestion of an ox nothing ever troubles me and the result is that i am as calm and goodnatured as a may morning dont you ever get riled mr stark asked leonard laughing well hardly ever sometimes when i am asked fool questions by one who seems to be prying into what is none of his business i get wrathy and when im roused look out he glanced meaningly at leonard and the boy understood that the words conveyed a warning and a menace is anything the matter with you mr gibbon are you as well as usual asked mr jennings one morning the little man was always considerate and he had noticed the flurried and nervous manner of his bookkeeper no sir what makes you ask said gibbon apologetically perhaps you need a vacation suggested mr jennings oh no i think not besides i couldnt be spared i would keep the books myself for a week to favor you you are very kind but i wont trouble you just yet a little later on if i feel more uncomfortable i will avail myself of your kindness do so i know that bookkeeping is a strain upon the mind more so than physical labor there were special reasons why mr gibbon did not dare to accept the vacation tendered him by his employer he knew that phil stark would be furious for it would interfere with his designs he could not afford to offend this man who held in his possession a secret affecting his reputation and good name the presence of a stranger in a small town always attracts public attention and many were curious about the rakishlooking man who had now for some time occupied a room at the hotel among others carl had several times seen him walking with leonard craig leonard he asked one day who is the gentleman i see you so often walking with its a man thats boarding at the hotel i play billiards with him sometimes he seems to like milford i dont know hes over at our house every evening is he asked carl surprised yes hes an old acquaintance of uncle julius i dont know where they met each other for he wont tell he said he and uncle might go into business together some time between you and me i think uncle would like to get rid of him i know he doesnt like him this set carl to thinking but something occurred soon afterwards that impressed him still more occasionally a customer of the house visited milford wishing to give a special order for some particular line of goods about this time a mr thorndike from chicago came to milford on this errand and put up at the hotel he had called at the factory during the day and had some conversation with mr jennings after supper a doubt entered the mind of the manufacturer in regard to one point and he said to carl carl are you engaged this evening no sir will you carry a note for me to the hotel certainly sir i shall be glad to do so mr thorndike leaves in the morning and i am not quite clear as to one of the specifications he gave me with his order you noticed the gentleman who went through the factory with me yes sir he is mr thorndike please hand him this note and if he wishes you to remain with him for company you had better do so i will sir hannah said mr jennings as his messenger left with the note carl is a pleasant addition to our little household yes indeed he is responded hannah emphatically if he was twice the trouble id be glad to have him here he is easy to get along with surely yet his stepmother drove him from his fathers house shes a wicked trollop then said hannah in a deep stern voice id like to get hold of her i would what would you do to her asked mr jennings smiling id give her a good shaking answered hannah i believe you would hannah said mr jennings amused on the whole i think she had better keep out of your clutches still but for her we would never have met with carl what is his fathers loss is our gain what a poor weak man his father must be said hannah contemptuously to let a woman like her turn him against his own flesh and blood i agree with you hannah i hope some time he may see his mistake carl kept on his way to the hotel it was summer and mr thorndike was sitting on the piazza smoking a cigar to him carl delivered the note its all right he said rapidly glancing it over you may tell mr jennings and here he gave an answer to the question asked in the letter yes sir i will remember wont you sit down and keep me company a little while asked thorndike who was sociably inclined thank you sir and carl sat down in a chair beside him will you have a cigar no thank you sir i dont smoke that is where you are sensible i began to smoke at fourteen and now i find it hard to break off my doctor tells me it is hurting me but the chains of habit are strong all the more reason for forming good habits sir spoken like a philosopher are you in the employ of my friend mr jennings yes sir learning the business that is my present intention if you ever come out to chicago call on me and if you are out of a place i will give you one are you not a little rash mr thorndike to offer me a place when you know so little of me i trust a good deal to looks i care more for them than for recommendations at that moment phil stark came out of the hotel and passing them stepped off the piazza into the street mr thorndike half rose from his seat and looked after him who is that he asked in an exciting whisper a man named stark who is boarding at the hotel do you know him do i know him repeated thorndike he is one of the most successful burglars in the west chapter xxiii preparing for the burglar carl stared at mr thorndike in surprise and dismay a burglar he ejaculated yes i was present in the courtroom when he was convicted of robbing the springfield bank i sat there for three hours and his face was impressed upon my memory i saw him later on in the joliet penitentiary i was visiting the institution and saw the prisoners file out into the yard i recognized this man instantly do you know how long he has been here for two weeks i should think he has some dishonest scheme in his head i have no doubt have you a bank in milford yes he may have some design upon that he is very intimate with our bookkeeper so his nephew tells me mr thorndike looked startled ha i scent danger to my friend mr jennings he ought to be apprised he shall be sir said carl firmly will you see him tonight yes sir i am not only in his employ but i live at his house that is well perhaps i ought to go home at once no attempt will be made to rob the office till late it is scarcely eight oclock i dont know however but i will walk around to the house with you and tell your employer what i know by the way what sort of a man is the bookkeeper i dont know him very well sir he has a nephew in the office who was transferred from the factory i have taken his place do you think the bookkeeper would join in a plot to rob his employer i dont like him to me he is always disagreeable but i would not like to say that how long has he been in the employ of mr jennings as long as two years i should think you say that this man is intimate with him leonard craig he is the nephew says that mr philip stark is at his uncles house every evening so he calls himself philip stark does he isnt that his name i suppose it is one of his names he was convicted under that name and retains it here on account of its being so far from the place of his conviction whether it is his real name or not i do not know what is the name of your bookkeeper julius gibbon i dont remember ever having heard it evidently there has been some past acquaintance between the two men and that i should say is hardly a recommendation for mr gibbon of course that alone is not enough to condemn him but the intimacy is certainly a suspicious circumstance the two soon reached the house of mr jennings for the distance was only a quarter of a mile mr jennings seemed a little surprised but gave a kindly welcome to his unexpected guest it occurred to him that he might have come to give some extra order for goods you are surprised to see me said thorndike i came on a very important matter a look of inquiry came over the face of mr jennings theres a thief in the village a guest at the hotel whom i recognize as one of the most expert burglars in the country i think i know whom you mean a man of moderate height rather thick set with small black eyes and a slouch hat exactly what can you tell me about him mr thorndike repeated the statement he had already made to carl do you think our bank is in danger asked the manufacturer perhaps so but the chief danger threatens you mr jennings looked surprised what makes you think so because this man appears to be very intimate with your bookkeeper how do you know that asked the little man quickly i refer you to carl leonard craig told me tonight that this man stark spent every evening at his uncles house mr jennings looked troubled i am sorry to hear this he said i dislike to lose confidence in any man whom i have trusted have you noticed anything unusual in the demeanor of your bookkeeper of late asked thorndike yes he has appeared out of spirits and nervous that would seem to indicate he is conspiring to rob you this very day noticing the change in him i offered him a weeks vacation he promptly declined to take it of course it would conflict with the plans of his confederate i dont know the man but i do know human nature and i venture to predict that your safe will be opened within a week do you keep anything of value in it there are my books which are of great value to me but not to a thief anything else yes i have a tin box containing four thousand dollars in government bonds coupon or registered coupon nothing could be better for a burglar what on earth could induce you to keep the bonds in your own safe to tell the truth i considered them quite as safe there as in the bank banks are more likely to be robbed than private individuals circumstances alter cases does anyone know that you have the bonds in your safe my bookkeeper is aware of it then my friend i caution you to remove the bonds from so unsafe a depository as soon as possible unless i am greatly mistaken this man stark has bought over your bookkeeper and will have his aid in robbing you what is your advice to remove the bonds this very evening said thorndike do you think the danger so pressing of course i dont know that an attempt will be made tonight but it is quite possible should it be so you would have an opportunity to realize that delays are dangerous should mr gibbon find on opening the safe tomorrow morning that the box is gone it may lead to an attack upon my house i wish you to leave the box in the safe but i understand that you advised me to remove it not the box but the bonds listen to my plan cut out some newspaper slips of about the same bulk as the bonds put them in place of the bonds in the box and quietly transfer the bonds in your pocket to your own house tomorrow you can place them in the bank should no burglary be attempted let the box remain in the safe just as if its contents were valuable your advice is good and i will adopt it said jennings and thank you for your valuable and friendly instruction if agreeable to you i will accompany you to the office at once the bonds cannot be removed too soon then if anyone sees us entering it will be thought that you are showing me the factory it will divert suspicion even if we are seen by stark or your bookkeeper may i go too asked carl eagerly certainly said the manufacturer i know carl that you are devoted to my interests it is a comfort to know this now that i have cause to suspect my bookkeeper it was only a little after nine the night was moderately dark and carl was intrusted with a wax candle which he put in his pocket for use in the office they reached the factory without attracting attention and entered by the office door mr jennings opened the safe he and the bookkeeper alone knew the combination and with some anxiety took out the tin box it was possible that the contents had already been removed but no on opening it the bonds were found intact according to mr thorndikes advice he transferred them to his pocket and substituted folded paper then replacing everything the safe was once more locked and the three left the office mr thorndike returned to the hotel and mr jennings to his house but carl asked permission to remain out a while longer it is on my mind that an attempt will be made tonight to rob the safe he said i want to watch near the factory to see if my suspicion is correct very well carl but dont stay out too long said his employer suppose i see them entering the office sir dont interrupt them they will find themselves badly fooled notice only if mr gibbon is of the party i must know whether my bookkeeper is to be trusted chapter xxiv the burglary carl seated himself behind a stone wall on the opposite side of the street from the factory the building was on the outskirts of the village though not more than half a mile from the post office and there was very little travel in that direction during the evening this made it more favorable for thieves though up to the present time no burglarious attempt had been made on it indeed milford had been exceptionally fortunate in that respect neighboring towns had been visited some of them several times but milford had escaped the night was quite dark but not what is called pitchy dark as the eyes became accustomed to the obscurity they were able to see a considerable distance so it was with carl from his place of concealment he occasionally raised his head and looked across the way to the factory an hour passed and he grew tired it didnt look as if the attempt were to be made that night eleven oclock pealed out from the spire of the baptist church a quarter of a mile away carl counted the strokes and when the last died into silence he said to himself i will stay here about ten minutes longer then if no one comes i will give it up for tonight the time was nearly up when his quick ear caught a low murmur of voices instantly he was on the alert waiting till the sound came nearer he ventured to raise his head for an instant above the top of the wall his heart beat with excitement when he saw two figures approaching though it was so dark he recognized them by their size and outlines they were julius gibbon the bookkeeper and phil stark the stranger staying at the hotel carl watched closely raising his head for a few seconds at a time above the wall ready to lower it should either glance in his direction but neither of the men did so ignorant that they were suspected it was the farthest possible from their thoughts that anyone would be on the watch presently they came so near that carl could hear their voices i wish it was over murmured gibbon nervously dont worry said his companion there is no occasion for haste everybody in milford is in bed and asleep and we have several hours at our disposal you must remember that my reputation is at stake this nights work may undo me my friend you can afford to take the chances havent i agreed to give you half the bonds i shall be suspected and shall be obliged to stand my ground while you will disappear from the scene two thousand dollars will pay you for some inconvenience i dont see why you should be suspected you will be supposed to be fast asleep on your virtuous couch while some bad burglar is robbing your worthy employer of course you will be thunderstruck when in the morning the appalling discovery is made ill tell you what will be a good dodge for you well offer a reward of a hundred dollars from your own purse for the discovery of the villain who has robbed the safe and abstracted the bonds phil stark burst out into a loud guffaw as he uttered these words hush said gibbon timidly i thought i heard some one moving what a timid fool you are muttered stark contemptuously if i had no more pluck id hire myself out to herd cows its a better business said gibbon bitterly well well each to his taste if you lose your place as bookkeeper you might offer your services to some farmer as for me the danger though there isnt much is just enough to make it exciting i dont care for any such excitement said gibbon dispiritedly why couldnt you have kept away and let me earn an honest living because i must live as well as you my dear friend when this little affair is over you will thank me for helping you to a good thing of course all this conversation did not take place within carls hearing while it was going on the men had opened the office door and entered then as carl watched the window closely he saw a narrow gleam of light from a dark lantern illuminating the interior now they are at the safe thought carl we who are privileged will enter the office and watch the proceedings gibbon had no difficulty in opening the safe for he was acquainted with the combination stark thrust in his hand eagerly and drew out the box this is what we want he said in a tone of satisfaction have you a key that will open it no then i shall have to take box and all let us get through as soon as possible said gibbon uneasily you can close the safe if you want to there is nothing else worth taking no then we will evacuate the premises is there an old newspaper i can use to wrap up the box in it might look suspicious if anyone should see it in our possession yes here is one he handed a copy of a weekly paper to phil stark who skillfully wrapped up the box and placing it under his arm went out of the office leaving gibbon to follow where will you carry it asked gibbon somewhere out of sight where i can safely open it i should have preferred to take the bonds and leave the box in the safe then the bonds might not have been missed for a week or more that would have been better that was the last that carl heard the two disappeared in the darkness and carl raising himself from his place of concealment stretched his cramped limbs and made the best of his way home he thought no one would be up but mr jennings came out from the sittingroom where he had flung himself on a lounge and met carl in the hall well he said the safe has been robbed who did it asked the manufacturer quickly the two we suspected did you see mr gibbon then yes he was accompanied by mr stark you saw them enter the factory yes sir i was crouching behind the stone wall on the other side of the road how long were they inside not over fifteen minutes perhaps only ten mr gibbon knew the combination said jennings quietly there was no occasion to lose time in breaking open the safe there is some advantage in having a friend inside did you see them go out yes sir carrying the tin box with them yes sir mr stark wrapped it in a newspaper after they got outside but you saw the tin box yes then if necessary you can testify to it i thought it possible that mr gibbon might have a key to open it i overheard stark regretting that he could not open it so as to abstract the bonds and leave the box in the safe in that case he said it might be some time before the robbery was discovered he will himself make an unpleasant discovery when he opens the box i dont think there is any call to pity him do you carl no sir i should like to be within sight when he opens it the manufacturer laughed quietly yes he said if i could see it i should feel repaid for the loss of the box let it be a lesson for you my boy those who seek to enrich themselves by unlawful means are likely in the end to meet with disappointment do you think i need the lesson asked carl smiling no my lad i am sure you dont but you do need a good nights rest let us go to bed at once and get what sleep we may i wont allow the burglary to keep me awake he laughed in high good humor and carl went up to his comfortable room where he soon lost all remembrance of the exciting scene of which he had been a witness mr jennings went to the factory at the usual time the next morning as he entered the office the bookkeeper approached him pale and excited mr jennings he said hurriedly i have bad news for you what is it mr gibbon when i opened the safe this morning i discovered that the tin box had been stolen mr jennings took the news quietly have you any suspicion who took it he asked no sir i i hope the loss is not a heavy one i do not care to make the extent of the loss public were there any marks of violence was the safe broken open no sir singular is it not if you will allow me i will join in offering a reward for the discovery of the thief i feel in a measure responsible i will think of your offer mr gibbon he suspects nothing thought gibbon with a sigh of relief chapter xxv starks disappointment philip stark went back to the hotel with the tin box under his arm he would like to have entered the hotel without notice but this was impossible for the landlords nephew was just closing up though not late for the city it was very late for the country and he looked surprised when stark came in i am out late said stark with a smile yes that is late for milford in the city i never go to bed before midnight have you been out walking yes you found it rather dark did you not it is dark as a pocket you couldnt have found the walk a very pleasant one you are right my friend but i didnt walk for pleasure the fact is i am rather worried about a business matter i have learned that i am threatened with a heavy loss an unwise investment in the west and i wanted time to think it over and decide how to act i see answered the clerk respectfully for starks words led him to think that his guest was a man of wealth i wish i was rich enough to be worried by such a cause he said jokingly i wish you were some time i may be able to throw something in your way do you think it would pay me to go to the west asked the clerk eagerly i think it quite likely if you know some one out in that section but i dont know anyone you know me said stark significantly do you think you could help me to a place mr stark i think i could a month from now write to me col philip stark at denver colorado and i will see if i can find an opening for you you are very kind mr i mean col stark said the clerk gratefully oh never mind about the title returned stark smiling goodnaturedly i only gave it to you just now because everybody in denver knows me as a colonel and i am afraid a letter otherwise addressed would not reach me by the way i am sorry that i shall probably have to leave you tomorrow so soon yes its this tiresome business i should not wonder if i might lose ten thousand dollars through the folly of my agent i shall probably have to go out to right things i couldnt afford to lose ten thousand dollars said the young man regarding the capitalist before him with deference no i expect not at your age i wasnt worth ten thousand cents now but thats neither here nor there give me a light please and i will go up to bed he was about to say how much he is worth now soliloquized the clerk i wish he had not stopped short if i cant be rich myself i like to talk with a rich man theres hope for me surely he says that at my age he was not worth ten thousand cents that is only a hundred dollars and i am worth that i must keep it to pay my expenses to colorado if he should send for me in a few weeks the young man had noticed with some curiosity the rather oddlyshaped bundle which stark carried under his arm but could not see his way clear to asking any questions about it it seemed queer that stark should have it with him while walking come to think of it he remembered seeing him go out in the early evening and he was quite confident that at that time he had no bundle with him however he was influenced only by a spirit of idle curiosity he had no idea that the bundle was of any importance or value the next day he changed his opinion on that subject phil stark went up to his chamber and setting the lamp on the bureau first carefully locked the door and then removed the paper from the tin box he eyed it lovingly and tried one by one the keys he had in his pocket but none exactly fitted as he was experimenting he thought with a smile of the night clerk from whom he had just parted stark he soliloquized addressing himself you are an old humbug you have cleverly duped that unsophisticated young man downstairs he looks upon you as a man of unbounded wealth evidently while as a matter of fact you are almost strapped let me see how much i have got left he took out his wallet and counted out seven dollars and thirtyeight cents that can hardly be said to constitute wealth he reflected but it is all i have over and above the contents of this box that makes all the difference gibbon is of opinion that there are four thousand dollars in bonds inside and he expects me to give him half shall i do it not such a fool ill give him fifteen hundred and keep the balance myself thatll pay him handsomely and the rest will be a good nestegg for me if gibbon is only half shrewd he will pull the wool over the eyes of that midget of an employer and retain his place and comfortable salary there will be no evidence against him and he can pose as an innocent man bah what a lot of humbug there is in the world well well stark you have your share no doubt otherwise how would you make a living tomorrow i must clear out from milford and give it a wide berth in future i suppose there will be a great hueandcry about the robbery of the safe it will be just as well for me to be somewhere else i have already given the clerk a good reason for my sudden departure confound it its a great nuisance that i cant open this box i would like to know before i go to bed just how much boodle i have acquired then i can decide how much to give gibbon if i dared id keep the whole but he might make trouble phil stark or col philip stark as he had given his name had a large supply of keys but none of them seemed to fit the tin box i am afraid i shall excite suspicion if i sit up any longer thought stark i will go to bed and get up early in the morning then i may succeed better in opening this plaguy box he removed his clothing and got into bed the evening had been rather an exciting one but the excitement was a pleasurable one for he had succeeded in the plan which he and the bookkeeper had so ingeniously formed and carried out and here within reach was the rich reward after which they had striven mr stark was not troubled with a conscience that he had got rid of years ago and he was filled with a comfortable consciousness of having retrieved his fortunes when they were on the wane so in a short time he fell asleep and slept peacefully toward morning however he had a disquieting dream it seemed to him that he awoke suddenly from slumber and saw gibbon leaving the room with the tin box under his arm he awoke really with beads of perspiration upon his brow awoke to see by the sun streaming in at his window that the morning was well advanced and the tin box was still safe thank heaven it was but a dream he murmured i must get up and try once more to open the box the keys had all been tried and had proved not to fit mr stark was equal to the emergency he took from his pocket a button hook and bent it so as to make a pick and after a little experimenting succeeded in turning the lock he lifted the lid eagerly and with distended eyes prepared to gloat upon the stolen bonds but over his face there came a startling change the ashy blue hue of disappointment succeeded the glowing hopeful look he snatched at one of the folded slips of paper and opened it alas it was valueless mere waste paper he sank into a chair in a limp hopeless posture quite overwhelmed then he sprang up suddenly and his expression changed to one of fury and menace if julius gibbon has played this trick upon me he said between his set teeth he shall repent it bitterly chapter xxvi a disagreeable surprise philip stark sat down to breakfast in a savage frame of mind he wanted to be revenged upon gibbon whom he suspected of having deceived him by opening and appropriating the bonds and then arranged to have him carry off the box filled with waste paper he sat at the table but five minutes for he had little or no appetite from the breakfast room he went out on the piazza and with corrugated brows smoked a cigar but it failed to have the usual soothing effect if he had known the truth he would have left milford without delay but he was far from suspecting that the deception practiced upon him had been arranged by the man whom he wanted to rob while there seemed little inducement for him to stay in milford he was determined to seek the bookkeeper and ascertain whether as he suspected his confederate had in his possession the bonds which he had been scheming for if so he would compel him by threats to disgorge the larger portion and then leave town at once but the problem was how to see him he felt that it would be venturesome to go round to the factory as by this time the loss might have been discovered if only the box had been left the discovery might be deferred then a bright idea occurred to him he must get the box out of his own possession as its discovery would compromise him why could he not arrange to leave it somewhere on the premises of his confederate he resolved upon the instant to carry out the idea he went up to his room wrapped the tin box in a paper and walked round to the house of the bookkeeper the coast seemed to be clear as he supposed it would be he slipped into the yard and swiftly entered an outhouse there was a large wooden chest or box which had once been used to store grain stark lifted the cover dropped the box inside and then with a feeling of relief walked out of the yard but he had been observed mrs gibbon chanced to be looking out of a side window and saw him she recognized him as the stranger who had been in the habit of spending recent evenings with her husband what can he want here at this time she asked herself she deliberated whether she should go to the door and speak to stark but decided not to do so he will call at the door if he has anything to say she reflected phil stark walked on till he reached the factory he felt that he must see julius gibbon and satisfy himself as to the meaning of the mysterious substitution of waste paper for bonds when he reached a point where he could see into the office he caught the eye of leonard who was sitting at the window he beckoned for him to come out and leonard was glad to do so where are you going asked the bookkeeper observing the boys movement mr stark is just across the street and he beckoned for me julius gibbon flushed painfully and he trembled with nervous agitation for he feared something had happened very well go out but dont stay long leonard crossed the street and walked up to stark who awaited him looking grim and stern your uncle is inside he asked yes sir tell him i wish to see him at once on business of importance hes busy said leonard he doesnt leave the office in business hours tell him i must see him do you hear hell come fast enough i wonder what its all about thought leonard whose curiosity was naturally excited wait a minute said stark as he turned to go is jennings in no sir he has gone over to the next town probably the box has not been missed then thought stark so much the better i can find out how matters stand and then leave town very well he said aloud let your uncle understand that i must see him leonard carried in the message gibbon made no objection but took his hat and went out leaving leonard in charge of the office well what is it he asked hurriedly as he reached stark is is the box all right look here gibbon said stark harshly have you been playing any of your infernal tricks upon me i dont know what you mean responded gibbon bewildered stark eyed him sharply but the bookkeeper was evidently sincere is there anything wrong continued the latter do you mean to tell me you didnt know that wretched box was filled with waste paper you dont mean it exclaimed gibbon in dismay yes i do i didnt open it till this morning and in place of government bonds i found only folded slips of newspaper by this time gibbon was suspicious having no confidence in stark it occurred to him that it was a ruse to deprive him of his share of the bonds i dont believe you he said you want to keep all the bonds for yourself and cheat me out of my share i wish to heaven you were right if there had been any bonds i would have acted on the square but somebody had removed them and substituted paper i suspected you i am ready to swear that this has happened without my knowledge said gibbon earnestly how then could it have occurred asked stark i dont know upon my honor where is the box i have disposed of it you should have waited and opened it before me i asked you if you had a key that would open it i wanted to open it last evening in the office true you will see after a while that i was acting on the square you can open it for yourself at your leisure how can i i dont know where it is then i can enlighten you said stark maliciously when you go home you will find it in a chest in your woodshed gibbon turned pale you dont mean to say you have carried it to my house he exclaimed in dismay yes i do i had no further use for it and thought you had the best claim to it but good heavens if it is found there i shall be suspected very probably answered stark coolly take my advice and put it out of the way how could you be so inconsiderate because i suspected you of playing me a trick i swear to you i didnt then somebody has tricked both of us has mr jennings discovered the disappearance of the box yes i told him when when he came to the office what did he say he took the matter coolly he didnt say much where is he gone to winchester on business look here do you think he suspects you i am quite sure not that is why i told him about the robbery he might suspect me he said nothing about suspecting anybody do you think he removed the bonds and substituted paper i dont think so if this were the case we should both be in a serious plight i think i had better get out of town you will have to lend me ten dollars i dont see how i can stark you must said stark sternly or i will reveal the whole thing remember the box is on your premises heavens what a quandary i am in said the bookkeeper miserably that must be attended to at once why couldnt you put it anywhere else i told you that i wanted to be revenged upon you i wish you had never come to milford groaned the bookkeeper i wish i hadnt myself as things have turned out they prepared to start for gibbons house when mr jennings drove up with him were two tall muscular men whom stark and gibbon eyed uneasily the two strangers jumped out of the carriage and advanced toward the two confederates arrest those men said jennings in a quiet tone i charge them with opening and robbing my safe last night about eleven oclock chapter xxvii brought to bay phil stark made an effort to get away but the officer was too quick for him in a trice he was handcuffed what is the meaning of this outrage demanded stark boldly i have already explained said the manufacturer quietly you are quite on the wrong tack continued stark brazenly mr gibbon was just informing me that the safe had been opened and robbed it is the first i knew of it julius gibbon seemed quite prostrated by his arrest he felt it necessary to say something and followed the lead of his companion you will bear me witness mr jennings he said that i was the first to inform you of the robbery if i had really committed the burglary i should have taken care to escape during the night i should be glad to believe in your innocence rejoined the manufacturer but i know more about this matter than you suppose i wont answer for mr gibbon said stark who cared nothing for his confederate if he could contrive to effect his own escape of course he had opportunities as bookkeeper which an outsider could not have gibbon eyed his companion in crime distrustfully he saw that stark was intending to throw him over i am entirely willing to have my room at the hotel searched continued stark gathering confidence if you find any traces of the stolen property there you are welcome to make the most of them i have no doubt mr gibbon will make you the same offer in regard to his house gibbon saw at once the trap which had been so craftily prepared for him he knew that any search of his premises would result in the discovery of the tin box and had no doubt that stark would be ready to testify to any falsehood likely to fasten the guilt upon him his anger was roused and he forgot his prudence you scoundrel he hissed between his closed teeth you seem excited sneered stark is it possible that you object to the search if the missing box is found on my premises said gibbon in a white heat it is because you have concealed it there phil stark shrugged his shoulders i think gentlemen he said that settles it i am afraid mr gibbon is guilty i shall be glad to assist you to recover the stolen property did the box contain much that was of value i must caution you both against saying anything that will compromise you said one of the officers i have nothing to conceal went on stark brazenly i am obliged to believe that this man committed the burglary it is against me that i have been his companion for the last week or two but i used to know him and that will account for it the unhappy bookkeeper saw the coils closing around him i hope you will see your way to release me said stark addressing himself to mr jennings i have just received information that my poor mother is lying dangerously sick in cleveland and i am anxious to start for her bedside today why did you come round here this morning asked mr jennings to ask mr gibbon to repay me ten dollars which he borrowed of me the other day returned stark glibly you liar exclaimed gibbon angrily i am prepared for this mans abuse said stark i dont mind admitting now that a few days since he invited me to join him in the robbery of the safe i threatened to inform you of his plan and he promised to give it up i supposed he had done so but it is clear to me now that he carried out his infamous scheme mr jennings looked amused he admired starks brazen effrontery what have you to say to this charge mr gibbon he asked only this sir that i was concerned in the burglary he admits it said stark triumphantly but this man forced me to it he threatened to write you some particulars of my past history which would probably have lost me my position if i did not agree to join him in the conspiracy i was weak and yielded now he is ready to betray me to save himself mr jennings said stark coldly you will know what importance to attach to the story of a selfconfessed burglar gibbon i hope you will see the error of your ways and restore to your worthy employer the box of valuable property which you stole from his safe this is insufferable cried the bookkeeper you are a doubledyed traitor phil stark you were not only my accomplice but you instigated the crime you will find it hard to prove this sneered stark mr jennings i demand my liberty if you have any humanity you will not keep me from the bedside of my dying mother i admire your audacity mr stark observed the manufacturer quietly dont suppose for a moment that i give the least credit to your statements thank you sir said gibbon im ready to accept the consequences of my act but i dont want that scoundrel and traitor to go free you cant prove anything against me said stark doggedly unless you accept the word of a selfconfessed burglar who is angry with me because i would not join him all these protestations it would be better for you to keep till your trial begins mr stark said the manufacturer however i think it only fair to tell you that i am better informed about you and your conspiracy than you imagine will you tell me where you were at eleven oclock last evening i was in my room at the hotel no i was taking a walk i had received news of my mothers illness and i was so much disturbed and grieved that i could not remain indoors you were seen to enter the office of this factory with mr gibbon and after ten minutes came out with the tin box under your arm who saw me demanded stark uneasily carl crawford came forward and answered this question i did he said a likely story you were in bed and asleep you are mistaken i was on watch behind the stone wall just opposite if you want proof i can repeat some of the conversation that passed between you and mr gibbon without waiting for the request carl rehearsed some of the talk already recorded in a previous chapter phil stark began to see that things were getting serious for him but he was game to the last i deny it he said in a loud voice do you also deny it mr gibbon asked mr jennings no sir i admit it replied gibbon with a triumphant glance at his foiled confederate this is a conspiracy against an innocent man said stark scowling you want to screen your bookkeeper if possible no one has ever before charged me with crime then how does it happen mr stark that you were confined at the joliet penitentiary for a term of years did he tell you this snarled stark pointing to gibbon no who then a customer of mine from chicago he saw you at the hotel and informed carl last evening of your character carl of course brought the news to me it was in consequence of this information that i myself removed the bonds from the box early in the evening and substituted strips of paper your enterprise therefore would have availed you little even if you had succeeded in getting off scotfree i see the game is up said stark throwing off the mask its true that i have been in the joliet penitentiary it was there that i became acquainted with your bookkeeper he added maliciously let him deny it if he dare i shall not deny it it is true said gibbon but i had resolved to live an honest life in future and would have done so if this man had not pressed me into crime by his threats i believe you mr gibbon said the manufacturer gently and i will see that this is counted in your favor and now gentlemen i think there is no occasion for further delay the two men were carried to the lockup and in due time were tried stark was sentenced to ten years imprisonment gibbon to five at the end of two years at the intercession of mr jennings he was pardoned and furnished with money enough to go to australia where his past character unknown he was able to make an honest living and gain a creditable position chapter xxviii after a year twelve months passed without any special incident with carl it was a period of steady and intelligent labor and progress he had excellent mechanical talent and made remarkable advancement he was not content with attention to his own work but was a careful observer of the work of others so that in one year he learned as much of the business as most boys would have done in three when the year was up mr jennings detained him after supper do you remember what anniversary this is carl he asked pleasantly yes sir it is the anniversary of my going into the factory exactly how are you satisfied with the year and its work i have been contented and happy mr jennings and i feel that i owe my happiness and content to you mr jennings looked pleased i am glad you say so he said but it is only fair to add that your own industry and intelligence have much to do with the satisfactory results of the year thank you sir the superintendent tells me that outside of your own work you have a general knowledge of the business which would make you a valuable assistant to himself in case he needed one carls face glowed with pleasure i believe in being thorough he said and i am interested in every department of the business before you went into the factory you had not done any work no sir i had attended school it was not a bad preparation for business but in some cases it gives a boy disinclination for manual labor yes i wouldnt care to work with my hands all my life i dont blame you for that you have qualified yourself for something better how much do i pay you i began on two dollars a week and my board at the end of six months you kindly advanced me to four dollars i dare say you have found it none too much for your wants carl smiled i have saved forty dollars out of it he answered mr jennings looked pleased you have done admirably he said warmly forty dollars is not a large sum but in laying it by you have formed a habit that will be of great service to you in after years i propose to raise you to ten dollars a week but sir shall i earn so much you are very kind but i am afraid you will be a loser by your liberality mr jennings smiled you are partly right he said your services at present are hardly worth the sum i have agreed to pay that is in the factory but i shall probably impose upon you other duties of an important nature soon if you do sir i will endeavor to meet your expectations how would you like to take a journey carl very much sir i think of sending you to chicago carl who had thought perhaps of a fiftymile trip looked amazed but his delight was equal to his surprise he had always wished to see the west though chicago can hardly be called a western city now since between it and the pacific there is a broad belt of land two thousand miles in extent do you think i am competent he asked modestly i cannot say positively but i think so answered mr jennings then i shall be delighted to go will it be very soon yes very soon i shall want you to start next monday i will be ready sir and i may as well explain what are to be your duties i am as you know manufacturing a special line of chairs which i am desirous of introducing to the trade i shall give you the names of men in my line in albany buffalo cleveland and chicago and it will be your duty to call upon them explain the merits of the chair and solicit orders in other words you will be a traveling salesman or drummer i shall pay your traveling expenses ten dollars a week and if your orders exceed a certain limit i shall give you a commission on the surplus suppose i dont reach that limit i shall at all events feel that you have done your best i will instruct you a little in your duties between now and the time of your departure i should myself like to go in your stead but i am needed here there are of course others in my employ older than yourself whom i might send but i have an idea that you will prove to be a good salesman i will try to be sir on monday morning carl left milford reached new york in two hours and a half and in accordance with the directions of mr jennings engaged passage and a stateroom on one of the palatial night lines of hudson river steamers to albany the boat was well filled with passengers and a few persons were unable to procure staterooms carl however applied in time and obtained an excellent room he deposited his gripsack therein and then took a seat on deck meaning to enjoy as long as possible the delightful scenery for which the hudson is celebrated it was his first long journey and for this reason carl enjoyed it all the more he could not but contrast his present position and prospects with those of a year ago when helpless and penniless he left an unhappy home to make his own way what a delightful evening said a voice at his side turning carl saw sitting by him a young man of about thirty dressed in somewhat pretentious style and wearing eyeglasses he was tall and thin and had sandy side whiskers yes it is a beautiful evening replied carl politely and the scenery is quite charming have you ever been all the way up the river no but i hope some day to take a day trip just so i am not sure but i prefer the rhine with its romantic castles and vineclad hills have you visited europe then asked carl oh yes several times i have a passion for traveling our family is wealthy and i have been able to go where i pleased that must be very pleasant it is my name is stuyvesant one of the old dutch families carl was not so much impressed perhaps as he should have been by this announcement for he knew very little of fashionable life in new york you dont look like a dutchman he said smiling i suppose you expected a figure like a beer keg rejoined stuyvesant laughing some of my forefathers may have answered that description but i am not built that way are you traveling far i may go as far as chicago is anyone with you no perhaps you have friends in chicago not that i am aware of i am traveling on business indeed you are rather young for a business man i am sixteen well that cannot exactly be called venerable no i suppose not by the way did you succeed in getting a stateroom yes i have a very good one youre in luck on my word i was just too late the man ahead of me took the last room you can get a berth i suppose but that is so common really i should not know how to travel without a stateroom have you anyone with you no if you will take me in i will pay the entire expense carl hesitated he preferred to be alone but he was of an obliging disposition and he knew that there were two berths in the stateroom if it will be an accommodation he said i will let you occupy the room with me mr stuyvesant will you indeed i shall esteem it a very great favor where is your room i will show you carl led the way to no followed by his new acquaintance mr stuyvesant seemed very much pleased and insisted on paying for the room at once carl accepted half the regular charges and so the bargain was made at ten oclock the two travelers retired to bed carl was tired and went to sleep at once he slept through the night when he awoke in the morning the boat was in dock he heard voices in the cabin and the noise of the transfer of baggage and freight to the wharf i have overslept myself he said and jumped up hurriedly he looked into the upper berth but his roommate was gone something else was gone too his valise and a wallet which he had carried in the pocket of his trousers chapter xxix the lost bank book carl was not long in concluding that he had been robbed by his roommate it was hard to believe that a stuyvesant a representative of one of the old dutch families of new amsterdam should have stooped to such a discreditable act carl was sharp enough however to doubt the genuineness of mr stuyvesants claims to aristocratic lineage meanwhile he blamed himself for being so easily duped by an artful adventurer to be sure it was not as bad as it might be his pocketbook only contained ten dollars in small bills the balance of his money he had deposited for safe keeping in the inside pocket of his vest this he had placed under his pillow and so it had escaped the notice of the thief the satchel contained a supply of shirts underclothing etc and he was sorry to lose it the articles were not expensive but it would cost him from a dozen to fifteen dollars to replace them carl stepped to the door of his stateroom and called a servant who was standing near how long have we been at the pier he asked about twenty minutes sir did you see my roommate go out a tall young man in a light overcoat yes yes sir i saw him did you notice whether he carried a valise in his hand a gripsack yes sir a small one yes sir it was mine you dont say so sir and such a respectablelookin gemman sir he may have looked respectable but he was a thief all the same you dont say did he take anything else sir he took my pocketbook well well he was a rascal sure but maybe it dropped on the floor carl turned his attention to the carpet but saw nothing of the lost pocketbook he did find however a small book in a brown cover which stuyvesant had probably dropped picking it up he discovered that it was a bank book on the sixpenny savings bank of albany standing in the name of rachel norris and numbered this is stolen property too thought carl i wonder if there is much in it opening the book he saw that there were three entries as follows jan five hundred dollars june two hundred dollars oct one hundred dollars there was besides this interest credited to the amount of seventyfive dollars the deposits therefore made a grand total of no doubt mr stuyvesant had stolen this book but had not as yet found an opportunity of utilizing it whats dat asked the colored servant a savings bank book my roommate must have dropped it it appears to belong to a lady named rachel norris i wish i could get it to her is she an albany lady sir i dont know you might look in the directory so i will it is a good idea i hope the gemman didnt take all your money sir no he didnt even take half of it i only wish i had been awake when the boat got to the dock i would have called you sir if you had asked me i am not much used to traveling i shall know better next time what to do the finding of the bank book partially consoled carl for the loss of his pocketbook and gripsack he was glad to be able to defeat stuyvesant in one of his nefarious schemes and to be the instrument of returning miss norris her savings bank book when he left the boat he walked along till he reached a modestlooking hotel where he thought the charges would be reasonable he entered and going to the desk asked if he could have a room large or small inquired the clerk small no will you go up now yes sir any baggage no i had it stolen on the boat the clerk looked a little suspicious we must require pay in advance then he said certainly answered carl pulling out a roll of bills i suppose you make special terms to commercial travelers are you a drummer yes i represent henry jennings of milford new york all right sir our usual rates are two dollars a day to you they will be a dollar and a quarter very well i will pay you for two days is breakfast ready it is on the table sir then i will go in at once i will go to my room afterwards in spite of his loss carl had a hearty appetite and did justice to the comfortable breakfast provided he bought a morning paper and ran his eye over the advertising columns he had never before read an albany paper and wished to get an idea of the city in its business aspect it occurred to him that there might be an advertisement of the lost bank book but no such notice met his eyes he went up to his room which was small and plainly furnished but looked comfortable going down again to the office he looked into the albany directory to see if he could find the name of rachel norris there was a rebecca norris who was put down as a dressmaker but that was as near as he came to rachel norris then he set himself to looking over the other members of the norris family finally he picked out norris wade furnishing goods and decided to call at the store and inquire if they knew any lady named rachel norris the prospect of gaining information in this way did not seem very promising but no other course presented itself and carl determined to follow up the clew slight as it was though unacquainted with albany streets he had little difficulty in finding the store of norris wade it was an establishment of good size well supplied with attractive goods a clerk came forward to wait upon carl what can i show you he asked you may show me mr norris if you please responded carl with a smile he is in the office said the clerk with an answering smile carl entered the office and saw mr norris a man of middle age partially bald with a genial businesslike manner well young man he said looking at carl inquiringly you must excuse me for troubling you sir said carl who was afraid mr norris would laugh at him but i thought you might direct me to rachel norris mr norris looked surprised what do you want of rachel norris he asked abruptly i have a little business with her answered carl of what nature excuse me but i dont care to mention it at present humph you are very cautious for a young man or rather boy isnt that a good trait sir good but unusual are you a schoolboy no sir i am a drummer mr norris put on a pair of glasses and scrutinized carl more closely i should like to see just out of curiosity the man that you travel for he said i will ask him to call whenever he visits albany there is his card mr norris took it why bless my soul he exclaimed it is henry jennings an old schoolmate of mine and a good business man even if he has sent out such a young drummer i should say so there must be something in you or he wouldnt have trusted you how is jennings he is well sir well and prosperous that is good news are you in his employ yes sir this is the first time i have traveled for him how far are you going as far as chicago i dont see what you can have to do with rachel norris however i dont mind telling you that she is my aunt and well upon my soul here she is now and he ran hastily to greet a tall thin lady wearing a black shawl who at that moment entered the office chapter xxx an eccentric woman miss norris dropped into a chair as if she were fatigued well aunt rachel how are you feeling this morning asked her nephew out of sorts was the laconic reply i am very sorry for that i suppose there is reason for it yes ive been robbed indeed said mr norris lost your purse i wonder more ladies are not robbed carrying their money as carelessly as they do that isnt it i am always careful as careful as any man still you got robbed yes but of a bank book here carl became attentive it was clear that he would not have to look any farther for the owner of the book he had found in his stateroom what kind of a bank book inquired mr norris i had nearly a thousand dollars deposited in the sixpenny savings bank i called at the bank to make some inquiries about interest and when i came out i presume some rascal followed me and stole the book have you any idea who took it i got into the horse cars near the bank next to me sat a young man in a light overcoat there was no one on the other side of me i think he must have taken it that was stuyvesant said carl to himself when did this happen aunt rachel three days since why didnt you do something about it before i did i advertised a reward of twentyfive dollars to anyone who would restore it to me there was no occasion for that by giving notice at the bank they would give you a new book after a time i preferred to recover the old one besides i thought i would like to know what became of it i can tell you miss norris said carl who thought it time to speak hitherto miss norris had not seemed aware of carls presence she turned abruptly and surveyed him through her glasses who are you she asked this might seem rude but it was only miss rachels way my name is carl crawford do i know you no miss norris but i hope you will humph that depends you say you know what became of my bank book yes miss norris well it was taken by the young man who sat next to you how do you know he robbed me last night on the way from new york in a hudson river steamboat that doesnt prove that he robbed me i was robbed here in this city what do you say to this asked carl displaying the bank book bless me that is my book where did you get it carl told his story briefly how on discovering that he had been robbed he explored the stateroom and found the bank book well well i am astonished and how did you know mr norris was my nephew i didnt know i didnt know anything about him or you but finding his name in the directory i came here to ask if he knew any such person you are a smart boy and a good honest one said miss norris you have earned the reward and shall have it i dont want any reward miss norris rejoined carl i have had very little trouble in finding you that is of no consequence i offered the reward and rachel norris is a woman of her word she thrust her hand into her pocket and drew out a wallet more suitable to a mans use openings this she took out three bills two tens and a five and extended them toward carl i dont think i ought to take this money miss norris said carl reluctantly did that rascal rob you too yes of how much ten dollars in money and some underclothing very well this money will go toward making up your loss you are not rich i take it not yet i am and can afford to give you this money there take it thank you miss norris i want to ask one favor of you if you ever come across that young man in the light overcoat have him arrested and let me know i will miss norris do you live in albany carl explained that he was traveling on business and should leave the next day if he could get through how far are you going to chicago can you attend to some business for me there yes if it wont take too long a time good come round to my house to supper at six oclock and i will tell you about it henry write my address on a piece of paper and give it to this young man henry norris smiled and did as his aunt requested you have considerable confidence in this young man he said i have you may be mistaken rachel norris is not often mistaken i will accept your invitation with pleasure miss norris said carl bowing politely now as i have some business to attend to i will bid you both goodmorning as carl went out miss norris said henry that is a remarkable boy i think favorably of him myself he is in the employ of an old schoolmate of mine henry jennings of milford by the way what business are you going to put into his hands a young man who has a shoe store on state street has asked me for a loan of two thousand dollars to extend his business his name is john french and his mother was an old schoolmate of mine though some years younger now i know nothing of him if he is a sober steady industrious young man i may comply with his request this boy will investigate and report to me and you will be guided by his report probably aunt rachel you are certainly very eccentric i may be but i am not often deceived well i hope you wont be this time the boy seems to me a very good boy but you cant put an old head on young shoulders some boys have more sense than men twice their age you dont mean me i hope aunt rachel said mr norris smiling indeed i dont i shall not flatter you by speaking of you as only twice this boys age i see aunt rachel there is no getting the better of you meanwhile carl was making business calls he obtained a map of the city and located the different firms on which he proposed to call he had been furnished with a list by mr jennings he was everywhere pleasantly received in some places with an expression of surprise at his youth but when he began to talk he proved to be so well informed upon the subject of his call that any prejudice excited by his age quickly vanished he had the satisfaction of securing several unexpectedly large orders for the chair and transmitting them to mr jennings by the afternoon mail he got through his business at four oclock and rested for an hour or more at his hotel then he arranged his toilet and set out for the residence of miss rachel norris it was rather a primlooking threestory house such as might be supposed to belong to a maiden lady he was ushered into a sittingroom on the second floor where miss norris soon joined him i am glad to see you my young friend she said cordially you are in time i always try to be miss norris it is a good way to begin here a bell rang supper is ready she said follow me downstairs carl followed the old lady to the rear room on the lower floor a small table was set in the center of the apartment take a seat opposite me said miss norris there were two other chairs one on each side carl wondered for whom they were set no sooner were he and miss norris seated than two large cats approached the table and jumped up one into each chair carl looked to see them ordered away but instead miss norris nodded pleasantly saying thats right jane and molly you are punctual at meals the two cats eyed their mistress gravely and began to purr contentedly chapter xxxi carl takes supper with miss norris this is my family said miss norris pointing to the cats i like cats said carl do you returned miss norris looking pleased most boys tease them do you see poor mollys ear that wound came from a stone thrown by a bad boy many boys are cruel said carl but i remember that my mother was very fond of cats and i have always protected them from abuse as he spoke he stroked molly who purred an acknowledgment of his attention this completed the conquest of miss norris who inwardly decided that carl was the finest boy she had ever met after she had served carl from the dishes on the table she poured out two saucers of milk and set one before each cat who rising upon her hind legs placed her forepaws on the table and gravely partook of the refreshments provided jane and molly were afterwards regaled with cold meat and then stretching themselves out on their chairs closed their eyes in placid content during the meal miss norris questioned carl closely as to his home experiences having no reason for concealment carl frankly related his troubles with his stepmother eliciting expressions of sympathy and approval from his hostess your stepmother must be an ugly creature she said i am afraid i am prejudiced against her said carl but that is my opinion your father must be very weak to be influenced against his own son by such a woman carl winced a little at this outspoken criticism for he was attached to his father in spite of his unjust treatment my father is an invalid he said apologetically and i think he yielded for the sake of peace all the same he ought not to do it said miss norris do you ever expect to live at home again not while my stepmother is there answered carl but i dont know that i should care to do so under any circumstances as i am now receiving a business training i should like to make a little visit home he added thoughtfully and perhaps i may do so after i return from chicago i shall have no favors to ask and shall feel independent if you ever need a home said miss norris abruptly come here you will be welcome thank you very much said carl gratefully it is all the more kind in you since you have known me so short a time i have known you long enough to judge of you said the maiden lady and now if you wont have anything more we will go into the next room and talk business carl followed her into the adjoining room and miss norris at once plunged into the subject she handed him a business card bearing this inscription john french boots shoes and rubber goods a state street chicago this young man wants me to lend him two thousand dollars to extend his business she said he is the son of an old school friend and i am willing to oblige him if he is a sober steady and economical business man i want you to find out whether this is the case and report to me wont that be difficult asked carl are you afraid to undertake anything that is difficult no answered carl with a smile i was only afraid i might not do the work satisfactorily i shall give you no instructions said miss norris i shall trust to your good judgment i will give you a letter to mr french which you can use or not as you think wise of course i shall see that you are paid for your trouble thank you said carl i hope my services may be worth compensation i dont know how you are situated as to money but i can give you some in advance and the old lady opened her pocketbook no thank you miss norris i shall not need it i might have been short if you had not kindly paid me a reward for a slight service slight indeed if you had lost a bank book like mine you would be glad to get it back at such a price if you will catch the rascal who stole it i will gladly pay you as much more i wish i might for my own sake but i am afraid it would be too late to recover my money and clothing at an early hour carl left the house promising to write to miss norris from chicago chapter xxxii a startling discovery well thought carl as he left the house where he had been so hospitably entertained i shall not lack for business miss norris seems to have a great deal of confidence in me considering that i am a stranger i will take care that she does not repent it can you give a poor man enough money to buy a cheap meal asked a plaintive voice carl scanned the applicant for charity closely he was a man of medium size with a pair of small eyes and a turnup nose his dress was extremely shabby and he had the appearance of one who was on bad terms with fortune there was nothing striking about his appearance yet carl regarded him with surprise and wonder despite the difference in age he bore a remarkable resemblance to his stepbrother peter cook i havent eaten anything for twentyfour hours continued the tramp as he may properly be called its a hard world to such as me boy i should judge so from your looks answered carl indeed you are right i was born to ill luck carl had some doubts about this those who represent themselves as born to ill luck can usually trace the ill luck to errors or shortcomings of their own there are doubtless inequalities of fortune but not as great as many like to represent of two boys who start alike one may succeed and the other fail but in nine cases out of ten the success or failure may be traced to a difference in the qualities of the boys here is a quarter if that will do you any good said carl the man clutched at it with avidity thank you this will buy me a cup of coffee and a plate of meat and will put new life into me he was about to hurry away but carl felt like questioning him further the extraordinary resemblance between this man and his stepbrother led him to think it possible that there might be a relationship between them of his stepmothers family he knew little or nothing his father had married her on short acquaintance and she was very reticent about her former life his father was indolent and had not troubled himself to make inquiries he took her on her own representation as the widow of a merchant who had failed in business on the impulse of the moment an impulse which he could not explain carl asked abruptly is your name cook a look of surprise almost of stupefaction appeared on the mans face who told you my name he asked then your name is cook what is your object in asking said the man suspiciously i mean you no harm returned carl but i have reasons for asking did you ever see me before asked the man no then what makes you think my name is cook it is not written on my face is it no then how carl interrupted him i know a boy named peter cook he said who resembles you very strongly you know peter cook little peter exclaimed the tramp yes is he a relation of yours i should think so responded cook emphatically he is my own son that is if he is a boy of about your age yes where is he is his mother alive your wife exclaimed carl overwhelmed at the thought she was my wife said cook but while i was in california some years since she took possession of my small property procured a divorce through an unprincipled lawyer and i returned to find myself without wife child or money wasnt that a mean trick i think it was can you tell me where she is asked cook eagerly yes i can where can i find my wife asked cook with much eagerness carl hesitated he did not like his stepmother he felt that she had treated him meanly but he was not prepared to reveal her present residence till he knew what course cook intended to pursue she is married again he said watching cook to see what effect this announcement might have upon him i have no objection i am sure responded cook indifferently did she marry well she married a man in good circumstances she would take good care of that then you dont intend to reclaim her how can i she obtained a divorce though by false representations i am glad to be rid of her but i want her to restore the two thousand dollars of which she robbed me i left my property in her hands but when she ceased to be my wife she had no right to take possession of it i ought not to be surprised however it wasnt the first theft she had committed can this be true asked carl excited yes i married her without knowing much of her antecedents two years after marriage i ascertained that she had served a years term of imprisonment for a theft of jewelry from a lady with whom she was living as housekeeper are you sure of this certainly she was recognized by a friend of mine who had been an official at the prison when taxed with it by me she admitted it but claimed that she was innocent i succeeded in finding a narrative of the trial in an old file of papers and came to the conclusion that she was justly convicted what did you do i proposed separation but she begged me to keep the thing secret and let ourselves remain the same as before i agreed out of consideration for her but had occasion to regret it my business becoming slack i decided to go to california in the hope of acquiring a competence i was not fortunate there and was barely able after a year to get home i found that my wife had procured a divorce and appropriated the little money i had left where she had gone or where she had conveyed our son i could not learn you say you know where she is i do will you tell me mr cook said carl after a pause for reflection i will tell you but not just at present i am on my way to chicago on business on my return i will stop here and take you with me to the present home of your former wife you will understand my interest in the matter when i tell you that she is now married to a relative of my own i pity him whoever he is said cook yes i think he is to be pitied said carl gravely but the revelation you will be able to make will enable him to insist upon a separation the best thing he can do how long before you return to albany a week or ten days i dont know how i am to live in the meantime said cook anxiously i am penniless but for the money you have just given me at what price can you obtain board i know of a decent house where i can obtain board and a small room for five dollars a week here are twelve dollars this will pay for two weeks board and give you a small sum besides what is the address cook mentioned a number on a street by the river carl took it down in a notebook with which he had provided himself when i return to albany he said i will call there at once you wont forget me no i shall be even more anxious to meet you than you will be to meet me the one to whom your former wife is married is very near and dear to me and i cannot bear to think that he has been so wronged and imposed upon very well sir i shall wait for you with confidence if i can get back from my former wife the money she robbed me of i can get on my feet again and take a respectable position in society it is very hard for a man dressed as i am to obtain any employment looking at his shabby and ragged suit carl could readily believe this statement if he had wished to employ anyone he would hardly have been tempted to engage a man so discreditable in appearance be of good courage mr cook he said kindly if your story is correct and i believe it is there are better days in store for you thank you for those words said cook earnestly they give me new hope chapter xxxiii from albany to niagara carl took the afternoon train on the following day for buffalo his thoughts were busy with the startling discovery he had made in regard to his stepmother though he had never liked her he had been far from imagining that she was under the ban of the law it made him angry to think that his father had been drawn into a marriage with such a woman that the place of his idolized mother had been taken by one who had served a term at sing sing did peter know of his mothers past disgrace he asked himself probably not for it had come before his birth he only wondered that the secret had never got out before there must be many persons who had known her as a prisoner and could identify her now she had certainly been fortunate with the fear of discovery always haunting her carl could not understand how she could carry her head so high and attempt to tyrannize over his father and himself what the result would be when dr crawford learned the antecedents of the woman whom he called wife carl did not for a moment doubt his father was a man of very strict ideas on the subject of honor and good repute and the discovery would lead him to turn from mrs crawford in abhorrence moreover he was strongly opposed to divorce and carl had heard him argue that a divorced person should not be permitted to remarry yet in ignorance he had married a divorced woman who had been convicted of theft and served a term of imprisonment the discovery would be a great shock to him and it would lead to a separation and restore the cordial relations between himself and his son not long after his settlement in milford carl had written as follows to his father dear father though i felt obliged to leave home for reasons which we both understand i am sure that you will feel interested to know how i am getting along i did not realize till i had started out how difficult it is for a boy brought up like myself to support himself when thrown upon his own exertions a newsboy can generally earn enough money to maintain himself in the style to which he is accustomed but i have had a comfortable and even luxurious home and could hardly bring myself to live in a tenement house or a very cheap boarding place yet i would rather do either than stay in a home made unpleasant by the persistent hostility of one member i will not take up your time by relating the incidents of the first two days after i left home i came near getting into serious trouble through no fault of my own but happily escaped when i was nearly penniless i fell in with a prosperous manufacturer of furniture who has taken me into his employment he gives me a home in his own house and pays me two dollars a week besides this is enough to support me economically and i shall after a while receive better pay i am not in the office but in the factory and am learning the business practically starting in at the bottom i think i have a taste for it and the superintendent tells me i am making remarkable progress the time was when i would have hesitated to become a working boy but i have quite got over such foolishness mr jennings my employer who is considered a rich man began as i did and i hope some day to occupy a position similar to his i trust you are quite well and happy dear father my only regret is that i cannot see you occasionally while my stepmother and peter form part of your family i feel that i can never live at home they both dislike me and i am afraid i return the feeling if you are sick or need me do not fail to send for me for i can never forget that you are my father as i am your affectionate son carl this letter was handed to dr crawford at the breakfast table he colored and looked agitated when he opened the envelope and mrs crawford who had a large share of curiosity did not fail to notice this from whom is your letter my dear she asked in the soft tone which was habitual with her when she addressed her husband the handwriting is carls answered dr crawford already devouring the letter eagerly oh she answered in a chilly tone i have been expecting you would hear from him how much money does he send for i have not finished the letter dr crawford continued reading when he had finished he laid it down beside his plate well said his wife interrogatively what does he have to say does he ask leave to come home no he is quite content where he is and where is that at milford that is not far away no not more than sixty miles does he ask for money no he is employed where in a furniture factory oh a factory boy yes he is learning the business he doesnt seem to be very ambitious sneered mrs crawford on the contrary he is looking forward to being in business for himself some day on your money i understand really mrs crawford you do the boy injustice he hints nothing of the kind he evidently means to raise himself gradually as his employer did before him by the way he has a home in his employers family i think mr jennings must have taken a fancy to carl i hope he will find him more agreeable than i did said mrs crawford sharply are you quite sure that you always treated carl considerately my dear i didnt flatter or fondle him if that is what you mean i treated him as well as he could expect did you treat him as well as peter for example no there is a great difference between the two boys peter is always respectful and obliging and doesnt set up his will against mine he never gives me a moments uneasiness i hope you will continue to find him a comfort my dear said dr crawford meekly he looked across the table at the fat expressionless face of his stepson and he blamed himself because he could not entertain a warmer regard for peter somehow he had a slight feeling of antipathy which he tried to overcome no doubt he is a good boy since his mother says so reflected the doctor but i dont appreciate him i will take care however that neither he nor his mother sees this when peter heard his mothers encomium upon him he laughed in his sleeve ill remind ma of that when she scolds me he said to himself im glad carl isnt coming back he was always interferin with me now if ma and i play our cards right well get all his fathers money ma thinks he wont live long i heard her say so the other day wont it be jolly for ma and me to come into a fortune and live just as we please i hope ma will go to new york its stupid here but i spose well have to stay for the present is carls letter private asked mrs crawford after a pause i i think he would rather i didnt show it returned her husband remembering the allusion made by carl to his stepmother oh well i am not curious said mrs crawford tossing her head none the less however she resolved to see and read the letter if she could get hold of it without her husbands knowledge he was so careless that she did not doubt soon to find it laid down somewhere in this she proved correct before the day was over she found carls letter in her husbands desk she opened and read it eagerly with a running fire of comment reasons which we both understand she repeated scornfully that is a covert attack upon me of course i ought to expect that so he had a hard time well it served him right for conducting himself as he did ah here is another hit at me yet i would rather do either than live in a home made unpleasant by the persistent hostility of one member he is trying to set his father against me well he wont succeed i can twist dr paul crawford round my finger luckily and neither his son nor anyone else can diminish my influence over him she read on for some time till she reached this passage while my stepmother and peter form a part of your family i can never live at home they both dislike me and i am afraid i return the feeling thanks for the information she muttered i knew it before this letter doesnt make me feel any more friendly to you carl crawford i see that you are trying to ingratiate yourself with your father and prejudice him against me and my poor peter but i think i can defeat your kind intentions she folded up the letter and replaced it in her husbands desk i wonder if my husband will answer carls artful epistle she said to herself he can if he pleases he is weak as water and i will see that he goes no farther than words dr crawford did answer carls letter this is his reply dear carl i am glad to hear that you are comfortably situated i regret that you were so headstrong and unreasonable it seems to me that you might with a little effort have got on with your stepmother you could hardly expect her to treat you in the same way as her own son he seems to be a good boy but i own that i have never been able to become attached to him carl read this part of the letter with satisfaction he knew how mean and contemptible peter was and it would have gone to his heart to think that his father had transferred his affection to the boy he had so much reason to dislike i am glad you are pleased with your prospects i think i could have done better for you had your relations with your stepmother been such as to make it pleasant for you to remain at home you are right in thinking that i am interested in your welfare i hope my dear carl you will become a happy and prosperous man i do not forget that you are my son and i am still your affectionate father paul crawford carl was glad to receive this letter it showed him that his stepmother had not yet succeeded in alienating from him his fathers affection but we must return to the point where we left carl on his journey to buffalo he enjoyed his trip over the central road during the hours of daylight he determined on his return to make an allday trip so that he might enjoy the scenery through which he now rode in the darkness at buffalo he had no other business except that of mr jennings and immediately after breakfast he began to make a tour of the furniture establishments he met with excellent success and had the satisfaction of sending home some large orders in the evening he took train for niagara wishing to see the falls in the early morning and resume his journey in the afternoon he registered at the international hotel on the american side it was too late to do more than take an evening walk and see the falls gleaming like silver through the darkness i will go to bed early thought carl and get up at six oclock he did go to bed early but he was more fatigued than he supposed and slept longer than he anticipated it was eight oclock before he came downstairs before going in to breakfast he took a turn on the piazzas here he fell in with a sociable gentleman much addicted to gossip goodmorning he said have you seen the falls yet i caught a glimpse of them last evening i am going to visit them after breakfast there are a good many people staying here just now some quite noted persons too indeed yes what do you say to an english lord and carls new friend nodded with am important air as if it reflected great credit on the hotel to have so important a guest does he look different from anyone else asked carl smiling well to tell the truth he isnt much to look at said the other the gentleman who is with him looks more stylish i thought he was the lord at first but i afterwards learned that he was an american named stuyvesant carl started at the familiar name is he tall and slender with side whiskers and does he wear eyeglasses he asked eagerly yes you know him then said the other in surprise yes answered carl with a smile i am slightly acquainted with him i am very anxious to meet him again chapter xxxiv carl makes the acquaintance of an english lord there they are now said the stranger suddenly pointing out two persons walking slowly along the piazza the small man in the rough suit and muttonchop whiskers is lord bedford carl eyed the british nobleman with some curiosity evidently lord bedford was no dude his suit was of rough cloth and illfitting he was barely five feet six inches in height with features decidedly plain but with an absence of pretension that was creditable to him considering that he was really what he purported to be stuyvesant walked by his side nearly a head taller and of more distinguished bearing though of plebeian extraction his manner was exceedingly deferential and he was praising england and everything english in a fulsome manner yes my lord carl overheard him say i have often thought that society in england is far superior to our american society thanks you are very kind drawled the nobleman but really i find things very decent in america upon my word i had been reading dickenss notes before i came over and i expected to find you very uncivilized and almost aboriginal but i assure you i have met some very gentlemanly persons in america some almost up to our english standard really my lord such a tribute from a man in your position is most gratifying may i state this on your authority yes i dont mind but i would rather not get into the papers dont you know you are not a reporter i hope i hope not said mr stuyvesant in a lofty tone i am a scion of one of the oldest families in new york of course i know that social position is a very different thing here from what it is in england it must be a gratifying thing to reflect that you are a lord yes i suppose so i never thought much about it i should like so much to be a lord i care little for money then by jove you are a remarkable man in comparison with rank i mean i would rather be a lord with a thousand pounds a year than a rich merchant with ten times as much youll find it very inconvenient being a lord on a thousand you might as well be a beggar i suppose of course high rank requires a large rent roll in fact a new york gentleman requires more than a trifle to support him i cant dress on less than two hundred pounds a year your american tailors are highpriced then those that i employ we have cheap tailors of course but i generally go to bell mr stuyvesant was posing as a gentleman of fashion carl who followed at a little distance behind the pair was much amused by his remarks knowing what he did about him i think a little of going to england in a few months continued stuyvesant indeed you must look me up said bedford carelessly i should indeed be delighted said stuyvesant effusively that is if i am in england i may be on the continent but you can inquire for me at my club the piccadilly i shall esteem it a great honor my lord i have a penchant for good society the lower orders are not attractive to me they are sometimes more interesting said the englishman but do you know i am surprised to hear an american speak in this way i thought you were all on a level here in a republic oh my lord expostulated stuyvesant deprecatingly you dont think i would associate with shopkeepers and common tradesmen i dont know a cousin of mine is interested in a wine business in london he is a younger son with a small fortune and draws a very tidy income from his city business but his name doesnt appear on the sign i infer no i think not then you are not in business mr stuyvesant no i inherited an income from my father it isnt as large as i could wish and i have abstained from marrying because i could not maintain the mode of living to which i have been accustomed you should marry a rich girl true i may do so since your lordship recommends it in fact i have in view a young lady whose father was once lord mayor i beg pardon mayor of new york her father is worth a million pounds well no dollars i should have said two hundred thousand pounds if the girl is willing it may be a good plan thank you my lord your advice is very kind the young man seems on very good terms with lord bedford said carls companion whose name was atwood with a shade of envy in his voice yes said carl i wish he would introduce me went on mr atwood i should prefer the introduction of a different man said carl why he seems to move in good society without belonging to it then you know him better than i wish i did atwood looked curious i will explain later said carl now i must go in to breakfast i will go with you though stuyvesant had glanced at carl he did not appear to recognize him partly no doubt because he had no expectation of meeting the boy he had robbed at niagara besides his time and attention were so much taken up by his aristocratic acquaintance that he had little notice for anyone else carl observed with mingled amusement and vexation that mr stuyvesant wore a new necktie which he had bought for himself in new york and which had been in the stolen gripsack if i can find lord bedford alone i will put him on his guard thought carl i shall spoil mr stuyvesants plans after breakfast carl prepared to go down to the falls on the way he overtook lord bedford walking in the same direction and as it happened without a companion carl quickened his pace and as he caught up with him he raised his hat and said lord bedford i believe yes answered the englishman inquiringly i must apologize for addressing a stranger but i want to put you on your guard against a young man whom i saw walking with you on the piazza is he what do you know of him asked lord bedford laying aside his air of indifference i know that he is an adventurer and a thief i made his acquaintance on a hudson river steamer and he walked off with my valise and a small sum of money is this true asked the englishman in amazement quite true he is wearing one of my neckties at this moment the confounded cad ejaculated the englishman angrily i suppose he intended to rob me i have no doubt of it that is why i ventured to put you on your guard i am a thousand times obliged to you why the fellow told me he belonged to one of the best families in new york if he does he doesnt do much credit to the family quite true why he was praising everything english he evidently wanted to gain my confidence may i ask where you met him asked carl on the train he offered me a light before i knew it he was chatting familiarly with me but his game is spoiled i will let him know that i see through him and his designs then my object is accomplished said carl please excuse my want of ceremony he turned to leave but bedford called him back if you are going to the falls remain with me he said we shall enjoy it better in company with pleasure let me introduce myself as carl crawford i am traveling on business and dont belong to one of the first families i see you will suit me said the englishman smiling just then up came stuyvesant panting and breathless my lord he said i lost sight of you if you will allow me i will join you sir said the englishman in a freezing voice i have not the honor of knowing you stuyvesant was overwhelmed i i hope i have not offended you my lord he said sir i have learned your character from this young man this called the attention of stuyvesant to carl he flushed as he recognized him mr stuyvesant said carl i must trouble you to return the valise you took from my stateroom and the pocketbook which you borrowed my name is carl crawford and my room is stuyvesant turned away abruptly he left the valise at the desk but carl never recovered his money chapter xxxv what carl learned in chicago as carl walked back from the falls he met mr atwood who was surprised to find his young acquaintance on such intimate terms with lord bedford he was about to pass with a bow when carl who was goodnatured said wont you join us mr atwood if lord bedford will permit i should like to introduce you glad to know any friend of yours mr crawford said the englishman affably i feel honored by the introduction said atwood bowing profoundly i hope you are not a friend of mr ah mr stuyvesant said the nobleman the person i was talking with this morning mr crawford tells me he is a what do you call it a confidence man i have no acquaintance with him my lord i saw him just now leaving the hotel i am afraid he has gone away with my valise and money said carl if you should be inconvenienced mr crawford said the nobleman my purse is at your disposal thank you very much lord bedford said carl gratefully i am glad to say i am still fairly well provided with money i was about to make you the same offer mr crawford said atwood thank you i appreciate your kindness even if im not obliged to avail myself of it returning to the hotel lord bedford ordered a carriage and invited atwood and carl to accompany him on a drive mr atwood was in an ecstasy and anticipated with proud satisfaction telling his family of his intimate friend lord bedford of england the peer though rather an ordinarylooking man seemed to him a model of aristocratic beauty it was a weakness on the part of mr atwood but an amiable one and is shared by many who live under republican institutions after dinner carl felt obliged to resume his journey he had found his visit to niagara very agreeable but his was a business and not a pleasure trip and loyalty to his employer required him to cut it short lord bedford shook his hand heartily at parting i hope we shall meet again mr crawford he said i expect myself to reach chicago on saturday and shall be glad to have you call on me at the palmer house thank you my lord i will certainly inquire for you there he is a very good fellow even if he is a lord thought carl our young hero was a thorough american and was disposed to think with robert burns that the rank is but the guinea stamp the mans the gold for a that no incident worth recording befell carl on his trip to chicago as a salesman he met with excellent success and surprised mr jennings by the size of his orders he was led on reaching chicago to register at the sherman house on clark street one of the most reliable among the many houses for travelers offered by the great western metropolis on the second day he made it a point to find out the store of john french hoping to acquire the information desired by miss norris it was a store of good size and apparently well stocked feeling the need of new footgear carl entered and asked to be shown some shoes he was waited upon by a young clerk named gray with whom he struck up a pleasant acquaintance do you live in chicago asked gray sociably no i am from new york state i am here on business staying at a hotel yes at the sherman if you are at leisure this evening i shall be glad to have you call on me i am a stranger here and likely to find the time hang heavy on my hands i shall be free at six oclock then come to supper with me thank you i shall be glad to do so answered gray with alacrity living as he did at a cheap boarding house the prospect of a supper at a firstclass hotel was very attractive he was a pleasantfaced young man of twenty who had drifted to chicago from his country home in indiana and found it hard to make both ends meet on a salary of nine dollars a week his habits were good his manner was attractive and won him popularity with customers and with patience he was likely to succeed in the end i wish i could live like this every day he said as he rose from a luxurious supper at present my finances wont allow me to board at the sherman nor would mine said carl but i am allowed to spend money more freely when i am traveling are you acquainted in new york asked gray i have little or no acquaintance in the city answered carl i should be glad to get a position there are you not satisfied with your present place i am afraid i shall not long keep it why not do you think you are in any danger of being discharged it is not that i am afraid mr french will be obliged to give up business why asked carl with keen interest i have reason to think he is embarrassed i know that he has a good many bills out some of which have been running a long time if any pressure is brought to bear upon him he may have to suspend carl felt that he was obtaining important information if mr french were in such a condition miss norris would be pretty sure to lose her money if she advanced it to what do you attribute mr frenchs embarrassment he asked he lives expensively in a handsome house near lincoln park and draws heavily upon the business for his living expenses i think that explains it i only wonder that he has been able to hold out so long perhaps if he were assisted he would be able to keep his head above water he would need a good deal of assistance you see that my place isnt very secure and i shall soon need to be looking up another i dont think i shall need to inquire any farther thought carl it seems to me miss norris had better keep her money before he retired he indited the following letter to his albany employer miss rachel norris dear madam i have attended to your commission and have to report that mr french appears to be involved in business embarrassments and in great danger to bankruptcy the loan he asks of you would no doubt be of service but probably would not long delay the crash if you wish to assist him it would be better to allow him to fail and then advance him the money to put him on his feet i am told that his troubles come from living beyond his means yours respectfully carl crawford by return mail carl received the following note my dear young friend your report confirms the confidence i reposed in you it is just the information i desired i shall take your advice and refuse the loan what other action i may take hereafter i cannot tell when you return should you stop in albany please call on me if unable to do this write me from milford your friend rachel norris carl was detained for several days in chicago he chanced to meet his english friend lord bedford upon his arrival and the nobleman on learning where he was staying also registered at the sherman house in his company carl took a drive over the magnificent boulevard which is the pride of chicago and rose several degrees in the opinion of those guests who noticed his intimacy with the english guest carl had just completed his chicago business when on entering the hotel he was surprised to see a neighbor of his fathers cyrus robinson a prominent business man of edgewood center carl was delighted for he had not been home or seen any home friends for over a year i am glad to see you mr robinson he said offering his hand what carl crawford exclaimed robinson in amazement how came you in chicago your father did not tell me you were here he does not know it i am only here on a business visit tell me mr robinson how is my father i think carl that he is not at all well i am quite sure he misses you and i dont believe your stepmothers influence over him is beneficial just before i came away i heard a rumor that troubled me it is believed in edgewood that she is trying to induce your father to make a will leaving all or nearly all his property to her and her son i dont care so much for that mr robinson as for my fathers health carl said robinson significantly if such a will is made i dont believe your father will live long after it you dont mean that said carl horrorstruck i think mrs crawford by artful means will worry your father to death he is of a nervous temperament and an unscrupulous woman can shorten his life without laying herself open to the law carls face grew stern i will save my father he said and defeat my stepmothers wicked schemes i pray heaven you can there is no time to be lost i shall lose no time you may be sure i shall be at edgewood within a week chapter xxxvi making a will in edgewood center events moved slowly in carl crawfords home dullness reigned supreme he had been the life of the house and his absence though welcome to his stepmother was seriously felt by his father who day by day became thinner and weaker while his step grew listless and his face seldom brightened with a smile he was anxious to have carl at home again and the desire became so strong that he finally broached the subject my dear he said one day at the breakfast table i have been thinking of carl considerably of late indeed said mrs crawford coldly i think i should like to have him at home once more mrs crawford smiled ominously he is better off where he is she said softly but he is my only son and i never see him pleaded her husband you know very well dr crawford rejoined his wife that your son only made trouble in the house while he was here yet it seems hard that he should be driven from his fathers home and forced to take refuge among strangers i dont know what you mean by his being driven from home said mrs crawford tossing her head he made himself disagreeable and not being able to have his own way he took french leave the house seems very lonely without him went on dr crawford who was too wise to get into an argument with his wife it certainly is more quiet as for company peter is still here and would at any time stay with you peter did not relish this suggestion and did not indorse it i should not care to confine him to the house said dr crawford as his glance rested on the plain and by no means agreeable face of his stepson i suppose i need not speak of myself you know that you can always call upon me if dr crawford had been warmly attached to his second wife this proposal would have cheered him but the time had gone by when he found any pleasure in her society there was a feeling of almost repulsion which he tried to conceal and he was obliged to acknowledge to himself that the presence of his wife gave him rather uneasiness than comfort carl is very well off where he is resumed mrs crawford he is filling a business position humble perhaps but still one that gives him his living and keeps him out of mischief let well enough alone doctor and dont interrupt his plans i i may be foolish said the doctor hesitating but i have not been feeling as well as usual lately and if anything should happen to me while carl was absent i should die very unhappy mrs crawford regarded her husband with uneasiness do you mean that you think you are in any danger she asked i dont know i am not an old man but on the other hand i am an invalid my father died when he was only a year older than i am at present mrs crawford drew out her handkerchief and proceeded to wipe her tearless eyes you distress me beyond measure by your words my dear husband how can i think of your death without emotion what should i do without you my dear you must expect to survive me you are younger than i and much stronger besides and mrs crawford made an artful pause i hardly like to mention it but peter and i are poor and by your death might be left to the cold mercies of the world surely i would not fail to provide for you mrs crawford shook her head i am sure of your kind intentions my husband she said but they will not avail unless you provide for me in your will yes its only right that i should do so as soon as i feel equal to the effort i will draw up a will i hope you will for i should not care to be dependent on carl who does not like me i hope you will not think me mercenary but to peter and myself this is of vital importance no i dont misjudge you i ought to have thought of it before i dont care so much about myself said mrs crawford in a tone of selfsacrifice but i should not like to have peter thrown upon the world without means all that you say is wise and reasonable answered her husband wearily i will attend to the matter tomorrow the next day mrs crawford came into her husbands presence with a sheet of legal cap my dear husband she said in a soft insinuating tone i wished to spare you trouble and i have accordingly drawn up a will to submit to you and receive your signature if you approve it dr crawford looked surprised where did you learn to write a will he asked i used in my days of poverty to copy documents for a lawyer she replied in this way i became something of a lawyer myself i see will you read what you have prepared mrs crawford read the document in her hand it provided in the proper legal phraseology for an equal division of the testators estate between the widow and carl i didnt know of course what provision you intended to make for me she said meekly perhaps you do not care to leave me half the estate yes that seems only fair you do not mention peter i ought to do something for him your kindness touches me my dear husband but i shall be able to provide for him out of my liberal bequest i do not wish to rob your son carl i admit that i do not like him but that shall not hinder me from being just dr crawford was pleased with this unexpected concession from his wife he felt that he should be more at ease if carls future was assured very well my dear he said cheerfully i approve of the will as you have drawn it up and i will affix my signature at once then shall i send for two of the neighbors to witness it it will be well two near neighbors were sent for and witnessed dr crawfords signature to the will there was a strangely triumphant look in mrs crawfords eyes as she took the document after it had been duly executed you will let me keep this doctor she asked it will be important for your son as well as myself that it should be in safe hands yes i shall be glad to have you do so i rejoice that it is off my mind you wont think me mercenary my dear husband or indifferent to your life no why should i then i am satisfied mrs crawford took the will and carrying it upstairs opened her trunk removed the false bottom and deposited under it the last will and testament of dr paul crawford at last she said to herself i am secure and have compassed what i have labored for so long dr crawford had not noticed that the will to which he affixed his signature was not the same that had been read to him mrs crawford had artfully substituted another paper of quite different tenor by the will actually executed the entire estate was left to mrs crawford who was left guardian of her son and carl and authorized to make such provision for each as she might deem suitable this of course made carl entirely dependent on a woman who hated him now dr paul crawford said mrs crawford to herself with a cold smile you may die as soon as you please peter and i are provided for your father died when a year older than you are now you tell me it is hardly likely that you will live to a greater age than he she called the next day on the family physician and with apparent solicitude asked his opinion of dr crawfords health he is all i have she said pathetically all except my dear peter tell me what you think of his chances of continued life your husband replied the physician has one weak organ it is his heart he may live for fifteen or twenty years but a sudden excitement might carry him off in a moment the best thing you can do for him is to keep him tranquil and free from any sudden shock mrs crawford listened attentively i will do my best she said since so much depends on it when she returned home it was with a settled purpose in her heart chapter xxxvii peter lets out a secret can you direct me to the house of dr crawford asked a stranger the inquiry was addressed to peter cook in front of the hotel in edgewood center yes sir he is my stepfather indeed i did not know that my old friend was married again you say you are his stepson yes sir he has an own son about your age i should judge thats carl he is a little older than me is he at home no answered peter pursing up his lips is he absent at boarding school no hes left home indeed ejaculated the stranger in surprise how is that he was awfully hard to get along with and didnt treat mother with any respect he wanted to have his own way and of course ma couldnt stand that i see returned the stranger and he eyed peter curiously what did his father say to his leaving home he asked oh he always does as ma wishes was carl willing to leave home yes he said he would rather go than obey ma i suppose he receives an allowance from his father no he wanted one but ma put her foot down and said he shouldnt have one your mother seems to be a woman of considerable firmness you bet shes firm she dont allow no boy to boss her really this boy is a curiosity said reuben ashcroft to himself he doesnt excel in the amiable and attractive qualities he has a sort of brutal frankness which cant keep a secret how did you and carl get along together he asked aloud we didnt get along at all he wanted to boss me and ma and i wouldnt have it so the upshot was that he had to leave the house and you remained yes thats the way of it said peter laughing and carl was actually sent out to earn his own living without help of any kind from his father yes what is he doing asked ashcroft in some excitement good heavens he may have suffered from hunger are you a friend of his asked peter sharply i am a friend of anyone who requires a friend carl is getting along well enough he is at work in some factory in milford and gets a living hasnt he been back since he first left home no how long ago is that oh bout a year answered peter carelessly how is dr crawford is he in good health he aint very well ma told me the other day she didnt think he would live long she got him to make a will the other day why this seems to be a conspiracy thought ashcroft id give something to see that will i suppose he will provide for you and your mother handsomely yes ma said she was to have control of the property i guess carl will have to stand round if he expects any favors it is evident this boy cant keep a secret thought ashcroft all the better for me i hope i am in time to defeat this womans schemes theres the house said peter pointing it out do you think dr crawford is at home oh yes he doesnt go out much ma is away this afternoon shes at the sewing circle i think thank you for serving as my guide said ashcroft theres a little acknowledgment which i hope will be of service to you he offered a half dollar to peter who accepted it joyfully and was profuse in his thanks now if you will be kind enough to tell the doctor that an old friend wishes to see him i shall be still further obliged just follow me then said peter and he led the way into the sittingroom chapter xxxviii dr crawford is taken to task after the first greetings reuben ashcroft noticed with pain the fragile look of his friend are you well he asked i am not very strong said dr crawford smiling faintly but mrs crawford takes good care of me and carl too he is no doubt a comfort to you dr crawford flushed painfully carl has been away from home for a year he said with an effort that is strange your own son too is there anything unpleasant you may confide in me as i am the cousin of carls mother the fact is carl and mrs crawford didnt hit it off very well and you took sides against your own son said ashcroft indignantly i begin to think i was wrong reuben you dont know how i have missed the boy yet you sent him out into the world without a penny how do you know that asked dr crawford quickly i had a little conversation with your stepson as i came to the house he spoke very frankly and unreservedly about family affairs he says you do whatever his mother tells you dr crawford looked annoyed and blushed with shame did he say that he asked yes he said his mother would not allow you to help carl he misunderstood paul i fear he understands the case only too well i dont want to pain you but your wife is counting on your speedy death i told her i didnt think i should live long and she got you to make a will yes did peter tell you that he said his mother was to have control of the property and carl would get nothing if he didnt act so as to please her there is some mistake here by my will made yesterday carl is to have an equal share and nothing is said about his being dependent on anyone who drew up the will mrs crawford did you read it yes ashcroft looked puzzled i should like to read the will myself he said after a pause where is it now mrs crawford has charge of it reuben ashcroft remained silent but his mind was busy that woman is a genius of craft he said to himself my poor friend is but a child in her hands i did not know paul would be so pitiably weak how do you happen to be here in edgewood reuben asked the doctor i had a little errand in the next town and could not resist the temptation of visiting you you can stay a day or two can you not i will though i had not expected to do so mrs crawford is away this afternoon she will be back presently and then i will introduce you at five oclock mrs crawford returned and her husband introduced her to his friend ashcroft fixed his eyes upon her searchingly her face looks strangely familiar he said to himself where can i have seen her mrs crawford like all persons who have a secret to conceal was distrustful of strangers she took an instant dislike to reuben ashcroft and her greeting was exceedingly cold i have invited mr ashcroft to make me a visit of two or three days my dear said her husband he is a cousin to carls mother mrs crawford made no response but kept her eyes fixed upon the carpet she could not have shown more plainly that the invitation was not approved by her madam does not want me here thought ashcroft as he fixed his gaze once more upon his friends wife again the face looked familiar but he could not place it have i not seen you before mrs crawford he asked abruptly i dont remember you she answered slowly probably i resemble some one you have met perhaps so answered ashcroft but he could not get rid of the conviction that somewhere and some time in the past he had met mrs crawford and under circumstances that had fixed her countenance in his memory after supper dr crawford said my dear i have told our guest that i had as a prudential measure made my will i wish you would get it and let me read it to him mrs crawford looked startled and annoyed couldnt you tell him the provisions of it she said yes but i should like to show him the document she turned and went upstairs she was absent at least ten minutes when she returned she was emptyhanded i am sorry to say she remarked with a forced laugh that i have laid away the will so carefully that i cant find it ashcroft fixed a searching look upon her that evidently annoyed her i may be able to find it tomorrow she resumed i think you told me paul said ashcroft turning to dr crawford that by the will your estate is divided equally between carl and mrs crawford yes and nothing is said of any guardianship on the part of mrs crawford no i think it would be better ashcroft that you should be carls guardian a man can study his interests and control him better i will accept the trust said ashcroft though i hope it may be many years before the necessity arises mrs crawford bit her lips and darted an angry glance at the two friends she foresaw that her plans were threatened with failure the two men chatted throughout the evening and dr crawford had never of late seemed happier it gave him new life and raised his spirits to chat over old times with his early friend chapter xxxix a man of energy the next morning ashcroft said to his host paul let us take a walk to the village dr crawford put on his hat and went out with his friend now paul said ashcroft when they were some rods distant from the house is there a lawyer in edgewood certainly and a good one did he indite your will no mrs crawford wrote it out she was at one time copyist for a lawyer take my advice and have another drawn up today without mentioning the matter to her she admits having mislaid the one made yesterday it may be a good idea certainly it is a prudent precaution then you will be sure that all is safe i have myself executed a duplicate will one i keep the other i have deposited with my lawyer ashcroft was a man of energy he saw that dr crawford who was of a weak vacillating temper executed the will he and another witnessed it and the document was left with the lawyer you think i had better not mention the matter to mrs crawford he said by no means she might think it was a reflection upon her for carelessly mislaying the first true and the doctor who was fond of peace consented to his friends plan by the way asked ashcroft who was your wife what was her name i mean before her second marriage she was a mrs cook oh i see said ashcroft and his face lighted up with surprise and intelligence what do you see inquired dr crawford i thought your wifes face was familiar i met her once when she was mrs cook you knew her then no i never exchanged a word with her till i met her under this roof how can i tell him that i first saw her when a visitor to the penitentiary among the female prisoners ashcroft asked himself my poor friend would sink with mortification they were sitting in friendly chat after their return from their walk when mrs crawford burst into the room in evident excitement husband she cried peter has brought home a terrible report he has heard from a person who has just come from milford that carl has been run over on the railroad and instantly killed dr crawford turned pale his features worked convulsively and he put his hand to his heart as he sank back in his chair his face as pale as the dead woman said ashcroft sternly i believe you have killed your husband oh dont say that how could i be so imprudent said mrs crawford clasping her hands and counterfeiting distress ashcroft set himself at once to save his friend from the result of the shock leave the room he said sternly to mrs crawford why should i i am his wife and have sought to be his murderer you know that he has heart disease mrs cook i know more about you than you suppose mrs crawfords color receded i dont understand you she said she had scarcely reached the door when there was a sound of footsteps outside and carl dashed into the room nearly upsetting his stepmother you here she said frigidly what is the matter with my father asked carl are you carl said ashcroft quickly yes your father has had a shock i think i can soon bring him to a few minutes later dr crawford opened his eyes are you feeling better paul asked ashcroft anxiously didnt i hear something about carl something terrible carl is alive and well said he soothingly are you sure of that asked dr crawford in excitement yes i have the best evidence of it here is carl himself carl came forward and was clasped in his fathers arms thank heaven you are alive he said why should i not be asked carl bewildered turning to ashcroft your stepmother had the let me say imprudence to tell your father that you had been killed on the railroad where could she have heard such a report i am not sure that she heard it at all said ashcroft in a low voice she knew that your father had heart disease chapter xl conclusion at this moment mrs crawford reentered the room what brings you here she demanded coolly of carl i came here because this is my fathers house madam you have behaved badly to me said mrs crawford you have defied my authority and brought sorrow and distress to your good father i thought you would have the good sense to stay away do you indorse this father asked carl turning to dr crawford no answered his father with unwonted energy my house will always be your home you seem to have changed your mind dr crawford sneered his wife where did you pick up the report of carls being killed on the railroad asked the doctor sternly peter heard it in the village said mrs crawford carelessly did it occur to you that the sudden news might injure your husband asked ashcroft i spoke too impulsively i realize too late my imprudence said mrs crawford coolly have you lost your place she asked addressing carl no i have just returned from chicago his stepmother looked surprised we have had a quiet time since you left us she said if you value your fathers health and peace of mind you will not remain here is my presence also unwelcome asked ashcroft you have not treated me with respect replied mrs crawford if you are a gentleman you will understand that under the circumstances it will be wise for you to take your departure leaving my old friend to your care yes that will be best mr ashcroft can i have a few minutes conversation with you asked carl certainly they left the room together followed by an uneasy and suspicious glance from mrs crawford carl hurriedly communicated to his fathers friend what he had learned about his stepmother mr cook peters father is just outside he said shall i call him in i think we had better do so but arrange that the interview shall take place without your fathers knowledge he must not be excited call him in and then summon your stepmother mrs crawford said carl reentering his fathers room mr ashcroft would like to have a few words with you can you come out she followed carl uneasily what is it you want with me sir she asked frigidly let me introduce an old acquaintance of yours mr cook whom mrs crawford had not at first observed came forward she drew back in dismay it is some time since we met lucy said cook quietly do you come here to make trouble she muttered hoarsely i come to ask for the property you took during my absence in california he said i dont care to have you return to me i obtained a divorce precisely i dont care to annul it i am thankful that you are no longer my wife i i will see what i can do for you dont go near my present husband he is in poor health and cannot bear a shock mrs crawford said ashcroft gravely if you have any idea of remaining here in this house give it up i shall see that your husbands eyes are opened to your real character sir you heard this man say that he has no claim upon me that may be but i cannot permit my friend to harbor a woman whose record is as bad as yours what do you mean she demanded defiantly i mean that you have served a term in prison for larceny it is false she said with trembling lips it is true i visited the prison during your term of confinement and saw you there i too can certify to it said cook i learned it two years after my marriage you will understand why i am glad of the divorce mrs crawford was silent for a moment she realized that the battle was lost well she said after a pause i am defeated i thought my secret was safe but i was mistaken what do you propose to do with me i will tell you this evening said ashcroft one thing i can say now you must not expect to remain in this house i no longer care to do so a conference was held during the afternoon dr crawford being told as much as was essential it was arranged that mrs crawford should have an allowance of four hundred dollars for herself and peter if she would leave the house quietly and never again annoy her husband mr cook offered to take peter but the latter preferred to remain with his mother a private arrangement was made by which dr crawford made up to mr cook onehalf of the sum stolen from him by his wife and through the influence of ashcroft employment was found for him he is no longer a tramp but a man held in respect and moderately prosperous carl is still in the employ of mr jennings and his father has removed to milford where he and his son can live together next september on his twentyfirst birthday carl will be admitted to a junior partnership in the business his father furnishing the necessary capital carls stepmother is in chicago and her allowance is paid to her quarterly through a chicago bank she has considerable trouble with peter who has become less submissive as he grows older and is unwilling to settle down to steady work his prospects do not look very bright mr jennings and hannah are as much attached as ever to carl and it is quite likely the manufacturer will make him his heir happy in the society of his son dr crawford is likely to live to a good old age in spite of his weakness and tendency to heart disease for happiness is a great aid to longevity
