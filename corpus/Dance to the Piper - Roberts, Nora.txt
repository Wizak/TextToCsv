 prologue during the break between lunch and cocktails the club was empty the floors were scarred but clean enough and the paint on the walls was only a little dull from fighting with cigarette smoke there was the scent intrinsic to such places old liquor and stale perfume mixed with coffee that was no longer fresh to a certain type of person it was as much home as a cozy fire and plump cushions the ohurleys made their home wherever audiences gathered when the afterdinner crowd strolled in the lights would be dimmed and it wouldnt look so grimy now strong sunlight shone through the two small windows and lighted the dust and dents mercilessly the mirror in back of a bar lined with bottles spread some of the light around but reflected mostly on the small stage in the center of the room thats my girl abby put a nice smile on frank ohurley took his fiveyearold triplets through the short dance routine he wanted to add to the show that night demonstrating the prissy moves with his wiry body they were playing a family hotel at a nice reasonably priced resort in the poconos he figured the audience would have a soft spot for three little girls i wish youd time your brainstorms better frank his wife molly sat at a corner table hurriedly sewing bows on the white dresses her daughters would wear in a few hours im not a bloody seamstress you know youre a trouper molly my love and the best thing that ever happened to frank ohurley theres nothing truer than that she muttered but smiled to herself all right my darlings lets try it again he smiled at the three little angels god had blessed him with in one fell swoop if the lord saw fit to present him with three babies for the price of one frank figured the lord was entitled to a sense of humor chantel was already a beauty with a round cherubs face and dark blue eyes he winked at her knowing she was more interested in the bows on the dress shed wear than in the routine abby was all amiability shed dance because her pop wanted her to and because it would be fun to be onstage with her sisters frank urged her to smile again and demonstrated the curtsy he wanted maddy with an elfin face and hair already hinting toward red mimicked his move perfectly her eyes never leaving his frank felt his heart swell with love for the three of them he laid his hand on his sons shoulder give us a twobar intro trace my boy a snappy one trace obligingly ran his fingers over the keys it was franks regret he couldnt afford lessons for the boy what trace knew of playing hed learned from watching and listening music rang out jumpy and bright hows that pop youre a pistol frank rubbed a hand over traces head okay girls lets take it from the top he worked them another fifteen minutes patiently making them giggle at their mistakes the fiveminute routine would be far from perfect but he was shrewd enough to recognize the charm of it theyd expand the act bit by bit as they went on it was the offseason at the resort now but if they made a bit of a mark theyd secure a return engagement life for frank was made up of gigs and return engagements he saw no reason his family shouldnt be of the same mind still the minute he saw chantel losing interest he broke off knowing her sisters wouldnt be far behind wonderful he bent to give each of them a smacking kiss as generous with affection as hed have liked to be with money were going to knock them dead is our name going on the poster chantel demanded and frank roared with delighted laughter want billing do you my little pigeon hear that molly doesnt surprise me she set down her sewing to rest her fingers tell you what chantel you get billing when you can do this he started a slow deceptively simple tap routine holding a hand out to his wife smiling molly rose to join him a dozen years of dancing together had them moving in unison from the first step abby slid onto the piano bench beside trace and watched he began to improvise a silly little tune that made abby smile chantels going to practice till she can do it he murmured abby smiled up at him then well all get our names on the poster i can show you how he whispered listening to his parents feet strike the wooden stage will you show us all how as an old man of ten trace was amused by the way his little sisters stuck together hed have gotten the same response from any of them i just might content she settled back against his shoulder her parents were laughing enjoying the exertion the rhythm it seemed to abby that her parents were always laughing even when her mother got that cross look on her face pop would make her laugh chantel was watching her eyes narrowed experimenting a bit but not quite catching the movements shed get mad abby knew but when she got mad she made sure she got what she wanted i want to do it maddy said from the corner of the stage frank laughed with his arms around mollys waist the two of them circled the stage feet tapping sliding shuffling do you now little turnip i can do it she told him and with a stubborn look on her face she began to tap her feet heel toe toe heel until she was moving center stage caught off balance frank stopped on a dime and molly bumped heavily into him look at that will you molly pushing her hair out of her eyes molly watched her youngest daughter struggling to capture the basics of their tap routine and she was doing it she felt a mixture of pride and regret only a mother would understand looks like well be buying another set of taps frank that it does frank felt twice the pride and none of the regret he released his wife to concentrate on his daughter no try this now he took the moves slowly hop shuffle stamp brush step brush step and step to the side he took maddys hand and careful to keep his steps small to match hers moved again she moved right with him now this his excitement growing he looked at his son give me a downbeat listen to the count maddy one and two and three and four tap no body weight here toe stab front then back now a riff again he demonstrated and again she imitated the steps well put it all together now and end with a step slide arms like this see he brought his arms out to the side in a sharp glitzy move then winked at her youre going to sell it sell it she repeated frowning in concentration give us the count trace frank took her hand again feeling the pleasure build as she moved in unison with him weve got ourselves a dancer here molly frank hefted maddy into his arms and let her fly she squealed not because she feared he wouldnt catch her but because she knew he would the sensation of dropping through the air was every bit as thrilling as the dance itself had been she wanted more chapter one five six seven eight twentyfour feet hit the wooden floor in unison the echo was wonderful twelve bodies twisted swooped and plunged as one mirrors threw their images right back at them arms flowed out on signal legs lifted heads tilted turned then fell back sweat rolled and the scent was the theater the piano banged out notes and the melody swelled in the old rehearsal hall music had echoed there before feet had responded heartbeats had raced and muscles had ached it would happen again and again year after year for as long as the building stood many stars had rehearsed in that room showbusiness legends had polished routines on the same boards countless unknown and unremembered line dancers had worked there until their muscles had gone stringy with fatigue it was a broadway that the paying public rarely saw the assistant choreographer his glasses fogging a bit in the steamy heat clapped out the beat constantly as he shouted the moves beside him the choreographer the man who had sculpted the dance stood watching with eyes as dark and alert as a birds hold it the piano music stopped movement stopped the dancers drooped with a combination of exhaustion and relief it drags there drags the dancers still a unit rolled their eyes and tried to ignore their aching muscles the choreographer studied them then gave the signal to take five twelve bodies dropped against the wall shifting together so that heads fell on convenient shoulders or abdomens calves were massaged feet flexed relaxed and flexed again they talked little breath was an important commodity to be hoarded whenever possible beneath them the floor was battlescarred covered with masking tape that had set the marks for dozens of other shows but there was only one show that mattered now this one want a bite maddy ohurley roused herself to look down at the chocolate bar she considered it coveted it then shook her head one bite would never be enough no thanks sugar makes me lightheaded when im dancing i need a lift the woman her skin as dark and rich as the candy took a huge bite like now all that guy needs is a whip and a chain maddy glanced over at the choreographer as he bent over the accompanist hes tough well be glad weve got him before this is over yeah but right now id like to strangle him with some piano wire maddy suggested and was rewarded with a quick husky laugh something like that her energy was coming back and she could feel herself drying off the room smelled of sweat and the fruity splashon many of the dancers used to combat it ive seen you at auditions maddy commented youre real good thanks the woman carefully wrapped the rest of the candy and slipped it into her dance bag wanda starre two rs and an e maddy ohurley yeah i know maddys name was already wellknown in the theater district the gypsies the dancers who wandered from show to show job to jobknew her as one of their own whod made it woman to woman dancer to dancer wanda recognized maddy as someone who hadnt forgotten her roots its my first white contract she said in an undertone no kidding white contracts were for principals pink for chorus there was much much more to it than color coding surprised maddy straightened to get a better look the woman beside her had a largefeatured exotic face and the long slender neck and strong shoulders of a dancer her body was longer than maddys even sprawled on the floor maddy gauged a fiveinch difference from shoulder to toe your first time out of chorus thats right wanda glanced at the other dancers relaxing and recharging im scared to death maddy toweled off her face me too come on youve already starred in a hit i havent starred in this one yet and i havent worked with macke she watched the choreographer still wiry at sixty move away from the piano show time she murmured the dancers rose and listened to the next set of instructions for another two hours they moved absorbed strove and polished when the other dancers were dismissed maddy was given a tenminute break then came back to go through her solo as lead she would dance with the chorus perform solo and dance with the male lead and the other principals she would prepare for the play in much the same way an athlete prepared for a marathon practice discipline and more practice in a show that was slated to run two hours and ten minutes she would be on stage about twothirds of the time dance routines would be absorbed into the memory banks of her mind muscles and limbs everything would have to respond in sync at the call of the downbeat try it with your arms out shoulderlevel macke instructed ball change before the kicks and keep the energy up the assistant choreographer gave the count and maddy threw herself into a twominute routine that would have left a linebacker panting better from macke maddy knew that was praise indeed this time keep your shoulders loose he walked over and laid his blunt ugly hands on maddys damp shoulders after the turn angle stage left i want the moves sharp dont follow through cut them off youre a stripper not a ballerina she smiled at him because while he was criticizing her he was massaging the exhausted muscles of her shoulders macke had a reputation for being a grueling instructor but he had the soul of a dancer ill try to remember that she took the count again and let her body do the thinking sharp sassy acerbic that was what the part called for so that was what shed be when she couldnt use her voice to get into the part she had to use her body her legs lifted jackknifing from the knee in a series of hitch kicks her arms ranged out to the side contracted to cuddle her body and flew up while her feet moved by memory to the beat her short smooth crop of reddishblond hair flopped around a sweatband that was already soaked shed have the added weight of a wildly curled shoulderlength wig for this number but she refused to think about that her face glowed like wet porcelain but none of the effort showed her features were small almost delicate but she knew how to use her whole face to convey an expression an emotion it was often necessary to overconvey in the theater moisture beaded on her soft upper lip but she smiled grinned laughed and grimaced as the mood of the dance demanded without makeup her face was attractive or cute as maddy had wearily come to accept with its triangular shape elfin features and wide brandycolored eyes for the part of mary howard alias the merry widow maddy would rely on the expertise of the makeup artist to turn her into something slick and sultry for now she depended on her own gift for expression and movement to convey the character of the overexperienced stripper looking for an easy way out in some ways she thought shed been preparing all her life for this part the train and bus rides with her family traveling from town to town and dub to club to entertain for union scale and a meal by the age of five shed been able to gauge an audience were they hostile were they laidback were they receptive knowing the audiences mood could mean the difference between success and failure maddy had discovered early how to make subtle changes in a routine to draw the best response her life from the time she could walk had been played out onstage in twentysix years shed never regretted a moment of it there had been classes endless classes though the names and faces of her teachers had blurred every movement every position every step was firmly lodged in her mind when there hadnt been the time or money for a formal class her father had been there setting up a makeshift barre in a motel room to put his children through practice routines and exercises shed been born a gypsy coming into the world with her two sisters when her parents had been on the way to a performance becoming a broadway gypsy had been inevitable shed auditioned failed and dealt with the misery of disappointment shed auditioned succeeded and dealt with the fear of opening night because of her nature and her background shed never had to deal with a lack of confidence for six years shed struggled on her own without the cushion of her parents her brother and her sisters shed danced in chorus lines and taken classes between rehearsals shed waited tables to help pay for the instructions that never ended and the dance shoes that wore out too soon shed broken through to principal but had continued to study shed made second lead but never gave up her classes she finally stopped waiting tables her biggest part had been the lead in suzannas park a plum shed relished until shed felt shed sucked it dry leaving it had been a risk but there was enough gypsy in her to have made the move an adventure now she was playing the role of mary and the part was harder more complex and more demanding than anything that had come before she was going to work for mary just as hard as she would make mary work for her when the music ended maddy stood in the center of the hall hands on hips labored breathing echoing off the walls her body begged to be allowed to collapse but if macke had signaled she would have revved up and gone on not bad kid he tossed her a towel with a little laugh maddy buried her face in it the cloth was no longer fresh but it still absorbed moisture not bad you know damn well it was terrific it was good mackes lips twitched maddy knew that was as good as a laugh for him cant stand cocky dancers but he watched her towel off pleased and grateful that there was such a furnace of energy in her compact body she was his tool his canvas his success would depend on her ability as much as hers did on his maddy slung the towel around her neck as she walked over to the piano where the accompanist was already stacking up the score can i ask you something macke shoot he drew out a cigarette it was a habit maddy looked on with mild pity how many musicals have you done now altogether i mean dancing and choreographing lost count well call it plenty okay she accepted his answer easily though she would have bet her best tap shoes that he knew the exact number how do you gauge our chances with this one nervous no paranoid he took two short drags its good for you i dont sleep well when im paranoid i need my rest his lips twitched again youve got the best me youve got a good score a catchy libretto and a solid book what do you want standing room only she accepted a glass of water from the assistant choreographer and sipped carefully he answered because he respected her it wasnt based on what shed done in suzannas park rather he admired what she and others like her did every day she was twentysix and had been dancing for more than twenty years you know whos backing us with a nod she sipped again letting the water play in her mouth not cold but wonderfully wet valentine records got any idea why a record company would negotiate to be the only backer of a musical exclusive rights to the cast album you catch on he crushed out the cigarette wishing immediately for another he only thought of them when the music wasnt playing on the piano or in his head luckily for his lungs that wasnt often reed valentines our angel a secondgeneration corporate bigwig and from what im told hes tougher than his old man ever thought of being hes not interested in us sweetheart hes interested in making a profit thats fair enough maddy decided after a moment id like to see him make one she grinned a big one good thinking hit the shower the pipes were noisy and the water sprayed in staccato bursts but it was cool and wet maddy propped both forearms against the wall and let the stream pour over her head shed taken a ballet class early that morning from there shed come directly to the rehearsal hall first to go over two of the songs with the composer the singing didnt worry her she had a clean voice excellent pitch and a good range most of all she was loud the theater didnt tolerate stingy voices shed spent her formative years as one of the ohurley triplets when you sang in bars and clubs with faulty acoustics and undependable audio equipment you learned to be generous with your lungs she had a pretty good handle on her lines tomorrow shed be rehearsing with the other actors after jazz class and before dance rehearsal the acting itself gave her a few flutters chantel was the true actor in the family just as abby had the most fluid voice maddy would rely on the character of mary to pull her through her heart was in the dancing it had to be there was nothing more strenuous more demanding more exhausting it had caught her mind body and soul from the moment her father had taught her her first simple tap routine in a dingy little lounge in pennsylvania look at me now pop she thought as she shut off the inconsistent spray im on broadway maddy toweled off quickly to avoid a chill and dressed in the street clothes shed stuffed in her dance bag the big hall echoed the composer and lyricist were performing minor surgery on one of their own tunes there would be changes tomorrow changes she and the other vocalists would have to learn that was nothing new macke would have a dozen subtle alterations to the number theyd just gone over that was nothing new either maddy heard the sound of dance shoes hitting the floor the rhythm repeated over and over someone from the chorus was vocalizing the vowel sounds rose and fell melodically maddy swung her bag over her shoulders and descended the stairs to the street door with one thing on her mind food the energy and calories that shed drained after a full day of exercise had to be replenished but replenished wisely shed trained herself long ago to look at a dish of yogurt and a banana split with the same enthusiasm tonight it would be yogurt garnished with fresh fruit and joined by a big bowl of barley soup and spinach salad at the door she paused a moment and listened again the vocalist was still doing scales piano music drifted tinny and slight with distance feet slapped the floor in rhythm the sounds were as much a part of her as her own heartbeat god bless reed valentine she decided and stepped out into the balmy dusk shed taken about two steps when a sharp jerk on her dance bag sent her spinning around he was hardly more than a boy really sixteen seventeen but she couldnt miss the hard desperate look in his eye shed been desperate a few times herself you should be in school she told him as they began a tugofwar over her bag shed looked like a pushover a hundred pounds of fluff to be tossed aside while he took the bag and fled her strength surprised him but made him all the more determined to have whatever cash and plastic she carried in the dim light beside the stairs of the old building no one noticed the struggle she thought of screaming then thought of how young he was and tried reason instead it had been pointed out to her once or twice that not everyone wanted to be reformed that never stopped her from trying you know whats in here she asked him as they pulled and tugged on the canvas he was running out of breath more quickly than she was sweaty tights and a towel thats already molding and my ballet shoes remembering them she held on tighter a pro she knew would have given up and looked for an easier mark the boy was beginning to call her all sorts of names but she ignored them believing that he was entitled theyre almost new but they wont do you any good she continued in the same rational tone i need them a lot more than you do as they scuffled she banged her heel against the iron railing and swore she could afford to lose a few dollars but she couldnt afford an injury so he didnt want to be reformed but maybe hed compromise look if youll let go a minute ill give you half of the cash i have i dont want to have to bother changing my credit cards which ill do by calling that number the minute you take off i dont have time to replace the shoes and i need them tomorrow all the cash she decided as she heard the seam in her bag begin to give i think i have about thirty dollars he gave a fierce rug that sent maddy stumbling forward then at the sound of a shout he released his hold the bag dropped like a stone its contents tumbling out the boy not wasting time on a curse ran like a rocket down the street and around the first corner muttering to herself maddy crouched down to gather up her belongings are you all right she reached for her tattered leg warmer and saw a pair of highly polished italian shoes as a dancer she took a special notice of what people wore on their feet shoes often reflected ones personality and selfesteem polished italian shoes meant wealth and appreciation for what wealth could provide to maddy above the exquisite leather were pale gray trousers that fell precisely to the middle of the foot their creases perfectly aligned an organized sensible man she decided as she gathered the loose change that had spilled from the bottom of her bag looking higher she saw that the trousers fit well over narrow hips and were buckled by a thin belt with a small intricately worked gold buckle stylish but not trendy the jacket was open revealing a trim waist a long torso smoothed by a light blue shirt and a darker tie all silk maddy approved highly of silk worn against the body luxuries were only luxuries if they were enjoyed she looked at the hand that reached down to help her up it was tanned with long attractive fingers on his wrist was a gold watch that looked both expensive and practical she put her hand in his and felt heat and strength and she thought impatience thank you she said it before she looked at his face from her long visual journey up his body she knew he was tall and lean rangy not in the way of a dancer but in the way of a man who knew discipline without the extremes of sacrifice in the same interested way shed studied him from shoes to shoulders she studied his face he was cleanshaven and every line and plane showed clearly his cheeks were slightly hollow giving his otherwise hard and stern look a poetic hint shed always had a soft spot for poets his mouth was in a firm line now signalling disapproval or annoyance while below it was a trace just a touch of a cleft in his chin his nose was straight aristocratic and though he looked down it at her she took no offense the eyes were a dark flinty gray and they conveyed as clearly as words the message that he didnt care to waste time rescuing damsels in distress the fact that he didnt and yet had made maddy warm toward him he brushed his fingers through his burnished blond hair and stared back at her and wondered if she was going into shock sit down he told her in the quick clipped voice of a man accustomed to giving orders and having them obeyed immediately im okay she said sending him an easy smile he noticed for the first time that her face wasnt flushed or pale that her eyes werent mirroring fear she didnt fit his picture of a woman whod nearly been mugged im glad you came along when you did that kid wasnt listening to reason she bent down again to gather her things he told himself he should go and leave her to pick up her own scattered belongings but instead he took a deep breath checked his watch then crouched down to help her do you always try to reason with muggers apprentice mugger would be my guess she found her key ring where it had bounced into a deep crack in the sidewalk and i was trying to negotiate he held up maddys oldest practice tights gingerly by the backs of the knees do you really think this was worth negotiating over absolutely she took them from him rolled them up and stuffed them in her bag he could have hurt you he could have gotten my shoes maddy picked up her ballet slippers and stroked the supple leather a fat lot of good theyd have done him and i only bought them three weeks ago hand me that sweatband would you he retrieved it then grimaced dangling it by his fingertips he handed it over shower with this do you laughing she took it and dropped it in with the rest of her practice clothes no its just sweat sorry but there was no apology in her eyes only humor dressed like that you dont look as though youd recognize the substance i dont generally carry it around in a bag with me he wondered why he didnt simply move by her and start on his way he was already five minutes late but something about the way she continued to look up at him with such frank good humor kept him there you dont react like a woman who very nearly lost a pair of tights a faded leotard a ratty towel two pairs of shoes and five pounds of keys the towels not that ratty satisfied shed found everything maddy dosed her beg again and anyway i didnt lose them most of the women i know wouldnt negotiate with a mugger interested she studied him again he looked like a man who would know dozens of women all elegant and intelligent what would they do scream i imagine if id done that hed have my bag and id be out of breath she dismissed the idea with a graceful shrug of strong shoulders anyway thanks she offered her hand again a delicate one narrow and naked of jewelry i think white knights are lovely she was small and completely alone and it was getting darker by the minute his natural instinct for noninvolvement warred with his conscience the resolution took the form of annoyance you shouldnt be walking around in this neighborhood after dark she laughed again the sound bright rich and amused this is my neighborhood i only live about four blocks away i told you the kid was green no selfrespecting muggers going to look twice at a dancer they know dancers are usually broke but you she stepped back and took another long look he was definitely worth taking the time to look twice youre another matter dressed like that youd be better off carrying your watch and your wallet in your shorts ill keep that in mind deciding one good turn deserved another maddy merely nodded can i give you directions you dont look as though you know your way around the lower forties why had he been the one feeling responsible for her in another minute that kid might have planted a fist in her face but she didnt appear to have considered that no thanks im just going inside here here maddy glanced over her shoulder at the ramshackle building that housed the rehearsal hall then looked at him speculatively youre not a dancer she said that positively it wasnt that he didnt move well from the little she had seen hed looked good he simply wasnt a dancer and not an actor she decided after only a brief mental debate and id swear you arent a musician even though youve got good hands every time he tried to walk away from her she drew him back why not too conservative maddy told him immediately but not with scorn absolutely too straight i mean youre dressed like a lawyer or a banker or it struck her clear as a bell she positively beamed at him an angel he lifted a brow you see a halo no i dont think youd be willing to carry that kind of weight around an angel she repeated a backer valentine records yet again maddy offered her hand he took it and found himself simply holding it thats right reed valentine im merry widow he frowned i beg your pardon the stripper she said and watched his eyes narrow she might have left it at that just for the possible shock value but then he had helped her out from take it off the play youre backing delighted with him she covered his hand with her free one maddy ohurley this was maddy ohurley this compact little urchin with the crop of disheveled redblond hair and the scrubbed face was the same powerhouse hed watched in suzannas park shed worn a long blond wig for that an alice in wonderland look and period costumes of the s but still her voice had boomed out filling every crack in the theater shed danced with a frenzied feverish energy that had awed a man who was very difficult to impress one of the reasons hed been willing to back the play was maddy ohurley now he was facetoface with her and swamped with doubts madeline ohurley thats what it says on the contract ive seen you perform miss ohurley i didnt recognize you lights costume makeup she shrugged it off when there werent footlights she prized her anonymity and acknowledged her own unremarkable looks shed been born one of three chantel had gotten the heartstopping beauty abby the warm loveliness and shed gotten cute maddy figured there were reasons for it but she couldnt help being amused by reeds cautious look now youre disappointed she concluded with a secret smile i never said of course you wouldnt youre much too polite dont worry mr valentine records ill deliver any ohurleys a wise investment she laughed at her own private joke the streetlight behind them flickered on signaling that night was coming like it or not i guess youve got meetings inside ten minutes ago times only important when youre on cue youve got the checkbook captain youre in charge before she stepped out of his way she gave him a friendly pat on the arm listen if youre around in a couple of days come by rehearsals she took a few steps turned and walked backward grinning at him you can watch me bump and grind im good valentine real good with a pirouette she turned away eating up the sidewalk with an easy jog in spite of a penchant for promptness reed continued to watch her until she disappeared around the corner he shook his head and started up the stairs then he noticed a small round hairbrush the temptation to leave it where it lay was strong curiosity was stronger when reed scooped it up he noticed that it carried the faintest scent of shampoo something lemonscented and fresh he resisted the urge to sniff at it and stuck it in his jacket pocket would a woman like that miss a hair brush he wondered then shrugged the thought away hed see that she got it back in any case he was bound to see maddy ohurley again anyway he told himself it wouldnt hurt to do one more good deed chapter two nearly a week passed before reed managed to schedule another visit to the rehearsal hall he was able to justify the trip to himself as good business sense but just barely it had never been his intention to become directly involved with the play itself meetings with the producer and sessions with the accountants would have been enough to keep him informed reed understood balance sheets ledgers and neatly formed columns better than he did the noises and the scents inside the decaying old building but it never hurt to keep a tight rein on an investment even if the investment involved an odd woman with a vivid smile he felt out of place he was a twentyminute cab ride from his offices yet just as out of place in the rehearsal hall in his threepiece suit as he would have been on some remote island in the south seas where the natives wore bones in their ears he would never have considered his life sheltered in the course of his career hed visited some seamy areas dealt with people from varied backgrounds but he lived uptown where the restaurants were sedate and the view of the park out his apartment window was restful as he started up the stairs reed told himself it was natural curiosity that had brought him back that coupled with the simple matter of protecting his interests valentine records had sunk a good chunk of capital into take it off and he was responsible for valentine records still he reached into his pocket and toyed with maddys hair brush going against his natural inclinations he headed toward the sounds of music and talk in a room wrapped with mirrors he found the dancers they werent the glittery spangly chorus one paid to see on a broadway stage but a ragtag dripping group of men and women in frayed tights to him they were a helterskelter mix of faded damp leotards without any hint of the precision or uniformity expected of professionals he felt uneasy for a moment as they stood most of them with their hands on their hips and stared at the small thin man he knew was the choreographer lets have a little more steam boys and girls macke instructed this is a strip joint not a cotillion weve got to sell sex and keep it goodnatured wanda i want a hesitation on the hip roll then make it broader maddy raise some blood pressure when you step up in the shimmy bend it from the waist he demonstrated and maddy watched considered the move then grinned at him i saw the design for my costume macke if i bend over like that the boys in the front row are going to get an anatomy lesson macke looked her over a small one in your case the dancers around her snorted and cackled maddy took the ribbing with a goodhumored laugh as they moved back into position to take the count they moved with gusto on eight reed watched with steadily growing astonishment over a floor shiny with sweat the dancers sprang to life legs flashed hips rolled men and women found their partners in what seemed to be a riot of churning bodies there were lifts jumps spins and the soft stamp of feet from his vantage point he could see the exertion the drip of perspiration the deep controlled breathing then maddy stepped out and he forgot the rest the leotard clung to every curve and line of her body with the dark patches only accentuating her shape her legs even in battered tights seemed to go all the way to her waist slowly at first with her hands at the tops of her hips she moved forward then right then left always following the rotation of her hips he didnt hear the count being called now but she did her arm snaked across her body then flew out it didnt take much imagination to understand that she had tossed aside some article of clothing she kicked up so that for a moment her foot was over her head slowly erotically she ran her fingertips down her thigh as she lowered her leg the pace picked up and so did her rhythm she moved like a leopard twisting turning sinuous and smooth then as the dancers behind her went into an orgy of movement she bent from the waist and used her shoulders to fascinate a man broke from the group and grabbed her arm with nothing more than the angle of her body the placement of her head she conveyed teasing taunting acceptance when the music ended she was caught against him arched backward and his hand was clamped firmly on her bottom better macke decided the dancers sagged unwilling to waste energy by standing upright maddy and her partner seemed to collapse onto each other watch your hand jack i am he leaned over her shoulder just a little ive got my eye right on it she managed a breathless laugh before she pushed him away for the first time she saw reed standing in the doorway he looked every inch the proper successful businessman because shed wanted to see him again had known she eventually would maddy sent him an uncomplicated friendly smile take lunch macke announced as he lit a cigarette i want maddy wanda and terry back in an hour someone give carter the word i want him too chorus is due in room b at for vocals the room was already emptying maddy took her towel and buried her face in it before she walked over to reed several of the female dancers passed him with nonetoosubtle invitations in their eyes hello again maddy slung her towel around her neck then gently eased him out of the way of the hungry dancers did you see the whole thing whole thing the dance yes he was having a hard time remembering anything but the way she had moved the sensuality that had poured out of her with a laugh she hung on to the ends of the towel and leaned against the wall and impressive now she looked simply like a woman whod been hard at work attractive enough but hardly primitively arousing youve ah a lot of energy miss ohurley oh im packed with it are you here for another meeting no feeling a little foolish he pulled out her hairbrush i think this is yours well yeah pleased maddy took it from him i gave it up for lost that was nice of you she dabbed at her face with the towel again hang on a minute she walked away to stuff the brush and towel in her bag reed allowed himself the notsomild pleasure of watching her leotard stretch over her bottom as she bent over she came back slinging the bag over her shoulder how about some lunch she asked him it was so casual and so ridiculously appealing that he nearly agreed ive got an appointment dinner his brow lifted she was looking up at him a half smile on her lips and laughter in her eyes the women he knew would have coolly left it to him to make the approach and the maneuvers are you asking me for a date the question rang with cautious politeness and she had to laugh again you catch on fast valentine records are you a carnivore i beg your pardon do you eat meat she explained i know a lot of people who wont touch it ah yes he wondered why he should feel apologetic fine ill fix you a steak got a pen not certain whether he was amused or just dazed reed drew one out of his breast pocket i knew you would maddy rattled off her address see you at seven she called for someone down the hall to wait for her and dashed off before he could agree or refuse reed walked out of the building without writing down her address but he didnt forget it maddy always did things on impulse that was how she justified asking reed to dinner when she barely knew him and didnt have anything in the house more interesting than banana yogurt he was interesting she told herself so she stopped on the way home after a full ten hours on her feet and did some frenzied marketing it wasnt often she cooked not that she couldnt when push came to shove it was simply that it was easier to eat out of a carton or can if it didnt have to do with the theater maddy always looked for the easiest way when she reached her apartment building the gianellis were arguing in their firstfloor apartment italian expletives streamed up the stairwell maddy remembered her mail jogged back down half a flight and searched her key ring for the tiny tarnished key that opened the scarred slot with a postcard from her parents an offer for life insurance and two bills in hand she jogged back up again on the second landing the newlywed from sat reading a textbook hows the english lit maddy asked her pretty good i think ill have my certificate by august terrific but she looked lonely maddy thought and she paused a moment hows tony he made the finals for that play offbroadway when she smiled her young hopeful face glowed if he makes chorus he can quit waiting tables at night he says prosperitys just around the corner thats great angie she didnt add that prosperity was always around the corner for gypsies the roads just kept getting longer ive got to run somebodys coming for dinner on the third floor she heard the wailing echo of rock music and the thumping of feet the disco queen was rehearsing maddy decided as she chugged up the next flight of steps after a quick search for her keys she let herself in she had an hour she switched on the stereo on her way to the kitchen then dropped her bag on the twelveinch square of formica she called counter space she scrubbed two potatoes stuck them in the oven remembered to turn it on then dumped the fresh vegetables into the sink it occurred to her vaguely that she might tidy the place up a bit it hadnt been dusted in well there was enough clutter on the tables to hide the dust anyway some might call her rooms a shade messy but no one would call them dull most of her furnishings and decorations were broadway surplus when a show closed especially if it had flopped the markdown on props and materials was wonderful they were memories to her so even after the money had started to come in regularly she hadnt replaced them the curtains were red and dizzity ornate a steal from best little whorehouse in texas the sofa with its curvy back and dangerously hard cushions had been part of the refuse of a flop she couldnt even remember but it was reputed to have once sat on the parlor set of my fair lady maddy had decided to believe it none of the tables matched nor did any of the chairs it was a hodgepodge of periods and colors a tangle of junk and splendor that suited her very well posters lined the walls posters from plays shed been in posters from plays where she hadnt gotten past the first call there was one plant a philodendron that hovered between life and death in its vivid pot by the window it was the last in a long line of dead soldiers but her most prized possession was a hotpink neon sign whose curvy letters spelled out her name trace had sent it to her when shed gotten her first job in a broadway chorus her name in lights maddy switched it on as she usually did and thought that while her brother might not often be around he always made himself known deciding not to spend too much tune picking up when it would only be cluttered again in a couple of days maddy cleaned off a couple of chairs stacked the magazines and the unopened mail and left it at that more pressing was the task of washing out her dance clothes she filled the tub with warm water and soap then added the lights and leotard shed worn to class that morning with them she added her rehearsal clothes for good measure she dropped in sweatbands and leg warmers with the sleeves of her kneelength sweatshirt rolled up she began the monotonous job of washing out rinsing and wringing using the makeshift clothesline shed fashioned in the tub maddy hung every piece up to dry the bathroom was no larger than a closet when she stood up and turned she faced herself in the mirror over the sink mirrors were an intimate part of her life there were days when she danced in front of them for eight hours watching recording assessing every muscle and move of her body now she looked at her face fairly good bones satisfactory features it was the combination of pointed chin wide eyes and glowing skin that won those awful accolades like cute and wholesome nothing earthshattering she thought but she could give them a hand on a whim she swung the mirrored door open and grabbed two handfuls of makeup at random she bought it stored it even hoarded it it was almost an obsession the fact that she rarely used it unless she was performing didnt make her hobby seem odd to her whenever she wanted to play with her face she had all the tools handy for ten minutes she experimented putting on creaming off then putting on again until the result was simply a bit of exotic color on her eyes and the faintest hint of warmth on her cheekbones maddy put the pots and tubes and pencils back into the cabinet then shut the door before anything could fall out was she supposed to chill that wine she thought abruptly or maybe she should serve it at room temperature which was now hovering around eighty degrees she must have given him the wrong address reed didnt doubt his memory hed been taught early the importance of remembering names faces facts figures when your teacher was your father and you adored your father you learned from years of practice rather than from natural inclination reed could hold three columns of figures in his head and tally each of them edwin valentine had taught his son that a smart businessman hired the best accountants then made certain he knew as much as they did he hadnt forgotten the address or mixed up the numbers but he was beginning to believe she had the neighborhood was tough and seedy and rapidly getting seedier as he drove a broken chair with its stuffing pouring out the side sat on the sidewalk a group of people was arguing over ownership an old man in an undershirt and shorts sat on a grimy stoop and chugged a can of beer he eyed reeds car owlishly as it passed how could she live here or more to the point he thought why would she live here maddy ohurley had just come off a years engagement in a solid show that had brought her a tony nomination before that shed had another year as the second lead and understudy to the star in a successful revival of kiss me kate reed knew because hed made it his business to know his business he assured himself as he pulled to the curb in front of the building that corresponded with the numbers maddy had given him a woman who was about to embark on her third major broadway show could afford to live in a neighborhood where they didnt mine the sidewalks at night as reed stepped out of his car he spotted a young hood leaning against a lamppost eyeing his hubcaps with a quiet oath reed approached him hed dressed casually but even without tie and jacket he looked as if he belonged at the country club how much to watch it reed began bluntly instead of strip it the boy shifted his position and smiled with practiced arrogance pretty elegant wheels you got there lancelot dont see many bmws cruise through here im thinking of getting my camera take all the pictures you want just dont take anything else reed slipped a twenty out of his wallet lets say youre gainfully employed theres another ten if the cars intact when i come out you wont get more by hocking the hubcaps and this way all you have to do is take in the evening air the boy studied the car then its driver he knew how to size up an opponent and figure the odds the flinty eyes were direct and calm if hed seen fear in them the boy would have pushed instead he took the twenty youre the boss i got a couple hours to kill he grinned and showed a painfully crooked front tooth the twenty had already disappeared before reed started toward the front door her name was on a mailslot in what might loosely have been called a foyer apartment and there was no elevator reed started up the steps to the accompaniment of squalling kids earsplitting jazz and the sweating gianellis by the time he reached the third floor he was doing some swearing himself when the knock came maddy was up to her wrists in salad shed known that hed be on time just as surely as shed known she wouldnt be hang on a minute she shouted then looked around fruitlessly for a cloth to dry her hands with giving up she shook what moisture she could from them as she walked to the door she gave the knob a hard yank then grinned at him hi i hope youre not hungry im not finished yet no i he glanced back over his shoulder the hall he began and let his words trail off maddy stuck her head out and sniffed smells like a cow pasture she said guido must be cooking again come on in he should have been prepared for her apartment but he wasnt reed glanced around at the vivid red curtains the shock of blue rug the chair that looked as though it had come straight out of a medieval castle it had in fact come from the set of camelot her name in pink neon glowed brilliantly against a white wall quite a place he murmured i like it when im here overhead came three simultaneous thuds ballet student on the fifth maddy said easily tours jett would you like some wine yes reed glanced uneasily at the ceiling again i think i would good so would i she walked back to the kitchen which was separated from the living room by a teetering breakfront and imagination theres a corkscrew in one of these drawers she told him why dont you open the bottle while i finish this after a moments hesitation reed found himself searching through maddys kitchen drawers in the first one he found a tennis ball several loose keys and some snapshots but no corkscrew he rifled through another wondering what he was doing there on the fifth floor the ballet student continued his leaps how do you like your steak reed rescued the corkscrew from a tangle of black wire ahh medium rare okay when she bent down to pull the broiling pan out of a cupboard her cheek nearly brushed his knee reed drew the cork from the bottle then set the wine aside to let it breathe why did you ask me to dinner still bent over and rummaging maddy turned her face upward no concrete reason i rarely have one but if youd like why dont we say because of the hairbrush she rose then holding a dented broiling pan besides youre terrific to look at she saw the humor come and go in his eyes and was delighted thank you oh youre welcome she brushed away the hair that fell into her eyes and thought vaguely that it was about time for a trim why did you come i dont have any idea that should definitely make things more interesting youve never backed a play before have you no ive never cooked dinner for a backer so were even setting the salad aside she began to prepare the steak glasses glasses she repeated then glanced at the wine oh theyre up in one of the cupboards resigned reed began another search he found cups with broken handles a mismatched set of fabulous bone china and several plastic dishes eventually he found a hoard of eight wineglasses no two alike you dont believe in uniformity hot really maddy set the steak under the broiler then slammed the oven door it needs a boost to get going she told him as she accepted the glass he offered to sro to what standing room only she clicked her glass to his and drank reed studied her over the rim of his glass she still wore the oversize sweatshirt her feet were bare the scent that hung around her was light airy and guileless you arent what i expected thats nice what did you expect someone with a sharper edge i suppose a little jaded a little hungry dancers are always hungry she said with a half smile turning to grate cheese onto potatoes i decided youd asked me here for one of two reasons the first was to pump me for information about the finances of the play maddy chuckled putting a sliver of cheese on her tongue reed i have to worry about eight dance routines maybe ten if macke has his way six songs and lines i havent even counted yet ill leave the money matters to you and the producers what was the second reason to come on to me her brows lifted more in curiosity than shock reed watched her steadily his eyes dark and calm his smile cool and faintly amused a cynic maddy realized thinking it was a shame perhaps he had a reason to be that was more of a shame do women usually come on to you hed expected her to be embarrassed to be annoyed at the very least to laugh instead she looked at him with mild curiosity lets just pass over that one shall we i suppose they do she began to hunt for a kitchen fork to turn the steak with and i suppose youd resent it after a while i never had to deal with that sort of thing myself men always came on to my sister she found the fork squeaked open the oven door and flipped the steak over theres only one reed pointed out no ive got two sisters steak youre only cooking one steak yes i know its yours arent you eating oh sure but i never eat a lot of red meat she slammed the oven door again it dogs up the system i figured youd give me a couple bites of yours here she handed him the salad bowl take this over to the little table by the window were nearly ready it was good in fact it was excellent as hed watched her haphazard way of cooking reed had had his doubts the salad was a symphony of mixed greens in a spicy vinaigrette cheese and bacon were heaped on steaming potatoes and the steak was done precisely as he preferred the wine had a subtle bite maddy was still nursing her first glass she ate a fraction of what seemed normal to reed and seemed to relish every bite take some more steak he offered but she shook her head she did however take a second small bowl of salad it seems to me that anyone who has as physical a job as you do should eat more to compensate dancers are better off a little underweight mostly its a matter of eating the right things i really hate that she grinned taking a forkful of lettuce and alfalfa sprouts not that i hate the right kind of food i just love food period once in a while i splurge on thousands of calories but i always make sure its a kind of celebration what kind well say its rained for three days then the sun comes out thats good enough for chocolatechip cookies she poured herself another half glass of wine and filled his glass before she noticed his blank expression dont you like chocolatechip cookies ive never considered them celebrational youve never lived an abnormal life do you consider your life abnormal i dont thousands would she propped her elbows on the table and rested her chin in her hands food so often dreamed over could always be forgotten when the conversation was interesting whats your life like the fight from the window beside them was dying quickly what was left of it gleamed darkly in her hair her eyes which had seemed so open so easy now glowed like a cats tawny lazy watchful the neon was a foolish pink shimmer that curled into her name i dont know how to answer that well i can probably guess some of it you have an apartment probably overlooking the park she poked into the salad again still watching him ming vases dresden figures something of the sort you spend more time at your office than in your home conscientious about your work dedicated to the business any responsible secondgeneration tycoon would be you date very casually because you dont have the time or inclination for a relationship youd spend more time at the museum if you could manage it take in a foreign film now and then and prefer quiet french restaurants she wasnt laughing at him he decided but she was more amused than impressed annoyance crept into his eyes not because of her description but because shed read him so easily thats very clever im sorry she said with such quick sincerity that his annoyance vanished its a bad habit of mine sizing people up categorizing them id be furious with anyone who did it to me then she stopped and caught her bottom lip between her teeth how close was i it was difficult to resist her frank good humor close enough with a laugh she shook her head back so that her hair flared out then settled she brought her legs up into the lotus position is it all right to ask why youre backing a play about a stripper is it all right to ask why youre starring in a play about a stripper she beamed at him like a teacher reed thought whose student had answered a question with particular insight its a terrific play the trick to being sure of that is to look at the script without the songs and the dance numbers the music punctuates emphasizes exhilarates but even without it its a good story i like the way mary develops without having to change intrinsically shes had to be tough to survive but shes made the best of it she wants more and she goes after it because she deserves more the only glitch is that she really falls for this guy hes everything shes ever wanted in a material way but she really just plain loses her head over him after she does the money doesnt matter the position doesnt matter but she ends up with it all anyway i like that happy ever after dont you believe in happy endings a shutter clicked down over his expression quickly completely curiously in a play i should tell you about my sister the one the men came on to no my other sister would you like an éclair i bought you one and if you have it you could offer me a bite it would be rude for me to refuse damn it she was getting more appealing by the minute not his type not his speed not his style but he smiled at her id love an éclair maddy went into the kitchen rummaged noisily then came back with a fat chocolateiced pastry my sister abby she began married chuck rockwell the race driver do you know about him yes reed had never been an avid fan of auto racing but the name rang a bell he was killed a few years back their marriage hadnt been working abby really had been having a dreadful time she was raising her two children alone on this farm in virginia financially she was strapped emotionally she was drained a few months ago she authorized a biography of rockwell the writer came to the farm ready i think to gun abby down maddy continued placing the éclair on the table are you going to offer me a bite reed obligingly cut a piece of the pastry with his fork and offered it to her maddy let the crust and cream and icing lie on her tongue for a long decadent moment so what happened to your sister she married the writer six weeks ago when she smiled again her face simply lighted up just as emphatically as the pink neon happyeverafter doesnt just happen in plays what makes you think your sisters second marriage will work because this is the right one she leaned forward again her eyes on his my sisters and i are triplets we know each other inside out when abby married chuck i was sorry in my heart you see i knew it wasnt right that it could never be right because i know abby just as well as i know myself i could only hope it would work somehow when she married dylan it was such a different feeling like letting out a long breath and relaxing dylan crosby yes do you know him he did a book on richard bailey richards been signed with valentine records for twenty years i got to know dylan fairly well when he was doing his research small world yes it was full dusk now and the sky was deepening to purple but she didnt bother with lights the ballet student had long since stopped his practicing somewhere down the hall a baby could be heard wailing fitfully why do you live here here she gave him a blank look why not youve got attila the hun on the street corner screaming neighbors and she added prompting him you could move uptown what for i know this neighborhood ive been here for seven years its close to broadway handy to rehearsal halls and classes probably half the tenants in this building are gypsies i wouldnt be surprised no chorusline gypsies she laughed and began to toy with the leaf of the philodendron it was a nervous gesture she wouldnt have begun to recognize herself dancers who move from show to show hoping for that one big break i got it that doesnt mean im not still a gypsy she glanced back at him wondering why it should matter so much that he understand her you cant change what you are reed or at least you shouldnt he believed that and always had he was the son of edwin valentine one of the early movers and shakers in the record industry he was a product of success wealth and survival he was as maddy had said devoted to the business because it had been part of his life always he was impatient often ruthless a man who looked at the bottom line and the fine print before changing it to suit himself he had no business sitting in a darkening apartment with a woman with cats eyes and a wicked smile he had less business entertaining fantasies about what it would be like to remain until the moon began to rise youre killing that plant he murmured i know i always do she had to swallow and that surprised her something in the way hed been looking at her just now something in the tone of his voice the set of his body she could always be mistaken about a face but not about a body his was tensed and so was hers i keep buying them and keep killing them too much sun he hadnt meant to but brushed the back of her hand with his fingers and too much water its as easy to overlove as underlove i hadnt thought of that she was thinking about the tremors that were shooting up her arm down her spine your plants probably thrive with the perfect balance of attention she caught herself wondering if it was the same with his women then she rose because her system wasnt reacting as shed expected it to i can offer you tea but not coffee i dont have any no i have to go he didnt there were no schedules to be met no appointments to keep but he was a survivor and he knew when to back away i enjoyed the dinner maddy and the company she let out a long breath as if shed just come down from a very high leap im glad well do it again it was impulse it was usually impulse with maddy she didnt think about it twice with friendly warmth she put her hands on his shoulders and touched her tips to his the kiss lasted less than a second and vibrated like a hurricane he felt her lips smooth curved a bit in a smile he tasted the sweetness fleeting with a touch of spice her scent was there hovering light enough to tease when she moved back he heard her quick surprised intake of air and saw the same surprise reflected in her eyes what was that she thought what in gods name was that she was a woman who made a habit of light friendly kisses quick hugs casual touches none of them had ever rocked her like this she felt hints of everything shed ever imagined in that one brief contact and she wanted more because shed practiced selfdenial all her life it was easier to control the desire to touch the fire a second time im glad you came the tremor in her voice amazed her so am i it wasnt often he had to use restraint it wasnt often he had to deny himself anything in this case he knew he had to good night maddy good night she stood where she was while he let himself out then listening to her body she sat down better to think this one through she warned herself better to think long and hard then her gaze drifted over to the plant that was wilting and yellowing in the dark window strange she hadnt realized shed been in the dark herself for so long chapter three her muscles warmed her eyes dreamy maddy stretched at the barre with the line of dancers the instructor called out every position pile tendu attitude legs torsos arms responded in endless repetition morning class was repetition a continual reminder to the body that it could indeed do the unnatural and do it well time and time again without it that same body would simply revolt and refuse to strain itself refuse to turn the leg out from the hip as though it were on a ball hinge refuse to bend beyond what was ordinary refuse to stretch itself past natural goals it would in essence become normal it wasnt necessary to concentrate fully maddys body had builtin discipline builtin instinct that carried her through the warmup her mind floated away far enough to dream close enough to hear the calls grand plié her knees bent her body descended slowly until her crotch hovered over her heels muscles trembled then acquiesced she wondered if reed was already in his office though it was still shy of nine she thought he would be she imagined he would arrive as a matter of habit before his secretary before his assistant would he think of her at all attitude en avant her leg raised holding at a ninetydegree angle she continued to hold as the count dragged on he probably wouldnt maddy concluded his mind was so crowded with schedules and appointments that he wouldnt have time for a single wayward thought battement fondu she brought her foot under her supporting knee which bent in synchronization gradually slowly she straightened feeling the resistance using it he didnt have to think of her now later perhaps on his way home over a quiet drink his mind might drift to her she wanted to think so maddys serviceable gray leotard was damp when she moved onto the floor for center practice the exercises they had just practiced at the barre would be repeated again on signal she went into the fifth position and began one two three four two two three four it was raining outside maddy could watch the water stream down the small frosted windows as she bent stretched reached and held on command a warm rain she thought the air had been steamy and heavy when shed rushed to class that morning she hoped it wouldnt stop before she got out again there hadnt been much time for walking in the rain when shed been a child not that she regretted anything still she and her family had spent more time at rehearsals and in train stations than in parks and playgrounds her parents had brought the fun with them games riddles and stories such highflown ridiculous stories stories that were worlds in themselves when you were blessed with two irish parents who possessed fantastic imaginations the sky was the limit shed learned so much from them more than timing more than projection little formal education had seeped through but geography had been taught on the road seeing the mississippi had been more illuminating than reading about it english grammar literature had come through the books that her parents had loved and passed on practical math had been a matter of survival her education had been as unconventional as her recreation but she considered herself more wellrounded than most maddy hadnt missed the parks or playgrounds her childhood had been its own carousel but now as a woman she rarely missed a chance to walk in a warm summer rain walking in the rain wouldnt appeal to reed in fact maddy doubted it would even occur to him they were worlds apart by birth by choice by inclination her right foot slid into a chasse back forward to the side repeat repeat he would be logical sensible perhaps a bit ruthless you couldnt succeed in business otherwise no one would consider it logical to stretch your body into unnatural positions day after day no one would consider it sensible to throw yourself body and soul into the theater and subject yourself to the whims of the public if she was ruthless she was only ruthless in the demands she made on herself physically so why couldnt she stop thinking about him she couldnt stop wondering she couldnt stop remembering the way the dying sunlight had lingered on his hair darkening it deepening it or the way his eyes had stayed on hers direct intrigued and cynical was it foolish for an optimist to be attracted to a cynic of course it was but shed done more foolish things theyd shared one kiss and barely a kiss at that his arms hadnt come around her his lips hadnt pressed hungrily to hers yet shed relived that instant of contact again and again somehow she thought somehow she was sure he hadnt been unmoved however foolish it was she dredged up that quick flood of sensation and reexperienced it it added a fine sheen of heat to alreadywarmed skin her heartbeat already thudding rhythmically with the demands of the exercise increased in speed amazing she thought that the memory of a sensation could do so much launching into a series of pirouettes maddy brought the feeling back again and spun with it with her hair still dripping from the shower maddy pulled on a pair of patched bright yellow bib overalls the rehearsal hall showers themselves were ripe with the scents of splashon cologne and powdered talc a tall woman naked to the waist sat in the corner and worked a cramp out of her calf i really appreciate you telling me about this class wanda resplendent in jeans and a sweater as snug as skin tugged her own hair back into a semiorganized bun its tougher than the one i was taking and five dollars cheaper madame has a soft spot for gypsies maddy straddled a long bench bent over and began to aim a hand drier at the underside of her hair not everyone in your position is willing to share come on wanda it isnt all a big sisterhood sweetheart wanda jammed in a last pin and watched maddys reflection in the mirror even with the reddish hair curtaining her face wanda saw the faint frown of disagreement youre the lead and you cant tell me you dont feel newcomers breathing down your neck makes you work harder maddy shook back her hair too impatient to dry it whered you get those earrings wanda finished fastening on the fiercely red prisms which fell nearly to her shoulders a movement of her head sent them spinning both she and maddy silently approved the result a boutique in the village fiveseventyone maddy got up from the bench and stood with her head close to wandas she narrowed her eyes and imagined did they have them in blue probably you like gaudy i love gaudy trade you these for that sweatshirt youve got with the eyes all over it deal maddy said immediately ill bring it to rehearsal you look happy maddy smiled and rose on her toes to bring her ear closer to wandas i am happy i mean you look man happy with a lift of her brow maddy studied her own face in the mirror free of makeup her skin glowed with health her mouth was full and shaped well enough to do without paint it was a pity shed always thought that her lashes were rather light and stubby chantel had gotten darker longer ones man happy maddy repeated enjoying the phrase i did meet a man shows goodlooking wonderfullooking hes got incredible gray eyes really gray no green at all and a kind of cleft she touched her own chin lets talk body maddy let out a peal of laughter and hooked her arm around wandas shoulders friendships the best of them are often made quickly she thought good shoulders very trim he holds himself well id guess good muscle tone guess i havent seen him naked well honey whats your problem we only had dinner maddy was used to frank sexual talk a lot more used to the talk than to acting on it i think he was interested in sort of a detached way so youve got to make him interested in an attached way hes not a dancer is he no good wanda sent her earrings for a last spin then began to unfasten them dancers make lousy husbands i know well im not thinking of marrying him she began then widened her eyes were you married to a dancer five years ago we were in the chorus of pippin ended up getting married on opening night she handed the earrings over trouble was before the play dosed hed forgotten that the ring on my finger applied to him im sorry wanda it was a lesson she said with a shrug dont jump into something legal with a smoothtalking goodlooking man unless hes loaded she added is yours is my oh maddy pouted into the mirror i suppose then grab ahold if it doesnt work out you can dry your eyes with a nice fat settlement i dont think youre as cynical as youd like to appear maddy gave wandas shoulder a quick squeeze hurt bad it stung wanda found it odd that shed never admitted that to anyone but herself before lets just say i learned that marriage doesnt work unless two people play by the rules how about some breakfast no i cant she glanced down to where her drooping philodendron sat under the bench ive got to deliver something that wanda broke into a grin looks like it needs a decent burial it needs maddy corrected as she fastened on her new earrings the proper balance of attention he hadnt stopped thinking about her reed wasnt used to anything interfering with his schedule especially not a flighty eccentric woman with neon on her walls they didnt have a thing in common hed told himself that repeatedly the night before when he hadnt been able to sleep she had nothing to attract him unless you counted whiskeycolored eyes or a laugh that came out of nowhere and that could echo in your mind for hours he preferred women with classic tastes elegant manners the companions he chose wouldnt drive through maddys neighborhood with an armed guard much less live there they certainly wouldnt nibble at the meat on his plate the women he dated went to the theater they didnt act in it they certainly wouldnt allow a man to see them sweat why after a few very brief encounters with maddy ohurley was reed beginning to think the women hed dated were raging bores of course they werent reed began to study the sales figures in front of him again hed never dated a woman merely for her looks he wanted and sought intelligent conversation mutual interests humor style he might want to discuss the impressionist show at the metropolitan over dinner or the weather conditions in st moritz over brandy what he avoided studiously avoided was any woman connected with the entertainment field he respected entertainers admired them but kept them at arms length on a social level as head of valentine records he dealt constantly with singers musicians agents representatives valentine records wasnt just a business not as his father had seen it it was an organization that provided the best in music from bach to rock and prized the talent it had signed and developed reed had entertained musicians from childhood he considered himself understanding of their needs their ambitions their vulnerabilities in his free time he preferred the company of the less complicated the less driven his own ambitions were intense enough valentine records was at the top of the heap and would remain there he would see to that not only for his father but for himself if as it often happened he had to work ten hours a day for and with entertainers he needed a breather from them when the day was over but he couldnt stop thinking of maddy what made her tick reed pushed aside the sales figures and turned to look at his view of midtown the rain turned it all into a misty gray fantasy she didnt appear to have developed the protective shield that her profession seemed to require she was rising to the top like cream but didnt seem awed by it could she really be as basic and uncomplicated as she seemed why did he care hed eaten dinner with her one short simple dinner theyd had an interesting somewhat intimate conversation theyd shared a brief friendly kiss that had rocked him back on his heels so he was attracted he wasnt immune to bright vital looks or a firm compact body it was natural to be curious about the woman with her odd philosophies and dangling thought patterns if he wanted to see her again there was no harm in it and it was simple enough hed just pick up the phone and call her they could have dinner again on his terms before the evening was over hed discover what it was about her that nagged at him when his door opened reeds glance of annoyance turned into a warm smile few were ever treated to a little wet for golf clubs a tomb when it rains edwin valentine walked into the room with the long slow steps of a big man then dropped heavily into a chair besides i start to feel old if i dont make it in here every couple of weeks yeah you look feeble reed leaned back in his chair and studied his fathers ruddy strongfeatured face whats your handicap these days four edwin grinned pleased as a boy all in the wrist got wind youve all but signed libby barlow away from galloway records cautious always cautious reed merely inclined his head it looks that way edwin nodded the office had been his for nearly twenty years the decisions had been his then still he didnt feel any twinge of regret any twist of envy at seeing his son behind the desk that was what hed worked for great set of pipes on that little lady id like to see dorsey produce her first album with us reeds lips curved slightly his fathers instincts were as always bullseye its been discussed i still think you should have an office here he held up a hand before his father could speak i dont mean you should tie yourself down to regular hours again never had regular hours in my life edwin put in well irregular hours then i do think valentine records should have edwin valentine it has you edwin folded his hands and the look he gave his son was direct and calm more much more passed between them than the words not that i dont think you could use some advice from the old man now and again however youre at the helm now the ships holding steady i wouldnt let you down edwin recognized the intensity in his sons voice and understood a portion of the passion behind it im aware of that reed i dont have to tell you that of all the things that have touched my life nothings made me prouder than you emotion rippled through him gratitude love dad before he could finish or even properly begin his secretary wheeled in a tray of coffee and sweet rolls by damn hannah youre as sharp as ever so are you mr valentine looks like youve dropped a pound or two she fixed his coffee the way he preferred it the flash of a wink she sent reed was too quick to measure shed been with the company twelve years and was the only person on staff who would have dared the cheeky look you witch hannah ive gained five edwin heaped two rolls on his plate anyway you wear it well mr valentine you have a meeting at eleventhirty with mackenzie in sates she set another cup on reeds desk would you like for me to reschedule not on my account edwin put in quickly reed glanced at his watch and calculated the next thirtyfive minutes ill see him at eleventhirty hannah thank you hell of a woman edwin said with a full mouth as the door shut behind hannah smart move taking her on as your secretary when i retired i dont think valentine records could run without hannah reed glanced at the raindrenched window again thinking of another woman whats on your mind reed hmm bringing himself back to the conversation reed picked up his coffee the sates figures look good i think youll be pleased with the results at the end of the fiscal year edwin didnt doubt that reed was a product of his mind of his heart only rarely did it concern him that hed molded his son a little too closely after himself doesnt look to me like youve got sales figures on the brain reed nodded deciding to answer the question while evading it ive been giving a lot of thought to the play were backing edwin smiled a little still nervous about my hunch there no he could answer that honestly enough now ive had several meetings with the producer and the director ive even looked in on a couple of rehearsals my guess is that the play itself will hit big the score more our concern really is wonderful what were working on now is promotion and marketing for the cast album if you wouldnt mind i might like to squirrel my way in on that end a bit you know you dont have to ask i do edwin corrected youre in charge reed i didnt step down figuratively but literally as it happens though this is a pet project of mine ive got a bit of personal interest youve never explained why you do edwin smiled a bit and broke off a corner of his second roll goes back awhile a long while have you met maddy ohurley yet reeds brows drew together did his father read him that well as a matter of fact when the buzzer sounded on his desk he accepted the interruption without heat yes hannah im sorry to disturb you mr valentine but theres a young woman out here hannah could be tough as nails but she found herself smiling at the drenched figure in front of her she says she has something to deliver to you take it will you hannah she prefers to give it to you personally her name is ah maddy reed paused on the brink of refusal maddy send her in hannah dripping rain and carrying her dance bag and her dying plant maddy rushed into the office im sorry to bother you reed its just that ive been thinking and i decided you should have this before i murder it i always get these spasms of guilt when i kill another plant and i figured you could spare me edwin rose as she passed his chair and she broke off her tumbling explanation hello she sent him an easy smile and tried to ignore the sweet rolls on the tray im interrupting but its really a matter of life and death she set the wet wilting plant on his spotless oak desk dont tell me if it dies okay but if it survives you let me know thanks with a last flashing grin she started to leave maddy now that shed given him a moment to speak reed rose as well id like you to meet my father edwin valentine maddy ohurley oh maddy started to offer her hand then dropped it again im soaked she explained smiling instead its nice to meet you delighted edwin beamed at her have a seat oh i cant really im wet a little water never hurt good leather before she could protest edwin took her arm and led her to one of the wide biscuitcolored chairs beside the desk ive admired you onstage thank you it didnt occur to her to be awed though she was sitting almost toetotoe with one of the richest and most influential men in the country she found his wide ruddy face appealing and though she looked she couldnt find a single resemblance to his son reed brought her gaze back to his would you like some coffee maddy no he didnt resemble his father reed was sharpfeatured and lean hungry maddy found her blood moving just a bit faster i dont drink coffee anymore if you had any tea with honey id love a cup have a roll edwin said when he saw her give them a quick wistful look im going to miss lunch she told him easily i guess i could use a little sugar in the bloodstream she smiled at him as she chose one that dripped with frosting if she was going to sin she preferred to sin well weve all been wondering if youd come by rehearsals mr valentine ive given it some thought reed and i were just talking about the play hes of the opinion its going to be a hit what do you think i think its bad luck for me to say so until we try it out in philadelphia she took a bite of the roll and could almost feel her energy level rise i can say that the dance numbers should knock them back in the aisles she looked gratefully at hannah as the secretary brought in her tea were working on one this afternoon that should bring down the house if it doesnt ill have to go back to waiting tables i trust your judgment edwin reached over to pat her hand to my way of thinking if an ohurley doesnt know when a dance number works no one does at her puzzled smile he leaned back i knew your parents you did her face lighted with pleasure the roll forgotten i dont remember either of them talking about it a long time ago he sent reed a quick glance as if in explanation and continued i was just getting started hustling talent hustling money i met your parents right here in new york i was on the down end right then scrambling for pennies and backers they let me sleep on a cot in their hotel room ive never forgotten maddy sent a meaningful glance around the office well you scrambled enough pennies mr valentine he laughed urging more rolls on her i always wanted to pay them back you know told them i would that was a good twentyfive years ago you and your sisters were still in booties i do believe i helped your mother change your diaper she grinned at him it was very difficult to tell chantel abby and me apart even from that angle you had a brother he remembered a pistol he still is sang like an angel i told your father id sign him up once i got myself going by the time i did and managed to find your family again your brother was gone to pops continued lamentations trace decided against a life on the road or at least he opted to follow a different road you and your sisters had a group maddy was never sure whether to wince or laugh at the memory the ohurley triplets i was going to offer you a contract he said and watched her eyes widen absolutely about that time your sister abby got married a record contract more a contract with valentine records maddy thought back to those times and imagined the awe that would have accompanied such an announcement did pop know wed talked lord she shook her head it must have killed him to see that slip through his fingers but he never said a word chantel and i finished out the bookings after abby married then she went west and i went east poor pop id say youve given him plenty to be proud of youre a nice man mr valentine is backing the play a kind of repayment for a night on a cot a repayment thats going to make my company a lot of money id like to see your parents again maddy ill see what i can do she rose then knowing she was pushing her luck if she wanted to get back across town on time to rehearsals i didnt mean to take up your visit with your father reed dont apologize as he stood he continued to watch her as he had been for the entire visit it was enlightening she studied him then he looked so right there behind the desk in front of the window in an office with oil paintings and leather chairs we mentioned small worlds once before her hair was dripping down her back ridiculous red glass triangles dangled from her ears looking somehow valiant the yellow bib overalls and the bright blue tshirt seemed the only spots of color on a gloomy day yes we did youll take the plant wont you he glanced at it it was pitiful ill do what i can but i cant promise a thing promises make me nervous anyway if you take them you have to make them she took a deep breath knowing she should go but not quite able to break away your office is just how i pictured organized elegance it suits you thanks for the tea he wanted to touch her it amazed him that he had to fight an urge to walk around the desk and put his hands on her anytime how about friday she blurted out friday im free on friday now that shed done it maddy decided not to regret it im free on friday she repeated after rehearsal i could meet you he nearly shook his head he had no idea what was on his calendar he had no idea what to say to a woman who took a casual statement as gospel he had no idea why he was glad she had where she smiled at him so that every part of her face moved with it rockefeller center seven oclock im going to be late she turned and held out her hands to edwin im so glad you were here in her easy way she leaned down to kiss his cheek goodbye goodbye maddy edwin waited until shed dashed out before turning back to his son it wasnt often edwin saw that dazed look on reeds face a man runs into a hurricane like that he better strap himself down or enjoy the ride edwin grinned and took the last roll damned if i wouldnt enjoy the ride chapter four reed wondered if she was playing tricks with his mind maddy ohurley didnt look like most peoples idea of a witch but that was certainly the most reasonable explanation for the fact that he was loitering around rockefeller center at seven on a humid friday evening he should have been home by now enjoying a quiet dinner before diving into the mass of paperwork he carried in his briefcase traffic streamed along fifth badtempered from heat and noise those lucky enough to have a place to go and the time to spare were heading out of town hoping the heat wave would ease by monday pedestrians hurried by ties loose shirts wilting looking like desert nomads in search of an oasis an airconditioned lounge and a long cold drink he watched without interest as a few children their eyes shrewd enough to mark outoftowners tried to push stiff red carnations for a dollar each they did a fair trade but not one of them bothered to approach reed he looked neither generous nor naive though he caught snippets of conversation as people shuffled past he didnt bother to wonder about them he was too busy wondering about himself why had he agreed to meet her the answer to that was obvious enough hed wanted to see her there was no use picking at that bone again she aroused his curiosity reed decided unable to find a better term a woman like her was bound to arouse anyones curiosity she was successful yet she shrugged off the trappings of success she was attractive though she rarely played on her looks her eyes were honest if you were the type who trusted such things yes maddy was a curiosity but why in hell hadnt he been able to pull his thoughts together and suggest some place more suitable at least a group of teenage girls streamed past giggling reed sidestepped in lieu of being mowed down one of them glanced back at him attracted by the aloof expression and lean body she put her hand over her mouth and whispered urgently to her companion there was another round of laughter and then they were lost in the crowd a sidewalk vendor hawked icecream bars and did a thriving business with a pack of office workers who hadnt escaped the heat of the city for the weekend a panhandler milled through the crowd and was far less successful reed brushed off a scalper who promised the last two tickets for the evening show down the street at radio city then watched him pounce on an elderly pair of tourists a block away a siren began to scream no one even bothered to look reed felt perspiration trickle down his collar and ease down his back his watch showed his temper was on its last notch when he saw her why did she look different he wondered from the dozens of people churning around her her hair and clothes were bright but there were others dressed more vividly she walked with a relaxed sort of grace but not slowly it seemed she did nothing slowly yet there was an air of ease about her reed knew that if he bothered to look he could find five women in that many minutes who had more beauty but his eyes were fixed on her and so was his mind sidetracked by the panhandler maddy stood near the curb and dug into her purse she pulled out some change exchanged what appeared to be a few friendly words then slid through the crowd she spotted reed a moment later and quickened her pace im sorry im always apologizing for being late i missed my bus but i thought id be better off going home and changing after rehearsal because youd probably be wearing a suit she looked him over with a bright satisfied smile and i was right shed traded the overalls for a fullskirted dress in a rainbow of colors that made her appear to be the gypsy she claimed she was everyone on the sidewalk seemed to fade to gray beside her you might have taken a cab he murmured keeping that short but vital distance between them ive never gotten in the habit ill spring for dinner and make up for it she hooked her arm through his with such quick easy camaraderie that his normal hesitancy toward personal contact never had a chance i bet youre starving after standing around waiting for me im starving and i didnt she shifted her body to avoid a collision with a woman in a hurry theres a great pizza place just down he cut her off as he drew her through the crowd ill buy and we can do better than pizza maddy was impressed when he caught a cab on the first try and she didnt argue when he gave the driver an upscale address off park avenue i suppose i can switch gears from pizza she said always willing to be surprised by the way i like your father i can tell you the feeling was mutual maddy didnt blink when the cab was cut off at a light and the driver began to mutter what might have been curses in what might have been arabic isnt it odd about him knowing my parents my pop loves to drop names until they bounce off the walls especially if hes never met the person but he never mentioned your father reed wondered if her scent would linger in the stale steamy air of the cab after they left he thought somehow it would perhaps he forgot maddy gave a quick chuckling snort not likely once pop met the niece of the wife of a man whose brother had worked as an extra on singin in the rain he never forgot that it does seem odd that your father would remember though or that it would matter one night on a cot in a hotel room it had seemed unlikely to reed as well edwin met hundreds and hundreds of people why should he remember so clearly a pair of traveling entertainers who had given him a bed one night i can only guess that your parents made an impression on him reed answered thinking aloud they are pretty great sos this she added as the cab pulled up in front of an elegantly understated french restaurant i dont get up this way very often why everything i needs basically concentrated in one area she would have slid from the cab on the street side if reed hadnt taken her hand and pulled her out with him onto the curb i dont have time to date often and when i do its usually with men whose french is limited to ballet positions she stopped herself when reed opened the door for her that was a remarkably unchic thing to say wasnt it they stepped inside where it was cool softly scented and quietly pastel yes but somehow i dont think you worry about being chic ill figure out whether that was a compliment or an insult later maddy decided insults make me cranky and i dont want to spoil my dinner ah monsieur valentine jeanpaul reed nodded to the maitre d i didnt make a reservation i hope you have room for us for you of course he cast a quick professional look at maddy not the monsieurs usual type jeanpaul decided but appealing all the same please follow me maddy followed wondering what kind of juggling act the maitre d would have to perform she didnt doubt that reed would make it worth his while it was precisely the sort of restaurant maddy had thought he would patronize a bit staid but very elegant quietly chic without being trendy floral pastels on the walls and subdued lighting lent an air of relaxation the scent of spice was subtle maddy took her seat at the corner table and glanced with frank curiosity at the other patrons so much polish in one small place she mused but that was part of the charm of new york trash or glitz you only had to turn a corner champagne mr valentine maddy reed inclined his head holding the wine list but leaving the decision to her she gave the maitre d a smile that made his opinion of her rise several notches its always difficult to say no to champagne thank you jeanpaul reed said handing back the list after making his selection this is nice maddy turned from her study of the other diners to smile at reed i really hadnt expected anything like this what did you expect thats why i like seeing you i never know what to expect i wondered if youd come by rehearsals again he didnt want to admit that hed wanted to had had to discipline himself to stay away from something that wasnt his field its not necessary i have nothing creative to contribute to the play itself our concern is the score she gave him a solemn look i see slowly she traced a pattern on the linen cloth valentine records need the play to be a hit in order to get a return on its investment and a hit play sells more albums naturally but we feel the plays in good hands well that should be a comfort to me but she had to drum up enthusiasm when the champagne arrived because rituals amused her maddy watched the procedure the display of the label the quick precise opening resulting in a muffled pop the tasting and approval the wine was poured in fluted glasses and she watched the bubbles rise frantically from bottom to top i suppose we should drink to philadelphia she was smiling again when she lifted her glass to his philadelphia opening there often tells the tale she touched her glass to his then sipped slowly she would limit her intake of wine just as religiously as she limited her intake of everything else but shed enjoy every bit of it wonderful the last time i had champagne was at a party they threw for me when i left suzannas park but it wasnt nearly this good why did you did i what leave the play before she answered she sipped again wine was so pretty in candlelight she mused it was a pity people stopped noticing things like that when they could have wine whenever they liked id given the part everything i could and gotten everything i could out of it she shrugged it was time to move on i have restless feet reed they dance to the piper you dont look for security with my background security doesnt come high on the list you find it first in yourself anyway he knew about restlessness about women who moved from one place to the next never quite finding satisfaction some might say you bored easily something in his tone put her on guard but she had no way of answering except with honesty im never bored how could i be theres too much to enjoy so you dont consider it a matter of losing interest without knowing why she felt he was testing her somehow or was he testing himself i cant think of anything ive ever lost interest in no thats not true there was this calicocat pillow an enormous expensive one i thought i was crazy about it then i bought it and got it home and decided it was awful but thats not what you mean is it no reed studied her as he drank its not its more a matter of different outlooks she ran a finger around the rim of her glass a man like you structures his own routine then has to live up to it every day because dozens of people are depending on you a great deal of my life is structured for me simply to keep me on level ground the rest has to change fluctuate constantly or i lose the edge you should understand that you work with entertainers his lips curved as he lifted his glass i certainly do they amuse you in some ways he admitted easily enough in others they frustrate me but that doesnt mean i dont admire them while knowing theyre all a little mad it took only an instant for the humor to spread from his mouth to his eyes absolutely i like you reed she put her hand over his friend to friend its a pity you dont have more illusions he didnt ask her what she meant he wasnt certain he wanted to know conversation stopped when the waiter arrived with menus and a list of specials delivered in a rolling french accent maddy decided was genuine this is a problem maddy muttered when they were alone again reed glanced up from his menu you dont like french food are you kidding she grinned at him i love it i love italian food armenian food east indian food thats the problem you suggested pizza he reminded her its hard to believe youre worried about calories i was only going to have one piece and inhale the rest she caught her bottom lip between her teeth and knew she could have eaten anything on the menu i have two choices i can order just a salad and deny myself or i can say this is a celebration and shoot the works i can recommend the cotelettes de saumon she lifted her gaze from the menu again to study him very seriously you can highly reed im a grown woman and independent by nature when it comes to food however i often have the appetite of a twelveyearold in a bakery im going to put myself in your hands she closed the menu and set it aside with the stipulation that you understand i can only eat this way once or twice a year unless i want to bounce around stage like a meatball understood he decided for reasons he didnt delve into to give her the meal of her life he wasnt disappointed her unabashed appreciation for everything put in front of her was novel and somehow compelling she ate slowly with a dark sensual enjoyment reed had forgotten could be found in food she tasted everything and finished nothing and it was clear that the underlying discipline was always there despite her sumptuous appreciation she teased herself with flavors as other women might tease themselves with men she closed her eyes over a bite of fish and gave herself to the pleasure of it as others gave themselves to the pleasures of lovemaking champagne bubbles exploded in their glasses and the scents rising up were rich oh this is wonderful taste wanting to share her pleasure she held her fork out to him his body tightened surprising him he had been aroused just by watching her but he discovered in that instant that what he really wanted was to sample her slowly as she sampled the tastes and textures on her plate he opened his mouth and allowed himself to be fed as he savored the bite he watched her eyes and saw they were aware mixed with that awareness was a curiosity that became intensely erotic its very good she knew she was getting in over her head and she wondered why the feeling was so alluring dancers think about food too much i suppose its because we watch so much of it pass us by you said once that dancers are always hungry he wasnt speaking of food now to give herself a moment maddy picked up her glass and sipped we make a choice usually in childhood we give up football games tv parties and go to class instead it carries over into adulthood how much do you sacrifice whatever it takes and its worth it yes she smiled more comfortable now that she could feel her body pull away from that trembling edge of tension even at its worst its worth it he leaned back just enough to distance himself from her she sensed it and wondered whether he had felt the same intensity between them what does success mean to you when i was sixteen it meant broadway she looked around the quiet restaurant and nearly sighed in some ways it still does then you have it he didnt understand nor did she expect him to i feel successful because i tell myself the shows going to be a smash i dont let myself think it might flop you wear blinders then oh no rosecolored glasses but never blinders youre a realist i suppose i like that in you because its so different from what i am i like to pretend you cant run a business on illusions and your personal life that either interested she leaned forward why not because you can only make things work your way if you know whats real and whats not i like to think you can make things real valentine reeds considering frown lingered as he glanced up at a tall lanky man in a peach jacket and a melon tie selby how are you fine just fine the man sent maddy a long look it looks like im interrupting and i hate to use a tired line but have we met before no maddy extended her hand with the easy friendship she showed everyone maddy ohurley allen selby maddy ohurley selby cut into reeds introduction and squeezed maddys hand this is a pleasure i saw suzannas park twice she didnt like the feel of his hand but she always hated herself when she made snap judgments then its my pleasure id heard valentine was dipping into broadway reed word gets around reed poured the last of the wine into maddys glass allen is the head of galloway records friendly competitors selby assured her and maddy got the distinct impression that hed cut reeds professional throat at the first opportunity have you ever considered a solo album maddy she toyed with the stem of her glass its a difficult thing to admit to a record producer but singings not my strong point if reed doesnt convince you differently come see me he laid a hand on reeds shoulder as he spoke no she didnt like those hands she thought again it couldnt be helped maddy noticed that reeds eyes frosted over but he merely picked up his glass wish i could join you for some coffee selby went on ignoring the fact he hadnt been asked but im meeting a client for dinner give my best to your old man reed think about that album now he winked at maddy then sauntered off to his own table maddy waited a beat then finished off the rest of her wine do most record producers dress like theyre part of a fruit salad reed stared at her a moment seeing the bland curious smile the tension dissolved into laughter selbys one of a kind she took his hand again delighted to have made him laugh so are you do i need time to decide if that was a compliment or an insult a definite compliment she glanced over to where selby was signaling a waiter you dont like him he didnt pretend not to understand who she was referring to were business rivals no maddy said with a shake of her head you dont like him personally that interested him because he had a wellearned reputation for concealing his emotions why do you say that because your eyes iced over involuntarily she shivered id hate to be looked at that way anyway you wont gossip and youre annoyed that hes here so why dont we go when they walked outside again the heat of the day had eased traffic had thinned hooking her arm through his maddy breathed in the rough night air that was new york can we walk awhile its too nice to jump right into a cab they strolled down the sidewalk past dark store windows and closed shops selby had a point you know with the right material you could make a very solid album she shrugged that had never been part of her dream though she wouldnt completely dismiss it maybe someday but i think streisand can steep easy you never see enough stars she murmured looking up as they walked on nights like this i envy abby and her farm in the country difficult to sit on the porch swing and make the eightoclock curtain exactly still i keep planning to take this wonderful vacation some day a cruise on the south seas where the steward brings you iced tea while you watch the moon hovering over the water or a cabin in the woods oregon maybe where you can lie in bed in the morning and listen to the birds wake up trouble is how would i make it to dance class she laughed at herself and moved closer what do you do when you have time off reed it had been two years since hed taken anything more than a long weekend off and even those were few and far between it had been two years since hed taken over valentine records we have a house in st thomas you can sit on the balcony and forget there is a manhattan it must be wonderful one of those big rambling places pinkandwhite stucco with a garden full of flowers most people only see in pictures but youd have phones a man like you would never really cut himself off everyone pays a price she knew that very well every time she placed her hand on the barre oh look she stopped by a window and looked in at an icyblue negligee that swept the mannequins feet and left the shoulders bare but for ivory lace thats chantel reed studied the faceless mannequin is it the negligee its chantel cool and sexy she was born to wear things like that and shes the first one to say so maddy laughed and stepped back to make a note of the name of the shop ill have to send it to her our birthdays in a couple of months chantel ohurley reed shook his head strange i never put it together shes your sister not so strange were not a great deal alike on the surface cool and sexy reed thought again that was precisely chantels image as a symbol of hollywood glamour the woman beside him would never be termed cool and her sexuality wasnt glamorous but tangible dangerously so being a triplet must be a very unique sensation its hard for me to say since ive always been one they began to walk again but its special youre never really alone you know i think that was part of the reason i had enough courage to come to new york and risk it all i always had chantel and abby even when they were hundreds of miles away you miss them oh yes i miss them dreadfully sometimes and mom and pop and trace we were so close growing up living in each others pockets working together yelling at each other she chuckled when he glanced down at her its not so odd you know everyone needs someone they can yell at now and then when trace left it was like losing an arm at first pop never really got over it then abby left and chantel and i i never thought how hard it was on my parents because they had each other you must be close to your parents he closed up then instantly she thought she could feel the frost settle over the heat theres only my father im sorry she never deliberately opened old wounds but innate curiosity often led her to them ive never lost anyone close to me but i can imagine how hard it would be my mothers not dead he didnt accept sympathy he detested it questions sprang into her head but she didnt ask them your fathers a wonderful man i could tell right away he has such kind eyes i always loved that about my own father the way his eyes would say trust me and you knew you could my mother ran away with him you know it always seemed so romantic she was seventeen and had already been working clubs for years my father came through town and promised her the moon on a silver platter i dont think she ever believed him but she went with him when we were little my sisters and i used to talk about the day a man would come and offer us the moon is that what you want the moon she laughed again and the sound of it trailed down the sidewalk of course and the stars i might even take the man he stopped then just outside the beam of a streetlight to look down at her any man whod give it to you no her heart began to thud slowly at first then faster until she felt it in her throat a man whod offer it a dreamer he combed his hand through her hair the way hed wanted to though hed told himself he wouldnt it spread like silk through his fingers like you if you stop dreaming you stop living he shook his head moving it closer to hers i stopped a long time ago his lips touched hers briefly as they had once before im still alive she put a hand on his chest not to keep him away but to keep him close why did you stop i prefer reality this time when his mouth came to hers it wasnt hesitant he gathered and took what hed wanted for days her lips were warm against his exotic in flavor tempting in their very willingness to merge with his her hand pressed against the back of his neck drawing him nearer eagerly accepting the next stage of pleasure as their tongues met and tangled the streetlight washed the sidewalk beside them and the buildings blocked out most of the sky they were alone though traffic shuttled by on the street his fingers spread against her back bringing enough pressure to align her body with his hard and firm the scent she wore made the musky smell of the city disappear so there was only her trapped in his arms she was already soaring up so that in a moment she could touch the chilled white surface of the moon and learn its secrets she hadnt expected to be breathless but she swayed against him with a helplessness neither of them could comprehend he tasted of power and ruthlessness her instinct for survival should have had her turning away from it even scorning it yet she remained as she was wound around him in the warm evening air the hand at the back of his neck stroked to soothe a tension she sensed intuitively he knew better from the first moment hed seen her reed had known better but hed continued to take steps toward her rather than away he was no good for her and she could only mean catastrophe for him there would be no casually complementary relationship here but something that would draw you farther and farther into a slowly burning fire he could taste it the frank surrender that was seduction he could hear it in her quiet sigh of acceptance with her body hugged tightly against his he could feel the need expand beyond what should what must be controlled he didnt want it yet he wanted her more than hed wanted anything that had come into his life before he drew away then before he could stop himself he framed her face in his hands to kiss her again he wanted to be sated by her done with her but the more he took the more he wanted a woman like this could destroy a man since childhood his life had been based on the premise that he would never allow a woman to be important enough to hurt him maddy was no different he told himself as he all but drowned in her she couldnt be when he drew away again maddys legs were rubber she had no flip remark no easy smile she could only look into his eyes and what she saw wasnt passion now wasnt desire it was anger she had no answer for it ill take you home he told her just a minute she needed to catch her breath needed to feel firm ground under her feet again he released her and she stepped to the street lamp and rested a hand on the solid metal surface light washed white over her and left him in shadow i get the feeling that youre annoyed at what happened he didnt respond when she studied him she saw that his eyes could be colder than stone it made her hurt as much for him as for herself since im not im left feeling like a fool tears came to her easily as easily as laughter but she wouldnt shed them now shed inherited a good deal of pride as well as quick emotions from her parents id just as soon see myself home thanks i said id take you inner strength came back it might have been the underlying fury in his voice that did it im a big girl reed ive been responsible for myself a long time see you around maddy walked to the corner and lifted a hand fate took pity on her and sent a cab steering toward the curb she got in without looking back he stood there until he saw her get safely inside then he stood there longer hed done them both a favor that was what he told himself he continued to tell himself that over and over as he remembered how soft and fragile shed looked in the bright glow of the streetlight turning away he began to walk it was late before he headed for home chapter five maddy stood stage left and took her cue from wanda there was no audience but the theater was far from empty the rest of the dancers were positioned across the stage and macke stood at the front ready to dissect every move in addition there were the stage manager the lighting director their assistants the accompanist with the composer standing nervously close by along with several technicians and the one who would make it all work the director listen honey wanda began in character as maureen core a fellow stripper this guys a pipe dream youre asking for trouble hes an answer maddy shot back and crossed to an imaginary bar on the empty stage she poured herself an invisible drink tossed it back and grinned hes the ticket ive been standing in line for all of my life get it in diamonds babe wanda walked toward her running her fingers up her arm as if she were enjoying the sensuous feel of a diamond bracelet and put them in a nice dark safe deposit box cause when he finds out what you are hes going to be gone before you can shake your hes not going to find out maddy told her hes never going to find out you think a class act like him is ever going to find his way to a dump like this she cast a disdainful look around the empty stage i tell you maureen ive got a chance for the first time in my life ive got a chance the accompanist gave her her intro and maddys mind went blank maddy the director known more for his skill than his patience snapped her back she swore with the ripe expertise she reserved solely for foul ups on stage sorry don youre only giving me about fifty percent maddy i need a hundred and ten youll get it she rubbed at the tension in her neck give me a minute first will you five he said clipping off the word so that the dancers shifted uneasily before they dispersed maddy walked off stage left and dropped down on a box in the wings problem wanda sat down beside her casting a look around designed to keep anyone else at a safe distance i hate to mess up i make it a policy to keep my nose out of other peoples business but theres always a but youve been walking around on three cylinders for about a week id say youre due for a tuneup she couldnt deny it she didnt try to instead she set her jaw on her hand why are men such jerks wanda considered a moment same reason the skys blue honey they were made that way another time she might have laughed now she only nodded grimly i guess its smarter just to leave them alone a hell of a lot smarter wanda agreed not much fun but smarter your guy giving you trouble hes not my guy maddy sighed and frowned down at her shoe but hes giving me trouble what do you do when a man kisses you as though hed like to nibble away at you for the next twenty years then brushes you aside as though you were never really there in the first place wanda cupped a hand around her instep then brought her leg up to keep the muscles umber well you can forget him or you can give him another chance to nibble until hes hooked i dont want to hook anybody maddy mumbled but you are wanda put in stretching the other leg hooked and dangling i know misery was something completely foreign to her she tried to shake it off but it clung the problem is i think he knows too and he doesnt want any part of it maybe you should think about what you want first yeah but first you have to know what that is is it him maddy gave a sulky shrug and hated herself for being petulant it might be take a lesson from mary on this one wanda gave her advice as she rose into a pile go after whats good for you it sounded so easy maddy knew better than most how it was to get to what was good for you you know the problem with being a dancer wanda two members of the chorus currently in the midst of a blistering affair began to argue with low steady malice wanda eavesdropped without a qualm i can name a couple hundred but go ahead you never have time to learn how to be just a person when other girls were out snuggling at the drivein with their boyfriends we were sleeping so we could get up and go to class the next morning i dont know what to do about him get in his way get in his way thats right get in his way enough and hell end up doing it to himself laughing maddy took her own chin in her hand does this look irresistible never know unless you try maddys fingers stroked down her chin then she dropped her hand youre right she stood then nodding youre absolutely right lets go i think im ready to give don a hundred and ten percent they ran through the dialogue again but this time maddy used her own nerves to give an edge to her character when the accompanist cued her for the song she poured herself into it part of the staging called for her to go toetotoe with wanda when she did the others dancers eyes glittered with a combination of appreciation and approval that had maddys adrenaline soaring higher she was all over the stage during the chorus interacting with the other dancers moving so quickly that the intense control she kept on her breathing went unnoticed she whirled to stage center threw out her arms selling it as her father had shown her years before and let the last note ring out someone threw her a towel they went over the scene again and again sharpening making a few changes in the blocking the lighting director and the stage manager went into a huddle and then they went through it again satisfied for the moment they walked through the next scene maddy took a break downed a pint of orange juice and a carton of yogurt then went back for more it was twilight when she left the theater a group of dancers were going to a local restaurant to unwind and recharge normally maddy would have tagged along content to remain in their company tonight she felt she had two choices she could go home and collapse in a hot tub or she could get in reeds way going home was smarter the last runthrough had drained her store of energy in any case a woman who pursued an uninterested man or a man who pursued an unwilling woman showed a remarkable lack of good sense there were plenty of other people people who had her own interests and ambitions who would make less complicated companions it wasnt as though men looked at her and ran in the other direction she was well liked by most she was usually appreciated for what she was and if she really wanted to she could find an easy dinner partner and while away an enjoyable evening she went to five phone booths before she found one with its phone book still attached just checking she told herself as she looked up reeds name it never hurt to check more than likely he lived way uptown shed just have to forgo her impulsive visit until she wasnt so tired her heart sank just a little when she found his address he lived uptown all right central park west there were nearly fifty blocks between them fifty blocks that meant a great deal more than linear distance when she closed the phone book it didnt occur to her that she could have lived there as well she couldnt live there because she didnt understand central park west she understood the village she understood soho she understood the lower forties and the theater district she and reed had nothing in common and it was foolish to think otherwise she began to walk telling herself that she was going home getting into the tub climbing into bed with a book she reminded herself that shed never wanted a man in her life anyway they expected things they complicated things she had dozens of dance routines filed in her head there wasnt enough room left to let her think about a relationship maddy went down into the subway merging with the crowd after a search she unearthed a token from the bottom of her bag still lecturing herself she went through the turnstile that would take her to the uptown train it would have been smarter to call first maddy decided as she stood on the sidewalk in front of the tall intimidating building where reed made his home he might not be there she paced down the sidewalk and back again worse he might be there but not alone a woman in raw silk slacks strolled by with a pair of poodles and never gave maddy a glance that was what this neighborhood was she thought silk slacks and poodles she was a mongrel in denim she glanced down at her own roomy jeans and worn sneakers at least she should have had the foresight to go home and change first listen to yourself maddy ordered youre standing here complaining about clothes thats chantels line its never been yours besides theyre good enough for you theyre good enough for the people you know if theyre not good enough for reed valentine what are you doing here i dont know she mused im an idiot no argument there taking a deep breath she walked forward through the wide glass doors into the quiet marblefloored lobby shed been an actress for years maddy put on an easy smile tossed back her hair then strolled over to the uniformed man behind the oak counter hello is reed in reed valentine im sorry miss he hasnt come in yet this evening oh she struggled not to let the depth of her disappointment show well i just dropped by id be happy to take a message miss when he looked at her really looked his eyes widened youre maddy ohurley she blinked it was a very rare thing for her to be recognized outside the theater maddy knew better than anyone how different she appeared onstage yes she offered her hand automatically how do you do oh what a pleasure this is the man not much taller than she and twice as wide took her hand in both of his when my wife wanted a treat for our anniversary the kids got us two tickets for suzannas park orchestra seats too what an evening we had thats lovely maddy glanced at his name tag you must have wonderful children johnny theyre good sports all six of them he grinned at maddy showing one gold tooth miss ohurley i cant tell you how much we enjoyed watching you my wife said it was like watching a sunrise thank you compliments like that one made the years of classes the days and weeks of rehearsals the cramped muscles worthwhile thank you very much you know that part lord my wife cried buckets when you think peters gotten on the train you think hes gone and all the lights come down with just that pale pale blue one on you and you sing ah he cleared his throat how can he go he began in a shaky baritone with my love wrapped around him how can he go maddy continued in a strong vibrant contralto with my heart in his hand i only know that i gave him a choice and he didnt choose me thats the one johnny shook his head and sighed i have to admit it brought a tear to my eye too im in a new musical thats scheduled to open in about six weeks are you now he beamed at her like a proud father we wont miss it i promise you maddy took a pencil from the counter and scrawled the name of the theater and the assistant stage manager on a pad you call this number ask for fred here and give my name ill see to it that you have two tickets for opening night opening night his look of astonished pleasure was enough to warm maddy all over my wifes not going to believe me i dont know how to thank you miss ohurley she grinned at him applaud youcan count on that well oh good evening mr valentine maddy straightened from the counter like a shot feeling guilty for no reason she could fathom she turned and managed a smile hello reed maddy hed come in during the brief duet but neither of them had noticed when he only stared at her she cleared her throat and decided to wing it i was up this way and decided to drop in and say hello hello hed just come out of a long meeting where thoughts of her had distracted him he wasnt pleased to see her but he wanted to touch her are you on your way somewhere she could try being casually chic and lie about a party around the corner she could just as easily grow a second head no just here taking her by the arm reed nodded at johnny then led her to the elevators are you always so generous with strangers he asked as they stepped inside oh after a moments thought she shrugged i suppose you look a little tired and wonderful she added silently just wonderful long day me too we had our first full rehearsal today it was a zoo then she laughed nervously dipping her hands in her pockets i guess i shouldnt say that to the man with the checkbook with an unintelligible mutter he led her out into the hallway maddy decided silence was the best tack then he unlocked his door and brought her inside shed expected something grand something elegant something tasteful it was all that and more when the lights were switched on there was a feeling of space the walls were pale set off by vibrant impressionist paintings and three tall wide windows that let in a lofty view of the park and the city the pewtertoned rug was the perfect contrast to the long spreading coral sofa two lush ficus trees stood in the corner and set in two wall niches were the ming vases shed once imagined a curved open staircase led to a loft there wasnt a thing out of place but she hadnt expected there to be still it wasnt cold and she hadnt been sure about that its lovely reed she crossed to the windows to look down if there was a problem she felt it was here he kept himself so aloof so distant from the city he lived in away from the sounds the smells the humanity of it do you ever stand here and wonder whats going on whats going on where down there of course she turned back to him with a silent invitation to join her when he did she looked down again whos arguing whos laughing whos making love wheres the police car going and will he get there in time how many street people will sleep in the park tonight how many tricks turned how many bottles opened how many babies born its an incredible place isnt it she wore the same scent light teasing only because it was so guileless not everyone looks at it the way you do i always wanted to live in new york she stepped back so that there were only lights just the dazzle of them ever since i can remember its strange how the three of us my sisters i mean seemed to have this gut instinct where we belonged as close as we are we all chose completely different places abbys in rural virginia chantels in fantasyland and im here he had to stop himself from stroking her hair there was always that trace of wistfulness when she spoke of her sisters he didnt understand family he had only his father would you like a drink it was in his tone the distance the formality she tried not to let it hurt i wouldnt mind some perrier when he went to the compact ebony bar she moved away from the window she couldnt stand there thinking about people milling around together when she felt so divorced from the man she had come to see then she saw the plant hed set it on a little stand where it would get indirect sunlight from the windows the soil when she tested it with her thumb was moist but not soaking she smiled as she touched a leaf he could care if only he allowed himself to it looks better maddy said as she took the glass he offered its pitiful reed corrected swirling the brandy in his snifter no really it does it doesnt look so well pale i guess thank you you were drowning it he drank and wished her eyes werent so wide so candid why dont you sit down maddy you can tell me why you came i just wanted to see you for the first time she wished she had some of chantels flair with men look im lousy at this sort of thing unable to keep still she began to wander around the apartment i never had time to develop a lot of style and i only say clever lines when theyre fed to me i wanted to see you defiantly she sat on the edge of the sofa so i came no style it amazed him that he could be amused when this unwanted need for her was knotting his gut i see he sat as well keeping a cushion between them did you come to proposition me temper flared in her eyes and came out unexpectedly as hauler i see dancers dont have a patent on ego i suppose the women youre used to are ready to tumble into bed when you crook your finger the smile threatened again as he lifted his brandy the women im used to dont sing duets in the lobby with the security guard she slammed down her glass and the fizzing water plopped dangerously close to the rim probably because they have tin ears thats a possibility the point is maddy i dont know what to do about you do about me she rose completely graceful totally livid you dont have to do anything about me i dont want you to do anything about me im not an eliza doolittle you even think in plays what if i do you think in columns disgusted she began to pace again i dont know what im doing here it was stupid damn it ive been miserable for a week im not used to being miserable she whirled back accusing i missed my cue because i was thinking about you were you he rose though hed promised himself he wouldnt he knew he should see to it that she was angry enough to leave before he did something hed regret but he was doing it now moving closer to brush his thumb over her cheek yes desire rose and anger drained she didnt know how to make room for both she took his wrist before he could drop his hand i wanted you to think of me maybe i was he wanted to gather her close to feel her hard against him and pretend for just a little while maybe i caught myself looking out the window of my office and wondering about you she rose on her toes to meet his lips there was a storm brewing in him she could feel it she had storms of her own but she knew his would be for different reasons and have different results was it necessary to understand him when being with him felt so right it was enough for her but even as she thought it she knew it would never be enough for him reed no his hands were hard and tense on her back in her hair as he pulled her closer dont talk now he needed what she could give him with her mouth with her arms with the movement of her body against his his home had never seemed empty until she had come into his life now that she was here with him he didnt want to think about being alone again her mouth was like velvet warm and smooth as comforting as it was arousing when she touched him it felt as though she wanted to give rather than take for a moment he could almost believe it how easily he could lure her under a kiss had always been a simple thing to her something to show affection to a loved one with something to be given casually to a friend even something to be played up onstage for a theater full of people but with reed the simplicity ended this was complex overwhelming a contact mat shot sparks through every nerve ending passion wasnt new to her she experienced it every day in her work shed known that it was different when it involved a man and woman but she hadnt realized it could turn her muscles to water and cloud her brain he ran his hands through her hair she wished he would move them over her over every inch of the body that throbbed and ached for him he wanted her she could taste the frenzied desire every time his mouth met hers yet he did nothing more than hold her dose against him make love with me her mind requested but her lips were captured by his and couldnt form the words she could picture candlelight soft music and a big wide bed with the two of them tangled together the image made her skin heat and her mouth more aggressive reed do you want me even as her mouth skimmed over his face she felt him stiffen just slightly but she felt it yes it was the way he said it that cooled her blood reluctance even annoyance glazed over the answer maddy drew away slowly you have a problem with that why couldnt it be as simple with her as it was with other women mutual enjoyment rules up front and nobodys hurt hed known from the first time hed touched her that it wouldnt be simple with her yes he went back for his brandy hoping it would steady him i have a problem with that she was going too fast maddy decided it was a bad habit of hers to move at top speed without looking for the bumps in the road would you like to share it with me i want you the statement wiped away what shed hoped was a casual smile ive wanted to take you to bed since i watched you gathering up loose change and sweaty clothes off the sidewalk she took a step closer did he know that was what shed wanted to hear even though it frightened her a little did he know how much she wanted him to feel some portion of what she felt why did you send me away the other night im no good for you maddy she stared at him wait a minute i want to be sure i understand this you sent me away for my own good he splashed more brandy into the glass it wasnt helping thats right reed you make a child wear scratchy clothes in the winter for her own good once she gets past a certain age shes on her own he wondered how in the hell he was supposed to argue with an analogy like that you dont strike me as the kind of woman interested in onenight stands her smile chilled no im not then i did you a favor he drank again because he was beginning to despise himself i guess i should say thank you she picked up her dance bag then dropped it again it just wasnt an ohurley trait to give up easily i want to know why youre so sure it would have been a onenight stand im not interested in the long term she nodded telling herself that was reasonable theres a big difference between one night and the long term i get the feeling that you think im trying to put a cage around you she didnt know that the cage was half formed already and that hed built it himself maddy why dont we just leave it that you and i have nothing in common ive thought about that now that she had something solid to dig her teeth into she relaxed again its true to a point you know but when you really think about it we have plenty in common we both live in new york lifting a brow he leaned back against the bar of course that wipes everything else out its a start she caught it that faint glimpse of amusement it was enough for her we both at the moment have a vested interest in a certain musical she smiled at him instinctively and irresistibly charming i put my socks on before my shoes how about you maddy do you stand up in the shower i dont see come on no evasions just the truth do you it was useless he had to smile yes amazing so do i ever read gone with the wind yes ah common ground in literature i could probably go on for hours im sure you could he set his brandy down and went to her again whats the point maddy the point is i like you reed she put her hands on his forearms wishing she could ease the tension and keep that smile in his eyes just a bit longer i think if youd loosen up just a little we could be friends im attracted to you i think if we take our time we could be lovers too it was a mistake of course he knew it but she looked so appealing just then so honest and carefree you are he murmured as he toyed with a strand of her hair unique i hope so with a smile she rose up on her toes and kissed him without heat without passion is it a deal you might regret it then thats my problem isnt it friends she offered her hand solemnly but her eyes laughed at him challenging friends he agreed and hoped he wouldnt be the one to regret it great listen im starving have you got a can of soup or something chapter six on the surface it appeared to be every bit as simple as maddy had said it could be for a great many people it would have been simple beneath the surface as well but not everyone wanted as deeply as reed or pretended as well as maddy they went to the movies whenever their schedules meshed and the weather cooperated they had lunch in the park they spent one quiet sunday afternoon wandering through a museum more interested in each other than in the exhibits if reed hadnt known himself better he would have said he was on the brink of having a romance but he didnt believe in romance love had brought his father betrayal a betrayal reed himself lived with every day if edwin had put it behind him reed had not could not fidelity to the majority of the people he worked with was nothing if not flexible people had affairs not romances and they had them before during and after marriage so that marriage itself was a moot point nothing lasted forever particularly not relationships but he thought of maddy when he wasnt with her and he thought of little else when they were together friends somehow theyd managed to become friends despite their differing outlooks and opposite backgrounds if the friendship was cautious on his part and careless on hers theyd still found enough between them to form a base where did they go from here lovers it seemed inevitable that they would become lovers the passion that simmered under the surface every moment they were together wouldnt be held back for long they both knew it and in their different ways accepted it what worried reed was that once hed taken her to bed as he wanted to he would lose the easy companionship he was coming to depend on sex would change things it was bound to intimacy on a physical level would jar the emotional intimacy they had just begun to develop as much as he needed maddy in his bed he wondered if he could afford to risk losing the maddy he knew out of bed it was a tugofwar he knew he could never really win yet he didnt believe in losing given enough logical thought enough planning he should be able to find a way to have both did it matter if he was being calculating even coldblooded when the end result would please both of them the answer wouldnt come instead an image ran through his head of maddy as shed been a few afternoons before laughing tossing bread crumbs to pigeons in the park when the buzzer sounded on his desk he discovered hed lost another ten minutes daydreaming yes hannah your fathers on line one mr valentine thank you reed pushed a button and made the connection dad reed heard a rumor that selbys taken on a fresh batch of indies know anything about it reed already had a preliminary report on the influx of independent record promoters taken on by galloway keeping your ear to the ground on the nineteenth hole something like that theres talk of some pressure on some of the top stations to add a few records to their playlist nothing new a few whispers of payola but nothing that gels selbys a slippery sonofabitch you hear anything concrete i wouldnt mind being informed youll be the first never liked the idea of paying to have a record air edwin muttered well its an old gambit and im thinking more of new ones i wanted to see a rehearsal of our play would you like to join me reed glanced at his desk calendar when in an hour i know its the form to let them know theyd like to be on their toes when the bank rolls expected but i like surprises reed noted two appointments that morning and started to refuse giving in to impulse he decided to reschedule ill meet you at the theater at eleven stretch it into lunch your old mans buying he was lonely reed realized edwin valentine had his club his friends and enough money to cruise around the world but he was lonely ill bring an appetite reed told him then hung up to juggle his schedule edwin entered the theater stealthily like a boy without a ticket well just slip into a seat on the aisle and see what were paying for reed walked behind his father but his gaze was on the stage where maddy was wrapped in the arms of another man he felt the lunge of jealousy so surprisingly fierce that he stopped in the center of the aisle and stared she was looking up at another man her arms linked behind his neck her face glowing i really had a wonderful time jonathan i could have danced forever youre talking like its over we have hours yet reed watched as the man pressed a kiss to her forehead come home with me come home with you even with the distance reed could sense the alarm in the set of maddys body oh jonathan id like to really she drew away just a little but he caught her hands i just cant i have to i have to be at work early yes thats it and theres my mother she turned away again rolling her eyes so that the audience could see the lie while the man beside her couldnt shes not really well you know and i should be there in case she needs anything youre such a good person mary oh no guilt and distress were hinted at in her voice no jonathan im not dont say that he drew her into his arms again because i think im falling in love with you she was caught up in another kiss even knowing it was only a play reed felt something twist in his stomach i have to go she said quickly i really have to pulling away she darted across stage right when will i see you again she stopped and seemed at war within herself tomorrow come to the library at six ill meet you mary he started toward her but she held up both hands tomorrow she said again and ran offstage all right the directors voice boomed out well have fifteen seconds here for the drops and set change wanda rose take your marks lights go on cue maddy she came rushing onstage again to where wanda was lounging in a chair and the woman named rose was primping in a mirror youre late wanda said lazily what are you a time clock maddys voice had an edge of toughness now her movements were sharper jackie was looking for you maddy stopped in the act of pulling on a wild red wig whatd you tell him that he wasnt looking in the right places dont stretch your gstring mary i covered for you yeah she covered for you rose agreed snapping a wad of gum and fussing with her outrageous pinkandorange costume thanks maddy whipped off her skirt nudging rose aside she began to paint her face dont thank me we gotta stick together she watched negligently as rose practiced a routine think youre nuts though wanda added i know what im doing maddy slipped behind a screen the blouse shed worn flapped across it i can handle it you better make sure you can handle jackie any idea what hed do to you and your pretty boy if he found out whats going on hes not going to find out she came out from the screen in a long slinky gown covered with red spangles look im on crowds pretty hot tonight good she sent wanda a grin thats the way i like them she walked off stage right again lights stage left the stage manager called cue terry a dancer reed recognized from the only other rehearsal hed seen paced out on stage left his hair was slicked back and hed added a pencilthin moustache he wore a brilliant white tie against a black shirt when maddy came out behind him he grabbed her arm where the hell you been around maddy pushed back the mane of red hair then settled a hand saucily on her hip whats your problem edwin leaned over and whispered to reed doesnt look like the little lady who came into your office with a dead plant no reed murmured as the two on stage argued it doesnt shes going to be big reed very very big he felt twin surges of pride and alarm and could explain neither of them yes i think she is look sugar maddy gave her partner a pat on the cheek you want me to go strip or stay here and read you my diary strip jackie ordered her yeah maddy tossed her head back thats what i do best lights the stage manager called out music maddy grabbed a red boa and walked no sauntered to center stage then stood there like a flame when she began to sing her voice came slowly and built as arousing and teasing as the movements she began to make the boa was tossed into the audience it would be replaced dozens of times before the play closed i never took you to a strip joint did i reed he had to smile even as maddy began to peel off elbowlength gloves no you didnt hole in your education onstage maddy let her body take over it was just one routine among nearly a dozen others but she knew it had the potential to be a showstopper if she played it right she intended to when she whipped off the skirt of the dress some of the technicians began to whistle she grinned and went into a series of thunderous bumps and grinds when the twominute dance had run its course she sat on the stage arched back wearing little more than spangles and beads to her surprise and pleasure there was a smattering of applause from the center of the audience exhausted she propped herself on her elbow and smiled out into the darkened theater word traveled quickly from assistant to assistant to stage manager to director money was in the house don went down the aisle swearing because the grapevine hadnt gotten to him sooner mr valentine and mr valentine he offered hearty handshakes we werent expecting you we thought wed catch something a little impromptu reed spoke to him but his gaze wandered back to the stage where maddy still sat dabbing at her throat now with a towel very impressive we could be a little sharper yet but well be ready for philadelphia no doubt about that edwin gave him a friendly slap on the shoulder we dont want to hold things up id love you to stay longer if you could were about to rehearse the first scene from the second act please come down front up to you reed he was going to have to put in an extra two hours with paperwork to make up for this but he wasnt going to miss it lets go the next scene was played strictly for laughs reed didnt know enough to dissect the comedic timing the pacing the stage business that made the simplest things funny he could see however that maddy knew how to play it to the hilt she was going to have the audience eating out of her hand there was something vivid about her something convincing and sympathetic even in her role as the brazen somewhat edgy stripper reed watched her play two roles adding the innocence necessary to convince the eager and honest jonathan that his mary was a dedicated librarian with a sick mother hed have believed her himself and it was that quality that began to worry him shes quite a performer edwin commented when the director and stage manager went into a huddle yes she is i suppose its none of my business but whats going on between you reed turned his face expressionless what makes you think anything is edwin tapped the side of his nose id never have gotten this far in the business if i couldnt sniff things out were friends reed said after a moment with a sigh edwin shifted his large bulk in the seat you know reed one of the things ive always wanted for you is a woman like maddy ohurley a bright beautiful woman who could make you happy i am happy youre still bitter not with you reed said immediately never with you your mother leave it though the words were quiet the ice was there this has nothing to do with her it had everything to do with her edwin thought as maddy took the stage again but he knew his son well and kept his silence edwin couldnt turn back the clock and stop the betrayal even if it were possible he wouldnt if he could and did reed wouldnt be sitting beside him now how could he teach his son that it was a matter not of forgiveness but of acceptance how could he teach him to trust when hed been born of a lie edwin studied maddy as her bright expressive face lighted the stage could she be the one to do the teaching maybe she was the woman reed had always needed the answer hed always searched for without acknowledging that he was looking maybe through maddy edwin could lay all his own past hurts to rest even though it was simply a walkthrough maddy kept the energy at a high level she didnt believe in pacing herself through a performance or through life but in going full out and seeing where it landed her while she ran through her lines practiced her moves part of her concentration focused on reed he was watching her so intently it was if he were trying to see through her role to who and what she really was didnt he understand that it was her job to submerge herself until there was no maddy only mary she thought she sensed disapproval even annoyance a completely different mood from the one hed sat down with she wanted badly to jump down from the stage and somehow reassure him though of what she wasnt sure but he didnt want that from her at least not yet for now he wanted everything casual very very light no strings no promises no future she stumbled over a line swore at herself they backtracked and began again she couldnt tell him how she felt for a woman with an honest nature even silence was deception but she couldnt tell him he didnt want to hear her say she loved him had begun to love him from the moment shed stood on the sidewalk with him at dusk he would be angry because he didnt want to be trapped by emotion he wouldnt understand that she simply lived on emotion perhaps hed think she simply gave her love easily it was true enough that she did but not this kind of love love of family was natural and always there love of friends evolved slowly or quickly but with no qualms she could love a child in the park for nothing more than his innocence or an old man on the street for nothing more than his endurance but loving reed involved everything this love was complex and shed always thought loving was simple it hurt and shed always believed love brought joy the passion was there always simmering underneath it made her restless with anticipation when shed always been so easygoing shed invited him into her life that was something she couldnt forget more shed argued him into her life when hed been ready to back away so she loved him but she couldnt tell him lunch ladies and gentlemen be back at two prepared to run through the two final scenes so its the angel wanda murmured in maddys ear the one in the front row who looks like a cover for gentlemans quarterly what about him maddy bent from the waist and let her muscles relax thats him isnt it what him the him wanda gave her a quick slap on the rump the him thats had you standing around dreamy eyed i dont stand around dreamy eyed at least she hoped she didnt thats him wanda said with a selfsatisfied smile before she strolled offstage grumbling to herself maddy walked down the steps beside the stage she put on a fresh smile reed im glad you came she didnt touch him or offer the quick friendly kiss she usually greeted him with mr valentine its so nice to see you again i enjoyed every minute of it he sandwiched her hand between his big ones its a pleasure to watch you work did i hear the man mention lunch she put a hand on her stomach that you did then youll join us wont you well i when reed said nothing she searched for an excuse now you wouldnt disappoint me edwin ignored his sons silence and barreled ahead this is your neck of the woods you must know a good spot theres a deli just across the street she began perfect i could eat a good pastrami and it would only take a quick call to cancel his reservation at the four seasons what do you say reed id say maddy needs a minute to change he finally smiled at her she glanced down at her costume of hotpink shorts and tank top five minutes to get into my street clothes she promised and dashed away she was better than her word within five minutes she had thrown a yellow sweat suit over her costume and was walking into the deli in front of reed and his father the smells were wonderful there were times she stopped in for them alone spiced meat hot mustard strong coffee an overhead fan stirred it all up most of the dancers had headed there from the theater like hungry ants to a picnic because the proprietor was shrewd there was a jukebox in the rear corner it was already blasting away the big greek behind the counter spotted maddy and gave her a wide white grin ahhh an ohurley special absolutely leaning on the glass front of the counter she watched him dish up a big leafy salad he used a generous hand with chunks of cheese then topped it off with a dollop of yogurt you eat that edwin asked behind her she laughed and accepted the bowl i absorb it body needs meat edwin ordered a pastrami on a huge kaiser roll ill get us a table maddy offered grabbing a cup of tea to go with the salad wisely she commandeered one on the opposite end of the room from the music lunch with the big boys huh maddy terry with his hair still slicked back a la jackie stooped over her going to put in a good word for me what word would you like she turned in her chair to grin up at him how aboutstar ill see if i can work it in he started to say something else but glanced over at his own table damn it leroy thats my pickle maddy was still laughing when reed and his father joined her quite a place edwin commented already looking forward to his sandwich and the heap of potato salad beside it theyre on their best behavior because youre here someone started to sing over the blare of the jukebox maddy simply pitched her voice higher will you come to the philadelphia opening mr valentine thinking about it dont travel as much as i used to there was a time when the head of a record company had to be out of town as much as he was in his office must have been exciting she dipped into her salad and pretended she didnt envy reed his pile of rare roast beef hotel rooms meetings he shrugged and i missed my boy the look he gave reed was both rueful and affectionate missed too many ball games you made plenty of them reed sliced off a corner of his sandwich and handed it to maddy it was a small completely natural gesture that caught edwins eye and his hope reed was top pitcher on his high school team reed was shaking his head with a smile of his own when maddy turned to him you played ball you never told me as soon as the words were out she reminded herself he had no reason to tell her there were dozens of other details about his life that he hadnt told her i never really understood baseball until i moved to new york she went on quickly then i caught a few yankee games to see what the fuss was about what was your era he lifted a brow it pleased her that he remembered she rolled her eyes at his father bigleague material so i always told him but he wanted to work in the business thats the big leagues too isnt it she nibbled on the portion of sandwich reed had given her most of us only look at the finished product you know the album we put on the turntable the cassette we stick in the car stereo i guess its a long trip from sheet music to vinyl when youve got three or four days free edwin said with a laugh ill fill you in id like that she drank her honeyed tea knowing it would seep into her bloodstream and get her through the next four hours when we recorded the cast album for suzannas park i got a taste of it i think the studios so different from the stage so well restricted she swallowed lettuce sorry no need a studio has certain restrictions reed put in he took a sip of his coffee and discovered it was strong enough to melt leather on the other hand there can be untold advantages we can take that man behind the counter put him in a studio and turn him into caruso by pushing the right buttons maddy digested that then shook her head thats cheating thats marketing reed corrected and plenty of labels do it does valentine he looked at her and the gray eyes shed admired from the beginning were direct no valentine was started with an eye toward quality not quantity she slanted edwin a wicked look but you were going to offer a recording contract to the ohurley triplets edwin added an extra dash of pepper to his sandwich you werent quality we were a slice above mediocre a great deal above if what i saw onstage this afternoon is any indication i appreciate that do you get time for much socializing maddy she plopped her chin on her hands asking me for a date he seemed taken aback though only for an instant then he roared with laughter that caught the attention of everyone in the deli damned if i wouldnt if i could drop twenty years quite a prize right here he patted her hand but looked at his son yes she is reed said blandly im thinking of giving a party edwin said on impulse sending the play off to philadelphia in style what do you think maddy i think its a great idea am i invited on the condition that you save a dance for me it was as easy for her to love the father as it was for her to love the son you can have as many as you like i dont think i can keep up with you for more than one she laughed with him when she picked up her tea she saw that reed was watching her again coolly the sense of disapproval she felt from him cut her to the bone i ah i have to get back there are some things i have to do before afternoon rehearsal walk the lady across the street reed your legs are younger than mine oh thats all right maddy was already up i dont need ill walk you over reed had her by the elbow she wouldnt make a scene for the life of her she couldnt pinpoint why she wanted to so badly instead she bent down and kissed edwins cheek thanks for lunch she waited until they were outside before she spoke again reed im perfectly capable of crossing the street alone go back to your father do you have a problem do have a problem she pulled her arm away and glared at him oh i cant stand to hear you say that to me in that proper politely curious voice she started across the street at a jog you have twenty minutes to get back he caught her arm again i said i had things to do you lied in the center of the street with the light turning yellow she turned toward him again then lets say i have better things to do better things than to sit there and be put under your intellectual microscope whats wrong dont you like the fact that i enjoy your fathers company are you afraid i have designs on him stop it he gave her a jerk to get her moving as cars began to honk you just dont like women in general do you you put us all in this big box thats labeled not to be trusted i wish i knew why maddy youre becoming very close to hysterical oh i can get a lot closer she promised with deadly sincerity you froze up i saw you when i was onstage and you were watching me with that cold measuring look in your eyes it was as if you thought you were looking at me instead of the part i was playing and you didnt want either of us to win because he recognized the glimmer of truth he shifted away from it youre being ridiculous im not she shoved away from him again as they stood by the stage door i know when im being ridiculous and in this instance im not i dont know what ate away at you reed but whatever it was im sorry for it ive tried not to let it bother me ive tried not to let a lot of things bother me but this is too much he took her by the shoulders and held her against the wall what is too much i saw your face when your father was talking about having a party about me being there well you dont have to worry i wont come ill make an excuse what are you talking about he demanded spacing each word carefully i didnt realize youd be embarrassed being seen with me maddy no its understandable isnt it she rushed on im just plain maddy ohurley no degrees behind the name no pedigree in front of it i got my high school diploma in the mail and both my parents can trace their roots back to peasant stock in the south of ireland he caught her chin in his hand the next time you take a side trip leave me a map so i can keep up i dont know what youre talking about im talking about us she shouted i dont know why im talking about us because there is no us you dont want an us you dont even want a you and me really so i dont he cut her off out of total frustration by pressing his mouth over hers shut up he warned when she struggled to protest just shut up a minute he filled himself on her god if she knew how frustrated hed been watching her seduce an empty theater how empty hed felt sitting beside her unable to touch her the anger poured through hed hurt her and would probably hurt her again he no longer knew how to avoid it calm he asked when he let her speak again no all right then just be quiet i dont know exactly what i was thinking while i was watching you onstage its becoming a problem to think at all when i look at you she started to snap then thought better of it why i dont know as for the other business you are being ridiculous i dont care if you got your education in a correspondence school or at vassar i dont care if your father was knighted or tried for grand larceny disturbing the peace maddy mumbled but that was only once twice i guess im sorry as the tears rolled out she apologized again im really sorry i hate this i always get so churned up when im angry and i cant stop dont he brushed at her tears himself i havent been completely fair with you we really need to clear up what the situation between us is okay when when dont you have a class at the crack of dawn she sniffed and searched in her dance bag for a tissue sunday saturday then will you come to my place he brushed a thumb along her cheekbone she was being reasonable too reasonable when he knew he couldnt promise to be please yes ill come reed i didnt mean to make a scene neither did i maddy he hesitated a moment then decided to start clearing the air now the business with my father it had nothing to do with the party hes planning it had nothing to do with you coming or being with me she wanted to believe him but an insecurity she hadnt been aware of held her back what was it then i havent seen him so charmed by anyone in a very long time he wanted a house full of children and he never had them if hed had a daughter i imagine hed have enjoyed one like you reed im sorry i dont know what you want me to do just dont hurt him i wont see him hurt again he touched her cheek briefly then left her at the stage door chapter seven when maddy let herself into her apartment she was thinking about reed that didnt surprise her thoughts of reed had dominated her day to the point where she had had to make a conscious effort to concentrate on her role as mary howard the philadelphia opening was only three weeks away she couldnt afford to be distracted by speculation on whatif and howto when they concerned reed valentine but what was going to happen on saturday what would she say how should she behave maddy jammed the key into her lock and called herself a fool but she kept thinking the lights were on as the door closed behind her maddy stood in the center of the room frowning true she was often absentminded or in too much of a rush to remember little details but she wouldnt have left the lights on shed retained the habit of conserving energy and electrical bills from her leaner days besides she didnt think shed even turned them on that morning before shed left for class odder still she could have sworn she smelled coffee fresh coffee maddy was setting down her dance bag and turning toward the kitchen when she heard a noise from the bedroom heart thudding she pulled a tap shoe from the bag and held it up like a weapon she didnt consider herself the aggressive type but it didnt even occur to her to run and call for help it was her home and she had always defended what was hers slowly careful to make no sound she moved across the room she heard a jangle of hangers from the closet and gripped the shoe tighter if the thief thought hed find anything of value in there he was too stupid for words she should be able to send a dimwitted thief on his way with the threat of a rap over the head with a reinforced heel still the closer she came the more often she had to swallow past the little flutter of panic in her throat holding her breath maddy closed her free hand around the knob then pulled there were simultaneous shrieks of alarm well chantel put a hand to her heart its nice to see you too chantel with a whoop of delight maddy tossed her shoe aside and grabbed her sister i almost put a dent in your head then id have one to match yours what are you doing here hanging up a few things chantel kissed maddys cheek then tossed back her silveryblond mane i hope you dont mind silk wrinkles so dreadfully of course i dont mind i meant what are you doing in new york you should have let me know you were coming darling i wrote you last week no you then maddy remembered the stack of mail shed yet to open i havent gotten to some of my mail yet typical yeah i know she drew her sister back just to look it was a face she knew as well as her own but one she never ceased to admire the subtle french fragrance that wafted through the room suited chantel as perfectly as the deep blue eyes and the cupidsbow mouth oh chantel you look wonderful im so glad to see you you look pretty wonderful yourself chantel studied her sisters glowing complexion either those vitamins you guzzle are working or youre in love i think its both one thin shapely brow rose is that so why dont we get out of the closet and talk about it lets sit down and have a drink maddy linked her arm through chantels oh i wish abby were here too then it would be perfect how long are you in town just a couple of days chantel explained as they walked back to the living room im presenting one of those americas choice awards friday night my publicists thought it would be just nifty maddy began to search the cupboards for a bottle of wine and you dont chantel tossed a glance at the darkening window you know new yorks not my town darling its too real maddy suggested lets just say noisy outside two sirens were competing in volume i hope you have some wine maddy you were out of coffee you know i gave it up maddy told her with her head stuck in a cupboard gave it up you i was drinking too much of it just pouring that caffeine into my system im drinking mostly herb tea these days maddy sniffed again and caught the rich dark scent of coffee where did you get it oh i borrowed a few scoops from your nextdoor neighbor wine bottle in hand maddy drew out of the cupboard not guido yes guido the one with the biceps and large teeth maddy unearthed two glasses chantel ive lived next door to him for years and i wouldnt exchange a goodmorning with him without an armed guard he was charming leaning against the counter chantel pushed her hair away from her face although i did have to discourage him from coming over to fix the coffee for me maddy glanced at her sister at the classic face the stunning body the wedgwoodblue eyes that easily hypnotized men i bet maddy poured two glasses then tapped hers against her sisters heres to the ohurleys god bless them every one chantel murmured and sipped after a grimace she swallowed maddy youre still buying your wine at the flea market its not that bad lets sit down have you heard from abby i called her before i left so shed know id be on the same coast she was refereeing a fight between the boys and sounded blissfully happy dylan chantel sank into the sofa grateful for its stationary comfort after a long tedious flight she said he was nearly finished with the book how does she feel about it content she trusts him completely chantel sipped again there was a trace of cynicism in her voice that she couldnt completely disguise she had trusted once too abby seems to have put her life with rockwell behind her she tells me dylans going to adopt the boys thats great maddy felt her eyes fill and swallowed more wine thats really great its what shes needed hes what shes needed oh and abby said shed gotten a lace tablecloth from trace as a wedding gift i guess we were all hoping hed manage to get back for the wedding where is he brittany i think he sent his apologies as usual do you ever wonder what he does i decided to stop wondering in case it was illegal are mom and pop going to make it to your opening i hope so theyve got three weeks to work their way to philly i guess you wont be able to make it back east im sorry chantel closed her hand over her sisters filming on strangers was postponed couple of problems with the location site i should be starting week after next you know id be here if i could i know you must be so excited its such a wonderful part yes a frown moved into her eyes and out again whats wrong chantel hesitated on the verge of telling maddy about the anonymous letters shed been getting and the phone calls she shrugged it off i dont know nerves i guess ive never done a miniseries its not really television its not a feature film come on chantel this is maddy its nothing she made up her mind not to discuss what was probably nothing more than a minor annoyance when she returned to california the whole thing would probably have blown over just a few loose ends i have to tie up what i want to talk about is the man youre thinking about she smiled when maddy blinked back to full attention come on maddy tell your big sister everything im not sure how much there is to tell maddy brought her legs up into a comfortable lotus position do you ever remember pop talking about knowing edwin valentine edwin valentine narrowing her eyes chantel searched her memory one of the reasons for her quick rise as an actress in hollywood was the fact that she never forgot anything not lines not names not faces no i dont remember the name at all hes valentine records chantel merely lifted a brow again and waited for maddy to go on its one of the top labels in the business maybe the top anyway he met mom and pop when we were babies he was just getting started and they let him sleep on a cot in their hotel room sounds like them chantel said easily she slipped out of her shoes and slouched something she would never have done with anyone but family whats next valentine records is the backer for the play interesting she started to sip then latched on to her sisters hand maddy youre not involved with him he must be pops age look im not saying that age should be a big factor in a relationship but when its my little sister hang on maddy giggled into her wine didnt i read that you were seeing count devargo of devargo jewelers he must be hitting sixty that was different chantel muttered european men are ageless very good maddy decided after a moment that was really very good thanks in any case we were nothing more than friends if youre getting dreamy eyed over a man old enough to be your father im not dreamy eyed maddy said and its his son whose son oh calmer chantel settled back again so this edwin valentine has a son not a dancer no she had to smile hes taken over the record company i guess hes a magnate well chantel rolled out the word coming up in the world arent we i dont know what im doing maddy unlaced her legs and rose most of the time i think i must be crazy hes gorgeous and successful and conservative he likes french restaurants the beast maddy dissolved into laughter oh chantel help have you slept with him it was like chantel to get right down to brass tacks maddy let out a deep breath and sat again no but youve thought about it i cant seem to think of much of anything but him chantel reached for the bottle to fill her glass again once you got past the first swallow the wine was almost palatable and how does he feel about you thats where i hit the brick wall chantel hes kind and considerate and has the capacity for such well goodness i guess but he has this safety net when it comes to women one minute hes holding me and i feel as though this is what ive been waiting for all of my life the next minute hes putting me aside as though we hardly know each other does he know how you feel im halfafraid he does i wouldnt dare tell him hes made it clear hes not interested in what he callsthe long haul chantel felt a little twist of alarm and youre thinking in terms of the long haul i could spend my life with him with eyes abruptly serious abruptly vulnerable she stared at her sister chantel i could make him happy maddy these things work two ways god how well she knew it can he make you happy if hed let me in if hed let me in just a little so i could understand why hes so afraid to feel chantel something happened something devastating i know it to make him so untrusting if i knew what it was i could do something about it but im flying blind chantel set down her glass and took both of maddys hands you really love him i really love him hes a very lucky man youre prejudiced damn right and no matter how aloof he is i dont think he stands a chance i mean look at that face she took maddys chin in her hand it says trustworthy loyal devoted you make me sound like a cocker spaniel maddy it was so easy to give advice chantel thought so easy to give what she would never take herself very simply if you love this guy the best way to get him to love you back is to be what you are discouraged maddy picked up her wine shed throw caution to the winds she decided and have another half glass i figured youd give me some triedandtrue tips in the art of seduction i just did for you chantel added honey if i told you some of my secrets your hair would curl besides youre looking for marriage right i guess i am then while i dont recommend honesty in most relationships this is different if you want this man in your life for better or for worse men you should be upfront when are you seeing him again not until saturday chantel frowned a moment shed wanted to get a look at this valentine character herself but shed be on a plane heading west on saturday well it wouldnt hurt for you to have a new outfit she cast a look at maddys sweats something alluring of course but something that will suit you do they make things like that leave it to me chantel took another quick glance and gauged that she and maddy still wore the same size the only thing i really like about new york is the shopping speaking of shopping did you know you only have three carrots and a jug of juice in your fridge i was going to get something at the health food shop around the corner spare me from that i dont like eating twigs theres a restaurant a block away that serves great spaghetti terrific do i have to change or do you maddy studied her sisters elegant nubby silk suit while fingering her own sweats you do did you bring anything with you that doesnt look so rodeo drive i cant bring what i dont have keeping up an image that looks glamorous and a little decadent is hard work with a quick snort maddy rose ive got something you can toss on that shouldnt tarnish that image of yours too badly besides no ones going to recognize you down at francos chantel smiled slowly as she rose what odds do you give me maddy opened her arms to grab her sister chantel youre one in a million chantel rested her cheek against her sisters things should be as simple she thought things should be as easy as they were at this moment no were three in a million and im so glad to have you when maddy came home from rehearsal on saturday the apartment was empty shed had almost three days with chantel during the brief visit her sister had charmed the surly guido awed the production staff of the play with a brief visit during rehearsal and bought out half the stores on fifth avenue maddy missed her already if chantel had been able to stay just one more day sighing maddy headed for the shower it was silly to think she needed moral support just to go talk to reed she didnt need a pep talk or a vote of confidence she was simply going to talk to the man about the meaning of their relationship and where it was going maddy turned on the shower and stood face into the spray as the water poured over her she was going to wash change then catch the subway uptown it wasnt as though it were the first time she would have spent an evening in reeds apartment besides they needed to talk there was no use being nervous about something that had to be done the play was going well she could tell him that she could start things off by telling him how right it was beginning to feel everything was coming together when they left the following week for the last days of intense rehearsal in philadelphia it was only going to get better would be miss her at all would he tell her lecturing herself maddy stepped out of the shower and immediately searched through the rubble of her linen closet for her hair drier within minutes shed fluffed her hair dry teased a bit of height on the top and ruffled the sides to give more volume she pulled out a pile of makeup and began to experiment with an expert hand more than once shed done her own hair and makeup for the stage shed learned early that if she didnt want to be dependent on someone elses time and whims she had to know how to do for herself she could if necessary have chosen the right paints and pots to turn her into mary or suzanna or any other part shed ever played tonight she was just maddy satisfied she headed into the bedroom there spread on the bed was what chantel had left behind maddy picked up the note first and read the bold looping writing maddy after an exhaustive search and hard thinking i decided this was for you happy birthday next month wear it tonight for your reed better yet wear it for yourself forget the first reaction that the color isnt right for you trust me ill be thinking of you you know i love you kid break a leg chantel catching her bottom lip between her teeth maddy looked at chanters gift the slinky silk slacks were a bold flaming pink exactly the sort of color maddy would avoid with her hair she gave them a dubious look but reached down to touch the skinny little camisole top was jadecolored together they were precisely the sort of outrageous combination she would have chosen herself maddy smiled as she picked the top up by the slender straps but it was the jacket that she who chose clothes with a careless eye for color and comfort cooed over it was silk as well a bit oversize and as slinky as the slacks thousands of beads were sewed on it creating a kaleidoscope of colors each way she turned it a different pattern emerged at first glance she would have said it was too sophisticated for her taste too elegant for her style but the everchanging patterns caught both her imagination and her admiration all right she said aloud were going to go for it why was he nervous reed paced his tooquiet apartment for the tenth time it was ridiculous to feel nervous just because he was going to entertain a woman for the evening even if the woman was maddy especially because the woman was maddy he corrected theyd spent evenings together before but tonight was different he switched on the stereo hoping the flow of music would distract him hed purposely avoided contacting her all week to prove to himself he could live without her somewhere around thursday he had stopped counting the times hed picked up the phone and dialed the first few digits of her number only to hang up they were just going to talk be reminded himself it was becoming imperative that they outline what they wanted from each other what the rules were where the boundaries began he wanted to make love with her needed to make love with her he corrected and a curl of desire began with just the thought they could be lovers and still keep things companionable thats what they had to get straight before any more time passed when she came they would sit down and talk about their needs and their restrictions like reasonable adults they would come to a logical understanding and go on from there no one would be hurt he was going to hurt her reed ran a hand over the back of his neck and wondered why he was so certain of that he could still remember the way her eyes had filled the last time hed seen her how shed somehow looked both wounded and courageous how many times had he told himself he would use tonight to break it off to sever it all before it went any farther how many times had he ultimately admitted it wouldnt be possible she was getting under his skin and he couldnt allow that the best way the only way he knew to stop it was to set down the rules he paced again to the windows and back before looking at his watch she was late she was driving him crazy what was it about her he asked himself she wasnt particularly beautiful she wasnt smooth and sleek and alluringly cool in short she wasnt the sort of woman who caught his notice she was the woman whod caught him by the throat he had to loosen her hold gain control go forward at his own pace where the hell was she when the knock sounded he was cursing her reed gave himself a moment to settle it wouldnt do to open the door edgy and eager if he started on solid ground hed stay on solid ground then he opened the door and every logical thought deserted him had he said she wasnt really beautiful how could he have been so totally wrong hes said she wasnt alluring yet she stood there glittering glowing simmering with her own source of energy and hed never been more captivated hi how are you he couldnt tell her heart was thudding uneasily as she smiled and kissed his cheek im fine that was the scent hed carried with him for days it was absurd for a man to linger on something that could be bought at a departmentstore cosmetics counter maddy hesitated a moment you did say you wanted to see me saturday night didnt you yes well are you going to let me in the humor in her eyes made him feel like a fool of course sorry he closed the door behind her and wondered if hed just made the biggest mistake of his life and hers you look wonderful different you think so smiling again she pirouetted my sister breezed into town for a couple of days and picked this out for me she turned again wanting to share her pleasure great isnt it yes youre beautiful it was easy to pass it off with a laugh well the outfit certainly is you havent been by rehearsals no because hed needed to give himself time away from her would you like a drink a little white wine maybe she crossed as she invariably did to his view of the city its really coming together reed everythings starting to click the accounting department will be glad to hear it it was his dry tone that made her laugh how can you lose if we hit you rake it in if we flop you write it off as a tax break but its alive reed she took the glass from him needing him to fed it with her every time i walk out into a scene as mary it becomes more alive i need that sort of vibrant breathing center to my life a center to her life hed always scrupulously avoided having one in his own and a play does that for you she looked down at her wine then out at the city again if i were alone with nothing more without a chance for anything more i could be happy when im onstage when im onstage she began again and i look out and see a theater full of people waiting for me reed i dont know how to explain it try he stood watching her watching the city lights glow behind her i want to know she pulled a hand through the hair shed so carefully styled it tell back into place just a little mussed i feel instant acceptance i guess i feel loved and i can give the love back with a dance with a song it sounds hokey to say thats what i was born for but it was it just was it would be enough if you could stand on stage and be loved by hundreds of strangers she gave him a long searching look knowing he didnt understand no one who didnt perform could it would be enough would have to be enough if that were all i could have you dont need one single permanent person or thing in your life i didnt say that she kept her eyes on his as she shook her head slowly i meant that ive always been able to adjust ive had to applause fills a lot of gaps reed all of them if you work hard at it i imagine your work does the same for you it does i told you before i dont have the time or the inclination for a longterm relationship yes you did i meant it maddy he drank again because the words didnt come comfortably through his lips why when he was trying so hard to be honest did it feel as though he were lying we tried it your way the friendship her fingers were cold she set her glass down and linked them together to warm them i think it worked i want more he ran his hand through her hair and brought her closer and if i take more im going to hurt you that was the truth she knew it accepted it then told herself to forget it im responsible for myself reed that includes my emotions i want more too whatever happens the choice was mine what choice he demanded suddenly what choice maddy isnt it time to admit neither of us has had one all along i wanted to push you aside that was my choice but i kept drawing you closer and closer he had his hands on her shoulders now and slowly slid the jacket from them it fell to the floor in a waterfall of color you dont know me he murmured as he felt the quick tremble that moved through her body you dont know whats inside me theres a lot there you wouldnt like more you wouldnt even understand if you were smart youd be out that door now guess im not smart it wouldnt matter his fingers tensed on her shoulders because im past the point of letting you go her skin was warm so warm and soft in his hands youll hate me before its finished and he already regretted it i dont hate easily reed wanting to soothe she lifted a hand to his cheek trust me a little trust has nothing to do with this something flared in his eyes quickly vibrantly then was gone not a damn thing i want you and that hungers been clawing inside me for weeks thats all i have for you the hurt came as promised but she pushed it aside if that were true i dont think you would have been fighting it so hard ive finished fighting it his lips descended upon hers youll stay with me tonight yes ill stay she put both hands to his face wanting to ease the tension in him because its what i want he took her wrists then slowly slid her hand through his until he could press his lips to her palm it was a promise the only one he could give her come with me leading with her heart maddy went chapter eight there was a lamp in the hall that sent a shaft of light into the bedroom otherwise all was shadows and secrets hed left the stereo on but it was hardly more than an echo of a sound now as they stopped to touch each other shed wanted to see his eyes like this intensely focused only on her and what he wanted from her it made her smile as she yielded her lips to his again youre making a mistake he began shhh she moved her lips over his lets be logical later ive wanted to know what it would be like with you from the moment i met you watching his face she began to unbutton his shirt ive wanted to know what you looked like what you felt like she drew his shirt off then ran her hands up his chest it was hard smooth and at the moment stiff id lie awake at night wondering when wed be together like this seeking curious her hands stroked his shoulders then moved slowly down his arms reed im not afraid of you or of how i feel you should be her head tilted back her eyes challenged then show me why with an oath he gave in to her to himself to everything dragging her against him he crushed her mouth beneath his and plundered he ran his hands all over the thin silk that covered her until her body began to shiver was it fear or anticipation he couldnt tell but her fingers dug into his flesh holding him close and her mouth was open and eager hed once wondered if she were a witch the thought returned now as what rose between them was all hellsmoke and temptation there was nothing easy about her now nothing light and simple the passion that swirled around him seemed as complex and dangerous as eve or the serpent who had dared her desire clawed at him fierce and heartless he wanted to take her quickly instantly where they stood living only for the moment no strings no promises it would be better for her better for him if he did then she murmured his name with a sound as soft and sweet as an evening breeze his hands gentled he couldnt resist it his mouth softened he couldnt prevent it there would come a time when he would hurt her but tonight was special he thought of nothing but her not the past not the future tonight he would give as much as he could take as much as he dared and perhaps he could give to himself as well gently he brushed the straps from her shoulders and the brilliant silk slithered down to cling tentatively to her breasts as if she sensed his change of mood she went very still was she so willing to absorb his moods he hoped for her sake she had some defenses left with a tenderness that surprised him more than it did her he skimmed his lips over her bare shoulders taking in the texture as smooth as the silk and her scent just as tantalizing she suddenly seemed so small so fragile so young after a moments hesitation he brought his lips back to merge with hers she felt the change in him the tugofwar that always seemed to rage inside him seemed to cease her own open heart was ready to take him in she stroked carefully pleased with the long hard lines of his body though her breathing was no longer steady she allowed her lips to nibble and tease only to give him time to accept what was happening between them he would fight it she was nearly certain he would deny it but his feelings were guiding him willing pliant they both moved to the bed she knew her body too well to feel awkward her hips were narrow her legs long her torso just a shade too thin she was built like a dancer and didnt question it just as she didnt question his cautious careful exploration the camisole slipped off and was tossed aside when his hands touched her skin she merely sighed and let sensation rule with her eyes half closed she could see the dark bronzed sweep of his hair as it brushed over her she could feel her heart racing pounding then his tongue traced over her nipple and her body contracted with a new dizzying surge of pleasure she moved with him as though the choreography between them had been long since plotted action and reaction move and countermove for maddy it was as effortless and natural as breathing wherever his desire took him wherever his needs led she was waiting willing hed never experienced anything anyone like her her body sizzled with heat he could feel the pulses throb wherever he touched whenever he tasted hed never known anyone so open to loving so free and uninhibited when she unhooked his slacks and drew them down her touch on his flesh was honest generous as though theyd known touched and taken from each other since time began his own pulse was raging she found it in the crook of his elbow and murmured as she pressed her lips against it when he was naked she looked at him with frank appreciation with an easy smile a gentle laugh she gathered him close embracing him with both passion and affection a shudder rippled through him leaving him dazed confused and aching for her kiss me again she murmured when he looked he saw her eyes half closed with that tawny feline look that shaded them so unexpectedly i love what happens to me when im kissing you she brought his face close and let herself be swept away ive wanted you to touch me she said against his lips sometimes id imagine what it would be like to have your hands on me here nearly purring she guided his hand and here i cant get enough she arched under him like a bow i dont think ill ever get enough something was slipping away from him the control he kept tightly locked on his emotions he couldnt afford to give her his heart couldnt trust her with the power that went with the gift instead he could give her the passion she sought and accepted so beautifully he pulled the silk pants off her watching as they glided erotically over her flesh the wisp that she wore beneath slid down and was discarded suddenly so suddenly he couldnt mark the change he was beyond being sensible beyond being reasonable desire for her for everything she was everything she offered clawed through his system perhaps this wasnt the kind of passion hed been prepared for but it raged through him too strong and real to be harnessed with her honesty and her zest for life shed begun this journey he wouldnt be merely a passenger here they would meet one to one he would finally set free the needs shed aroused in him from the first he forgot gentleness so that when his mouth crushed hers it was with rough desperation his hands always so careful raced over her until she was writhing and murmuring mindlessly beneath him with each movement each sigh his heart thudded faster pounding in his brain in a beat that somehow sounded like her name without hesitation she wrapped around him and he took her he heard a moan low in her throat before his own breath caught she was so warm so unbelievably soft and welcoming he struggled to regain that edge of control as her body began to move graceful as a waltz erotic as any primitive rite he moved above her wanting to see what the feel of him did to her pleasure shuddered over her face but her eyes stayed open and on his she trembled and the bedspread slithered through her fingers as she gripped it such power such strength nothing shed ever experienced could match it if shed left the world shed known she felt no need to return to it here she could remain here while centuries flew by then they were tangled tightly as the storm plucked them both up and threw them together her body tensed shivering on the edge before the release came in floods of unspeakable pleasure she would take the moon and the stars he offered maddy wrapped her arms around him and knew she would wait until he offered himself as well she was gone when he woke up reed felt the loss swiftly sharply when he turned toward where shed slept and found the bed beside him empty from the living room the stereo that had never been switched off droned out the sundaymorning news as he lay back and explored the feeling of emptiness why should he feel empty hed spent an exciting night with an exciting woman and now shed gone on her way that was what hed wanted that was the way the game was played throughout the night they had given each other comfort warmth and passion now the sun was up and it was over he should be grateful she took it all so casually that she could slip out the door without even a goodbye why should he feel empty he couldnt afford to regret that she wasnt there to give him a sleepy smile and snuggle against him he was the one who knew how transient and shallow relationships really were he should admire her for being honest enough to acknowledge that what had passed between them during the night had been nothing more than mutual physical release there had been no pledges given no pledges asked for just a few hours of mindless pleasure that required no excuses or explanations why should he feel so empty because she was gone and he wanted to hold her swearing reed pushed himself up in bed as he raked a hand through his hair he spotted a pool of pink silk on the floor beside the bed but she was gone reed tossed aside the sheet and got out of bed to pick up the slacks hed drawn slowly down maddys legs the night before even maddy couldnt get far without them he was still holding them when he heard his front door open reed tossed the slacks over the back of the chair beside the bed then reached for a robe he found her in the kitchen setting a brown grocery bag on the counter maddy she let out a muffled squeal and jumped back reed with a hand to her heart she closed her eyes a moment you scared me to death i thought you were sleeping and hed thought she was gone cautious he held himself back what are you doing i went out to get breakfast he didnt feel empty any longer but even as the pleasure came so did the wariness i thought youd left dont be silly i wouldnt just leave she combed her fingers through hair that hadnt yet seen a brush that morning why dont you get back in bed ill have this put together in a minute maddy he took a step forward then his gaze slid slowly down her body what are you wearing like it laughing she caught the hem of his shirt in her fingers and twirled around you have excellent taste reed i was very fashionable his shirt hung loose over her shoulders skimmed her thighs and made her look ridiculously attractive is that one of my ties she pressed her lips together to hold back a chuckle as she toyed with the thin black silk shed used to secure the shirt at the waist it was all i could find dont worry i can have it pressed her legs were long and smooth and bare he looked at them again and shook his head you went out like that nobody looked twice she assured him so easily he thought she probably believed it look im starving she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him with an easy affection that had his pulse thudding get back in bed and ill bring this in in a minute because he needed a minute to adjust he obliged her she wasnt gone reed thought as he sat back against the pillows she was here in his kitchen fixing breakfast as though it were the most natural thing in the world it pleased him it worried him he wondered what he was going to do about her ive got extra whipped cream if we need it maddy said as she walked in with a tray reed stared at the breakfast shed fixed as she scooted onto the bed and set the tray between them what is that sundaes she told him dipping a forefinger into a mound of whipped cream as she laid it on her tongue she let out a luxurious sigh of pleasure strawberry sundaes strawberry sundaes he repeated for breakfast is this the same maddy ohurley who worries constantly about nutrition and calories ice creams a dairy product she reminded him as she offered a spoon the berries are fresh what more do you need bacon and eggs much too much fat and cholesterol especially since it doesnt taste this good anyway im celebrating she dipped into her bowl celebrating what their eyes met quickly and held then she seemed to sigh how could he not know and because he didnt how could she explain you look wonderful i feel wonderful its sunday and the suns shining that should be enough maddy plucked a strawberry out of his bowl and offered it to him go ahead live dangerously he closed his lips over the berry drawing the tips of her fingers into his mouth briefly and i thought you subsisted on alfalfa sprouts and wheat germ i do most of the time thats why this is so great she let the ice cream rest cool on her tongue and closed her eyes usually i jog on sunday mornings reed sampled the ice cream himself jog only three or four miles she said with a shrug only she licked the back of her spoon clean but today im being decadent he skimmed a hand along her knee are you absolutely ill pay for it tomorrow so it has to be good did you plan to stay here and be decadent unless youd rather i go he linked his fingers with hers in an uncomplicated gesture that would have surprised him if hed realized hed done it no i dont want you to go the smile lighted her face i can be very decadent im counting on it maddy swirled her finger through the whipped cream then slowly very slowly licked it off you might be shocked when she dipped again reed took her wrist then brought the cream and her finger to his own mouth you think so he felt her pulse jump as he sucked lightly on her fingertips why dont we see picking up the tray he set it beside the bed her eyes were huge her body aching when he looked at her again i wondered how youd look in the morning tilting her head she lifted a brow how do i look fresh with the lightest of touches he stroked her cheek just a bit mussed appetizing she caught her tongue between her teeth i think i like the appetizing best you know maddy you never asked if you could borrow my shirt humor danced in her eyes again but she answered very seriously no i didnt did i that was rude i want it back he hooked his fingers in the neck of the shirt and drew her closer now now fast and hot anticipation rippled through her i suppose you want the tie as well i certainly do i guess youre entitled she murmured kneeling she loosened the knot slipped the silk off and handed it to him she reached for the buttons hesitated then began to unfasten them her gaze stayed steady on his as the shirt fell open to reveal a thin panel of flesh then she smiled as she let the material slide from her shoulders without any selfconsciousness she stayed as she was while he looked his fill then took the shirt by the collar and held it out kneeling in the center of the bed with sunlight streaming over her skin this is yours i believe he brushed the shirt aside rising on his knees to cup her shoulders in his hands im becoming fonder of whats inside he nipped at her chin as his hands slid down over her you have the most incredible body hard soft compact limber compelled he drew away just to look at her i wonder if maddy whats that youre wearing what a little dazed she followed his gaze downward oh thats a gstring of course havent you ever seen one his eyes came back to hers amused and intrigued as a matter of fact yes one wonders if you arent taking your role of the merry widow a bit too seriously you didnt say that while i was stripping for you she pointed out then linked her hands behind his neck i discovered gstrings when i was researching for the part researching he started to kiss her then drew back again exactly what does that mean just what it sounds like i couldnt go into a role like this without doing some research you went to strip joints caught between fury and frustration he took her chin firmly are you crazy do you know what can happen in places like that have you had a lot of experience yes no damn it maddy dont change the subject i didnt think i was she smiled at him again reed i had to get inside mary a bit i figured the best way to do it was to talk to some strippers i met some fascinating people there was one called lotta oomph lotta oomph maddy finished her gimmick was poodles see she had five poodles and i dont think i want to hear it though he wanted badly to laugh he held her firmly maddy youve no business going into that kind of place dont be silly i worked in places not much different than that when i was twelve its all fantasy reed for the most part all you have are people trying to make a living and talking with some of the women really helped me understand mary better mary is a fantasy he corrected what goes on in those places what can go on in those places is hard reality i understand reality very well reed she lifted a hand to his cheek touched that he would be concerned im not saying strippings an admirable profession or that every strippers another gypsy rose lee but most of the people i talked with took a great deal of pride in their act i dont intend to argue the morals or the social significance of exotic dancing maddy i just dont like the idea of you going into one of those joints downtown well i dont intend to make a habit of it she lowered her lashes trailing a finger down his chest i wouldnt mind seeing the poodles again maddy the lashes came up revealing laughter they were pretty amazing so are you he ran a hand over her hip where the thin string rested and whats the story on this comfort she began to nibble quietly on his earlobe every woman in america should wear a gstring you always wear one he spread his hand over her feeling soft skin firm muscle mmm under street clothes that day we went to see the exhibition of victorian architecture you had on those baggy khaki slacks that looked like army surplus they are army surplus you had one of these on underneath mmhmmm do you know what might have happened if id known content she rubbed her cheek against his what right there in front of the model of queen victorias summer home the giggle bubbled out as he scooped her up what with the family of four from new jersey right behind us oh god she wrapped her arms around him maybe we can go back this afternoon not a chance he buried his face in her throat he wasnt supposed to feel like laughing when he had a naked woman beneath him lovemaking was a serious business to be respected and treated with caution and care he wasnt supposed to feel like a teenager romping in a back seat on a darkened road he was a grown man experienced aware but when he rolled over on the bed with her the laughter was there it was there when he held her hard against him when she snuggled into him when he touched when she offered his delight in her was so great so immense that laughter seemed the only answer she accepted it so beautifully answering with laughter of her own even later not so very much later when laughter turned to sighs the joy wasnt dimmed there was so much love in her maddy wondered that it didnt burst out and light up the room every moment she was with him he grew just a little brighter every time he looked at her his eyes seemed to shimmer he was so kind so gentle so thorough so desperate with need for her if she hadnt already given him her heart she would have done so then just as freely how could she have known there was so much to discover so much pleasure so many sensations shed never shown that much generosity to another but with reed it was easy she knew her body intimately its strengths its weaknesses how strange it was to discover she had known so little about its needs when his mouth closed over her breast she felt incredible sensations tighten inside her pleasure pain desperation a stroke of his hand down her thigh made her shudder a brush of his lips at her throat made her moan the body she disciplined so religiously became a morass of needs of confusion of anticipation when he pressed against her touching him made her weak he was only flesh blood bone but stroking her hands over him made her spirit soar he was hers she told herself it didnt matter that it was only for the moment it didnt matter that it was only pretend he was hers as long as they were flesh to flesh mouth to mouth he needed her she could feel the rush of excitement move through him if even for one brief moment he untied the bonds on his emotions he could love her she was sure of it there was more than passion when he held her more than heat and lust there was caring and compassion when his lips brushed over hers when he allowed the kiss to deepen slowly until they were both swimming in it she knew that he was on the edge of giving her what she wanted so badly to give him love it healed it soothed it protected she wanted to tell him how wonderful it was to feel so irrevocably bound to another she wanted to offer him a glimpse of what it was to know there was someone there for him someone who would always be there his skin was hot and damp his hands lost their gentleness degree by degree as her excitement grew she was wild hungry avid her energy seemed boundless and pushed him farther and farther to the borders of his control the stereo blared on outside the heat rose in waves it didnt matter nothing mattered but them and what they could give each other she rolled over him arms and legs snaking out to hold him close agile and desperate she arched to take him into her when their sanity shattered then reformed they were still together limp drained glowing maddy lowered herself to him her skin was damp and seemed to fuse naturally with his she could hear his heartbeat through the dull buzzing in her head when his hand came to stroke her back she closed her eyes and surrendered everything oh reed i love you at first she was too caught up in her own dream to feel the stiffening of his body beneath hers she was too giddy to notice the quick tensing of his fingers on her back but gradually her mind cleared maddy kept her eyes closed a moment longer knowing that now the words had been said they couldnt be taken back im sorry she took a last long breath and looked up his expression was shuttered though they were still tangled together hed distanced himself im not sorry i said it or that i feel it im sorry you dont want it he told himself that the rush of feeling was regret not hope maddy i dont believe in catchphrases or the need for them catchphrases she shook her head as if to clear it you consider i love you a catchphrase what else taking her by the shoulders he shifted them both until they were sitting maddy we have something good between us lets not cover it with comfortable lies what she swallowed wasnt bitterness but hurt i dont lie reed something moved inside him something warm he didnt quite recognize it as another surge of hope before he forced it back fantasize then her voice was quiet not quite steady when she spoke again you dont believe i could love you loves just a word he rolled out of bed grabbing his robe again it exists certainly father to son mother to daughter brother to sister when it comes to a man and woman there are things like attraction infatuation even obsession they come and go maddy she could only stay where she was and stare at him you dont really believe that i know it he cut her off so sharply she flinched he regretted his harshness instantly but he swallowed the regret people come together because they want something from each other they stay together until they want something from someone else while theyre together they make promises they dont intend to keep and say things they dont mean because its expected i have no expectations suddenly cold she drew the sheet up to reed she looked terribly young and small and vulnerable ive never told another man that i loved him i dont suppose that matters he couldnt let it there was no way to explain it to her i dont want the words maddy he walked to the window his back to her why should he hurt he wondered he was only speaking the truth i cant give them back to you why i wonder determined not to cry she pressed the heels of her hands against her eyes for a moment what was it that happened to lock off your emotions reed whats made you so hellbent to stay untouched i said i loved you her voice rose as she allowed the fury to overwhelm the pain im not ashamed of it i didnt say it to pull some sort of declaration from you its simply the truth youre looking for lies where there arent any she wouldnt lose her temper she told herself as she drew breath in and out slowly but she wasnt finished they werent finished are you going to try to tell me you didnt feel anything just now do you really believe we had sex and nothing more when he turned his struggle was all internal nothing showed on his face i dont have anything more to give you take it or leave it maddy her fingers tightened on the sheet but she nodded i see i need some coffee he turned on his heel and left her alone his hands were shaking why did he feel as though everything hed said had been someone elses thoughts someone elses words what was wrong with him reed slammed the kettle on the burner then leaned both palms on the counter when shed said she loved him part of him had wanted and needed it part of him had believed it he was becoming a fool over her that had to stop he had a prime example of what happens to a man who trusts a woman who devotes his life to her reed had promised himself he wouldnt allow himself the same vulnerability maddy couldnt change that he couldnt let her she might actually believe she loved him it wouldnt take long for her to realize differently in the meantime they simply had to go on carefully and play by the rules he heard the front door open then close again for a long time reed simply stood there even when the water began to steam and boil he only stood there he knew she was gone this time and he felt hideously empty chapter nine i dont care if youve scheduled openheart surgery you are going to that party tonight maddy pulled on a hightop sneaker wanda whats the big deal no big deal wanda pulled maddys eyecovered sweatshirt over her head then studied the results youre going to go home and put on your fancy dress and party i just said i was a little tired and not in the mood for a party and i say youre sulking sulking eyes narrowed maddy pulled on her second shoe she was ready for a fight primed for it i dont sulk wanda plopped down beside her on the bench youre an expert at sulking dont push it wanda im in a very mean mood wanda seriously doubted that maddy could be mean if she took a course in it look if you dont want to talk about what a jerk your guy is fine hes not my guy whos not your guy frustration came out in a low whistle under her breath he he is not my guy i do not have a guy i do not want a guy therefore whoever he is he cant be mine uhhuh wanda examined her nails and decided that particular shade of red was very becoming but he is a jerk i didnt say her humor got the better of her and she grinned yeah hes a jerk honey they all are the point is mr valentine seniors throwing us this bash and the star of the show cant go home and pout in her bathtub i wasnt going to maddy tied an elaborate bow with her laces i was going to pout in bed wanda watched maddy tie her other shoe if you dont go im going to tell everyone in the company that you think youre too classy to party with us maddy snorted whod believe you everybody cause you wont be there maddy lunged off the bench and began to drag a brush through her hair look why dont you lay off because i like your face wanda only grinned when maddy scowled at her im just too tired to go thats all bull ive been rehearsing with you for weeks now you dont get tired maddy let the brush clatter into the sink in the reflection her eyes met wandas im tired tonight youre sulking tonight im not yes she was she admitted silently hell be there she blurted out i dont i just dont think i can handle it the saucy look was replaced by concern wanda rose to drape an arm around maddys shoulder hit hard yeah maddy pressed her fingers between her eyes real hard had a good cry yet no she shook her head fighting for composure i didnt want to be any more of a fool than i already was youre a fool if you dont cry it out wanda tugged her back to the bench sit down here and put your head on wandas shoulder i didnt think it would hurt so bad maddy managed as the tears started to fall who does keeping her voice quiet wanda patted her arm if we knew how bad it can be we wouldnt come within ten feet of a man but we keep going back because sometimes its the best there is it stinks to high heaven hes not worth crying over she wiped the back of her hand over her cheek not one of them is except of course the right one i love him wanda wanda carefully drew back far enough to study maddys face the real thing yeah she didnt bother to wipe the tears away again only he doesnt love me back he doesnt even want me to love him somehow i always thought when i got hit the other person would get hit too and wed go on to happyeverafter reed doesnt even think love exists thats his problem no its mine too because ive been trying for days and days to get over him and i cant she drew in a deep breath there would be no more tears so you see why i cant go tonight hell no i see why you have to go wanda look honey go home and bury your head in the sand and youre going to feel the same way tomorrow when she spoke again there was a toughness in her voice that made maddys spine straighten what do you do when an audience freezes up on you and sits there like a bunch of mummies i want to go stomp off to my dressing room but what do you do maddy sighed and brushed her hands over her damp face i stand onstage and sweat it out and thats what you have to do tonight and if im any judge of men hes going to be doing some sweating of his own i saw the way he watched you when he and his old man came to rehearsal come on lets get started weve got to get dressed maddy revved herself up to see reed again the same way she revved herself up to face an audience she told herself she knew her lines she knew her moves and if she made a mistake shed cover it before anyone noticed she chose a strapless dress that hugged her hips and draped sensuously down her body and was slit up the side to the middle of her thigh if she was going to flop she was going to look great doing it still as she stood in front of edwin valentines imposing front door she had to talk herself out of turning around and running for cover setting her chin she knocked she was prepared to face him again she was prepared to act casual and cool the one thing she wasnt prepared for was the possibility that reed would open the door himself she stared at him astonished at how much emotion could churn inside the human body he wondered why his fingers hadnt simply crushed the faceted glass knob he gripped as he looked at her hello maddy reed she wouldnt smile it simply wasnt possible just yet but she wouldnt collapse at his feet either i hope im not early no as a matter of fact my fathers been waiting for you then ill go say hello right away the blare of a trumpet pealed out from down the hall i take it the partys down there she skirted around him ignoring the knot in her stomach maddy bracing herself she looked carelessly over her shoulder yes are you how have you been busy the bell rang behind him and she lifted a brow it looks like youve got your hands full too see you later she walked blindly down the hall blinking furiously to clear her vision the party was in full swing maddy stepped into it and allowed herself to be caught up in the good feelings the excitement and the camaraderie she exchanged a few quick careless embraces and fended of a more intimate one from a member of the brass section i was beginning to think youd backed out wanda whod been talking to one of the musicians came up beside her a jerk of her head sending the horn player on his way nope nobody can call an ohurley a coward might help you to know that the younger valentine has been watching the door for the last half hour he has she started to turn around to look for him then stopped herself no it doesnt matter lets have a drink champagne yeah mr valentines a real sport you know hes a nice man wanda took a glass of champagne and downed it in one shot not stuffy he acts as though were real people we are real people dont spread that around a slow gleam came into wandas eyes as she looked over maddys shoulder theres phil ive decided to let him convince me he has serious intentions not necessarily honorable she added as her smile widened just serious phil interested maddy eyed the dancer who played wandas partner well does he maybe maybe not wanda grabbed another glass of champagne the funs in finding out wishing she could agree maddy turned to the buffet table where groups of hungry dancers crowded together eat drink and be merry she told herself for tomorrow we go to philadelphia maddy before she could choose between the pate and the quiche edwin came up behind her oh mr valentine what a great party edwin he corrected as he took her hand and kissed it in a courtly gesture that made her smile it has to be edwin if youre going to give me the dance you promised then its edwin and it will be my pleasure with a hand on his shoulder she moved into step with him i got in touch with my parents she began theyre in new orleans but theyre going to make it for opening night in philly i was hoping youd be there wouldnt miss it you know maddy this play is the best thing ive done for myself in years i thought it was time i let myself grow old you know thats the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard youre so young he patted the back of her waist where his hand guided her when you come up on sixty you look around and say to yourself okay its time to slow down now youve earned it you should relax and enjoy your waning years waning years she tossed her hair back and grinned at him phooey well thats about it he chuckled down at her and she wondered why reed hadnt inherited those kind dark eyes after id retired i realized i wanted a bit more than eighteen holes every wednesday i needed youth around me their vitality reeds always kept me young you know as much my best friend as my son a man couldnt do any better he loves you very much something in her tone had him glancing down yes he does i wanted to give him a chance with the business without me banging around poking into things hes done well more than well he said with a sigh reeds put his whole life into the business maybe thats a mistake he doesnt think so no i wonder well in any case until this play came along i didnt know what the hell i was going to do with myself now i think i found out broadway fever exactly somehow hed known she would understand him he could only hope she would understand his son as well once this plays established im going to hunt myself up another i figure ive got myself an expert whose opinion i can ask for and trust she saw the question in his eyes and nodded slowly if you want to play angel edwin ill be glad to play devils advocate i knew i could count on you ive been around entertainers all my life maddy made my living off them that kind of punch just cant be replaced with a golf ball he gave her a quick companionable pat lets get you something to eat a glance at the buffet table had her sighing my hero the music changed from mellow to manic as three members of the cast jumped together to belt out a medley of broadway hits it didnt take long for phil to pull wanda stage center for an impassioned pas de deux the chorus of cheers turned quickly into a challenge of champions as another couple swirled out come on maddy terry said taking her by the hand we cant let them show us up sure we can maddy told him and reached for the pate again no weve got a reputation to uphold remember the number from within reach that was the biggest bomb i ever rode into the ground so the play stunk he said easily but the dances we had together were terrific we got the only good reviews come on maddy for old times sake he tugged on her arm and grinned unable to resist maddy went into a series of pirouettes that ended with them caught close the few dancers who recognized the moves went into a round of applause it was a slow seductive number with long moves and extended holds that took perfect timing and muscle control the routine came back to her as though shed rehearsed it that afternoon rather than four years before the file simply clicked open and her body remembered she felt terry brace for the lift and plied to help him with the trust of dancer for dancer she arched back until her hair nearly swept the rug then she was laughing and bouncing back into his arms from the sheer fun of it maybe it wasnt such a bomb she said breathlessly baby it was atomic then he gave her a friendly pat on the rump as the music changed tempo and other dancers merged together reed was watching her when her gaze was drawn to his maddy felt the heat rise to her skin along with wishes and regrets thinking only of escape she turned and went through the doors onto the terrace the air was hot and sultry there as if it bounced off the pavement and rose up maddy leaned on the banister and gave in to it she absorbed the noise the movement and the life of the city beneath her she could need she could wish but she wouldnt regret steadying herself maddy drew on the strength shed been born with she wouldnt regret she knew reed had stepped onto the terrace behind her before he spoke it had been wrong of her to think of running to think of hiding in her apartment he was still what she wanted like it or not tell me if youd rather i go it was so like him she thought to lay the choices out front she turned and let herself look at him no of course not he curled his hands into his pockets are you generous with everyone maddy or most particularly with me i dont know ive never thought about it he walked over to the railing wanting to be just a bit closer ive missed seeing you id hoped you would the stars were out and the moon was full she had that to hold on to at least i was going to come here tonight and be very cool very breezy i dont seem to be able to carry it off i watched you dance with my father and you know what occurred to me when she shook her head he reached out compelled to touch her even just a wisp of her hair youve never danced with me she turned just enough to study his profile youve never asked me im asking now he held out his hand again leaving the choice up to her she set hers in it without a second thought they moved together until they were one shadow on the terrace floor when you left last week i thought it was for the best so did i he brushed his cheek over her hair there hasnt been a day that i havent thought of you there hasnt been a day that i havent wanted you slowly when he felt no resistance he lowered his mouth to hers her lips were as warm and welcoming as always her body fit to his as though fate had fashioned her for him or him for her the longings that raced through him brought on a panic he rigidly fought down maddy i want you to come back i want that too she lifted her hands to his cheeks but i cant he gripped her wrists as panic grew why because i cant keep to your terms reed i cant stop myself from loving you and you wont let yourself love me damn it maddy youre asking for more than i can give no she stepped a little closer and her eyes were bright and direct no id never ask for more than you were capable of giving any more than i can give you any less i love you reed if i came back i couldnt stop telling you you couldnt stop backing away from it i want you in my life desperation made his hands tense on her isnt that enough i wish i knew i want to be part of your life i want you to be part of mine marriage is that what you want he spun away to lean on the rail what the hell is marriage maddy an emotional commitment between two people who promise to do their best for better or for worse he turned back then but his face was in shadow and she could only read his voice how many of them last only the ones that people work hard enough at i suppose only for the ones that care enough many dont last the institution doesnt mean anything its a legal contract broken by another legal contract the first of which is usually broken morally dozens of times in between part of her heart broke for him just hearing what he said reed you cant generalize that way how many happy marriages can you name how many lasting ones he corrected forget the happiness reed thats ridiculous i cant even think of one he said her temper snapped into place of course i can the the gianelliss on the first floor of my building the ones who shout at each other constantly they like to shout it makes them deliriously happy to shout because shed begun to shout herself she spun on her heel and racked her brain damn it if you werent quizzing me i wouldnt have such a hard time at it ozzie and harriet give it a break maddy no setting her hands on her hips she glared at him jimmy stewarts been married for a hundred and fifty years umm queen elizabeth and prince philip are doing pretty good my parents for gods sake she continued warming up theyve been together forever my greataunt jo was married for fiftyfive years had to work at it didnt you he came out of the shadows then and what she saw in his eyes was cynicism youd have an easier time coming up with marriages that crumbled all right i would it doesnt mean you give up on the system because the people involved in it make mistakes besides i didnt ask you to marry me i just asked you to feel he caught her before she could storm inside again are you going to tell me marriage isnt what you want she stood toetotoe with him no im not going to tell you that i cant promise marriage i admire you as a woman and as a performer im attracted to you i need you all those things are important reed but theyre only enough for a little while if i hadnt fallen in love with you we could both be happy with that i dont think i can handle too much more she turned and gripped the railing as if it were a lifeline please just go it wasnt easy to fight her when he seemed to be fighting himself as well the moves werent clear the next step wasnt as well defined as it should have been seeing no other way reed backed off its not finished no matter how much both of us would like it otherwise maybe not she drew in a breath but ive made a fool of myself in front of you for the last time leave me alone now the moment he left she shut her eyes tight she would not cry as soon as she could pull herself together she was going back inside to make her excuses and go home she wasnt running away she was simply facing reality maddy she turned and faced edwin one look told her she didnt need to paste on a bright smile im sorry i listened to a great deal of that and youve a right to be angry with me but reeds my son and i love him im not angry indeed she found she couldnt dredge up any emotions at all i just have to go ill take you home no you have guests she gestured inside ill catch a cab theyll never miss me he stepped forward to take her arm i want to take you home maddy theres a story you should hear they spoke very little on the way home edwin seemed to be lost in thoughts of his own maddy had lost her knack for bright witty conversation his only comment as they started up the stairs to her apartment was on the lack of security youre becoming more wellknown every time you step out onstage maddy theres a price to be paid for that she glanced around the dimly lighted hallway as she reached for her keys shed never been afraid here yet somehow shed known that her time in the freemoving transient world of the gypsies was almost up ill fix tea she left edwin to wander the cramped living room this suits you maddy he said a few moments later its friendly bright honest the glow of neon made him smile as he settled into a chair im going to embarrass you and tell you how much i admire what youve done with your life you dont embarrass me i appreciate it talent isnt always enough i know ive watched many many talented people slip away into oblivion because they didnt have the strength or the confidence to make it to the top youre there and you havent even noticed yet i dont know about my reaching the top she skirted the breakfront carrying a tray but im happy where i am thats the beauty of it maddy you like where you are you like yourself he accepted the cup of tea but put a hand lightly on hers reed needs you maybe on some levels she retreated a little because it hurt too much i found out that i need more than that so does he maddy so does he but hes too stubborn and maybe too afraid to admit it i dont understand why i dont understand how he can be so she cut herself off swearing im sorry dont be i think i understand maddy has reed ever told you about his mother no thats one of the handsoff subjects between us i think you have a right to know he sighed and sipped his tea knowing he was about to stir unwanted and painful memories of his own if i werent sure you really cared for him and that you were really right for him i could never tell you this edwin i dont want you to tell me something reed would resent me knowing your concern for him is why im going to tell you he set down his cup and leaned forward something told maddy there would be no going back reeds mother was a stunning woman is a stunning woman still im sure though i havent seen her in many years has reed no he refuses to refuses to see his mother how could he once i explain maybe youll understand there was a weariness in his voice that made her heart go out to him without question i married elaine when we were both very young i had some family money and she was a struggling singer working the clubs you understand yes of course she had talent nothing showstopping but with the right management she could have made a solid living i decided to give her that right management then i decided to marry her it was almost as calculated as that im sorry to say because i was used to getting what i wanted for a year or two it worked she was grateful for what i was doing for her career i was grateful to have a beautiful wife i loved her and i worked very hard to make her a success because thats what she wanted most somewhere along the line things began to change elaine was impatient edwin sat back again sipping tea as he looked around maddys apartment hed given his wife all he could yet shed never been satisfied she was young he said knowing it was no real excuse she wanted better bookings and began to resent the fact that i was advising her on her clothes her hair she began to think that i was holding her back using her to further my own career she couldnt have understood you very well he smiled at that not everyone was willing to give such unconditional support perhaps not but then i didnt understand her either our marriage was in trouble id almost accepted the fact that it was ending when she told me she was going to have a child youre a modern woman maddy and a compassionate one you should be able to understand that while i very much wanted children had always wanted them elaine didnt maddy looked down at her tea sympathizing with edwin i can only feel sorry for someone who didnt or for whatever reason couldnt want the child she carried it was the right answer he closed his eyes on it elaine was desperate for success she had reed i think because she was afraid to do otherwise i had gotten her a small recording contract her decision to stay with me and have reed was more a career move than anything else you still loved her i still had feelings for her and there was reed when he was born i felt as though id been given the greatest gift a son someone who would love me accept the love i wanted to give back he was beautiful a wonderful baby who grew into a wonderful child my life changed the moment he was born i wanted to give him everything i had a kind of focus that hadnt been there before i could lose a client i could lose a contract but my son was always there families keep our feet on the ground yes they do before i go on i want you to know that reed has never given me anything but pleasure i never considered him a duty or a burden you dont have to tell me that i can see it he rubbed his hand over his temple then continued when he was five i was in an accident they did a lot of tests on me in the hospital his voice was changing maddy tensed without knowing why one of the byproducts of the testing was a report that i was sterile her hand grew damp on the cup and she set it down i dont understand i couldnt have children his eyes were direct intense id never been able to have them the cold gripped her squeezing her stomach into a frigid knot reed with the one word she asked all the questions and gave nothing but love i didnt father him it was a blow i cant describe to you oh edwin she rose immediately to kneel in front of him i confronted elaine she didnt even try to lie i think shed grown tired of the lies by then the marriage had been over and she knew shed never hit it big as an entertainer thered been another man one whod left her as soon as hed learned she was pregnant his breath came out in a slow painful stream it must have been a terrible blow to her shed known i wouldnt question but simply accept the child as mine moreover shed known inside shed known that shed never have gotten out of those dreary little clubs without me so shed stuck she must have been a very unhappy woman not everyone finds contentment easily elaine was too restless to do anything but look for it if she wasnt satisfied shed move on when i got out of the hospital she was gone reed was staying with a neighbor he drew a deep breath because after all the years that had passed it still hurt maddy shed told him oh my god she dropped her head on his knee and wept for all of them poor little boy i didnt do much better by him edwin laid a hand on her hair he hadnt realized how cleansing it would be to speak of it aloud after all those years i needed to get away so i paid the neighbor and left him there i was gone nearly a month pulling money together to finance valentine records until i met your family im not sure i had any intention of going back its hard to forgive myself for that you were hurt you reed was devastated he said i hadnt considered the effect it would have on him id thrown myself into the hustling game and tried to block out what id left behind then i met your parents for just one night i saw what family meant rubbing a hand over her wet cheek she looked up and you slept on a cot in their room i slept on a cot and watched the love your parents had for each other and for their children it was as though someone had drawn a curtain aside to let me see what life really meant what was really important i broke down your father took me out to a bar and i told him everything god knows why pops easy to talk to he listened to all of it sympathized some but not as much as i thought i deserved after all the years that had passed edwin could remember and even laugh a little he had a shot of whiskey in his hand he downed it slapped me on the shoulder and told me i had a son to think of and that i should go home to him he saw clean through it and he was right ive never forgotten what he did for me just by speaking the truth she took his hands now holding tight and reed he was my son always had been always would be my son i was a fool to have forgotten that you hadnt forgotten she murmured i dont think youd forgotten no he felt the smoothness and strength of her hands in his in my heart i hadnt i drove back he was playing in the yard alone this boy not quite six turned and looked at me with adult eyes a shudder moved through him quick and violent ive never been able to wipe out that one moment when i saw what his mother and i had done to him youve no cause to blame yourself no she added before edwin could speak again ive seen you and reed together youve no cause to blame yourself i did everything i could to make it up to him to make things normal in fact it didnt take me very long to forget what his mother had done reed never forgot he still carries that bitterness maddy that i saw in his eyes when he was five years old what youve told me helps me to understand a great deal taking a deep breath she sat back on her heels but edwin i dont know what i can do you love him dont you yes i love him youve given him something hes beginning to trust in someone dont take it away now he doesnt want what i have to give him he does and hell come around just dont give up on him she rose and wrapped her arms around herself then turned away are you so sure im what he needs hes my son as she turned back slowly edwin rose yes im sure he wasnt asleep he couldnt sleep reed had nearly given in to the urge to lose himself in a bottle of scotch but he decided misery was better company hed lost her because they hadnt been able to accept each other for what they were hed lost her oh she was better off without him that he was certain of yet shed been the best thing that had ever happened to him hed hurt her just as hed known he would but wasnt it strange how much he hurt too shed be gone tomorrow he told himself the best thing to do was to forget and to put the handling of the play and the cast album in his fathers hands hed divorce himself from it and therefore purge himself of memories of maddy ohurley he started to cross to the windows but remembered how maddy had been drawn to them swearing he paced away again the knock on the door surprised him he didnt often have visitors at one in the morning he didnt want visitors he thought and ignored the knock it continued to sound stubbornly annoyed reed yanked the door open with the intention of blasting anyone who had the misfortune to be there hi maddy stood with a dance bag slung over her shoulders and her hands dipped into the pockets of a wide denim skirt maddy i was in the neighborhood she began and walked past him into the apartment i decided to drop in i didnt wake you did i no i good im always cranky when someone wakes me up so she tossed her bag down how about a drink what are you doing here i told you i was in the neighborhood crossing to her he held her by the shoulders and kept her still what are you doing here she tilted her head i couldnt keep away from you before he could prevent it his hand had reached for her cheek he dropped it again maddy a few hours ago i said a lot of things she finished for him they were all true i love you reed i want to marry you i want to spend my life with you and i think we could do a pretty good job of it but until you think so well just have to coast youre making a mistake she rolled her eyes reed youre putting those scratchy clothes on me again if we were married maybe just maybe you could suggest what was best for me as things stand i make my own decisions i really would like a drink got any diet soda no all right whiskey then reed its very rude to refuse to serve a guest a drink he continued to hold her a moment longer then gave in and lowered his forehead to hers i do need you maddy i know she lifted her hands to his face i know you do im glad you know it if i could give you what you wanted weve talked about it enough for now im leaving for philadelphia tomorrow dancing to the piper he murmured thats right and im going to work my tail off so i dont want to talk i dont want to argue not tonight all right ill get us a drink he moved over to the bar and chose a decanter you know reed its still a very odd feeling for me to take my clothes off onstage he had to laugh somehow she always made him laugh i imagine it is i mean i wear a bodysuit and spangles and dont expose more than i would on a public beach but its the act itself thats odd i have to pull this off in front of several hundred people in a few days that means practice practice practice when he turned back she was smiling at him and slowly unbuttoning her blouse i thought you might give me an unbiased opinion on my stage presence strippings an art you know she ran a hand down the center of her body as her blouse parted titillating she turned her back and looked at him over her shoulder fanciful she let the blouse slip gently away what do you think i think youre doing great so far i just want to be sure i make mary realistic she loosened the tie on her skirt and let it fall as she turned back the brief black merry widow she wore had him setting down his glass before he dropped it ive never seen you wear anything like that this she passed a hand down her body again not really my style not comfortable enough but for mary she bent from the waist and unhooked a garter from the sheer black stocking its sort of a trademark she straightened again and ran both hands through her hair in an upward motion do you think itll sell im thinking that if you wear that onstage ill strangle you with a laugh she unhooked the second garter then slowly rolled the stocking down her leg you have to remember im mary once the curtains up and im going to help make your play a hit she tossed the stocking at him then began the same routine on the other its too bad i dont have a more voluptuous figure yours does very well do you think still smiling she began to unhook the lace covering her breasts reed i hate to be a pest but you havent given me that drink sorry he picked up her glass and carried it to her maddy took it and for a moment the humor in her eyes turned into something deeper this ones for my pop she said and touched her glass to his what you dont have to understand she smiled again and tossed back the shot of whiskey it poured through her like lava what do you think of the show so far worth the price of a ticket hed meant to be gentle hed wanted to be tender to show her how much her coming back to him meant but the hands that dived into her hair were tense and urgent ive never wanted you more she tilted her head back and let her empty glass fall carelessly to the carpet show me he dragged her against him desperate the sting of whiskey clung to her lips intoxicating her arms went around him welcoming the rage of desire it was the first time the only time she had felt him come to her without control her blood began to pound with anticipation of facing unleashed passion when he pulled her to the floor she went willingly his hands were everywhere touching stroking pressing he lifted her up to a blinding peak where she could only gasp his name and ask for more there was more much more impatient he tugged at the remaining hooks freeing her body to his just as urgent her fingers tore at the belt of his robe until she found warm naked flesh and muscle the carpet was smooth at her back his body was hard against hers she heard her name whispered through his lips harshly then he was filling her it had never been so fast before so furious so unrestrained heedlessly she threw herself into the whirl of pleasure her body shook and so did his love and passion mixed so intimately that she couldnt tell one from the other and no longer tried she was there for him as long as he accepted her arms around him he was there for her chapter ten wed be better off walking maddy slowed and steered through yet another pothole before she tossed a grin at wanda wheres your sense of adventure i lost it a mile back in that ditch we went through it wasnt a ditch maddy corrected as she maneuvered her way through downtown philadelphia traffic why dont you look out the window and tell me when we pass something of great historical significance i cant look out the window wanda folded her long legs into a more comfortable position it wasnt easy as maddy had chosen to rent a nifty little compact with bucket seats that all but sat on the dash it makes me seasick when the buildings bounce up and down its not the buildings its the car that too wanda grabbed the doorhandle for support why did you rent this heap anyway because i never get to drive in new york is that independence hall when maddy craned her neck around wanda gave her a nonetoogentle shove on the shoulder honey you watch the road if you want to get back to new york maddy bumped to a stop at a light i like driving she said breezily some people like jumping out of planes wanda muttered id have a car in new york if i thought i would ever have a chance to use it how much time do we have fifteen funfilled minutes wanda braced herself as maddy shot forward again i know i should have asked this before i got in the car but whens the last time you drove oh i dont know a year maybe two i think we should try some of those little shops on south street after rehearsal if we live to see it wanda mumbled then pressed the invisible brake on her side as maddy whipped around a sedan you know maddy the man on the street probably would think youre about the happiest human being alive somebody who knows you a bit better might tell you that your smiles going to crack around the edges if you dont ease up maddy downshifted as the car jittered over yet another pothole that obvious obvious enough whats going on with you and mr wonderful maddy let out a long sighing breath one day at a time and youre the type who needs to have a good grip on next week it was true too true but she shook her head he has a good reason for feeling the way he does but that doesnt change the way you feel i guess not you know wanda i never really used to believe it when people said life was complicated stop me if i get too personal she began and wanda merely shrugged when you were married before did you think it was forever wanda pursed her lips i guess you could say i did and he didnt well would you i mean if you met someone you really cared about would you get married again instinctively wanda started to laugh then thought better of it if there was someone who made everything click i might do it but id think about it for longer no hell i wouldnt either id dive in with both feet why because there arent any guarantees if i thought i had a chance id take it like the lottery werent you suppose to turn there turn oh damn muttering to herself maddy bumped her way around the block now well be late better that you get whats on your mind out of your system first anyway i was just hoping hed be here maddy turned again and got back on track i know he couldnt very well spend the whole week down here while were in rehearsal but wed kind of planned that he would come today noshow something came up he was vague about it something about some problem with playlists and promoters or something weve all got a job to do kid yeah with maneuvering even wanda had to admire maddy squeezed into a minuscule parking space right across from the theater i guess i better think about my own two more full rehearsals and were on dont remind me wanda set a hand on her stomach every time i think about it a lands in my gut youre going to be great maddy stepped out of the car and slammed the door at the end of the block someone was selling cut flowers she made a mental note to treat herself after rehearsal were going to be great im going to hold you to that the last play i was in closed after two performances i gave serious thought to sticking my head in the oven but it was electric tell you what maddy paused by the stage door and grinned if we flop you can use mine ive got gas thanks a lot thats what friends are for maddy pushed open the door took one step inside then let out a whoop with some curiosity wanda watched her launch down the corridor and fling herself at a group of people youre here youre all here and where else would we be frank ohurley picked up his baby girl and swung her in a circle but all of you the minute her feet touched the floor maddy grabbed her mother and squeezed her ribs until they threatened to crack you look great absolutely great so do you molly returned the hug and late for rehearsal as usual missed my turn driving here oh abby she reached for her sister hugged and held on im so glad you could come i was afraid you wouldnt be able to get away from the farm itll be there when we get back how often does my sister have an opening night but concern clouded abbys eyes she knew her sister as well as she knew herself and she didnt think the tension she felt from maddy had anything to do with professional nerves still hugging abby maddy grabbed for her brotherinlaws hand dylan thanks for bringing her i think it was the other way around with a laugh he kissed maddys cheek but youre welcome its too bad she began with a wink to abby that you couldnt bring the boys were right here deliberately maddy looked in the opposite direction did i hear something we came too were going to new york i could have sworn i maddy let her words trail off as she focused on her nephews carefully she kept her face blank for a moment then widened her eyes you cant be ben and chris can you theyre just little boys youre both much too tall to be ben and chris we are too chris piped up we grew taking her time maddy studied both of them no fooling come on maddy though he tried not to look too pleased ben grinned and shuffled his feet you know its us youre going to have to prove it to me give me a hug she bent down to hold them both tight we rode on a plane chris began i got to sit by the window miss ohurley they want you in wardrobe shoot maddy released her nephews and straightened look where are you all staying theres a whole list of hotels on the call board i can were booked in your hotel molly told her now go on well have plenty of time okay are you going to stay for rehearsal think they could stop us frank asked when she heard her name again she started down the hall walking backward to keep them in view just a moment longer as soon as im done were going to celebrate im buying frank chuckled and draped an arm over his wifes shoulders does she think wed argue with that lets go get a frontrow seat mr selby to see you sir hannah kept a cool professional smile on her face as she ushered selby into reeds office thank you hannah hold my calls there would be no tray of coffee and sweet rolls today reed caught hannahs look of disapproval before she shut the door sit down selby i guess your old mans proud of you selby cast a look around the office before he settled himself comfortably youve kept the label right up top heard you signed that little group from dc a risky move reed merely lifted a brow and held his gaze steady he knew galloway had offered the group a contract valentine had simply offered them a better one we dont mind a few risks always a headache to get the stations to put new talent on their playlist a record from an unknowns going to die without solid promotion selby took out a small thin cigar then fiddled with his lighter thats why im here i thought it would be wise if we talked before the riaa meeting this afternoon reed continued to sit back waiting for selby to light his cigar hed known as soon as selby had requested an appointment that the other man was running scared the recording industry association of america didnt have closed meetings every day those involved were aware that the label heads would vote on whether the organization should investigate independent promoters some major record companies galloway included still used the independents though the shadow of scandal payola and kickbacks lurked around the edges of their profession look valentine selby began when reed remained silent neither of us started in this business yesterday we know what the bottom line is airplay without airplay on the important stations a record dies he was sweating reed observed calmly beneath the trendy pastel suit and the sunlamp tan nerves ran hot just what would a full investigation mean to galloway reed speculated when you pay for airplay selby youre riding a sick horse sooner or later its going to fall down under you letting out a quick stream of smoke selby leaned forward we both know how the system works if it means slipping a few hundred to a program director who does it hurt and if it means threatening that same program director if he doesnt play ball thats nonsense but there was a tiny bead of sweat on his temple if it is an investigation will clear it up in the meantime valentine records will get its new releases played without independents throwing the baby out with the bathwater selby snapped then rose top stations report their playlist to the trades if a new release doesnt hit the trades it might as well not exist thats the system maybe the system needs a little reworking just as narrowminded and straight as your old man a ghost of a smile touched reeds lips thank you its easy for you isnt it bitter selby turned on reed you sit here in your cozy little office never getting your hands dirty your daddy did that for you reed checked his temper if you look he said quietly youll see my fathers hands are clean valentine doesnt and never has run its business on payola kickbacks or heavyhanded threats youre not so lilywhite valentine lets just say that in an hour valentine records will vote for a full investigation itll never fly selby smirked as he crushed out his cigar but his hands werent steady hed come to reed because valentine had the reputation and power to sway the vote now he was choking selby loosened the careful knot of his tie too many labels know where the breads buttered even if you probe i wont lose oh a few heads will roll down the line but mine wont ten years ago galloway was a holeinthewall today its one of the top names in the business i made it because i played the game i watched the angles when the dust settles valentine im still going to be on top im sure you will reed murmured as selby stormed out of his office men like that never paid for their actions they had plenty of fall guys and scapegoats littering their path if reed had wanted a personal vendetta he could have initiated an investigation of his own already he had information on a disc jockey whod been beaten allegedly for not playing certain releases there was the program director in new jersey whose wife had been threatened there was another who made frequent trips to vegas traveling firstclass and gambling heavily more heavily than his annual salary would permit part of the game not a game reed cared to play but it was unlikely selby would pay for his actions did anyone rising he checked the contents of his briefcase it was true that he had come into a business that had already been well established he hadnt had to hustle his way to a label if he had would he have scrambled for a shortcut because he didnt know couldnt be sure reed decided to leave the investigation up to the riaa hed let the dust settle it would be a long probably ugly meeting reed thought as he stepped out of his office i wont be back today hannah good luck mr valentine you had a few calls while you were talking to that man his mouth twitched a little at her tone anything important no nothing that cant wait you did get a call from miss ohurley hannah sent him an entirelytooinnocent smile and hoped for a reaction the fact that he hesitated told hannah everything she needed to know if she calls back tell her yes mr valentine tell her ill get back to her disappointment ruled for a moment ah mr valentine yes she could see the impatience but pressed just a little further i wondered if you were going to philadelphia for the opening or if perhaps youd like me to send flowers he thought of the meeting he had to deal with of the work that couldnt be ignored he thought of maddys face and the confusion that had been dogging him for days her feelings his his needs hers were they really the same or were they so totally opposed that they could never come together my fathers going if i dont well be represented i see hannah said primly and stacked papers on her desk ill take care of the flowers myself see that you do she muttered as he went out the glass doors it had gone well maddy dropped crosswise on her bed and let the rehearsal play back in her head she wouldnt jinx it by saying it was perfect but she could think it as long as she thought it very quietly tomorrow night tomorrow night at this time she thought with a little skip of the pulse shed be in her dressing room twentyfour hours she rolled onto her back and stared at the ceiling how in the hell was she going to get through the next twentyfour hours he hadnt called back maddy shifted her head so that she could look at the phone again they had only spoken to each other a handful of times since shed left for philadelphia and every time they had shed sensed he was trying to distance himself from her maybe hed succeeded a dancer was no stranger to pain you felt it acknowledged it then went on and worked around it heartache might be a little more difficult to deal with than a pulled muscle but she would go on survive shed always prided herself on being a survivor her family was here rousing herself from the bed maddy went to the closet she would change put on her happiest face and take her family out on the town not everyone was as lucky as she maddy reminded herself as she stripped out of her sweats she had a family who loved her who stood behind her who thought she was just fine the way she was she had a career that was on the rise even if she lost her grip on the brass ring no one could take her dancing away from her if she had to go back and play the clubs again do regional theater summer stock shed still be happy maddy ohurley didnt need a man to complete her life because her life was complete she didnt want a knight on a white charger to scoop her up and take her away from all this she liked where she was who she was if reed backed out of her life she could she leaned back against the closet door with a sigh she could very possibly be the most miserable person alive no she didnt need him to save or protect her she needed him to love her and though she didnt think he could understand she needed him to let her love him when she heard the knock on her door maddy shook herself out of what was dangerously close to depression who is it its abby leaving her robe untied maddy dashed to the door abby stood there looking fresh and quietly lovely in a slim white dress oh youre all ready i havent even started i dressed early so i could come down and talk before you say anything i have to tell you how wonderful you look maybe its dylan maybe its the country air but youve never looked better maybe its pregnancy what i found out right before we left home she took maddy by the shoulders looking as though she could take on the world im going to have another baby oh god oh abby thats great im going to cry okay lets sit down while you do maddy searched fruitlessly in her robe pocket for tissue how does dylan feel about it stunned abby laughed as they sat together on the bed her eyes were soft the hint of rose under her skin enhanced the curve of her cheeks she pushed her wavy blond hair behind her back before she took maddys hands were going to make the announcement at dinner tonight and youre going to start taking better care of yourself no more mucking out the stalls i mean it abby she continued before her sister could speak if i have to lecture dylan i will you dont have to hed like to wrap me up in tissue for the next seven months or so we werent made for that maddy you know we werent maybe not but you can ease off she threw her arms around her sister and squeezed im so happy for you i know now i want you to talk to me firm abby straightened her back chantel called me and said you were making yourself crazy over some man she would maddy muttered im not making myself crazy over anything its not my style abby supped off her shoes who is he his names reed valentine valentine records thats right how do you know i still keep up with the industry a little and dylan worked with him on a book some time ago yes reed mentioned it and and nothing i met him i fell in love with him i made a fool of myself she tried to keep her voice careless and light and nearly succeeded now im sitting here staring at the phone waiting for him to call like a teenager you never had much of a chance to be a teenager when you were sixteen i dont care much for it hes a good man abby kind and gentle though hed never see that in himself can i tell you about him you know you can she started at the beginning and left nothing out it never occurred to her that she was betraying reeds privacy in truth she wasnt whatever she said to abby or to chantel was like telling her thoughts to herself abby listened in her calm serene way while maddy told her everything the love the compromises the trauma that had marred reeds childhood and affected his life because they were so in tune with each other abby hurt when her sister did so you see no matter how much i love him i cant change what happened to him or how he feels im sorry they shifted together with abbys arm around maddys shoulder i know how painful it is i can only tell you that i know absolutely that if you love hard enough you can work miracles dylan didnt want to love me the truth is i didnt want to love him either it was easy to look back and remember wed both made a decision never to risk that kind of involvement again it was a very logical decision made by two intelligent people she smiled a little leaning her head against maddys love has a way of wiping out everything but what really matters ive tried to tell myself that but abby he wasnt dishonest with me right from the start he made it clear that he didnt want to get involved it was to be a very casual relationship which of course isnt a relationship at all im the one who stepped over the line so im the one who had to make the adjustments thats also very logical what happened to your optimism maddy i left it in a drawer at home then its time you pulled it out again this isnt like you mooning around looking at the dark side you were the one who always planted her feet and refused to budge until things worked out your way this is different no its not dont you know how much ive always wanted to be as confident of myself as you are i always envied that quality in you maddy when day after day i went on afraid of failing oh abby its true and you cant let me down now if you love him really love him then youve got to plant your feet until he can admit he loves you too he has to feel it first abby i think he does she gave her sister a quick shake go back over everything youve just told me but this time listen the mans crazy about you maddy he just hasnt been able to admit it to you or to himself hope never far beneath the surface began to stir again ive tried to believe that dont try do ive had the worst a relationship can offer maddy now im having a taste of the best instinctively she rested a hand on her stomach where a new life slept dont give up but ill be damned if im going to sit here and watch you wait for him to toss you a few crumbs get dressed abby ordered were going to celebrate bossy maddy grinned as she walked to her closet you always were bossy reed let the phone ring a dozen times before he hung up it was nearly midnight where the hell was she why wasnt she in bed resting up for the next day the one thing he knew about her was absolutely certain of was that maddy trained for a part as rigorously as an athlete training meant diet exercise attitude and rest so where the hell was she in philadelphia he thought disgusted as he walked to the windows and back again she was miles away in philadelphia in her own world with her own people she could be doing anything with anyone and he had no right to question her the hell with rights he told himself as he picked up the phone again she was the one who spoke of love of commitments of trust and she was the one not answering her phone he could still remember how disappointed shed looked when hed told her he couldnt be sure hed be there for opening night hed had the damn riaa meeting hanging over his head and he still couldnt judge the backlash from it there was bound to be a scandal now that the investigation had been approved a scandal would affect everyone every label every record company executive even the ones whod kept their noses clean in the morning he was likely to have dozens of calls from reporters radio stations consulting firms his own employees he couldnt very well drop everything and go off to watch the opening of a play not just any play he thought as the phone rang on and on maddys play no his play reed reminded himself as he slammed the phone down again valentine records was backing it and therefore had a duty to protect its interests his father would be there that would be enough but he was president of valentine reed reminded himself was he excusing himself from going or from remaining behind it really didnt matter none if it really mattered at all what mattered was why maddy wasnt answering the phone at midnight she had a right to her own life the hell she did reed ran a hand through his hair he was acting like a fool trying to calm himself he walked over to pour himself a drink and the plant caught his eye there were new green shoots spreading out young and healthy the old yellowed leaves had fallen off and been swept away compelled he reached out to stroke one of the smooth heartshaped leaves a minor miracle perhaps but it was only a plant after all a very stubborn plant he conceded one that had refused to die when it should have one that had responded wholeheartedly to the proper care and attention so he had luck with plants deliberately he turned away and stared at his empty apartment it wouldnt be wise to make too much of its having been maddys just as it wasnt wise to make too much out of the fact that she wasnt in her room he had other things to think about other things to do but he left the drink untouched the room was pitchdark when knocking disturbed her sleep maddy rolled over snuggled into the pillow and prepared to ignore it when it continued she shook herself awake half believing it was a cue it was the middle of the night she reminded herself with a huge yawn she had hours yet before she had to step out onstage but the knocking was definitely at her door and getting louder every minute all right she called out irritably and rubbed her eyes open if one of the dancers had the jitters she was going to send her back to her own room to sleep it off she couldnt afford to be a pillar of strength at three am just hang on will you muttering she found the light switch then hunted up a robe she unlocked her door then pulled it open until the chain snapped into place now look reed instantly awake maddy slammed the door in his face and fumbled with the chain when she pulled it open again she jumped into his arms youre here i didnt think youd be here id nearly gotten used to the idea that you werent coming no i hadnt she corrected immediately and found his lips with hers she felt it the need the tension reed what are you doing here at three in the morning do you mind if i come in of course not she stepped back and waited while he tossed a small overnight bag on a chair is something wrong she began then tugged at his shirt oh god is something wrong with your father reed no my fathers fine he should be here tomorrow her fingers relaxed but stayed where they were youre upset im fine he moved back from her and walked around the room shed already made it her own he noticed with tights socks shoes strewn here and there the dresser was a rubble of bottles and pots and scraps of paper shed spilled a bit of powder and hadnt bothered to dust it off he ran a finger through it and her scent dung to his skin i couldnt reach you tonight oh i was out having dinner with you dont owe me an explanation furious though only with himself he whirled around she pushed the hair away from her face and wished she understood him it was three in the morning she reminded herself he was obviously edgy she was tired it would be best to take it slow all right reed youre not going to tell me you drove all the way to philadelphia because i didnt answer the phone even as he stared at her he saw puzzlement turn to humor and humor to pleasure you did going to him she slipped her arms around him pressing her cheek to his chest thats about the nicest thing anyones ever done for me i dont know what to say i but when she looked up she saw it in his eyes all the pleasure drained from hers as she backed away you thought i was with someone else her voice was very quiet the words very distinct you thought i was sleeping with someone else so you came to see for yourself a bitter taste rose in her throat it was a taste shed rarely sampled she gestured toward the empty bed sorry to disappoint you dont he grabbed her wrist before she could turn away because hed already seen the tears welling in her eyes that wasnt it or damn it maybe it was part of it part of what went through my mind youd have a perfect right thank you she pulled her wrist away and sat on the edge of the bed but she couldnt stop the tears now that youve satisfied yourself why dont you go i need my sleep i know he ran both hands though his hair before he sat beside her i know that and when it was late and i couldnt reach you i wondered when her eyes lifted to his he cursed himself all right i did wonder if you were with someone else i dont have any hold on you maddy youre an idiot i know that too just give me a minute anticipating her reed took both her hands before she could refuse please i did wonder and i hated the idea then i worried the whole time i was driving here i worried that something had happened to you dont be ridiculous what could happen nothing anything his hands tightened on hers in frustration i just had to be here to see you the anger was draining but she didnt know what would rise up to replace it well youve seen me now what thats up to you no she pulled away again and rose i want you to tell me i want you to look at me right now and tell me what it is you want i want you he rose slowly i want you to let me stay not to make love with you maddy just to be here she could easily allow the hurt to overwhelm her she could just as easily toss her hurt feelings aside and reach out to him with a smile she stepped closer you dont want to make love with me i want to make love with you until we both collapse shaken because it was true he reached out to touch her cheek but you need your sleep worried about your investment she ran her fingers down his shirt unfastening buttons as she went yes he took her face in his hands yes i am you dont have to be watching him she slid his shirt off his shoulders trust me at least for tonight trust me chapter eleven he wanted to somewhere during the long frustrating night hed realized that if he trusted her what she was what she said what she felt his life would turn around he just couldnt be certain the answers would be waiting for him if it did but her touch was so easy and her eyes were so warm for tonight for just one more night nothing else really mattered he brought her hands both of them to his lips as if he could show her what he didnt feel safe in saying or feel safe in even thinking she smiled at him as always touched by the tenderness he was capable of bright and steady the light by the bed continued to burn as they lowered themselves onto already rumpled sheets her eyes stayed open darkening slowly as he brushed kisses over her face he stroked his fingers gently across her shoulder where her robe hung loose up the long line of her throat and to her lips where they traced the shape with the tip of her tongue she moistened his skin inviting tempting promising then she nipped catching his fingertip between her teeth and holding it snug while her eyes dared him watching her he slid his hand up her leg loitering on the tight muscular calf then lingering on the smooth cool skin of her thigh he felt her breath catch then continued moving up making her shudder once twice before he parted her robe and freed her body to his i thought about touching you like this reed murmured as he caressed one small firm breast since the last time i touched you this way i wanted you to be here she let her hands make their own explorations slowly wanting to see the fire leap into his eyes she drew his slacks over his hips every night when i closed my eyes i pretended that youd be here in the morning now you will be she pressed a kiss to his shoulder but her hands were never still nor were his they moved slowly though not quite lazily because the passion was too close to the surface they savored in silent agreement that they had all the time they needed no rush no hurry no frantic desperate merging that left the body and mind dazed tonight was a night for the soul first desire me but quietly long for me but gently ache for me but patiently the sheets were tangled beneath her disturbed by the restless night she had barely begun warmed now by the passionate night she hoped wouldnt end their fingers linked palm against palm strength against strength as their lips met for one more long luxurious kiss of all the food she had recklessly sampled that evening there had been nothing to compare with the flavor of his kisses the wine had lacked sparkle the spices had been bland when compared with the taste of his lips on hers he could indeed feed her soul somehow in some way she wanted to feed his her arms came around him as she sought to give back a portion of what she was given there seemed to be no limit to her generosity he could feel it flow over him every time he held her now even with the languorous passionate movements of her body he felt it pour out of her quenching his souls thirst like something cool in the midday heat her body responded with every move with every request he made she was there with him as desirable and urgent a partner as a man could want but she was also he knew there for him something soft and giving a man could sink into and be soothed by he didnt know how to repay to give back what she so selflessly offered he knew only to love her with infinite care if it had been possible she would have told him that was enough at least for now there could be no more words when her mind and body were floating so freely when he touched her skin she felt ablaze he murmured her name and her heart rejoiced when they came together with all the fire and intensity of lovers reunited love for him consumed her by midmorning maddy was up and restless filled with nervous energy in a matter of hours it would be makeorbreak time winorlose allornothing it simply wasnt possible to stay away from the theater i thought you didnt have to be there until late this afternoon reed commented as maddy directed him down the shortcut shed discovered from hotel to theater theres no rehearsal but everythings happening today i was under the impression that everything happens tonight nothing happens tonight without today the lights the sets the drops turn right then right again through a thick stream of traffic he eased over and followed her directions i didnt think performers worried much about the technical points of a show a musical would lose a lot of its punch if it wasnt trimmed properly try to picture the king and i without the throne room or la cage without the nightclub theres a space leaning out the window she pointed it out to him will this thing squeeze into that reed gave her a mild look then with a few turns of the wheel maneuvered his bmw between two other cars parked at the curb will that do thats great she leaned over to kiss him youre great im glad youre here reed have i mentioned that a few times he cupped a hand around the back of her neck to keep her close keeping her close was becoming a priority i should have worked harder to talk you into staying in bed to rest he added when she lifted her brow youre ready to jump out of your skin this is normal openingnight behavior if i were relaxed you could worry besides i think you should see what youre paying for youre not the kind of man whos only interested in the end product come on she was out of the car and waiting on the sidewalk you should get a look at backstage they went through the stage door together maddy waved to the guard then followed the noise the electric sound of a saw came briefly then was gone for the most part there were voices some loud some lowered some complaining men and women dressed for work milled around some gave orders others followed them in what looked to reed like quiet confusion if he had to take bets that they would be ready for curtain in a matter of hours hed have called it a long shot there was no greasepaint here no glitter there was dust a little grime and a lot of sweat a man in a headphone stood downstage with his arms spread over his head he spoke into the mike as he brought his hands a little closer together a square of light on the backdrop adjusted with the movement you met the lighting director didnt you briefly reed said and watched him move a few feet to stage right all the lights have to be focused one at a time hes doing the downstage lights his assistant will take care of upstage how many lights are there dozens the show starts at eight shouldnt this have been done already we made some changes in rehearsal yesterday dont worry she linked an arm through his whether its done or not the show will go on at eight reed cast another look around there were big wooden crates on wheels some opened some closed coils of cable littered the floor ladders were set up here and there on a genie lift a man fiddled with lights while another stood back motioning down with his hands a dark backdrop lowered slowly then stopped on his signal theyve got to set the highs and lows on the drops she told him theyre all weighted and the crew has to know how far to take them down how far to bring them up come on ill show you the fly floor thats where they make a lot of magic happen maddy weaved her way backstage around crates and boxes carefully skirting ladders rather than walking under them there was more rope dangling more cable coiled reed saw a rubber chicken hanging by a noose next to where two men taped what looked like an electrical box to a wood panel miss ohurley one of them turned to grin at her looking good just make sure you make me look good tonight there were tall chests lined up along the back wall most of them plastered with stickers from other shows maddy squeezed between the last drop and the chests we have to cross underneath the stage in this theater she explained not enough room back here its better than having to run outside and around to make your next cue would it be more organized if this is theater maddy took his hand and led him through a narrow doorway this is as organized as it gets up here she climbed up a skinny steep stairway and through another opening it looked to reed like the deck of a ship one that had weathered a heavy storm ropes were everywhere some as thick as maddys wrist some thin and wiry they hung from above and spilled out on the floor without it seemed to him any rhyme or reason a great many were grouped together slanting up then down over a long metal pole there was a small table wedged into a corner with papers tacked up around it and spread over it with an overflowing ashtray on top of everything a few men were tying ropes with the careless skill of veteran sailors the place smelled of rope cigarettes and sweat the familiar scents that lingered in a theater this is a hemp house she began there arent too many of them left in the states its too bad really you have more flexibility with rope and sandbags than you do with counterweights all the moving pieces are handled from up here the beaded curtain she put a hand over a group of ropes that was bound together and labeled with a tag it weighs over five hundred pounds when its time to let it down in the third act the stage manager cues the flyman verbally through the intercom the lighting director backs it up with a light cue sounds simple enough sure unless youve got two or three cues on top of each other or a drop thats so heavy it takes three men on the ropes this is a big show the guys up here wont be taking many coffee breaks i dont understand why you know so much ive been in theater all my life a man came through the doorway muscled his way around them and began talking to two men who were tying off rope come out on the paint bridge its quite a view she made her way around the various ropes hunched under a steel bar and stepped out on a narrow iron platform below stagehands were spread out though it looked no more organized from this angle reed began to sense a spirit of teamwork if anything up here has to be painted this is where they do it she glanced down and shook her head not my kind of job a stream of fourletter words rose up from below a drop descended silently then a spotlight began to play on it widening then narrowing then holding steady maddy ran her hands back and forth over the rail thats my spot in act one scene three if i didnt know better id say you were nervous no im not nervous im terrified why he put a hand over hers you know what you can do i know what i have done she corrected i havent done this yet tonight when the curtain goes up its the first time theres your father looking down maddy let out a long breath it looks like hes talking to the general manager of the theater you should be down there with them no i should be here with you he was just beginning to realize how true that was he hadnt driven to philadelphia in the middle of the night because he mistrusted her he hadnt come with her that morning because he didnt have anything better to do hed done both because wherever she was he belonged she danced to the piper and perhaps so did he it scared the hell out of him thirty feet above the stage on a narrow iron platform he experienced the fear of falling but not fear of falling physically onto the floor below lets go down he wanted people around strangers noise anything to distract him from what was blooming inside all right oh its my family look nerves were gone and the pleasure was so deep that she slipped an arm around reeds waist without being aware that he stiffened theres pop see the skinny little man whos kibitzing with one of the carpenters he could run any part of this show lights drops props he could direct it or choreograph it but thats never been for him she beamed down all admiration and love spotlight thats for pop and for you im told i take after him the most my mothers there see the pretty woman with the little boy thats my youngest nephew chris he decided yesterday he wanted to be a lighting man because they get to ride up in the lift and my sister abby isnt she lovely reed looked down focusing on a slender woman with wavy blond hair there was an air of contentment around her though she stood in the midst of chaos she put her hand on the shoulder of another boy and pointed to the house shes showing ben where theyll be sitting tonight i imagine hes really more excited about going to new york tomorrow dylan has meetings with his publisher reed watched dylan reach down then heft chris on his shoulders the little boys squeals of delight bounced up to them theyre great kids because she heard the wistfulness in her own voice she shook it away she had enough maddy reminded herself lets go say hello back down onstage she skirted around a row of colored lights bolted to the floor later that night they would shine for her hearing the signal she took reeds hand and drew him aside as the beaded curtain made its glittery descent pretty terrific isnt it reed studied the thousands of beads it certainly makes a statement we use this during my dream sequence when i imagine im a ballet dancer instead of a stripper and of course i pirouette right into jonathans arms the nice thing about theater and about dreams is you can make anything you want happen as they walked around another drop she heard her fathers voice ring out valentine ill be damned frank ohurley why and small grabbed the huge husky man in a rough embrace my girl told me youd sprouted wings to back this play delighted frank drew back and grinned at him how many years has it been too many edwin pumped franks hand enthusiastically too damn many you dont look any older thats because your eyes are and molly edwin bent down to kiss her cheek pretty as ever theres not a thing wrong with your eyes edwin she assured him and kissed him again its always good to see an old friend i never forgot you and i never stopped envying you your wife frank in that case i cant let you kiss her again you might have a harder time remembering my abby one of the triplets he took abbys hand between his meaty ones incredible which one the middle one she answered easily maybe it was your diaper i changed with a laugh abby turned to dylan my husband dylan crosby mr valentine is obviously an old intimate friend of the family crosby ive read some of your work didnt you work with my son on one of your books yes i did dylan felt bens hand slip into his and linked fingers with him you were out of town at the time so we never met and grandchildren edwin sent another look at frank and molly before he hunkered down to the boys level a fine pair how do you do he offered his hand formally to each boy heres something else i covet frank ive got a soft spot for the little devils frank admitted winking at them abbys going to give us another one next winter congratulations it was envy he couldnt prevent it but he felt pleasure as well if you dont have plans id like for you all to join me for dinner before the show were the ohurleys frank reminded him we never have plans that cant be changed hows your boy edwin hes fine as a matter of fact he well here he is now with your daughter when frank turned a light went on in his head he saw maddy with her hand caught in that of a tall lean man with sculpted features and he saw the look in her eyes warm glowing and a little uncertain his baby was in love the quick twist in his heart was part pleasure part pain both feelings softened when mollys fingers linked with his introductions were made again and frank kept his eyes sharply on reed if this was the man his baby had chosen it was up to him to make sure shed chosen well so youre in charge of valentine records frank began he didnt believe in subtle probing doing a good job of it are you i like to think so the man before reed was like a bantam rooster small but scrappy franks hairline was receding and his eyes were a stunning blue and reed wondered why when he looked at frank ohurley he saw maddy there was little or no resemblance on the surface if it was there and somehow it was it came from inside perhaps that was why he felt himself so drawn to the man and why he worked so hard to keep his distance a lot of responsibility a record company frank went on takes a clever hand at a wheel a dependable one not married are you boy despite himself reed felt a smile tugging no im not never have been pop did i show you how we changed the timing for the finale taking his hand maddy dragged him into the wings at stage left what do you think youre doing about what he grinned and kissed both her cheeks god what a face youve got still look like my little turnip flattery will get you a punch in the nose she drew him back behind the stage managers desk as a group of stagehands wheeled out a crate you stop pumping reed that way pop its so so obvious whats obvious is that youre my baby girl and i have a right to look after you when im around to do it with her arms folded she tilted her head pop did you do a good job of raising me i did the best job would you say im a sensible responsible woman damn right you are frank puffed out his chest id punch the first man who said different good she kissed him hard then butt out ohurley she gave his cheek two sharp pats then walked out onstage again i know everyone has things to do this afternoon she answered her mothers wink im going up to the rehearsal room to iron out a few kinks she warmed up slowly carefully stretching her muscles one by one to insure against injury there was only her only her and the wall of mirrors she could bear the washing machine humming in the wardrobe room across the hall in the little kitchen down the hall someone opened and slammed the refrigerator door two people from maintenance were taking a break just outside the door their conversation ebbed and flowed as maddy bent to touch her chin to her knee there was only her and the wall of mirrors it had been mackes idea to put in the dream sequence with its balletic overtones when shed mentioned that she hadnt been en pointe in six months hed simply suggested that she dig out her toe shoes and practice she had the extra pointe classes every week had added hours to her schedule she could only hope they paid off shed worked shed rehearsed and the moves and music were lodged in her head still if there was one number that gave her the jitters it was this one shed be alone onstage for the first four minutes alone the lights a filmy blue the curtain behind her glittering and shimmering the music would come up maddy pushed the button on her tape recorder and set herself in front of the mirrors her arms would cross her body her hands would rest lightly on her own shoulders slowly very slowly she would rise en pointe and begin the bustle outside the door was blanked out a series of dreamy pirouettes she wasnt mary now but marys most private dream jete arms extended it had to look effortless as if she floated the bunching muscles the strain werent allowed to show here she was an illusion a musicbox dancer in tutu and tiara fluidity she imagined her limbs were water even as the strength rippled through them for a series of fouet turns her arms came over her head as she went to an arabesque she would hold this for only a few seconds until jonathan came onstage to make the dream a pas de deux maddy let her arms come down then shook them to keep the muscles limber that was as far as she could go without her partner moving to the recorder she pressed the rewind button she would do it again ive never seen you dance like that her concentration snapped as she glanced over and saw reed in the doorway not my usual style she stopped the squawking tape i didnt know you were still around youre a constant amazement he murmured as be came into the room if i didnt know you i would have looked in here and thought id walked in on a prima ballerina though it pleased her she laughed it away a few classic moves isnt swan lake but you could do it if you wanted couldnt you he took the towel she held and dabbed at her temples himself i dont know id probably be in the middle of sleeping beauty and feel an irresistible urge to do a tap routine ballets loss is broadways gain keep talking she said with a laugh i need it maddy youve been in here nearly two hours youre going to wear yourself out before curtain today i have enough energy to do the show three times what about food rumor has it the stagehands are fixing goulash if i pick at some about four or five i should be able to keep it down during the first act i wanted to take you out oh reed i couldnt not before opening night after she reached out her hands for his we could have a late supper after all right he felt how cool her hands were even after her dancing too cool too tense he didnt know how to begin to soothe her maddy are you always like this before an opening always even though youre confident that its going to be a hit just because im confident doesnt mean i dont have to work to make it a hit and that makes me nervous nothing worthwhile happens easily no his eyes grew more intense on hers no it doesnt but they werent talking about opening nights or about the theater now his fingers were tense when be spoke again you really believe that if you work at something hard enough believe strongly enough you cant miss yes i do us she swallowed yes us even though the odds are against it it isnt a matter of odds reed its a matter of people he dropped her hands and moved away just as he had on the paint bridge hed felt that quick fear of falling i wish i could feel as optimistic as you i wish i could believe in miracles she felt the hope that had ballooned inside her deflate so do i marriage is important to you he could see her in the glass small and standing very straight yes the commitment i was raised to respect that commitment to understand that marriage wasnt an end but a beginning yes its important its a contract he corrected speaking almost to himself a legal one and not particularly binding we both know about contracts maddy we can sign one she opened her mouth then very slowly shut it again before she attempted to speak i beg your pardon i said well sign one its important to you more important than i had realized and it doesnt really matter to me we can get blood tests a license and its done blood tests she let out a staggered breath and braced herself on the little table behind her a license well thats certainly cutting out the romantic nonsense isnt it its only a formality something was moving uneasily in his stomach as he turned back to her what he was doing was clear he was closing his own cage door why he was doing it was another matter im not sure of the law but if we have to we can drive into new york on monday and take care of it you can be back for the evening show tuesday we wouldnt want it to interfere with our schedules she said quietly shed known he would hurt her but she hadnt known he would quite simply break her heart i appreciate the offer reed but ill pass she slammed down the button again and let the music come what do you mean he took her arm before she could set into position just what i said excuse me i have to rehearse her voice had never been cold before never cold never flat as it was now you wanted marriage and i agreed to it what more do you want maddy she jerked away to face him more much more than youre willing to give god im afraid more than youre capable of giving i dont want a piece of paper damn you i dont want you to do me any favors okay maddy wants to get married and since i dont really care one way or the other well sign on the dotted line and keep her happy well you can go to hell thats not what i meant he would have taken her by the shoulders but she backed away i know what you meant i know it too well marriage is just a contract and contracts can be broken maybe youd like to put an escape clause in this one so it can be neat and tidy when youre tired of it no thank you had it sounded that cold that despicable he was out of his mind maddy i didnt come up here knowing wed get into all of this it just happened too spontaneous for you this time there was sarcasm another first why dont you go punch up your lines reed what do you want candlelight and me down on one knee arent we beyond that im tired of telling you what i want the fire went out of her eyes they were cool again and for the first time aloof i have to be onstage in a few hours and youve done enough for now to make that difficult for me she pushed the recorder to take the tape back to the beginning again leave me alone reed she picked up the count and began she continued to dance when she was alone and the tears started to fall chapter twelve as reed came down into the corridor he met his father maddy still upstairs edwin clapped his arms around his sons shoulders just finished talking with the general manager seems were sold out for tonights performance in fact were sold out through the week i wanted to tell her give her a little while reed dug his fists into his pockets and struggled against a feeling of utter frustration shes working on a routine i see he thought he did come in here for a minute he gestured toward the stage managers office when they were inside he shut the door behind them you used to tell me when you had problems you get to a point where youd better know how to solve them yourself youve always been good at that reed it doesnt mean you cant run them by me he took out a cigar lighted it and waited i asked maddy to marry me no he went on quickly before the pleasure could dawn in edwins eyes thats not quite true i laid out the arrangements for a marriage to maddy she tossed them right back at me arrangements yes arrangements reed was defensive and his voice was sharp and impatient we need blood tests a license we have to fit it into our schedules it edwin repeated with a slight inclination of his head you make it sound very cutand dried reed no orange blossoms she can have a truckload of orange blossoms if she wants them the room was too small to allow him to storm around it instead he stood where he was and strained against the enforced stillness if she wants them understanding too well edwin nodded and lowered himself into the one chair reed if you put marriage on that sort of level with a woman like maddy you deserved to have it tossed back at you maybe i did maybe its for the best i dont know why i started the whole business it might be because you love her loves a word that sells greeting cards if i thought you believed that id consider myself a complete failure no outraged reed turned to him youve never failed at anything thats not true i failed at my marriage not you the bitterness rose up too huge to swallow yes i did you listen to me now we never talked about this properly you never wanted to and i let it go because i felt youd been hurt enough i shouldnt have edwin looked at his cigar then slowly crushed it out i married your mother knowing she didnt love me i thought i could keep her bound to me because i could pull the strings to give her what she wanted the more strings i pulled the more she felt hemmed in when she finally broke free it was as much my fault as hers no yes edwin corrected marriage is two people reed its not a business its not an arrangement its not one person wanting to keep the other indebted i dont know what youre talking about reed said i dont see any reason to get into this now you know theres a reason shes upstairs right now reed stopped even as he gripped the handle of the door slowly he let it go again and turned back youre right edwin settled back your mother didnt love me and she didnt love you im sorry for that but you should know that love isnt something that comes just from giving birth or just from duty it comes from the heart she betrayed you yes but she also gave you to me i cant hate her reed and its time you stopped letting what she did run your life i could be like her is that what this is about edwin heaved himself up and took reed by the lapels in the first gesture of violence hed ever shown his son how long have you been carrying this around i could be like her reed repeated or i could be like the man she slept with and i dont even know who he was edwin loosened his hold and stepped back do you want to know reed combed both hands through his hair no theyre nothing to me but how can i know whats inside of me how can i know that what they were wasnt passed on you cant but you can look in the mirror and think about who you are and have been rather than who you might be and you can believe as i do that the last thirtyfive years that weve had together is more important i know it is but there are no buts im in love with maddy with the words came a slow shattering of defenses hed lived with since childhood how do i know that wont change next month next year how can i know im capable of giving her what it is she needs for the rest of our lives thats something else you cant ever know why couldnt the answers be simple ones it seemed to edwin that there had never been simple answers for reed thats something you have to risk something you have to want and something you have to work at if you love her you will im more afraid of hurting her than i am of anything else shes the best thing that ever happened to me i dont suppose you mentioned all this when you were outlining the arrangements no he rubbed his hands over his face i made a mess of it id be more concerned if youd been too smooth you dont have to worry about that i pushed her away because i was afraid to reach out for her smiling edwin rocked back on his heels ill tell you this no son of mine would let a woman like maddy ohurley slip through his fingers because he thinks he might not be perfect after running a hand over his face reed nearly laughed that sounds like a challenge damn right it is edwin put his hands on reeds shoulders and my moneys on you remember that game in your senior year ninth inning two outs the score was tied you worked the batter to a full count yeah i remember this time he did laugh i threw a knuckleball and he knocked it over the fence thats right edwin grinned at him but it was a hell of a pitch why dont you buy your old man a drink with her hair pulled back by a thick band and the rattiest robe she owned tied loosely at the waist maddy sat at makeup mirror and carefully attached false lashes to her own her makeup was nearly done and even with one eye lashed and the other naked shed already captured the exotic look that was marys just a little too much color on the cheeks just a little too much sparkle on the eyelids and a rich ripe red for the lips as she fastened the other lash she waited for the knot in her stomach to untie itself openingnight nerves just openingnight nerves she told herself as she carefully adjusted the liner on her left eye but there was more than that rushing around inside her and she couldnt get away from it marriage reed had spoken of marriage but on his terms the part of her that was always open to hope had waited for the moment when he would accept the fact that they should be together the part of her that was always willing to see the best of things had been certain that moment would come now that it had she couldnt take it what he offered wasnt years of joy but a piece of paper that would bind them together legally leaving nothing to the emotions she had too much of it maddy told herself too much emotion not enough logic a logical woman would have accepted reeds terms and made the best of it instead she was ending things maddy stared at her reflection in the lighted mirror tonight was a night for beginnings and a night for endings she rose and walked away from the mirror shed seen enough of herself outside in the corridor people were rushing by she could hear the noise the nerves the energy that was opening night her dressing room was packed with flowers dozens of arrangements that doubled themselves in the mirror and crowded the room with scent there were roses from chantel white ones her parents had sent her a clutch of daisies that looked wild and lovely there was a bowl of gardenias that she had known had come from trace before shed looked at the card it had merely said break a leg shed wondered briefly how hed known where and when to send them then shed stopped wondering and had appreciated other arrangements sat here and there but there were none from reed she hated herself for overlooking the beauty of what she had in the quest for what wasnt there thirty minutes miss ohurley maddy pressed a hand to her stomach at the call thirty minutes left why did she have to have reed dragging at her mind now she didnt want to go on she didnt want to go out there tonight to sing and dance and make a theater full of strangers laugh she wanted to go home and pull down the shades there was a quick knock at her door but before she could answer her parents poked their heads through can you use a couple of friendly faces molly asked her oh yeah maddy stretched out her hands to her mother i need all i can get the house is filling up frank beamed as he looked around the dressing room there was a star on the door he couldnt have asked for more for his daughter you got standing room only kiddo are you sure sure im sure frank patted her hand i talked to the general manager myself hes wearing out the leather on his shoes dancing around he should wait until the curtain calls to do his dancing maddy put a hand to her stomach again and wondered if she had any alkaseltzer you wont need it when the curtain goes up molly commented reading her daughter easily openingnight jitters maddy or is there something else you want to tell us about she hesitated but there had never been any secrets between maddy and her family just that im in love with an absolute fool oh well molly lifted a brow toward frank i know how that is just a minute now he began but was summarily shooed from the room by his wife out frank maddy has to get into costume ive powdered her bottom he muttered but allowed himself to be pushed out the door knock them dead he told his daughter then he winked and was gone hes terrific isnt he maddy smiled as she heard him call out to one of the dancers he has his moments molly glanced at the costume of sequins and feathers hanging on the back of the door that for opening yes ill give you a hand molly took it off the hanger as maddy tossed her robe aside the fool wouldnt happen to be reed valentine would it thats him maddy wiggled herself into the snug bikini we had dinner with him and his father tonight she helped maddy hook the brief spangled bra that would go under the outer costume seems like a nice young man he is i never want to see him again mmhmmm fifteen minutes miss ohurley i think im going to be sick maddy whispered no youre not with competent hands molly pressed the velcro together at her daughters hip it seemed to me that your reed was a bit distracted at dinner hes got a lot on his mind maddy turned this way and that to be certain the costume was secure contracts mostly she added in a mutter anyway im not interested yes i can see that they dont make our lives easier you know what men molly turned her daughter around they werent put here to make our lives easier they were just put here for the first time in hours maddy felt a laugh bubbling up did you ever think the amazons had it right the ones who killed off the men after theyd made love with them molly seemed to consider the question seriously before shaking her head no i dont think so theres something comforting about having one man for a lifetime you get used to him where are your shoes right here studying her mother molly stepped into them you still love pop dont you i mean really really love him just the way you always did no when maddys mouth dropped open molly laughed nothing stays the same the way i love frank now is different from the way i loved him thirty years ago weve four children now and a lifetime of fights and laughter and tears i couldnt have loved him this much when i was twenty i doubt i love him as much now as i will when im eighty i wish maddy let her words trail off shaking her head no tell me what you wish mollys voice was gentle as it rarely was a daughter can tell her mother anything especially wishes i wish reed could understand that i wish he could see that sometimes it can work sometimes it can last mom i love him so much then ill give you one piece of advice she took maddys wig off the stand dont give up on him i think im giving up on me well thatll be a first for an ohurley sit down girl maybe this wig will help keep the brains in your head thanks the fiveminute call sounded molly walked to the door then turned to give her daughter one last look dont miss your cue mom maddy rose keeping her shoulders straight im going to bring down the house im counting on it maddy stepped out of her dressing room with four minutes to spare a member of the chorus came clattering down the stairs with an outrageous plume of ostrich feathers on her head the overture was already playing she walked toward the music losing a little bit of maddy ohurley with every step wanda was already in title wings taking long cleansing breaths this is it maddy smiled at her before she looked over the stage managers shoulder to the monitor on his desk he could watch the play from there seeing it as the audience did whats the top in curtain calls for you wanda we got seventeen in rochester once maddy put her hands on her hips were going to beat the hell out of that tonight she walked onstage faced the curtain and took her mark as the other dancers filled the stage she could feel the rearlaced excitement the nightclub set was in darkness behind her hidden by the wings was macke at stage right maddy glanced over at him and tossed her head she was ready house lights half go she drew in oxygen cue one go above her head lights flashed on bathing her in a rainbow house lights off go the audience hushed curtain it rose and so did the music by the time maddy walked off stage right for the first scene change the electricity was high immediately wardrobe began stripping off one costume and bundling her into the next she breathed a sigh as her wig was removed and her own hair fluffed out you keep that energy up until the final curtain and ill buy you the best meal in philadelphia maddy caught her breath as she stared at macke her dress was zipped her shoes changed and her makeup toned down all in a matter of two minutes youre on then she made the dash that would take her under the stage and across for her cue she passed beneath the floor of the stage and crossed behind the orchestra pit where the musicians now were silent her jonathan and the actor who played his best friend were exchanging lines she heard the audience give a roll of laughter as she moved through a makeshift lounge where enterprising members of the crew had gathered a couple of chairs and a sagging sofa near the steps that would lead her back up stage left a group of stagehands loitered around a small portable television the sound was down to a low buzz so that the business on stage could be heard clearly maddy paused knowing she had time before the next cue obviously they did too whos winning she asked as she caught a glimpse of the ball game no score pirates against the mets theyre in the third inning my moneys on the mets one of the men laughed hope you dont mind losing it five bucks she said as she heard jonathan finishing up his song youre on he told her i certainly am she went up the steps and out onstage for her first encounter with jonathan c wiggings iii the chemistry was right mary and jonathan met on the library steps they clicked the audiences interest was caught up in the romance between the stripper and the rich mans son with innocence shining out of his eyes the last number before intermission was maddys striptease she came rushing in as she had in rehearsal struggling out of her prim dress and into her flamboyant costume and wig her dialogue with wanda was edgy and acerbic her argument with terry tough then the lights came up in hot pinks and reds she began with her energy at peak and never let it slide she whipped the boa off and let it fly the audience sent up a howl as it landed in her fathers lap for you pop she thought as she sent him a broad wink because you taught me everything maddy kept her word and brought the house down intermission wasnt a time for relaxing there were costume changes makeup to be freshened energy to be recharged word was sent to maddy that the mets were down in the sixth zip she took it philosophically shed lost more important things that day from her place in the wings maddy sipped a cup of water and peered out at the audience the house lights were up and she could see people swarming around the theater the buzz of excitement was there she had helped put it there then she saw reed with the lights from the chandeliers spilling over his hair her father stood beside him inches shorter years older but just as vital as she watched frank laughed and tossed an arm around reeds shoulder it warmed her she told herself it didnt matter could no longer matter but it warmed her to see her father laughing with the man she loved maddy stepped back until the audience was blocked from her view you look like that youre going to scare them away before the finale turning maddy looked at wanda they were both dressed in nightclothes for the scene in the apartment they shared the beaded curtain would come down soon and maddy would do her dream sequence i cant do that we still have to beat those seventeen curtain calls he out there wanda didnt bother to look but motioned with her head yes hes there the house lights flashed off and on off and on wanda quietly began her deep breathing i guess youve got something to prove that i can survive maddy thought that i can complete my own life if i have to to myself she murmured before they moved out to their marks not to him to myself in plays the writer can twist events shift them manipulate them to create a happy ending in the end mary and jonathan had each other they had overcome differences and deceptions backgrounds and lies distrust and disillusionment for them happyeverafter was there for the taking then the applause began it rolled it thundered and echoed over the chorus as they took their bows it continued only stronger over the principals with her hands gripped together maddy waited she would go out last with her head up and the smile already in place maddy strode out onstage applause rose like lava warm and fluid the cheers began in the balcony and rolled down growing louder still louder until the theater was filled with them she took her first bow with them ringing in her head then they were standing first one then two then a dozen hundreds of people rose up to their feet and shouted for her stunned she could only stand there and look take another bow wanda said to her in an undertone you earned it maddy broke out of her trance and bowed again before linking hands with wanda and her partner the cast as a unit bowed again and the curtain came down the applause kept coming wave after wave as maddy threw her arms around wanda and squeezed the unity was there a line of dancers a group of actors all of whom had worked and studied and rehearsed endless hours for this one moment so they held on to it as the curtain for a moment cut them off from the audience and ranged them together here we go again maddy said and locked her hands tight the curtain rose and fell twentysix times it took maddy some time to work her way back to her dressing room there were people to hug and a few tears to be shed macke scooped her up in his arms and kissed her full on the mouth you better be just as damn good tomorrow he told her it was a riot backstage with dancers whooping around and planning a big celebration they were a hit whatever adjustments polishing or tightening that would have to be done before broadway couldnt take away from the fact that they were a hit no one could take it away from them the hours and hours of work sweat and repetition had paid off feet clattered on stairs as members of the chorus scrambled up to their dressing rooms someone had a trumpet and was blaring out reveille maddy squeezed through the crowd in the hall and into her own room there she collapsed on a chair and stared at her own reflection there were pots and tubes jumbled over the surface of the table greasepaint powder every color of the rainbow above it she studied her own face then broke into a grin shed done it her dressing room door opened and part of the riot slipped in she saw her father first the boa slung around his shoulders like a mantle of victory energy poured back into her as she jumped out of her chair to fling herself into his arms pop it was great tell me it was great great twentysix curtain calls is better than great you counted of course i counted he squeezed her hard until her feet left the floor that was my girl out there my baby girl knocking them dead im so proud of you maddy oh pop dont cry sniffling herself she reached into his pocket for a handkerchief youd have been proud of me if id flopped she dried his eyes thats why i love you how about a hug for your mother molly held out her arms and gathered maddy close all i could think of was the first time we put you in dance shoes i could hardly believe it was you so strong so vital strong molly drew her back by the shoulders thats what you are madeline ohurley my hearts still racing laughing abby embraced her sister every time you came out id grab dylans hand i dont know how many fingers i broke ben kept telling the woman beside him you were his aunt i just wish i know i wish chantel could have been here too she leaned down to hug ben then glanced up at chris who was nestled droopy eyed in dylans arms i didnt fall asleep chris told her with a huge yawn i watched the whole thing it was pretty thanks well dylan do you think were ready for broadway i think youre going to rock broadway back on its heels congratulations maddy then he grinned and let his gaze slide down her i also liked your costumes flashy but brief she said with a chuckle as she glanced down at the red merry widow she wore we have to get the kids back abby looked at ben his hand was already caught in dylans well see you tomorrow before we go call me abby touched maddys arm in a gesture that said everything ill be thinking of you well be going too frank sent molly a sidelong look youll be running out of here to celebrate with the rest of the cast you know youre welcome to come maddy began no no we need our rest weve got a gig in buffalo in a couple of days come on lets leave the girl to change frank nudged his family along then paused at the door you were the best turnip no she remembered everything just then his patience the joy hed given to her the magic hed passed on when hed taught her to dance you were pop maddy sighed and sat again she drew a rose out of its vase to hold it to her cheek the best she thought shutting her eyes why wasnt it enough when the door opened again she straightened in her chair and had her smile ready reed stood in the doorway with noise and confusion reigning behind him very carefully maddy set the rose back in place the bright smile didnt seem so necessary now do you mind if i come in no but she didnt look at him deliberately she turned to the mirror and peeled off her lashes i dont have to tell you how terrific you were he shut the door on the stream of noise outside oh i dont get tired of hearing it she dipped her hand into a pot of cold cream then smeared it on so you stayed for the show of course i stayed she was making him feel like an idiot hed never pursued a woman before not this way and he knew if he made another mistake hed lose her for good when he came up behind her he saw her hand hesitate then tremble before she continued to rub in the cream it eased the tension at the back of his neck he hadnt lost her yet i guess you know you got your moneys worth maddy pulled out a tissue and began to wipe off the cream and layers of makeup yes i do he set a large blue box on the table at her elbow she forced herself to ignore it but my fathers taking over the showbusiness side he wanted me to tell you how much he enjoyed tonight how incredible he thought you were i though hed come back he knew i needed to see you alone she tossed tissues in the wastebasket mary was gone and there was only maddy now rising she reached for a robe i need to get out of costume do you mind no he kept his eyes on hers i dont mind because she decided he wouldnt make it easy maddy simply nodded and moved behind a chinese screen so you must be going back to new york tomorrow no the hooks slipped out from between her fingers setting her teeth maddy attacked them again if your fathers taking over theres no need for you to stay im not going anywhere maddy if you want to make me crawl i guess youre entitled she slammed the costume over the screen i dont want to make you crawl thats ridiculous why ive been a complete fool im ready to admit it but if youre not ready to accept it i can wait she yanked the tie on her robe before she came around the screen you dont play fair youve never played fair no i havent and its cost me he took a step toward her but saw from the look in her eyes that he could go no farther if it means i have to start over from this point ill start over i want you maddy more than ive ever wanted anything or anyone why are you doing this she pulled a hand through her hair and looked for a way out there wasnt one every time i convince myself its done and over with every time i say okay maddy give it up you pull the rug out from under me im tired of falling on my rear end with you reed i just want to find my balance again this time he went to her because nothing could stop him his eyes were very dark but she didnt see the panic in them i know you can live without me i know you can shoot right to the top without me and maybe just maybe i can walk away from you and survive i dont want to risk it ill do whatever i can not to dont you understand if the foundation isnt there if we dont understand each other dont trust each other it wont ever work i love you reed but dont say anything else though she held herself stiff he drew her close let me hang on to that for a minute ive done a lot of thinking a lot of changing since i met you things were pretty blackandwhite before you came along youve added the color and i dont want to lose that no dont say anything he repeated open the box first reed please just open the box first if he knew her as well as he thought as well as he hoped that would say more to her than he could strong her mother had told her she was strong she had to believe it now maddy turned away and lifted the top on the box for a moment she could only state i didnt send you flowers reed began i figured youd have plenty of them i thought i hoped this would mean more hannah had a hell of a time getting it up here speechless maddy lifted the plant out when shed given it to him it had been soggy and yellowed and already rotting away now it was green and vivid with strong young shoots because her hands were unsteady she set it down on the table a minor miracle reed murmured it didnt die when it should have it just kept fighting just kept thriving you can make miracles happen if you want them badly enough you told me that once and i didnt believe it i do now he touched her hair and waited until she looked back at him i love you all i want is for you to give me a lifetime to prove it she stepped into his arms start now with laughter and relief he brought his lips to hers and felt the welcome she drew him closer with a sigh holding on with all the love all the strength she would promise him i never had a chance he murmured not from the first minute i saw you nothing thank god has been the same for me since but he drew her away needing to pass the last hurdle those things i said this afternoon placing a finger over his lips she shook her head youre not going to try to back out of marrying me now no he held her close again then let her go no but i cant ask you until you know everything about me it was hard harder than hed thought it could be he let his hands drop away from her maddy my father is an exceptional man she finished for him taking his hand reed he told me everything weeks ago he told you yes she reached up to soothe the tension before it could form did you think it would make a difference i couldnt be sure she shook her head rising on her toes she kissed him again letting the love pour out be sure theres no candlelight she pointed out and i dont want you to get down on one knee but i do want you to ask me he took both of her hands and as he brought them to his lips his eyes never left her i love you maddy i want to spend my life with you have children with you take chances with you i want to sit in the front row and watch you explode on the stage and know when its over youll come home to me will you marry me the smile came slowly until it lighted her whole face she opened her mouth then let out a groan as a sharp knock sounded at her door get rid of them reed demanded maddy gave his hands a quick squeeze just dont move dont even breathe she yanked the door open prepared to shut it again just as quickly your five miss ohurley one of the stagehands grinned at her and offered her a bill mets took it looks like you just cant lose tonight she took the bill and ran it through her hands looking over her shoulder she smiled at reed youre so right
