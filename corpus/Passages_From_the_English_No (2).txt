 passages from the english notebooks of nathaniel hawthorne vol ii passages from hawthornes english notebooks london miltonclub dinner april th on tuesday i went to no ludgate hill to dine with bennoch at the milton club a club recently founded for dissenters nonconformists and people whose ideas religious or political are not precisely in train with the establishment in church and state i was shown into a large readingroom well provided with periodicals and newspapers and found two or three persons there but bennoch had not yet arrived in a few moments a tall gentleman with white hair came in a fine and intelligentlooking man whom i guessed to be one of those who were to meet me he walked about glancing at the periodicals and soon entered mr tupper and without seeing me exchanged warm greetings with the whitehaired gentleman i suppose began mr tupper you have come to meet now conscious that my name was going to be spoken and not knowing but the excellent mr tupper might say something which he would not quite like me to overhear i advanced at once with outstretched hand and saluted him he expressed great joy at the recognition and immediately introduced me to mr hall the diningroom was pretty large and lofty and there were sixteen guests at table most of them authors or people connected with the press so that the party represented a great deal of the working intellect of london at this present day and moment the men whose plays whose songs whose articles are just now in vogue mr tom taylor was one of the very few whose writings i had known anything about he is a tall slender dark young man not englishlooking and wearing colored spectacles so that i should readily have taken him for an american literary man i did not have much opportunity of talking with him nor with anybody else except dr who seemed a shrewd sensible man with a certain slight acerbity of thought mr herbert ingram recently elected member of parliament was likewise present and sat on bennochs left it was a very good dinner with an abundance of wine which bennoch sent round faster than was for the next days comfort of his guests it is singular that i should thus far have quite forgotten wh whose books i know better than those of any other person there he is a whiteheaded stout firmlooking and rather wrinkledfaced old gentleman whose temper i should imagine was not the very sweetest in the world there is all abruptness a kind of subacidity if not bitterness in his address he seemed not to be in short so genial as i should have anticipated from his books as soon as the cloth was removed bennoch without rising from his chair made a speech in honor of his eminent and distinguished guest which illustrious person happened to be sitting in the selfsame chair that i myself occupied i have no recollection of what he said nor of what i said in reply but i remember that both of us were cheered and applauded much more than the occasion deserved then followed about fifty other speeches for every single individual at table was called up as tupper said toasted and roasted and for my part i was done entirely brown to continue t s figure everybody said something kind not a word or idea of which can i find in my memory certainly if i never get any more praise in my life i have had enough of it for once i made another little bit of a speech too in response to something that was said in reference to the present difficulties between england and america and ended as a proof that i deemed war impossible with drinking success to the british army and calling on lieutenant shaw of the aldershott camp to reply i am afraid i must have said something very wrong for the applause was vociferous and i could hear the gentlemen whispering about the table good good yes he is a fine fellow and other such illearned praises and i took shame to myself and held my tongue publicly the rest of the evening but in such cases something must be allowed to the excitement of the moment and to the effect of kindness and goodwill so broadly and warmly displayed and even a sincere man must not be held to speak as if he were under oath we separated in a blessed state of contentment with one another at about eleven and lest i should starve before morning i went with mr dto take supper at his house in park lane mr dis a pale young gentleman of american aspect being a westindian by birth he is one of the principal writers of editorials for the times we were accompanied in the carriage by another gentleman mr m who is connected with the management of the same paper he wrote the letters from scutari which drew so much attention to the state of the hospitals mr dis the husband of the former miss the actress and when we reached his house we found that she had just come home from the theatre and was taking off her stagedress anon she came down to the drawingroom a seemingly good simple and intelligent lady not at all pretty and i should think older than her husband she was very kind to me and told me that she had read one of my books the house of the seven gables thirteen years ago which i thought remarkable because i did not write it till eight or nine years afterwards the principal talk during supper which consisted of welshrabbit and biscuits with champagne and sodawater was about the times and the two contributors expressed vast admiration of mr who has the chief editorial management of the paper it is odd to find how little we outsiders know of men who really exercise a vast influence on affairs for this mris certainly of far more importance in the world than a minister of state he writes nothing himself but the character of the times seems to depend upon his intuitive unerring judgment and if ever he is absent from his post even for a day or two they say that the paper immediately shows it in reply to my questions they appeared to acknowledge that he was a man of expediency but of a very high expediency and that he gave the public the very best principles which it was capable of receiving perhaps it may be so the timess articles are certainly not written in so high a moral vein as might be wished but what they lack in height they gain in breadth every sensible man in england finds his own best commonsense there and in effect i think its influence is wholesome apropos of public speaking drsaid that sir lytton bulwer asked him i think the anecdote was personal to himself whether he felt his heart beat when he was going to speak yes does your voice frighten you yes do all your ideas forsake you yes do you wish the floor to open and swallow you yes why then youll make an orator drtold of canning too how once before rising to speak in the house of commons he bade his friend feel his pulse which was throbbing terrifically i know i shall make one of my best speeches said canning because im in such an awful funk president pierce who has a great deal of oratorical power is subject to a similar horror and reluctance reformclub dinner april th on thursday at eight oclock i went to the reform club to dine with dr the waiter admitted me into a great basement hall with a tessellated or mosaic or somehow figured floor of stone and lighted from a dome of lofty height in a few minutes drappeared and showed me about the edifice which is very noble and of a substantial magnificence that was most satisfactory to behold no woodwork imitating better materials but pillars and balustrades of marble and everything what it purports to be the readingroom is very large and luxuriously comfortable and contains an admirable library there are rooms and conveniences for every possible purpose and whatever material for enjoyment a bachelor may need or ought to have he can surely find it here and on such reasonable terms that a small income will do as much for him as a far greater one on any other system in a colonnade on the first floor surrounding the great basement hall there are portraits of distinguished reformers and black niches for others yet to come joseph hume i believe is destined to fill one of these blanks but i remarked that the larger part of the portraits already hung up are of men of high rank the duke of sussex for instance lord durham lord grey and indeed i remember no commoner in one room i saw on the wall the facsimile so common in the united states of our declaration of independence descending again to the basement hall an elderly gentleman came in and was warmly welcomed by dr he was a very short man but with breadth enough and a back excessively bent bowed almost to deformity very gray hair and a face and expression of remarkable briskness and intelligence his profile came out pretty boldly and his eyes had the prominence that indicates i believe volubility of speech nor did he fail to talk from the instant of his appearance and in the tone of his voice and in his glance and in the whole man there was something racy a flavor of the humorist his step was that of an aged man and he put his stick down very decidedly at every footfall though as he afterwards told me that he was only fiftytwo he need not yet have been infirm but perhaps he has had the gout his feet however are by no means swollen but unusually small drintroduced him as mr douglas jerrold and we went into the coffeeroom to dine the coffeeroom occupies one whole side of the edifice and is provided with a great many tables calculated for three or four persons to dine at and we sat down at one of these and drordered some mulligatawny soup and a bottle of white french wine the waiters in the coffeeroom are very numerous and most of them dressed in the livery of the club comprising plush breeches and whitesilk stockings for these english reformers do not seem to include republican simplicity of manners in their system neither perhaps is it anywise essential after the soup we had turbot and by and by a bottle of chateau margaux very delectable and then some lambs feet delicately done and some cutlets of i know not what peculiar type and finally a ptarmigan which is of the same race of birds as the grouse but feeds high up towards the summits of the scotch mountains then some cheese and a bottle of chambertin it was a very pleasant dinner and my companions were both very agreeable men both taking a shrewd satirical yet not illnatured view of life and people and as for mr douglas jerrold he often reminded me of e c in the richer veins of the latter both by his face and expression and by a tincture of something at once wise and humorously absurd in what he said but i think he has a kinder more genial wholesomer nature than e and under a very thin crust of outward acerbity i grew sensible of a very warm heart and even of much simplicity of character in this man born in london and accustomed always to london life i wish i had any faculty whatever of remembering what people say but though i appreciate anything good at the moment it never stays in my memory nor do i think in fact that anything definite rounded pointed separable and transferable from the general lump of conversation was said by anybody i recollect that they laughed at mr and at his shedding a tear into a scottish river on occasion of some literary festival they spoke approvingly of bulwer as valuing his literary position and holding himself one of the brotherhood of authors and not so approvingly of charles dickens who born a plebeian aspires to aristocratic society but i said that it was easy to condescend and that bulwer knew he could not put off his rank and that he would have all the advantages of it in spite of his authorship we talked about the position of men of letters in england and they said that the aristocracy hated and despised and feared them and i asked why it was that literary men having really so much power in their hands were content to live unrecognized in the state douglas jerrold talked of thackeray and his success in america and said that he himself purposed going and had been invited thither to lecture i asked him whether it was pleasant to a writer of plays to see them performed and he said it was intolerable the presentation of the authors idea being so imperfect and drobserved that it was excruciating to hear one of his own songs sung jerrold spoke of the duke of devonshire with great warmth as a true honest simple most kindhearted man from whom he himself had received great courtesies and kindnesses not as i understood in the way of patronage or essential favors and i heaven forgive me queried within myself whether this english reforming author would have been quite so sensible of the dukes excellence if his grace had not been a duke but indeed a nobleman who is at the same time a true and wholehearted man feeling his brotherhood with men does really deserve some credit for it in the course of the evening jerrold spoke with high appreciation of emerson and of longfellow whose hiawatha he considered a wonderful performance and of lowell whose fable for critics he especially admired i mentioned thoreau and proposed to send his works to dr who being connected with the illustrated news and otherwise a writer might be inclined to draw attention to then douglas jerrold asked why he should not have them too i hesitated a little but as he pressed me and would have an answer i said that i did not feel quite so sure of his kindly judgment on thoreaus books and it so chanced that i used the word acrid for lack of a better in endeavoring to express my idea of jerrolds way of looking at men and books it was not quite what i meant but in fact he often is acrid and has written pages and volumes of acridity though no doubt with an honest purpose and from a manly disgust at the cant and humbug of the world jerrold said no more and i went on talking with dr but in a minute or two i became aware that something had gone wrong and looking at douglas jerrold there was an expression of pain and emotion on his face by this time a second bottle of burgundy had been opened clos vougeot the best the club could produce and far richer than the chambertin and that warm and potent wine may have had something to do with the depth and vivacity of mr jerrolds feelings but he was indeed greatly hurt by that little word acrid he knew he said that the world considered him a sour bitter illnatured man but that such a man as i should have the sane opinion was almost more than he could bear as he spoke he threw out his arms sank back in his seat and i was really a little apprehensive of his actual dissolution into tears hereupon i spoke as was good need and though as usual i have forgotten everything i said i am quite sure it was to the purpose and went to this good fellows heart as it came warmly from my own i do remember saying that i felt him to be as genial as the glass of burgundy which i held in my hand and i think that touched the very right spot for he smiled and said he was afraid the burgundy was better than he but yet he was comforted drsaid that he likewise had a reputation for bitterness and i assured him if i might venture to join myself to the brotherhood of two such men that i was considered a very illnatured person by many people in my own country douglas jerrold said he was glad of it we were now in sweetest harmony and jerrold spoke more than it would become me to repeat in praise of my own books which he said he admired and he found the man more admirable than his books i hope so certainly we now went to the haymarket theatre where douglas jerrold is on the free list and after seeing a ballet by some spanish dancers we separated and betook ourselves to our several homes i like douglas jerrold very much april th on saturday evening at ten oclock i went to a supperparty at mr ds and there met five or six people mr faed a young and distinguished artist dr eliotson a dark sombre taciturn powerfullooking man with coalblack hair and a beard as black fringing round his face mr charles reade author of christie johnstone and other novels and many plays a tall man more than thirty fairhaired and of agreeable talk and demeanor on april th i went to the waterloo station and there meeting bennoch and dr took the rail for woking where we found mr halls carriage waiting to convey us to addlestone about five miles off on arriving we found that mr and mrs hall had not yet returned from church their place is an exceedingly pretty one and arranged in very good taste the house is not large but is filled in every room with fine engravings statuettes ingenious prettinesses or beautifulnesses in the way of flowerstands cabinets and things that seem to have bloomed naturally out of the characters of its occupants there is a conservatory connected with the drawingroom and enriched with lovely plants one of which has a certain interest as being the plant on which coleridges eyes were fixed when he died this conservatory is likewise beautified with several very fine casts of statues by modern sculptors among which was the greek slave of powers which my english friends criticised as being too thin and meagre but i defended it as in accordance with american ideas of feminine beauty from the conservatory we passed into the garden but did not minutely examine it knowing that mr hall would wish to lead us through it in person so in the mean time we took a walk in the neighborhood over stiles and along bypaths for two or three miles till we reached the old village of chertsey in one of its streets stands an ancient house gabled and with the second story projecting over the first and bearing an inscription to the purport that the poet cowley had once resided and i think died there thence we passed on till we reached a bridge over the thames which at this point about twentyfive miles from london is a narrow river but looks clean and pure and unconscious what abominations the city sewers will pour into it anon we were caught in two or three showers in the course of our walk but got back to firfield without being very much wetted our host and hostess had by this time returned from church and mrs hall came frankly and heartily to the door to greet us scolding us kindly for having got wet i liked her simple easy gentle quiet manners and i liked her husband too he has a wide and quick sympathy and expresses it freely the world is the better for him the shower being now over we went out upon the beautiful lawn before his house where there were a good many trees of various kinds many of which have been set out by persons of great or small distinction and are labelled with their names thomas moores name was appended to one maria edgeworths to another likewise fredrika bremers jenny linds also grace greenwoods and i know not whose besides this is really a pleasant method of enriching ones grounds with memorials of friends nor is there any harm in making a shrubbery of celebrities three holes were already dug and three new trees lay ready to be planted and for me there was a sumach to plant a tree i never liked but mr hall said that they had tried to dig up a hawthorn but found it clung too fast to the soil so since better might not be and telling mr hall that i supposed i should have a right to hang myself on this tree whenever i chose i seized a spade and speedily shovelled in a great deal of dirt and there stands my sumach an object of interest to posterity bennoch also and drset out their trees and indeed it was in some sense a joint affair for the rest of the party held up each tree while its godfather shovelled in the earth but after all the gardener had more to do with it than we after this important business was over mr hall led us about his rounds which are very nicely planned and ordered and all this he has bought and built and laid out from the profits of his own and his wifes literary exertions we dined early and had a very pleasant dinner and after the cloth was removed mr hall was graciously pleased to drink my health following it with a long tribute to my genius i answered briefly and one half of my short speech was in all probability very foolish after the ladies there were three one being a girl of seventeen with rich auburn hair the adopted daughter of the halls had retired drhaving been toasted himself proposed mrs halls health i did not have a great deal of conversation with mrs hall but enough to make me think her a genuine and good woman unspoilt by a literary career and retaining more sentiment than even most girls keep beyond seventeen she told me that it had been the dream of her life to see longfellow and myself her dream is half accomplished now and as they say longfellow is coming over this summer the remainder may soon be rounded out on taking leave our kind hosts presented me with some beautiful flowers and with three volumes of a work by themselves on ireland and drwas favored also with some flowers and a plant in a pot and bennoch too had his hands full and we went on our way rejoicing here follows an account of the lord mayors dinner taken mostly for our old home but i think i will copy this more exact description of the lady mentioned in civic banquets ed my eyes were mostly drawn to a young lady who sat nearly opposite me across the table she was i suppose dark and yet not dark but rather seemed to be of pure white marble yet not white but the purest and finest complexion without a shade of color in it yet anything but sallow or sickly her hair was a wonderful deep ravenblack black as night black as death not ravenblack for that has a shiny gloss and hers had not but it was hair never to be painted nor described wonderful hair jewish hair her nose had a beautiful outline though i could see that it was jewish too and that and all her features were so fine that sculpture seemed a despicable art beside her and certainly my pen is good for nothing if any likeness could be given however it must be by sculpture not painting she was slender and youthful and yet had a stately and cold though soft and womanly grace and looking at her i saw what were the wives of the old patriarchs in their maiden or earlymarried days what judith was for womanly as she looked i doubt not she could have slain a man in a just cause what bathsheba was only she seemed to have no sin in her perhaps what eve was though one could hardly think her weak enough to eat the apple whether owing to distinctness of race my sense that she was a jewess or whatever else i felt a sort of repugnance simultaneously with my perception that she was an admirable creature the house of commons at ten oclock the next day after the lord mayors dinner i went to lunch with bennoch and afterwards accompanied him to one of the government offices in downing street he went thither not on official business but on a matter connected with a monument to miss mitford in which mr harness a clergyman and some sort of a government clerk is interested i gathered from this conversation that there is no great enthusiasm about the monumental affair among the british public it surprised me to hear allusions indicating that miss mitford was not the invariably amiable person that her writings would suggest but the whole drift of what they said tended nevertheless towards the idea that she was an excellent and generous person loved most by those who knew her best from downing street we crossed over and entered westminster hall and passed through it and up the flight of steps at its farthest end and along the avenue of statues into the vestibule of the house of commons it was now somewhat past five and we stood at the inner entrance of the house to see the members pass in bennoch pointing out to me the distinguished ones i was not much impressed with the appearance of the members generally they seemed to me rather shabbier than english gentlemen usually and i saw or fancied in many of them a certain selfimportance as they passed into the interior betokening them to be very full of their dignity some of them looked more american more like american politicians than most englishmen do there was now and then a grayheaded country gentleman the very type of stupidity and two or three city members came up and spoke to bennoch and showed themselves quite as dull in their aldermanic way as the country squires bennoch pointed out lord john russell a small very short elderly gentleman in a brown coat and so large a hat not large of brim but large like a peckmeasure that i saw really no face beneath it by and by came a rather tall slender person in a black frockcoat buttoned up and black pantaloons taking long steps but i thought rather feebly or listlessly his shoulders were round or else he had a habitual stoop in them he had a prominent nose a thin face and a sallow very sallow complexion and had i seen him in america i should have taken him for a hardworked editor of a newspaper weary and worn with nightlabor and want of exercise aged before his time it was disraeli and i never saw any other englishman look in the least like him though in america his appearance would not attract notice as being unusual i do not remember any other noteworthy person whom we saw enter in fact the house had already been some time in session and most of the members were in their places we were to dine at the refectory of the house with the new member for boston and meanwhile bennoch obtained admittance for us into the speakers gallery where we had a view of the members and could hear what was going on a mr muntz was speaking on the income tax and he was followed by sir george cornewall lewis and others but it was all very uninteresting without the slightest animation or attempt at oratory which indeed would have been quite out of place we saw lord palmerston but at too great a distance to distinguish anything but a gray head the house had daylight in it when we entered and for some time afterwards but by and by the roof which i had taken to be a solid and opaque ceiling suddenly brightened and showed itself to be transparent a vast expanse of tinted and figured glass through which came down a great mild radiance on the members below the character of the debate however did not grow more luminous or vivacious so we went down into the vestibule and there waited for mr who soon came and led us into the refectory it was very much like the coffeeroom of a club the strict rule forbids the entrance of any but members of parliament but it seems to be winked at although there is another room opening beyond this where the law of seclusion is strictly enforced the dinner was good not remarkably so but good enough a soup some turbot or salmon cutlets and i know not what else and claret sherry and port for as mrsaid he did not wish to be stingy mris a selfmade man and a strong instance of the difference between the englishman and the american when selfmade and without early education he is no more a gentleman now than when he began life not a whit more refined either outwardly or inwardly while the american would have been after the same experience not distinguishable outwardly and perhaps as refined within as nine tenths of the gentlemen born in the house of commons and besides an american comes naturally to any distinctions to which success in life may bring him he takes them as if they were his proper inheritance and in no wise to be wondered at mr on the other hand took evidently a childish delight in his position and felt a childish wonder in having arrived at it nor did it seem real to him after all we again saw disraeli who has risen from the people by modes perhaps somewhat like those of mr he came and stood near our table looking at the bill of fare and then sat down on the opposite side of the room with another gentleman and ate his dinner the story of his marriage does him much credit and indeed i am inclined to like disraeli as a man who has made his own place good among a hostile aristocracy and leads instead of following them from the house of commons we went to albert smiths exhibition or lecture of the ascent of mont blanc to which bennoch had orders it was very amusing and in some degree instructive we remained in the saloon at the conclusion of the lecture and when the audience had dispersed mr albert smith made his appearance nothing of moment happened the next day at least not till two oclock when i went with mr bowman to birchs eatinghouse it is not birchs now but this was the name of the original founder who became an alderman and has long been dead for a basin of turtlesoup it was very rich very good better than we had at the lord mayors and the best i ever ate in the evening mr j b davis formerly our secretary of legation called to take us to dine at mr s in camden town mrcalls his residence vermont house but it hardly has a claim to any separate title being one of the centre houses of a block i forget whether i mentioned his calling on me he is a vermonter a graduate of yale college who has been here several years and has established a sort of book brokerage buying libraries for those who want them and rare works and editions for american collectors his business naturally brings him into relations with literary people and he is himself a kindly and pleasant man on our arrival we found mr dand one of his sisters already there and soon came a mr peabody who if i mistake not is one of the salem peabodys and has some connection with the present eminent london mr peabody at any rate he is a very sensible wellinstructed and widely and long travelled man mr tom taylor was also expected but owing to some accident or mistake he did not come for above an hour all which time our host waited but mr tom taylor a wit a satirist and a famous diner out is too formidable and too valuable a personage to be treated cavalierly in the interim mrshowed us some rare old books which he has in his private collection a blackletter edition of chaucer and other specimens of the early english printers and i was impressed as i have often been with the idea that we have made few if any improvements in the art of printing though we have greatly facilitated the modes of it he showed us drydens translation of virgil with dr johnsons autograph in it and a large collection of bibles of all dates church bibles family bibles of the common translation and older ones he says he has written or is writing a history of the bible as a printed work i presume many of these bibles had no doubt been in actual and daily use from generation to generation but they were now all splendidly bound and were likewise very clean and smooth in fact every leaf had been cleansed by a delicate process a part of which consisted in soaking the whole book in a tub of water during several days mris likewise rich in manuscripts having a spanish document with the signature of the son of columbus a whole little volume in franklins handwriting being the first specimen of it and the original manuscripts of many of the songs of burns among these i saw auld lang syne and bruces address to his army we amused ourselves with these matters as long as we could but at last as there was to be a party in the evening dinner could no longer be put off so we took our seats at table and immediately afterwards mr taylor made his appearance with his wife and another lady mr taylor is reckoned a brilliant conversationist but i suppose he requires somebody to draw him out and assist him for i could hear nothing that i thought very remarkable on this occasion he is not a kind of man whom i can talk with or greatly help to talk so though i sat next to him nothing came of it he told me some stories of his life in the temple little funny incidents that he afterwards wrought into his dramas in short a sensible activeminded clearly perceptive man with a humorous way of showing up men and matters i wish i could know exactly what the english style good conversation probably it is something like plumpudding as heavy but seldom so rich after dinner mr tom taylor and mr d with their respective ladies took their leave but when we returned to the drawingroom we found it thronged with a good many people mr s c hall was there with his wife whom i was glad to see again for this was the third time of meeting her and in this whirl of new acquaintances i felt quite as if she were an old friend mr william howitt was also there and introduced me to his wife a very natural kind and pleasant lady and she presented me to one or two daughters mr marston the dramatist was also introduced to me and mr helps a thin scholarly cold sort of a man dr mackay and his wife were there too and a certain mr jones a sculptor a jolly large elderly person with a twinkle in his eye also a mr godwin who impressed me as quite a superior person gentlemanly cultivated a man of sensibility but it is quite impossible to take a clear imprint from any one character where so many are stamped upon ones notice at once this mr godwin as we were discussing thackeray said that he is most beautifully tender and devoted to his wife whenever she can be sensible of his attentions he says that thackeray in his real self is a sweet sad man i grew weary of so many people especially of the ladies who were rather superfluous in their oblations quite stifling me indeed with the incense that they burnt under my nose so far as i could judge they had all been invited there to see me it is ungracious even hoggish not to be gratified with the interest they expressed in me but then it is really a bore and one does not know what to do or say i felt like the hippopotamus or to use a more modest illustration like some strange insect imprisoned under a tumbler with a dozen eyes watching whatever i did by and by mr jones the sculptor relieved me by standing up against the mantelpiece and telling an irish story not to two or three auditors but to the whole drawingroom all attentive as to a set exhibition it was very funny the next day after this i went with mr bowman to call on our minister and found that he and four of the ladies of his family with his son had gone to the queens drawingroom we lunched at the wellington and spent an hour or more in looking out of the window of that establishment at the carriages with their pompous coachmen and footmen driving to and from the palace of st james and at the horse guards with their bright cuirasses stationed along the street then i took the rail for liverpool while i was still at breakfast at the waterloo j came in ruddycheeked smiling very glad to see me and looking i thought a good deal taller than when i left him and so ended my london excursion which has certainly been rich in incident and character though my account of it be but meagre scotland glasgow may th last friday may d i took the rail with mr bowman from the lime street station for glasgow there was nothing of much interest along the road except that when we got beyond penrith we saw snow on the tops of some of the hills twilight came on as we were entering scotland and i have only a recollection of bleak and bare hills and villages dimly seen until nearing glasgow we saw the red blaze of furnacelights at frequent ironfounderies we put up at the queens hotel where we arrived about ten oclock a better hotel than i have anywhere found in england new well arranged and with brisk attendance in the morning i rambled largely about glasgow and found it to be chiefly a modernbuilt city with streets mostly wide and regular and handsome houses and public edifices of a dark gray stone in front of our hotel in an enclosed green space stands a tall column surmounted by a statue of sir walter scott a good statue i should think as conveying the air and personal aspect of the man there is a bronze equestrian statue of the queen in one of the streets and one or two more equestrian or other statues of eminent persons i passed through the trongate and the gallowgate and visited the saltmarket and saw the steeple of the tolbooth all of which scott has made interesting and i went through the gate of the university and penetrated into its enclosed courts round which the college edifices are built they are not gothic but of the age i suppose of james i with oddlooking conicalroofed towers and here and there the bust of a benefactor in niches round the courts and heavy stone staircases ascending from the pavement outside the buildings all of dark gray granite cold hard and venerable the university stands in high street in a dense part of the town and a very old and shabby part too i think the poorer classes of glasgow excel even those in liverpool in the bad eminence of filth uncombed and unwashed children drunkenness disorderly deportment evil smell and all that makes city poverty disgusting in my opinion however they are a betterlooking people than the english and this is true of all classes more intelligent of aspect with more regular features i looked for the high cheekbones which have been attributed as a characteristic feature to the scotch but could not find them what most distinguishes them front the english is the regularity of the nose which is straight or sometimes a little curved inward whereas the english nose has no law whatever but disports itself in all manner of irregularity i very soon learned to recognize the scotch face and when not too scotch it is a handsome one in another part of the high street up a pretty steep slope and on one side of a public green near an edifice which i think is a medical college stands st mungos cathedral it is hardly of cathedral dimensions though a large and fine old church the price of a ticket of admittance is twopence so small that it might be as well to make the entrance free the interior is in excellent repair with the nave and side aisles and clustered pillars and intersecting arches that belong to all these old churches and a few monuments along the walls i was going away without seeing any more than this but the verger a friendly old gentleman with a hearty scotch way of speaking told me that the crypts were what chiefly interested strangers and so he guided me down into the foundationstory of the church where there is an intricacy and entanglement of immensely massive and heavy arches supporting the structure above the view through these arches among the great shafts of the columns was very striking in the central part is a monument a recumbent figure if i remember rightly but it is not known whom it commemorates there is also a monument to a scotch prelate which seems to have been purposely defaced probably in covenant times these intricate arches were the locality of one of the scenes in rob roy when rob gives frank osbaldistone some message or warning and then escapes from him into the obscurity behind in one corner is st mungos well secured with a wooden cover but i should not care to drink water that comes from among so many old graves after viewing the cathedral i got back to the hotel just in time to go from thence to the steamer wharf and take passage up the clyde there was nothing very interesting in this little voyage we passed many small iron steamers and some large ones and green fields along the rivershores villas villages and all such suburban objects neither am i quite sure of the name of the place we landed at though i think it was bowling here we took the railway for balloch and the only place or thing i remember during this transit was a huge bluff or crag rising abruptly from a riverside and looking in connection with its vicinity to the highlands just such a site as would be taken for the foundation of a castle on inquiry it turned out that this abrupt and doubleheaded hill for it has two summits with a cleft between is the site of dumbarton castle for ages one of the strongest fortresses in scotland and still kept up as a garrisoned place at the distance and point of view at which we passed it the castle made no show arriving at balloch we found it a small village with no marked features and a hotel where we got some lunch and then we took a stroll over the bridge across the levers while waiting for the steamer to take us up loch lomond it was a beautiful afternoon warm and sunny and after walking about a mile we had a fine view of loch lomond and of the mountains around and beyond it ben lomond among the rest it is vain at a weeks distance to try to remember the shapes of mountains so i shall attempt no description of them and content myself with saying that they did not quite come up to my anticipations in due time we returned to our hotel and found in the coffeeroom a tall whitehaired venerable gentleman and a pleasantlooking young lady his daughter they had been eating lunch and the young lady helped her father on with his outside garment and his comforter and gave him his stick just as any other daughter might do all of which i mention because he was a nobleman and moreover had engaged all the posthorses at the inn so that we could not continue our travels by land along the side of loch lomond as we had first intended at four oclock the railway train arrived again with a very moderate number of passengers who and we among them immediately embarked on board a neat little steamer which was waiting for us the day was bright and cloudless but there was a strong cold breeze blowing down the lake so that it was impossible without vast discomfort to stand in the bow of the steamer and look at the scenery i looked at it indeed along the sides as we passed and on our track behind and no doubt it was very fine but from all the experience i have had i do not think scenery can be well seen from the water at any rate the shores of loch lomond have faded completely out of my memory nor can i conceive that they really were very striking at a years interval i can recollect the cluster of hills around the head of lake windermere at twenty years interval i remember the shores of lake champlain but of the shores of this scottish lake i remember nothing except some oddly shaped rocks called the cobbler and his daughter on a mountaintop just before we landed but indeed we had very imperfect glimpses of the hills along the latter part of the course because the wind had grown so very cold that we took shelter below and merely peeped at loch lomonds sublimities from the cabinwindows the whole voyage up loch lomond is i think about thirtytwo miles but we landed at a place called tarbet much short of the ultimate point there is here a large hotel but we passed it and walked onward a mile or two to arroquhar a secluded glen among the hills where is a new hotel built in the old manorhouse style and occupying the site of what was once a castle of the chief of the macfarlanes over the portal is a stone taken from the former house bearing the date there is a little lake near the house and the hills shut in the whole visible scene so closely that there appears no outlet nor communication with the external world but in reality this little lake is connected with loch long and loch long is an arm of the sea so that there is water communication between arroquhar and glasgow we found this a very beautiful place and being quite sheltered from all winds that blew we strolled about late into the prolonged twilight and admired the outlines of the surrounding hills and fancied resemblances to various objects in the shapes of the crags against the evening sky the sun had not set till nearly if not quite eight oclock and before the daylight had quite gone the northern lights streamed out and i do not think that there was much darkness over the glen of arroquhar that night at all events before the darkness came we withdrew into the coffeeroom we had excellent beds and sleepingrooms in this new hotel and i remember nothing more till morning when we were astir betimes and had some chops for breakfast then our host mr macregor who is also the host of our hotel at glasgow and has many of the characteristics of an american landlord claiming to be a gentleman and the equal of his guests took us in a drosky and drove us to the shore of loch lomond at a point about four miles from arroquhar the lake is here a mile and a half wide and it was our object to cross to inversnaid on the opposite shore so first we waved a handkerchief and then kindled some straw on the beach in order to attract the notice of the ferryman at inversnaid it was half an hour before our signals and shoutings resulted in the putting off of a boat with two oarsmen who made the transit pretty speedily and thus we got across loch lomond at inversnaid there is a small hotel and over the rock on which it stands a little waterfall tumbles into the lake a very little one though i believe it is reckoned among the other picturesque features of the scene we were now in rob roys country and at the distance of a mile or so along the shore of the lake is rob roys cave where he and his followers are supposed to have made their abode in troublous times while lunch was getting ready we again took the boat and went thither landing beneath a precipitous though not very lofty crag we clambered up a rude pathway and came to the mouth of the cave which is nothing but a fissure or fissures among some great rocks that have tumbled confusedly together there is hardly anywhere space enough for half a dozen persons to crowd themselves together nor room to stand upright on the whole it is no cave at all but only a crevice and in the deepest and darkest part you can look up and see the sky it may have sheltered rob roy for a night and might partially shelter any christian during a shower returning to the hotel we started in a drosky i do not know whether this is the right name of the vehicle or whether it has a right name but it is a carriage in which four persons sit back to back two before and two behind for aberfoyle the mountainside ascends very steeply from the inn door and not to damp the horses courage in the outset we went up on foot the guidebook says that the prospect from the summit of the ascent is very fine but i really believe we forgot to turn round and look at it all through our drive however we had mountain views in plenty especially of great ben lomond with his snowcovered head round which since our entrance into the highlands we had been making a circuit nothing can possibly be drearier than the mountains at this season bare barren and bleak with black patches of withered heath variegating the dead brown of the herbage on their sides and as regards trees the hills are perfectly naked there were no frightful precipices no boldly picturesque features along our road but high weary slopes showing miles and miles of heavy solitude with here and there a highland hut built of stone and thatched and in one place an old gray ruinous fortress a station of the english troops after the rebellion of and once or twice a village of hills the inhabitants of which old and young ran to their doors to stare at us for several miles after we left inversnaid the mountainstream which makes the waterfall brawled along the roadside all the hills are sheeppastures and i never saw such wild rough raggedlooking creatures as the sheep with their black faces and tattered wool the little lambs were very numerous poor things coming so early in the season into this inclement region and it was laughable to see how invariably when startled by our approach they scampered to their mothers and immediately began to suck it would seem as if they sought a draught from the maternal udder wherewith to fortify and encourage their poor little hearts but i suppose their instinct merely drove them close to their dams and being there they took advantage of their opportunity these sheep must lead a hard life during the winter for they are never fed nor sheltered the day was sunless and very uncomfortably cold and we were not sorry to walk whenever the steepness of the road gave us cause i do not remember what oclock it was but not far into the afternoon when we reached the baillie nicoljarvie inn at aberfoyle a scene which is much more interesting in the pages of rob roy than we found it in reality here we got into a sort of cart and set out over another hillpath as dreary as or drearier than the last for the trosachs on our way we saw ben venue and a good many other famous bens and two or three lochs and when we reached the trosachs we should probably have been very much enraptured if our eyes had not already been weary with other mountain shapes but in truth i doubt if anybody ever does really see a mountain who goes for the set and sole purpose of seeing it nature will not let herself be seen in such cases you must patiently bide her time and by and by at some unforeseen moment she will quietly and suddenly unveil herself and for a brief space allow you to look right into the heart of her mystery but if you call out to her peremptorily nature unveil yourself this very moment she only draws her veil the closer and you may look with all your eyes and imagine that you see all that she can show and yet see nothing thus i saw a wild and confused assemblage of heights crags precipices which they call the trosachs but i saw them calmly and coldly and was glad when the drosky was ready to take us on to callender the hotel at the trosachs by the by is a very splendid one in the form of an old feudal castle with towers and turrets all among these wild hills there is set preparation for enraptured visitants and it seems strange that the savage features do not subside of their own accord and that there should still be cold winds and snow on the top of ben lomond and rocks and heather and ragged sheep now that there are so many avenues by which the commonplace world is sluiced in among the highlands i think that this fashion of the picturesque will pass away we drove along the shore of lake vennachar and onward to callender which i believe is either the first point in the lowlands or the last in the highlands it is a large village on the river teith we stopped here to dine and were some time in getting any warmth into our benumbed bodies for as i said before it was a very cold day looking from the window of the hotel i saw a young man in highland dress with bare thighs marching through the village street towards the lowlands with a martial and elastic step as if he were going forth to conquer and occupy the world i suppose he was a soldier who had been absent on leave returning to the garrison at stirling i pitied his poor thighs though he certainly did not look uncomfortable after dinner as dusk was coming on and we had still a long drive before us eighteen miles i believe we took a close carriage and two horses and set off for stirling the twilight was too obscure to show many things along the road and by the time we drove into stirling we could but dimly see the houses in the long street in which stood our hotel there was a good fire in the coffeeroom which looked like a drawingroom in a large oldfashioned mansion and was hung round with engravings of the portraits of the county members and a master of foxhounds and other pictures we made ourselves comfortable with some tea and retired early in the morning we were stirring betimes and found stirling to be a pretty large town of rather ancient aspect with many gray stone houses the gables of which are notched on either side like a flight of stairs the town stands on the slope of a hill at the summit of which crowning a long ascent up which the paved street reaches all the way to its gate is stirling castle of course we went thither and found free entrance although the castle is garrisoned by five or six hundred men among whom are barelegged highlanders i must say that this costume is very fine and becoming though their thighs did look blue and frostbitten and also some soldiers of other scotch regiments with tartan trousers almost immediately on passing the gate we found an old artilleryman who undertook to show us round the castle only a small portion of it seems to be of great antiquity the principal edifice within the castle wall is a palace that was either built or renewed by james vi and it is ornamented with strange old statues one of which is his own the old scottish parliament house is also here the most ancient part of the castle is the tower where one of the earls of douglas was stabbed by a king and afterwards thrown out of the window in reading this story one imagines a lofty turret and the dead man tumbling headlong from a great height but in reality the window is not more than fifteen or twenty feet from the garden into which he fell this part of the castle was burned last autumn but is now under repair and the wall of the tower is still stanch and strong we went up into the chamber where the murder took place and looked through the historic window then we mounted the castle wall where it broods over a precipice of many hundred feet perpendicular looking down upon a level plain below and forth upon a landscape every foot of which is richly studded with historic events there is a small peephole in the wall which queen mary is said to have been in the habit of looking through it is a most splendid view in the distance the blue highlands with a variety of mountain outlines that i could have studied unweariably and in another direction beginning almost at the foot of the castle hill were the links of forth where over a plain of miles in extent the river meandered and circled about and returned upon itself again and again and again as if knotted into a silver chain which it was difficult to imagine to be all one stream the history of scotland might be read from this castle wall as on a book of mighty page for here within the compass of a few miles we see the field where wallace won the battle of stirling and likewise the battlefield of bannockburn and that of falkirk and sheriffmuir and i know not how many besides around the castle hill there is a walk with seats for old and infirm persons at points sheltered from the wind we followed it downward and i think we passed over the site where the games used to be held and where this morning some of the soldiers of the garrison were going through their exercises i ought to have mentioned that passing through the inner gateway of the castle we saw the round tower and glanced into the dungeon where the roderic dhu of scotts poem was left to die it is one of the two round towers between which the portcullis rose and fell edinburgh the palace of holyrood at eleven oclock we took the rail for edinburgh and i remember nothing more except that the cultivation and verdure of the country were very agreeable after our experience of highland barrenness and desolation until we found the train passing close at the base of the rugged crag of edinburgh castle we established ourselves at queens hotel in princes street and then went out to view the city the monument to sir walter scott a rather fantastic and not very impressive affair i thought stands almost directly in front of a hotel we went along princes street and thence by what turns i know not to the palace of holyrood which stands on a low and sheltered site and is a venerable edifice arthurs seat rises behind it a high hill with a plain between as we drew near the palace mr bowman who has been here before pointed out the windows of queen marys apartments in a circular tower on the left of the gateway on entering the enclosed quadrangle we bought tickets for sixpence each admitting us to all parts of the palace that are shown to visitors and first we went into a noble hall or gallery a long and stately room hung with pictures of ancient scottish kings and though the pictures were none of them authentic they at least answer an excellent purpose in the way of upholstery it was here that the young pretender gave the ball which makes one of the scenes in waverley thence we passed into the old historic rooms of the palace darnleys and queen marys apartments which everybody has seen and described they are very dreary and shabbylooking rooms with bare floors and here and there a piece of tapestry faded into a neutral tint and carved and ornamented ceilings looking shabbier than plain whitewash we saw queen marys old bedstead low with four tall posts and her lookingglass which she brought with her from france and which has often reflected the beauty that set everybody mad and some needlework and other womanly matters of hers and we went into the little closet where she was having such a cosey supperparty with two or three friends when the conspirators broke in and stabbed rizzio before her face we saw too the bloodstain at the threshold of the door in the next room opening upon the stairs the body of rizzio was flung down here and the attendant told us that it lay in that spot all night the bloodstain covers a large space much larger than i supposed and it gives the impression that there must have been a great pool and sop of blood on all the spot covered by rizzios body staining the floor deeply enough never to be washed out it is now of a dark brown hue and i do not see why it may not be the genuine veritable stain the floor thereabouts appears not to have been scrubbed much for i touched it with my finger and found it slightly rough but it is strange that the many footsteps should not have smoothed it in three hundred years one of the articles shown us in queen marys apartments was the breastplate supposed to have been worn by lord ruthven at the murder a heavy plate of iron and doubtless a very uncomfortable waistcoat holyrood abbey from the palace we passed into the contiguous ruin of holyrood abbey which is roofless although the front and some broken columns along the nave and fragments of architecture here and there afford hints of a magnificent gothic church in bygone times it deserved to be magnificent for here have been stately ceremonials marriages of kings coronations investitures before the high altar which has now been overthrown or crumbled away and the floor so far as there is any floor consists of tombstones of the old scottish nobility there are likewise monuments bearing the names of illustrious scotch families and inscriptions in the scotch dialect on the walls in one of the front towers the only remaining one indeed we saw the marble tomb of a nobleman lord belhaven who is represented reclining on the top with a bruised nose of course except in westminster abbey i do not remember ever to have seen an old monumental statue with the nose entire in all political or religious outbreaks the mobs first impulse is to hit the illustrious dead on their noses at the other end of the abbey near the high altar is the vault where the old scottish kings used to be buried but looking in through the window i saw only a vacant space no skull nor bone nor the least fragment of a coffin in fact i believe the royal dead were turned out of their last home on occasion of the revolutionary movements at the accession of william iii high street and the grassmarket quitting the abbey and the palace we turned into the canongate and passed thence into high street which i think is a continuation of the canongate and being now in the old town of edinburgh we saw those immensely tall houses seven stories high where the people live in tiers all the way from earth to middle air they were not so quaint and strange looking as i expected but there were some houses of very antique individuality and among them that of john knox which looks still in good repair one thing did not in the least fall short of my expectations the evil odor for which edinburgh has an immemorial renown nor the dirt of the inhabitants old and young the town to say the truth when you are in the midst of it has a very sordid grimy shabby upswept unwashen aspect grievously at variance with all poetic and romantic associations from the high street we turned aside into the grassmarket the scene of the porteous mob and we found in the pavement a cross on the site where the execution of porteous is supposed to have taken place the castle returning thence to the high street we followed it up to the castle which is nearer the town and of more easy access from it than i had supposed there is a large court or parade before the castle gate with a parapet on the abrupt side of the hill looking towards arthurs seat and salisbury crags mud overhanging a portion of the old town as we leaned over this parapet my nose was conscious of the bad odor of edinburgh although the streets whence it must have come were hundreds of feet below i have had some experience of this ugly smell in the poor streets of liverpool but i think i never perceived it before crossing the atlantic it is the odor of an old system of life the scent of the pine forests is still too recent with us for it to be known in america the castle of edinburgh is free as appears to be the case with all garrisoned places in great britain to the entrance of any peaceable person so we went in and found a large space enclosed within the walls and dwellings for officers and accommodation for soldiers who were being drilled or loitering about and as the hill still ascends within the external wall of the castle we climbed to the summit and there found an old soldier whom we engaged to be our guide he showed us mons meg a great old cannon broken at the breech but still aimed threateningly from the highest ramparts and then he admitted us into an old chapel said to have been built by a queen of scotland the sister of harold king of england and occupying the very highest part of the hill it is the smallest place of worship i ever saw but of venerable architecture and of very solid construction the old soldier had not much more to show us but he pointed out the window whence one of the kings of scotland is said when a baby to have been lowered down the whole height of the castle to the bottom of the precipice on which it stands a distance of seven hundred feet after the soldier had shown us to the extent of his jurisdiction we went into a suite of rooms in one of which i saw a portrait of queen mary which gave me for the first time an idea that she was really a very beautiful woman in this picture she is wonderfully so a tender womanly grace which was none the less tender and graceful for being equally imbued with queenly dignity and spirit it was too lovely a head to be cut off i should be glad to know the authenticity of this picture i do not know that we did anything else worthy of note before leaving edinburgh there is matter enough in and about the town to interest the visitor for a very long time but when the visit is calculated on such brevity as ours was we get weary of the place before even these few hours come to an end thus for my part i was not sorry when in the course of the afternoon we took the rail for melrose where we duly arrived and put up at the george inn melrose melrose is a village of rather antique aspect situated on the slope and at the bottom of the eildon hills which from this point of view appear like one hill with a double summit the village as i said has an old look though many of the houses have at least been refronted at some recent date but others are as ancient i suppose as the days when the abbey was in its splendor a rustic and peasantlike antiquity however lowroofed and strawthatched there is an aged cross of stone in the centre of the town our first object of course was to see the abbey which stands just on the outskirts of the village and is attainable only by applying at a neighboring house the inhabitant of which probably supports himself and most comfortably too as a showman of the ruin he unlocked the wooden gate and admitted us into what is left of the abbey comprising only the ruins of the church although the refectory the dormitories and the other parts of the establishment formerly covered the space now occupied by a dozen village houses melrose abbey is a very satisfactory ruin all carpeted along its nave and transepts with green grass and there are some wellgrown trees within the walls we saw the window now empty through which the tints of the painted glass fell on the tombstone of michael scott and the tombstone itself broken in three pieces but with a cross engraven along its whole length it must have been the monument of an old monk or abbot rather than a wizard there too is still the marble stone on which the monk and warrior sat them down and which is supposed to mark the restingplace of alexander of scotland there are remains both without and within the abbey of most curious and wonderfully minute old sculpture foliage in places where it is almost impossible to see them and where the sculptor could not have supposed that they would be seen but which yet are finished faithfully to the very veins of each leaf in stone and there is a continual variety of this accurate toil on the exterior of the edifice there is equal minuteness of finish and a great many niches for statues all of which i believe are now gone although there are carved faces at some points and angles the graveyard around the abbey is still the only one which the village has and is crowded with gravestones among which i read the inscription of one erected by sir walter scott to the memory of thomas pardy one of his servants some sable birds either rooks or jackdaws were flitting about the ruins inside and out mr bowman and i talked about revisiting melrose by moonlight but luckily there was to be no moon that evening i do not myself think that daylight and sunshine make a ruin less effective than twilight or moonshine in reference to scotts description i think he deplorably diminishes the impressiveness of the scene by saying that the alternate buttresses seen by moonlight look as if made of ebon and ivory it suggests a small and very pretty piece of cabinetwork not these gray rough walls which time has gnawed upon for a thousand years without eating them away leaving the abbey we took a path or a road which led us to the river tweed perhaps a quarter of a mile off and we crossed it by a footbridge a pretty wide stream a dimpling breadth of transparent water flowing between low banks with a margin of pebbles we then returned to our inn and had tea and passed a quiet evening by the fireside this is a good unpretentious inn and its visitors book indicates that it affords general satisfaction to those who come here in the morning we breakfasted on broiled salmon taken no doubt in the neighboring tweed there was a very coarselooking man at table with us who informed us that he owned the best horse anywhere round the eildon hills and could make the best cast for a salmon and catch a bigger fish than anybody with other selflaudation of the same kind the waiter afterwards told us that he was the son of an admiral in the neighborhood and soon his horse being brought to the door we saw him mount and ride away he sat on horseback with ease and grace though i rather suspect early as it was that he was already in his cups the scotch seem to me to get drunk at very unseasonable hours i have seen more drunken people here than during all my residence in england and generally early in the day their liquor so far as i have observed makes them goodnatured and sociable imparting a perhaps needed geniality to their cold natures after breakfast we took a drosky or whatever these foreandaftseated vehicles are called and set out for dryburgh abbey three miles distant it was a cold though rather bright morning with a most shrewd and bitter wind which blew directly in my face as i sat beside the driver an english wind is bad enough but methinks a scotch one is rather worse at any rate i was half frozen and wished dryburgh abbey in tophet where it would have been warmer work to go and see it some of the border hills were striking especially the cowden knowe which ascends into a prominent and lofty peak such villages as we passed did not greatly differ from english villages by and by we came to the banks of the tweed at a point where there is a ferry a carriage was on the riverbank the driver waiting beside it for the people who came in it had already been ferried across to see the abbey the ferryman here is a young girl and stepping into the boat she shoved off and so skilfully took advantage of the eddies of the stream which is here deep and rapid that we were soon on the other side she was by no means an uncomely maiden with pleasant scotch features and a quiet intelligence of aspect gleaming into a smile when spoken to much tanned with all kinds of weather and though slender yet so agile and muscular that it was no shame for a man to let himself be rowed by her from the ferry we had a walk of half a mile more or less to a cottage where we found another young girl whose business it is to show the abbey she was of another mould than the ferrymaiden a queer shy plaintive sort of a body and answered all our questions in a low wailing tone passing through an appleorchard we were not long in reaching the abbey the ruins of which are much more extensive and more picturesque than those of melrose being overrun with bushes and shrubbery and twined about with ivy and all such vegetation as belongs naturally to old walls there are the remains of the refectory and other domestic parts of the abbey as well as the church and all in delightful state of decay not so far gone but that we had bits of its former grandeur in the columns and broken arches and in some portions of the edifice that still retain a roof in the chapterhouse we saw a marble statue of newton wofully maltreated by damps and weather and though it had no sort of business there it fitted into the ruins picturesquely enough there is another statue equally unauthorized both having been placed here by a former earl of buchan who seems to have been a little astray in his wits on one side of the church within an arched recess are the monuments of sir walter scott and his family three ponderous tombstones of aberdeen granite polished but already dimmed and dulled by the weather the whole floor of the recess is covered by these monuments that of sir walter being the middle one with lady or as the inscription calls her dame scott beyond him next to the church wall and some one of his sons or daughters on the hither side the effect of his being buried here is to make the whole of dryburgh abbey his monument there is another arched recess twin to the scott burialplace and contiguous to it in which are buried a pringle family it being their ancient place of sepulture the spectator almost inevitably feels as if they were intruders although their rights here are of far older date than those of scott dryburgh abbey must be a most beautiful spot of a summer afternoon and it was beautiful even on this not very genial morning especially when the sun blinked out upon the ivy and upon the shrubberied paths that wound about the ruins i think i recollect the birds chirruping in this neighborhood of it after viewing it sufficiently sufficiently for this one time we went back to the ferry and being set across by the same undine we drove back to melrose no longer riding against the wind i found it not nearly so cold as before i now noticed that the eildon hills seen from this direction rise from one base into three distinct summits ranged in a line according to the lay of the last minstrel they were cleft into this shape by the magic of michael scott reaching melrose without alighting we set off for abbotsford three miles off the neighborhood of melrose leading to abbotsford has many handsome residences of modern build and very recent date suburban villas each with its little lawn and garden ground such as we see in the vicinity of liverpool i noticed too one castellated house of no great size but old and looking as if its tower were built not for show but for actual defence in the old border warfare we were not long in reaching abbotsford the house which is more compact and of considerably less extent than i anticipated stands in full view from the road and at only a short distance from it lower down towards the river its aspect disappointed me but so does everything it is but a villa after all no castle nor even a large manorhouse and very unsatisfactory when you consider it in that light indeed it impressed me not as a real house intended for the home of human beings a house to die in or to be born in but as a plaything something in the same category as horace walpoles strawberry hill the present owner seems to have found it insufficient for the actual purposes of life for he is adding a wing which promises to be as extensive as the original structure we rang at the front door the family being now absent and were speedily admitted by a middleaged or somewhat elderly man the butler i suppose or some upper servant who at once acceded to our request to be permitted to see the house we stepped from the porch immediately into the entrancehall and having the great hall of battle abbey in my memory and the ideal of a baronial hall in my mind i was quite taken aback at the smallness and narrowness and lowness of this which however is a very fine one on its own little scale in truth it is not much more than a vestibule the ceiling is carved and every inch of the walls is covered with claymores targets and other weapons and armor or oldtime curiosities tastefully arranged many of which no doubt have a history attached to them or had in sir walters own mind our attendant was a very intelligent person and pointed out much that was interesting but in such a multitudinous variety it was almost impossible to fix the eye upon any one thing probably the apartment looked smaller than it really was on account of being so wainscoted and festooned with curiosities i remember nothing particularly unless it be the coalgrate in the fireplace which was one formerly used by archbishop sharpe the prelate whom balfour of burley murdered either in this room or the next one there was a glass case containing the suit of clothes last worn by scott a short green coat somewhat worn with silvered buttons a pair of gray tartan trousers and a white hat it was in the hall that we saw these things for there too i recollect were a good many walkingsticks that had been used by scott and the hatchet with which he was in the habit of lopping branches from his trees as he walked among them from the hall we passed into the study a small room lined with the books which sir walter no doubt was most frequently accustomed to refer to and our guide pointed out some volumes of the moniteur which he used while writing the history of napoleon probably these were the driest and dullest volumes in his whole library about midheight of the walls of the study there is a gallery with a short flight of steps for the convenience of getting at the upper books a studytable occupied the centre of the room and at one end of the table stands an easychair covered with morocco and with ample space to fling ones self back the servant told me that i might sit down in this chair for that sir walter sat there while writing his romances and perhaps quoth the man smiling you may catch some inspiration what a bitter word this would have been if he had known me to be a romancewriter no i never shall be inspired to write romances i answered as if such an idea had never occurred to me i sat down however this study quite satisfied me being planned on principles of commonsense and made to work in and without any fantastic adaptation of old forms to modern uses next to the study is the library an apartment of respectable size and containing as many books as it can hold all protected by wirework i did not observe what or whose works were here but the attendant showed us one whole compartment full of volumes having reference to ghosts witchcraft and the supernatural generally it is remarkable that scott should have felt interested in such subjects being such a worldly and earthly man as he was but then indeed almost all forms of popular superstition do clothe the ethereal with earthly attributes and so make it grossly perceptible the library like the study suited me well merely the fashion of the apartment i mean and i doubt not it contains as many curious volumes as are anywhere to be met with within a similar space the drawingroom adjoins it and here we saw a beautiful ebony cabinet which was presented to sir walter by george iv and some pictures of much interest one of scott himself at thirtyfive rather portly with a heavy face but shrewd eyes which seem to observe you closely there is a fulllength of his eldest son an officer of dragoons leaning on his charger and a portrait of lady scott a brunette with black hair and eyes very pretty warm vivacious and unenglish in her aspect i am not quite sure whether i saw all these pictures in the drawingroom or some of them in the diningroom but the one that struck me most and very much indeed was the head of mary queen of scots literally the head cut off and lying on a dish it is said to have been painted by an italian or french artist two days after her death the hair curls or flows all about it the face is of a deathlike hue but has an expression of quiet after much pain and trouble very beautiful very sweet and sad and it affected me strongly with the horror and strangeness of such a head being severed from its body methinks i should not like to have it always in the room with me i thought of the lovely picture of mary that i had seen at edinburgh castle and reflected what a symbol it would be how expressive of a human being having her destiny in her own hands if that beautiful young queen were painted as carrying this dish containing her own woful head and perhaps casting a curious and pitiful glance down upon it as if it were not her own also in the drawingroom there was a plaster cast of sir walters face taken after death the only one in existence as our guide assured us it is not often that one sees a homelier set of features than this no elevation no dignity whether bestowed by nature or thrown over them by age or death sunken cheeks the bridge of the nose depressed and the end turned up the mouth puckered and no chin whatever or hardly any the expression was not calm and happy but rather as if he were in a perturbed slumber perhaps nothing short of nightmare i wonder that the family allow this cast to be shown the last record that there is of scotts personal reality and conveying such a wretched and unworthy idea of it adjoining the drawingroom is the diningroom in one corner of which between two windows scott died it was now a quarter of a century since his death but it seemed to me that we spoke with a sort of hush in our voices as if he were still dying here or had but just departed i remember nothing else in this room the next one is the armory which is the smallest of all that we had passed through but its walls gleam with the steel blades of swords and the barrels of pistols matchlocks firelocks and all manner of deadly weapons whether european or oriental for there are many trophies here of east indian warfare i saw rob roys gun rifled and of very large bore and a beautiful pistol formerly claverhouses and the sword of montrose given him by king charles the silver hilt of which i grasped there was also a superb claymore in an elaborately wrought silver sheath made for sir walter scott and presented to him by the highland society for his services in marshalling the clans when george iv came to scotland there were a thousand other things which i knew must be most curious yet did not ask nor care about them because so many curiosities drive one crazy and fret ones heart to death on the whole there is no simple and great impression left by abbotsford and i felt angry and dissatisfied with myself for not feeling something which i did not and could not feel but it is just like going to a museum if you look into particulars and one learns from it too that scott could not have been really a wise man nor an earnest one nor one that grasped the truth of life he did but play and the play grew very sad toward its close in a certain way however i understand his romances the better for having seen his house and his house the better for having read his romances they throw light on one another we had now gone through all the showrooms and the next door admitted us again into the entrancehall where we recorded our names in the visitors book it contains more names of americans i should judge from casting my eyes back over last years record than of all other people in the world including great britain bidding farewell to abbotsford i cannot but confess a sentiment of remorse for having visited the dwellingplace as just before i visited the grave of the mighty minstrel and romancer with so cold a heart and in so critical a mood his dwellingplace and his grave whom i had so admired and loved and who had done so much for my happiness when i was young but i and the world generally now look at him from a different point of view and besides these visits to the actual haunts of famous people though long dead have the effect of making us sensible in some degree of their human imperfections as if we actually saw them alive i felt this effect to a certain extent even with respect to shakespeare when i visited stratfordonavon as for scott i still cherish him in a warm place and i do not know that i have any pleasanter anticipation as regards books than that of reading all his novels over again after we get back to the wayside this mr hawthorne did aloud to his family the year following his return to america ed it was now one or two oclock and time for us to take the rail across the borders many a mile behind us as we rushed onward we could see the threefold eildon hill and probably every pant of the engine carried us over some spot of ground which scott has made fertile with poetry for scotland cold cloudy barren little bit of earth that it is owes all the interest that the world feels in it to him few men have done so much for their country as he however having no guidebook we were none the wiser for what we saw out of the window of the railcarriage but now and then a castle appeared on a commanding height visible for miles round and seemingly in good repair now in some low and sheltered spot the gray walls of an abbey now on a little eminence the ruin of a border fortress and near it the modern residence of the laird with its trim lawn and shrubbery we were not long in coming to berwick a town which seems to belong both to england and scotland or perhaps is a kingdom by itself for it stands on both sides of the boundary river the tweed where it empties into the german ocean from the railway bridge we had a good view over the town which looks ancient with red roofs on all the gabled houses and it being a sunny afternoon though bleak and chill the seaview was very fine the tweed is here broad and looks deep flowing far beneath the bridge between high banks this is all that i can say of berwick pronounced berrick for though we spent above an hour at the station waiting for the train we were so long in getting our dinner that we had not time for anything else i remember however some gray walls that looked like the last remains of an old castle near the railway station we next took the train for newcastle the way to which for a considerable distance lies within sight of the sea and in close vicinity to the shore we saw holy isle on which are the ruins of an abbey norham castle must be somewhere in this neighborhood on the english shore of the tweed it was pretty late in the afternoon almost nightfall when we reached newcastle over the roofs of which as over those of berwick we had a view from the railway and like berwick it was a congregation of mostly red roofs but unlike berwick the atmosphere over which was clear and transparent there came a gush of smoke from every chimney which made it the dimmest and smokiest place i ever saw this is partly owing to the iron founderies and furnaces but each domestic chimney too was smoking on its own account coal being so plentiful there no doubt that the fire is always kept freshly heaped with it reason or none out of this smokecloud rose tall steeples and it was discernible that the town stretched widely over an uneven surface on the banks of the tyne which is navigable up hither ten miles from the sea for pretty large vessels we established ourselves at the station hotel and then walked out to see something of the town but i remember only a few streets of duskiness and dinginess with a glimpse of the turrets of a castle to which we could not find our way so as it was getting twilightish and very cold we went back to the hotel which is a very good one better than any one i have seen in the south of england and almost or quite as good as those of scotland the coffeeroom is a spacious and handsome apartment adorned with a fulllength portrait of wellington and other pictures and in the whole establishment there was a wellordered alacrity and liberal provision for the comfort of guests that one seldom sees in english inns there are a good many american guests in newcastle and through all the north an old newcastle gentleman and his friend came into the smokingroom and drank three glasses of hot whiskeytoddy apiece and were still going on to drink more when we left them these respectable persons probably went away drunk that night yet thought none the worse of themselves or of one another for it it is like returning to times twenty years gone by for a newenglander to witness such simplicity of manners the next morning may th i rose and breakfasted early and took the rail soon after eight oclock leaving mr bowman behind for he had business in newcastle and would not follow till some hours afterwards there is no use in trying to make a narrative of anything that one sees along an english railway all i remember of this tract of country is that one of the stations at which we stopped for an instant is called washington and this is no doubt the old family place where the de wessyngtons afterwards the washingtons were first settled in england before reaching york first one old lady and then another quaker lady got into the carriage along with me and they seemed to be going to york on occasion of some fair or celebration this was all the company i had and their advent the only incident it was about eleven oclock when i beheld york cathedral rising huge above the old city which stands on the river ouse separated by it from the railway station but communicating by a ferry or two and a bridge i wandered forth and found my way over the latter into the ancient and irregular streets of york crooked narrow or of unequal width puzzling and many of them bearing the name of the particular gate in the old walls of the city to which they lead there were no such fine ancient stately houses as some of those in shrewsbury were nor such an aspect of antiquity as in chester but still york is a quaint old place and what looks most modern is probably only something old hiding itself behind a new front as elsewhere in england i found my way by a sort of instinct as directly as possible to york minster it stands in the midst of a small open space or a space that looks small in comparison with the vast bulk of the cathedral i was not so much impressed by its exterior as i have usually been by gothic buildings because it is rectangular in its general outline and in its towers and seems to lack the complexity and mysterious plan which perplexes and wonderstrikes me in most cathedrals doubtless however if i had known better how to admire it i should have found it wholly admirable at all events it has a satisfactory hugeness seeking my way in i at first intruded upon the registry of deeds which occupies a building patched up against the mighty side of the cathedral and hardly discernible so small the one and so large the other i finally hit upon the right door and i felt no disappointment in my first glance around at the immensity of enclosed space i see now in my minds eye a dim length of nave a breadth in the transepts like a great plain and such an airy height beneath the central tower that a worshipper could certainly get a good way towards heaven without rising above it i only wish that the screen or whatever they call it between the choir and nave could be thrown down so as to give us leave to take in the whole vastitude at once i never could understand why after building a great church they choose to sunder it in halves by this midpartition but let me be thankful for what i got and especially for the height and massiveness of the clustered pillars that support the arches on which rests the central tower i remember at furness abbey i saw two tall pillars supporting a broken arch and thought it the most majestic fragment of architecture that could possibly be but these pillars have a nobler height and these arches a greater sweep what nonsense to try to write about a cathedral there is a great cold bareness and bleakness about the interior for there are very few monuments and those seem chiefly to be of ecclesiastical people i saw no armed knights asleep on the tops of their tombs but there was a curious representation of a skeleton at full length under the tableslab of one of the monuments the walls are of a grayish hue not so agreeable as the rich dark tint of the inside of westminster abbey but a great many of the windows are still filled with ancient painted glass the very small squares and pieces of which are composed into splendid designs of saints and angels and scenes from scripture there were a few watery blinks of sunshine out of doors and whenever these came through the old painted windows some of the more vivid colors were faintly thrown upon the pavement of the cathedral very faintly it is true for in the first place the sunshine was not brilliant and painted glass too fades in the course of the ages perhaps like all mans other works there were two or three windows of modern manufacture and far more magnificent as to brightness of color and material beauty than the ancient ones but yet they looked vulgar glaring and impertinent in comparison because such revivals or imitations of a longdisused art cannot have the good faith and earnestness of the originals indeed in the very coloring i felt the same difference as between hearts blood and a scarlet dye it is a pity however that the old windows cannot be washed both inside and out for now they have the dust of centuries upon them the screen or curtain between the nave and choir has eleven carved figures at full length which appeared to represent kings some of them wearing crowns and bearing sceptres or swords they were in wood and wrought by some gothic hand these carvings and the painted windows and the few monuments are all the details that the mind can catch hold of in the immensity of this cathedral and i must say that it was a dreary place on that cold cloudy day i doubt whether a cathedral is a sort of edifice suited to the english climate the first buildings of the kind were probably erected by people who had bright and constant sunshine and who desired a shadowy awfulness like that of a forest with its arched woodpaths into which to retire in their religious moments in america on a hot summers day how delightful its cool and solemn depths would be the painted windows too were evidently contrived in the first instance by persons who saw how effective they would prove when a vivid sun shone through them but in england the interior of a cathedral nine days out of ten is a vast sullenness and as chill as death and the tomb at any rate it was so today and so thought one of the old vergers who kept walking as briskly as he could along the width of the transepts there were several of these old men when i first came in but they went off all but this one before i departed none of them said a word to me nor i to them and admission to the minster seems to be entirely free after emerging from this great gloom i wandered to and fro about york and contrived to go astray within no very wide space if its history be authentic it is an exceedingly old city having been founded about a thousand years before the christian era there used to be a palace of the roman emperors here and the emperor severus died here as did some of his successors and constantine the great was born here i know not what if any relics of those earlier times there may be but york is still partly surrounded with a wall and has several gates which the city authorities take pains to keep in repair i grow weary in my endeavor to find my way back to the railway and inquired it of one of the good people of york a respectable courteous gentlemanly person and he told me to walk along the walls then he went on a considerable distance but seemed to repent of not doing more for me so he waited till i came up and walking along by my side pointed out the castle now the jail and the place of execution and directed me to the principal gateway of the city and instructed me how to reach the ferry the path along the wall leads in one place through a room over the arch of a gateway a low thickwalled stone apartment where doubtless the gatekeeper used to lodge and to parley with those who desired entrance i found my way to the ferry over the ouse according to this kind yorkists instructions the ferryman told me that the fee for crossing was a halfpenny which seemed so ridiculously small that i offered him more but this unparalleled englishman declined taking anything beyond his rightful halfpenny this seems so wonderful to me that i can hardly trust my own memory reaching the station i got some dinner and at four oclock just as i was starting came mr bowman my very agreeable and sensible travelling companion our journeying together was ended here for he was to keep on to london and i to return to liverpool so we parted and i took the rail westward across england through a very beautiful and in some degree picturesque tract of country diversified with hills through the valleys and vistas of which goes the railroad with dells diverging from it on either hand and streams and arched bridges and old villages and a hundred pleasant english sights after passing rochdale however the dreary monotony of lancashire succeeded this variety between nine and ten oclock i reached the tithebarn station in liverpool ever since until now may th i have employed my leisure moments in scribbling off the journal of my tour but it has greatly lost by not having been written daily as the scenes and occurrences were fresh the most picturesque points can be seized in no other way and the hues of the affair fade as quickly as those of a dying dolphin or as according to audubon the plumage of a dead bird one thing that struck me as much as anything else in the highlands i had forgotten to put down in our walk at balloch along the road within view of loch lomond and the neighboring hills it was a brilliant sunshiny afternoon and i never saw any atmosphere so beautiful as that among the mountains it was a clear transparent ethereal blue as distinct as a vapor and yet by no means vaporous but a pure crystalline medium i have witnessed nothing like this among the berkshire hills nor elsewhere york is full of old churches some of them very antique in appearance the stones weatherworn their edges rounded by time blackened and with all the tokens of sturdy and agelong decay and in some of them i noticed windows quite full of old painted glass a dreary kind of minute patchwork all of one dark and dusty hue when seen from the outside yet had i seen them from the interior of the church there doubtless would have been rich and varied apparitions of saints with their glories round their heads and brightwinged angels and perhaps even the almighty father himself so far as conceivable and representable by human powers it requires light from heaven to make them visible if the church were merely illuminated from the inside that is by what light a man can get from his own understanding the pictures would be invisible or wear at best but a miserable aspect liverpool may th day before yesterday i had a call at the consulate from one of the potentates of the earth a woollyhaired negro rather thin and spare between forty and fifty years of age plainly dressed at the first glimpse of whom i could readily have mistaken him for some ships steward seeking to enter a complaint of his captain however this was president roberts of liberia introduced by a note from mrs osullivan whom he has recently met in madeira i was rather favorably impressed with him for his deportment was very simple and without any of the flourish and embroidery which a negro might be likely to assume on finding himself elevated from slavery to power he is rather shy reserved at least and undemonstrative yet not harshly so in fine with manners that offer no prominent points for notice or criticism although i felt or thought i felt that his color was continually before his mind and that he walks cautiously among men as conscious that every new introduction is a new experiment he is not in the slightest degree an interesting man so far as i discovered in a very brief interview apart from his position and history his face is not striking nor so agreeable as if it were jet black but there may be miles and miles of depth in him which i know nothing of our conversation was of the most unimportant character for he had called merely to deliver the note and sat only a few minutes during which he merely responded to my observations and originated no remarks intelligence discretion tact these are probably his traits not force of character and independence the same day i took the rail from the little street station for manchester to meet bennoch who had asked me thither to dine with him i had never visited manchester before though now so long resident within twenty miles of it neither is it particularly worth visiting unless for the sake of its factories which i did not go to see it is a dingy and heavy town with very much the aspect of liverpool being like the latter built almost entirely within the present century i stopped at the albion hotel and as bennoch was out i walked forth to view the city and made only such observations as are recorded above opposite the hotel stands the infirmary a very large edifice which when erected was on the outskirts or perhaps in the rural suburbs of the town but it is now almost in its centre in the enclosed space before it stands the statue of peel and sits a statue of dr dalton the celebrated chemist who was a native of manchester returning to the hotel i sat down in the room where we were to dine and in due time bennoch made his appearance with the same glow and friendly warmth in his face that i had left burning there when we parted in london if this man has not a heart then no man ever had i like him inexpressibly for his heart and for his intellect and for his flesh and blood and if he has faults i do not know them nor care to know them nor value him the less if i did know them he went to his room to dress and in the mean time a middleaged dark man of pleasant aspect with black hair black eyebrows and bright dark eyes came in limping a little but not much he seemed not quite a man of the world a little shy in manner yet he addressed me kindly and sociably i guessed him to be mr charles swain the poet whom mr bennoch had invited to dinner soon came another guest whom mr swain introduced to me as mr editor of the manchester examiner then came bennoch who made us all regularly acquainted or took for granted that we were so and lastly appeared a mr w a merchant in manchester and a very intelligent man and the party was then complete mr swain the poet is not a man of fluent conversation he said indeed very little but gave me the impression of amiability and simplicity of character with much feeling mr wis a very sensible man he has spent two or three years in america and seems to have formed juster conclusions about us than most of his countrymen do he is the only englishman i think whom i have met who fairly acknowledges that the english do cherish doubt jealousy suspicion in short an unfriendly feeling towards the americans it is wonderful how every american whatever class of the english he mingles with is conscious of this feeling and how no englishman except this sole mr w will confess it he expressed some very good ideas too about the english and american press and the reasons why the times may fairly be taken as the exponent of british feeling towards us while the new york herald immense as its circulation is can be considered in no similar degree or kind the american exponent we sat late at table and after the other guests had retired bennoch and i had some very friendly talk and he proposed that on my wifes return we should take up our residence in his house at blackheath while mrs bennoch and himself were absent for two months on a trip to germany if his wife and mine ratify the idea we will do so the next morning we went out to see the exchange and whatever was noticeable about the town time being brief i did not visit the cathedral which i believe is a thousand years old there are many handsome shops in manchester and we went into one establishment devoted to pictures engravings and decorative art generally which is most perfect and extensive the firm if i remember is that of the messrs agnew and though originating here they have now a house in london here i saw some interesting objects purchased by them at the recent sale of the rogers collection among other things a slight pencil and watercolor sketch by raphael an unfinished affair done in a moment as this must have been seems to bring us closer to the hand that did it than the most elaborately painted picture can were i to see the transfiguration raphael would still be at the distance of centuries seeing this little sketch i had him very near me i know not why perhaps it might be fancied that he had only laid down the pencil for an instant and would take it up again in a moment more i likewise saw a copy of a handsome illustrated edition of childe harold presented by old john murray to mr rogers with an inscription on the flyleaf purporting that it was a token of gratitude from the publisher because when everybody else thought him imprudent in giving four hundred guineas for the poem mr rogers told him it would turn out the best bargain he ever made there was a new picture by millais the distinguished preraphaelite artist representing a melancholy parting between two lovers the ladys face had a great deal of sad and ominous expression but an old brick wall overrun with foliage was so exquisitely and elaborately wrought that it was hardly possible to look at the personages of the picture every separate leaf of the climbing and clustering shrubbery was painfully made out and the wall was reality itself with the weatherstains and the moss and the crumbling lime between the bricks it is not well to be so perfect in the inanimate unless the artist can likewise make man and woman as lifelike and to as great a depth too as the creator does bennoch left town for some place in yorkshire and i for liverpool i asked him to come and dine with me at the adelphi meaning to ask two or three people to meet him but he had other engagements and could not spare a day at present though he promises to come before long dining at mr rathbones one evening last week may st it was mentioned that borrow author of the bible in spain is supposed to be of gypsy descent by the mothers side hereupon mr martineau mentioned that he had been a schoolfellow of borrow and though he had never heard of his gypsy blood he thought it probable from borrows traits of character he said that borrow had once run away from school and carried with him a party of other boys meaning to lead a wandering life if an englishman were individually acquainted with all our twentyfive millions of americans and liked every one of them and believed that each man of those millions was a christian honest upright and kind he would doubt despise and hate them in the aggregate however he might love and honor the individuals captainand his wife oakum they spent all evening at mrs bs the captain is a marblehead man by birth not far from sixty years old very talkative and anecdotic in regard to his adventures funny goodhumored and full of various nautical experience oakum it is a nickname which he gives his wife is an inconceivably tall woman taller than he six feet at least and with a wellproportioned largeness in all respects but looks kind and good gentle smiling and almost any other woman might sit like a baby on her lap she does not look at all awful and belligerent like the massive english women one often sees you at once feel her to be a benevolent giantess and apprehend no harm from her she is a lady and perfectly well mannered but with a sort of naturalness and simplicity that becomes her for any the slightest affectation would be so magnified in her vast personality that it would be absolutely the height of the ridiculous this wedded pair have no children and oakum has so long accompanied her husband on his voyages that i suppose by this time she could command a ship as well as he they sat till pretty late diffusing cheerfulness all about them and then come oakum cried the captain we must hoist sail and up rose oakum to the ceiling and moved towerlike to the door looking down with a benignant smile on the poor little pygmy women about her six feet did i say why she must he seven eight nine and whatever be her size she is as good as she is big june th monday night th just as i was retiring i received a telegraphic message announcing my wifes arrival at southampton so the next day i arranged the consular business for an absence of ten days and set forth with j and reached birmingham between eight and nine evening we put up at the queens hotel a very large establishment contiguous to the railway next morning we left birmingham and made our first stage to leamington where we had to wait nearly an hour which we spent in wandering through some of the streets that had been familiar to us last year leamington is certainly a beautiful town new bright clean and as unlike as possible to the business towns of england however the sun was burning hot and i could almost have fancied myself in america from leamington we took tickets for oxford where we were obliged to make another stop of two hours and these we employed to what advantage we could driving up into town and straying hither and thither till j s weariness weighed upon me and i adjourned with him to a hotel oxford is an ugly old town of crooked and irregular streets gabled houses mostly plastered of a buff or yellow hue some new fronts and as for the buildings of the university they seem to be scattered at random without any reference to one another i passed through an old gateway of christ church and looked at its enclosed square and that is in truth pretty much all i then saw of the university of oxford from christ church we rambled along a street that led us to a bridge across the isis and we saw many rowboats lying in the river the lightest craft imaginable unless it were an indian canoe the isis is but a narrow stream and with a sluggish current i believe the students of oxford are famous for their skill in rowing to me as well as to j the hot streets were terribly oppressive so we went into the roebuck hotel where we found a cool and pleasant coffeeroom the entrance to this hotel is through an arch opening from high street and giving admission into a paved court the buildings all around being part of the establishment old edifices with pointed gables and oldfashioned projecting windows but all in fine repair and wearing a most quiet retired and comfortable aspect the court was set all round with flowers growing in pots or large pedestalled vases on one side was the coffeeroom and all the other public apartments and the other side seemed to be taken up by the sleepingchambers and parlors of the guests this arrangement of an inn i presume is very ancient and it resembles what i have seen in the hospitals free schools and other charitable establishments in the old english towns and indeed all large houses were arranged on somewhat the same principle by and by two or three young men came in in wideawake hats and loose blouselike summerish garments and from their talk i found them to be students of the university although their topics of conversation were almost entirely horses and boats one of them sat down to cold beef and a tankard of ale the other two drank a tankard of ale together and went away without paying for it rather to the waiters discontent students are very much alike all the world over and i suppose in all time but i doubt whether many of my fellows at college would have gone off without paying for their beer we reached southampton between seven and eight oclock i cannot write today june th the first day after we reached southampton was sunny and pleasant but we made little use of the fine weather except that s and i walked once along the high street and j and i took a little ramble about town in the afternoon the next day there was a high and disagreeable wind and i did not once stir out of the house the third day too i kept entirely within doors it being a storm of wind and rain the castle hotel stands within fifty yards of the waterside so that this gusty day showed itself to the utmost advantage the vessels pitching and tossing at their moorings the waves breaking white out of a tumultuous gray surface the opposite shore glooming mistily at the distance of a mile or two and on the hither side boatmen and seafaring people scudding about the pier in waterproof clothes and in the street before the hotel door a cabman or two standing drearily beside his horse but we were sunny within doors yesterday it was breezy sunny shadowy showery and we ordered a cab to take us to clifton villa to call on mrs a friend of bs who called on us the day after our arrival just as we were ready to start mrsagain called and accompanied us back to her house it is in shirley about two miles from southampton pier and is a pleasant suburban villa with a pretty ornamented lawn and shrubbery about it mrsis an instructress of young ladies and at bs suggestion she is willing to receive us for two or three weeks during the vacation until we are ready to go to london she seems to be a pleasant and sensible woman and tomorrow we shall decide whether to go there there was nothing very remarkable in this drive and indeed my stay hereabouts thus far has been very barren of sights and incidents externally interesting though the inner life has been rich southampton is a very pretty town and has not the dinginess to which i have been accustomed in many english towns the high street reminds me very much of american streets in its general effect the houses being mostly stuccoed white or light and cheerful in aspect though doubtless they are centuries old at heart the old gateway which i presume i have mentioned in describing my former visit to southampton stands across high street about in the centre of the town and is almost the only token of antiquity that presents itself to the eye june th yesterday morning june th s mrs and i took the rail for salisbury where we duly arrived without any accident or anything noticeable except the usual verdure and richness of an english summer landscape from the railway station we walked up into salisbury with the tall spire four hundred feet high of the cathedral before our eyes salisbury is an antique city but with streets more regular than i have seen in most old towns and the houses have a more picturesque aspect than those of oxford for instance where almost all are meanlooking alike though i could hardly judge of oxford on that hot weary day through one or more of the streets there runs a swift clear little stream which being close to the pavement and bordered with stone may be called i suppose a kennel though possessing the transparent purity of a rustic rivulet it is a brook in city garb we passed under the pointed arch of a gateway which stands in one of the principal streets and soon came in front of the cathedral i do not remember any cathedral with so fine a site as this rising up out of the centre of a beautiful green extensive enough to show its full proportions relieved and insulated from all other patchwork and impertinence of rusty edifices it is of gray stone and looks as perfect as when just finished and with the perfection too that could not have come in less than six centuries of venerableness with a view to which these edifices seem to have been built a new cathedral would lack the last touch to its beauty and grandeur it needs to be mellowed and ripened like some pictures although i suppose this awfulness of antiquity was supplied in the minds of the generation that built cathedrals by the sanctity which they attributed to them salisbury cathedral is far more beautiful than that of york the exterior of which was really disagreeable to my eye but this mighty spire and these multitudinous gray pinnacles and towers ascend towards heaven with a kind of natural beauty not as if man had contrived them they might be fancied to have grown up just as the spires of a tuft of grass do at the same time that they have a law of propriety and regularity among themselves the tall spire is of such admirable proportion that it does not seem gigantic and indeed the effect of the whole edifice is of beauty rather than weight and massiveness perhaps the bright balmy sunshine in which we saw it contributed to give it a tender glory and to soften a little its majesty when we went in we heard the organ the forenoon service being near conclusion if i had never seen the interior of york cathedral i should have been quite satisfied no doubt with the spaciousness of this nave and these side aisles and the height of their arches and the girth of these pillars but with that recollection in my mind they fell a little short of grandeur the interior is seen to disadvantage and in a way the builder never meant it to be seen because there is little or no painted glass nor any such mystery as it makes but only a colorless common daylight revealing everything without remorse there is a general light hue moreover like that of whitewash over the whole of the roof and walls of the interior pillars monuments and all whereas originally every pillar was polished and the ceiling was ornamented in brilliant colors and the light came manyhued through the windows on all this elaborate beauty in lieu of which there is nothing now but space between the pillars that separate the nave from the side aisles there are ancient tombs most of which have recumbent statues on them one of these is longsword earl of salisbury son of fair rosamond in chain mail and there are many other warriors and bishops and one crosslegged crusader and on one tombstone a recumbent skeleton which i have likewise seen in two or three other cathedrals the pavement of the aisles and nave is laid in great part with flat tombstones the inscriptions on which are half obliterated and on the walls especially in the transepts there are tablets among which i saw one to the poet bowles who was a canon of this cathedral the ecclesiastical dignitaries bury themselves and monument themselves to the exclusion of almost everybody else in these latter times though still as of old the warrior has his place a young officer slain in the indian wars was memorialized by a tablet and may be remembered by it six hundred years hence as we now remember the old knights and crusaders it deserves to be mentioned that i saw one or two noses still unbroken among these recumbent figures most of the antique statues on close examination proved to be almost entirely covered with names and initials scratched over the once polished surface the cathedral and its relics must have been far less carefully watched at some former period than now between the nave and the choir as usual there is a screen that half destroys the majesty of the building by abridging the spectator of the long vista which he might otherwise have of the whole interior at a glance we peeped through the barrier and saw some elaborate monuments in the chancel beyond but the doors of the screen are kept locked so that the vergers may raise a revenue by showing strangers through the richest part of the cathedral by and by one of these vergers came through the screen with a gentleman and lady whom he was taking round and we joined ourselves to the party he showed us into the cloisters which had long been neglected and ruinous until the time of bishop dennison the last prelate who has been but a few years dead this bishop has repaired and restored the cloisters in faithful adherence to the original plan and they now form a most delightful walk about a pleasant and verdant enclosure in the centre of which sleeps good bishop dennison with a wife on either side of him all three beneath broad flat stones most cloisters are darksome and grim but these have a broad paved walk beneath the vista of arches and are light airy and cheerful and from one corner you can get the best possible view of the whole height and beautiful proportion of the cathedral spire one side of this cloistered walk seems to be the length of the nave of the cathedral there is a square of four such sides and of places for meditation grave yet not too sombre it seemed to me one of the best while we stayed there a jackdaw was walking to and fro across the grassy enclosure and haunting around the good bishops grave he was clad in black and looked like a feathered ecclesiastic but i know not whether it were bishop dennisons ghost or that of some old monk on one side of the cloisters and contiguous to the main body of the cathedral stands the chapterhouse bishop dennison had it much at heart to repair this part of the holy edifice and if i mistake not did begin the work for it had been long ruinous and in cromwells time his dragoons stationed their horses there little progress however had been made in the repairs when the bishop died and it was decided to restore the building in his honor and by way of monument to him the repairs are now nearly completed and the interior of this chapterhouse gave me the first idea anywise adequate of the splendor of these gothic church edifices the roof is sustained by one great central pillar of polished marble small pillars clustered about a great central column which rises to the ceiling and there gushes out with various beauty that overflows all the walls as if the fluid idea had sprung out of that fountain and grown solid in what we see the pavement is elaborately ornamented the ceiling is to be brilliantly gilded and painted as it was of yore and the tracery and sculptures around the walls are to be faithfully renewed from what remains of the original patterns after viewing the chapterhouse the verger an elderly man of grave benign manner clad in black and talking of the cathedral and the monuments as if he loved them led us again into the nave of the cathedral and thence within the screen of the choir the screen is as poor as possible mere barren woodwork without the least attempt at beauty in the chancel there are some meagre patches of old glass and some of modern date not very well worth looking at we saw several interesting monuments in this part of the cathedral one belonging to the ducal family of somerset and erected in the reign of james i it is of marble and extremely splendid and elaborate with kneeling figures and all manner of magnificence more than i have seen in any monument except that of mary of scotland in westminster abbey the more ancient tombs are also very numerous and among them that of the bishop who founded the cathedral within the screen against the wall is erected a monument by chantrey to the earl of malmesbury a fulllength statue of the earl in a halfrecumbent position holding an open volume and looking upward a noble work a calm wise thoughtful firm and not unbenignant face beholding its expression it really was impossible not to have faith in the high character of the individual thus represented and i have seldom felt this effect from any monumental bust or statue though i presume it is always aimed at i am weary of trying to describe cathedrals it is utterly useless there is no possibility of giving the general effect or any shadow of it and it is miserable to put down a few items of tombstones and a bit of glass from a painted window as if the gloom and glory of the edifice were thus to be reproduced cathedrals are almost the only things if even those that have quite filled out my ideal here in this old world and cathedrals often make me miserable from my inadequacy to take them wholly in and above all i despise myself when i sit down to describe them we now walked around the close which is surrounded by some of the quaintest and comfortablest ecclesiastical residences that can be imagined these are the dwellinghouses of the dean and the canons and whatever other high officers compose the bishops staff and there was one large brick mansion old but not so ancient as the rest which we took to be the bishops palace i never beheld anything i must say again so cosey so indicative of domestic comfort for whole centuries together houses so fit to live in or to die in and where it would be so pleasant to lead a young wife beneath the antique portal and dwell with her till husband and wife were patriarchal as these delectable old houses they belong naturally to the cathedral and have a necessary relation to it and its sanctity is somehow thrown over them all so that they do not quite belong to this world though they look full to overflowing of whatever earthly things are good for man these are places however in which mankind makes no progress the rushing tumult of human life here subsides into a deep quiet pool with perhaps a gentle circular eddy but no onward movement the same identical thought i suppose goes round in a slow whirl from one generation to another as i have seen a withered leaf do in the vortex of a brook in the front of the cathedral there is a most stately and beautiful tree which flings its verdure upward to a very lofty height but far above it rises the tall spire dwarfing the great tree by comparison when the cathedral had sufficiently oppressed us with its beauty we returned to sublunary matters and went wandering about salisbury in search of a luncheon which we finally took in a confectioners shop then we inquired hither and thither at various liverystables for a conveyance to stonehenge and at last took a fly from the lamb hotel the drive was over a turnpike for the first seven miles over a bare ridgy country showing little to interest us we passed a party of seven or eight men in a coarse uniform dress resembling that worn by convicts and apparently under the guardianship of a stout authoritative yet rather kindlylooking man with a cane our driver said that they were lunatics from a neighboring asylum out for a walk seven miles from salisbury we turned aside from the turnpike and drove two miles across salisbury plain which is an apparently boundless extent of unenclosed land treeless and houseless it is not exactly a plain but a green sea of long and gentle swells and subsidences affording views of miles upon miles to a very far horizon we passed large flocks of sheep with the shepherds watching them but the dogs seemed to take most of the care of the flocks upon their own shoulders and would scamper to turn the sheep when they inclined to stray whither they should not and then arose a thousandfold bleating not unpleasant to the ear for it did not apparently indicate any fear or discomfort on the part of the flock the sheep and lambs are all blackfaced and have a very funny expression as we drove over the plain my seat was beside the driver i saw at a distance a cluster of large gray stones mostly standing upright and some of them slightly inclined towards each other very irregular and so far off forming no very picturesque or noteworthy spectacle of course i knew at once that this was stonehenge and also knew that the reality was going to dwindle wofully within my ideal as almost everything else does when we reached the spot we found a picnicparty just finishing their dinner on one of the overthrown stones of the druidical temple and within the sacred circle an artist was painting a wretched daub of the scene and an old shepherd the very shepherd of salisbury plain sat erect in the centre of the ruin there never was a ruder thing than stonehenge made by mortal hands it is so very rude that it seems as if nature and man had worked upon it with one consent and so it is all the stranger and more impressive from its rudeness the spectator wonders to see art and contrivance and a regular and even somewhat intricate plan beneath all the uncouth simplicity of this arrangement of rough stones and certainly whatever was the intellectual and scientific advancement of the people who built stonehenge no succeeding architects will ever have a right to triumph over them for nobodys work in after times is likely to endure till it becomes a mystery as to who built it and how and for what purpose apart from the moral considerations suggested by it stonehenge is not very well worth seeing materially it is one of the poorest of spectacles and when complete it must have been even less picturesque than now a few huge rough stones very imperfectly squared standing on end and each group of two supporting a third large stone on their tops other stones of the same pattern overthrown and tumbled one upon another and the whole comprised within a circuit of about a hundred feet diameter the short sheepcropped grass of salisbury plain growing among all these uncouth bowlders i am not sure that a misty lowering day would not have better suited stonehenge as the dreary midpoint of the great desolate trackless plain not literally trackless however for the london and exeter road passes within fifty yards of the ruins and another road intersects it after we had been there about an hour there came a horseman within the druids circle evidently a clerical personage by his white neckcloth though his loose gray riding pantaloons were not quite in keeping he looked at us rather earnestly and at last addressed mrs and announced himself as mr hinchman a clergyman whom she had been trying to find in salisbury in order to avail herself of him as a cicerone and he had now ridden hither to meet us he told us that the artist whom we found here could give us more information than anybody about stonehenge for it seems he has spent a great many years here painting and selling his poor sketches to visitors and also selling a book which his father wrote about the remains this man showed indeed a pretty accurate acquaintance with these old stones and pointed out what is thought to be the altarstone and told us of some relation between this stone and two other stones and the rising of the sun at midsummer which might indicate that stonehenge was a temple of solar worship he pointed out too to how little depth the stones were planted in the earth insomuch that i have no doubt the american frosts would overthrow stonehenge in a single winter and it is wonderful that it should have stood so long even in england i have forgotten what else he said but i bought one of his books and find it a very unsatisfactory performance being chiefly taken up with an attempt to prove these remains to be an antediluvian work constructed i think the author says under the superintendence of father adam himself before our departure we were requested to write our names in the album which the artist keeps for the purpose and he pointed out expresident fillmores autograph and those of one or two other americans who have been here within a short time it is a very curious life that this artist leads in this great solitude and haunting stonehenge like the ghost of a druid but he is a brisk little man and very communicative on his one subject mr hinchman rode with us over the plain and pointed out salisbury spire visible close to stonehenge under his guidance we returned by a different road from that which brought us thither and a much more delightful one i think i never saw such continued sylvan beauty as this road showed us passing through a good deal of woodland scenery fine old trees standing each within its own space and thus having full liberty to outspread itself and wax strong and broad for ages instead of being crowded and thus stifled and emaciated as human beings are here and foresttrees are in america hedges too and the rich rich verdure of england and villages full of picturesque old houses thatched and ivied or perhaps overrun with roses and a stately mansion in the elizabethan style and a quiet stream gliding onward without a ripple from its own motion but rippled by a large fish darting across it and over all this scene a gentle friendly sunshine not ardent enough to crisp a single leaf or blade of grass nor must the village church be forgotten with its square battlemented tower dating back to the epoch of the normans we called at a house where one of mrs s pupils was residing with her aunt a thatched house of two stories high built in what was originally a sandpit but which in the course of a good many years has been transformed into the most delightful and homelike little nook almost that can be found in england a thatched cottage suggests a very rude dwelling indeed but this had a pleasant parlor and drawingroom and chambers with latticewindows opening close beneath the thatched roof and the thatch itself gives an air to the place as if it were a birds nest or some such simple and natural habitation the occupants are an elderly clergyman retired from professional duty and his sister and having nothing else to do and sufficient means they employ themselves in beautifying this sweet little retreat planting new shrubbery laying out new walks around it and helping nature to add continually another charm and nature is certainly a more genial playfellow in england than in my own country she is always ready to lend her aid to any beautifying purpose leaving these good people who were very hospitable giving tea and offering wine we reached salisbury in time to take the train for southampton june th yesterday we left the castle hotel after paying a bill of twenty pounds for a little more than a weeks board in america we could not very well have lived so simply but we might have lived luxuriously for half the money this castle hotel was once an old roman castle the landlord says and the circular sweep of the tower is still seen towards the street although being painted white and built up with modern additions it would not be taken for an ancient structure there is a dungeon beneath it in which the landlord keeps his wine j and i quitting the hotel walked towards shinley along the waterside leaving the rest of the family to follow in a fly there are many traces along the shore of the fortifications by which southampton was formerly defended towards the water and very probably their foundations may be as ancient as roman times our hotel was no doubt connected with this chain of defences which seems to have consisted of a succession of round towers with a wall extending from one to another we saw two or three of these towers still standing and likely to stand though ivygrown and ruinous at the summit and intermixed and even amalgamated with pothouses and mean dwellings and often through an antique arch there was a narrow doorway giving access to the house of some sailor or laborer or artisan and his wife gossiping at it with her neighbor or his children playing about it after getting beyond the precincts of southampton our walk was not very interesting except to j who kept running down to the verge of the water looking for shells and seainsects june th yesterday th i left liverpool from the lime street station an exceedingly hot day for england insomuch that the rail carriages were really uncomfortable i have now passed over the london and northwestern railway so often that the northern part of it is very wearisome especially as it has few features of interest even to a new observer at stafford no at wolverhampton we diverged to a track which i have passed over only once before we stopped an hour and a quarter at wolverhampton and i walked up into the town which is large and old old at least in its plan or lack of plan the streets being irregular and straggling over an uneven surface like many of the english towns it reminds me of boston though dingier the sun was so hot that i actually sought the shady sides of the streets and this of itself is one long step towards establishing a resemblance between an english town and an american one english railway carriages seem to me more tiresome than any other and i suppose it is owing to the greater motion arising from their more elastic springs a slow train too like that which i was now in is more tiresome than a quick one at least to the spirits whatever it may be to the body we loitered along through afternoon and evening stopping at every little station and nowhere getting to the top of our speed till at last in the late dusk we reached gloucester and i put up at the wellington hotel which is but a little way from the station i took tea and a slice or two of ham in the coffeeroom and had a little talk with two people there one of whom on learning that i was an american said but i suppose you have now been in england some time he meant finding me not absolutely a savage that i must have been caught a good while ago the next morning i went into the city the hotel being on its outskirts and rambled along in search of the cathedral some churchbells were chiming and clashing for a wedding or other festal occasion and i followed the sound supposing that it might proceed from the cathedral but this was not the case it was not till i had got to a bridge over the severn quite out of the town that i saw again its tower and knew how to shape my course towards it i did not see much that was strange or interesting in gloucester it is old with a good many of those antique elizabethan houses with two or three peaked gables on a line together several old churches which always cluster about a cathedral like chickens round a hen a hospital for decayed tradesmen another for bluecoat boys a great many butchers shops scattered in all parts of the town open in front with a counter or dresser on which to display the meat just in the old fashion of shakespeares house it is a large town and has a good deal of liveliness and bustle in a provincial way in short judging by the sheep cattle and horses and the people of agricultural aspect that i saw about the streets i should think it must have been marketday i looked here and there for the old bell inn because unless i misremember fielding brings tom jones to this inn while he and partridge were travelling together it is still extant for on my arrival the night before a runner from it had asked me to go thither but i forgot its celebrity at the moment i saw nothing of it in my rambles about gloucester but at last i found the cathedral though i found no point from which a good view of the exterior can be seen it has a very beautiful and rich outside however and a lofty tower very large and ponderous but so finished off and adorned with pinnacles and all manner of architectural devices wherewith these old builders knew how to alleviate their massive structures that it seems to sit lightly in the air the porch was open and some workmen were trundling barrows into the nave so i followed and found two young women sitting just within the porch one of whom offered to show me round the cathedral there was a great dust in the nave arising from the operations of the workmen they had been laying a new pavement and scraping away the plaster which had heretofore been laid over the pillars and walls the pillars come out from the process as good as new great round massive columns not clustered like those of most cathedrals they are twentyone feet in circumference and support semicircular arches i think there are seven of these columns on each side of the nave which did not impress me as very spacious and the dust and racket of the workpeople quite destroyed the effect which should have been produced by the aisles and arches so that i hardly stopped to glance at this part though i saw some mural monuments and recumbent statues along the walls the choir is separated from the nave by the usual screen and now by a sailcloth or something of that kind drawn across in order to keep out the dust while the repairs are going on when the young woman conducted me hither i was at once struck by the magnificent eastern window the largest in england which fills or looks vast enough to fill all that end of the cathedral a most splendid window full of old painted glass which looked as bright as sunshine though the sun was not really shining through it the roof of the choir is of oak and very fine and as much as ninety feet high there are chapels opening from the choir and within them the monuments of the eminent people who built them and of benefactors or prelates or of those otherwise illustrious in their day my recollection of what i saw here is very dim and confused more so than i anticipated i remember somewhere within the choir the tomb of edward ii with his effigy upon the top of it in a long robe with a crown on his head and a ball and sceptre in his hand likewise a statue of robert son of the conqueror carved in irish oak and painted he lolls in an easy posture on his tomb with one leg crossed lightly over the other to denote that he was a crusader there are several monuments of mitred abbots who formerly presided over the cathedral a cavalier and his wife with the dress of the period elaborately represented lie side by side in excellent preservation and it is remarkable that though their noses are very prominent they have come down from the past without any wear and tear the date of the cavaliers death is and i think his statue could not have been sculptured until after the restoration else he and his dame would hardly have come through cromwells time unscathed here as in all the other churches in england cromwell is said to have stabled his horses and broken the windows and belabored the old monuments there is one large and beautiful chapel styled the ladys chapel which is indeed a church by itself being ninety feet long and comprising everything that appertains to a place of worship here too there are monuments and on the floor are many old bricks and tiles with inscriptions on them or gothic devices and flat tombstones with coats of arms sculptured on them as indeed there are everywhere else except in the nave where the new pavement has obliterated them after viewing the choir and the chapels the young woman led me down into the crypts below where the dead persons who are commemorated in the upper regions were buried the low ponderous pillars and arches of these crypts are supposed to be older than the upper portions of the building they are about as perfect i suppose as when new but very damp dreary and darksome and the arches intersect one another so intricately that if the girl had deserted me i might easily have got lost there these are chapels where masses used to be said for the souls of the deceased and my guide said that a great many skulls and bones had been dug up here no doubt a vast population has been deposited in the course of a thousand years i saw two white skulls in a niche grinning as skulls always do though it is impossible to see the joke these crypts or crypts like these are doubtless what congreve calls the aisles and monumental caves of death in that passage which dr johnson admired so much they are very singular something like a dark shadow or dismal repetition of the upper church below ground ascending from the crypts we went next to the cloisters which are in a very perfect state and form an unbroken square about the green grassplot enclosed within here also it is said cromwell stabled his horses but if so they were remarkably quiet beasts for tombstones which form the pavement are not broken nor cracked nor bear any hoofmarks all around the cloisters too the stone tracery that shuts them in like a closed curtain carefully drawn remains as it was in the days of the monks insomuch that it is not easy to get a glimpse of the green enclosure probably there used to be painted glass in the larger apertures of this stonework otherwise it is perfect these cloisters are very different from the free open and airy ones of salisbury but they are more in accordance with our notions of monkish habits and even at this day if i were a canon of gloucester i would put that dim ambulatory to a good use the library is adjacent to the cloisters and i saw some rows of folios and quartos i have nothing else to record about the cathedral though if i were to stay there a month i suppose it might then begin to be understood it is wicked to look at these solemn old churches in a hurry by the by it was not built in a hurry but in full three hundred years having been begun in and only finished in not a great many years before papistry began to go out of vogue in england from gloucester i took the rail for basingstoke before noon the first part of the journey was through an uncommonly beautiful tract of country hilly but not wild a tender and graceful picturesqueness fine single trees and clumps of trees and sometimes wide woods scattered over the landscape and filling the nooks of the hills with luxuriant foliage old villages scattered frequently along our track looking very peaceful with the peace of past ages lingering about them and a rich rural verdure of antique cultivation everywhere old countryseats specimens of the old english hall or manorhouse appeared on the hillsides with parkscenery surrounding the mansions and the gray churches rose in the midst of all the little towns the beauty of english scenery makes me desperate it is so impossible to describe it or in any way to record its impression and such a pity to leave it undescribed and moreover i always feel that i do not get from it a hundredth or a millionth part of the enjoyment that there really is in it hurrying past it thus i was really glad when we rumbled into a tunnel piercing for a long distance through a hill and emerging on the other side we found ourselves in a comparatively level and uninteresting tract of country which lasted till we reached southampton english scenery to be appreciated and to be reproduced with pen and pencil requires to be dwelt upon long and to be wrought out with the nicest touches a coarse and hasty brush is not the instrument for such work july th monday june th was a warm and beautiful day and my wife and i took a cab from southampton and drove to netley abbey about three or four miles the remains of the abbey stand in a sheltered place but within view of southampton water and it is a most picturesque and perfect ruin all ivygrown of course and with great trees where the pillars of the nave used to stand and also in the refectory and the cloister court and so much soil on the summit of the broken walls that weeds flourish abundantly there and grass too and there was a wild rosebush in full bloom as much as thirty or forty feet from the ground s and i ascended a winding stair leading up within a round tower the steps much footworn and reaching the top we came forth at the height where a gallery had formerly run round the church in the thickness of the wall the upper portions of the edifice were now chiefly thrown down but i followed a footpath on the top of the remaining wall quite to the western entrance of the church since the time when the abbey was taken from the monks it has been private property and the possessor in henry viiis days or subsequently built a residence for himself within its precincts out of the old materials this has now entirely disappeared all but some unsightly old masonry patched into the original walls large portions of the ruin have been removed likewise to be used as buildingmaterials elsewhere and this is the abbey mentioned i think by dr watts concerning which a mr william taylor had a dream while he was contemplating pulling it down he dreamed that a part of it fell upon his head and sure enough a piece of the wall did come down and crush him in the nave i saw a large mass of conglomerated stone that had fallen from the wall between the nave and cloisters and thought that perhaps this was the very mass that killed poor mr taylor the ruins are extensive and very interesting but i have put off describing them too long and cannot make a distinct picture of them now moreover except to a spectator skilled in architecture all ruined abbeys are pretty much alike as we came away we noticed some women making baskets at the entrance and one of them urged us to buy some of her handiwork for that she was the gypsy of netley abbey and had lived among the ruins these thirty years so i bought one for a shilling she was a woman with a prominent nose and weathertanned but not very picturesque or striking to blackheath on the th july we left the villa with our enormous luggage and took our departure from southampton by the noon train the main street of southampton though it looks pretty fresh and bright must be really antique there being a great many projecting windows in the oldtime style and these make the vista of the street very picturesque i have no doubt that i missed seeing many things more interesting than the few that i saw our journey to london was without any remarkable incident and at the waterloo station we found one of mr bennochs clerks under whose guidance we took two cabs for the east kent station at london bridge and there railed to blackheath where we arrived in the afternoon on thursday i went into london by one of the morning trains and wandered about all day visiting the exhibition of the royal academy and westminster abbey and st pauls the two latter of which i have already written about in former journals on friday s j and i walked over the heath and through the park to greenwich and spent some hours in the hospital the painted hall struck me much more than at my first view of it it is very beautiful indeed and the effect of its frescoed ceiling most rich and magnificent the assemblage of glowing hues producing a general result of splendor in the evening i went with mr and mrsto a conversazione at mrs newton croslands who lives on blackheath i met with one person who interested me mr bailey the author of festus and i was surprised to find myself already acquainted with him it is the same mr bailey whom i met a few months ago when i first dined at mr s a dark handsome rather picturesquelooking man with a gray beard and dark hair a little dimmed with gray he is of quiet and very agreeable deportment and i liked him and believed in him there is sadness glooming out of him but no unkindness nor asperity mrs croslands conversazione was enriched with a supper and terminated with a dance in which mrjoined with heart and soul but mrswent to sleep in her chair and i would gladly have followed her example if i could have found a chair to sit upon in the course of the evening i had some talk with a pale nervous young lady who has been a noted spiritual medium yesterday i went into town by the steamboat from greenwich to london bridge with a nephew of mr s and calling at his place of business he procured us an order from his winemerchants by means of which we were admitted into the winevaults of the london docks we there found parties with an acquaintance who was going with two french gentlemen into the vaults it is a good deal like going down into a mine each visitor being provided with a lamp at the end of a stick and following the guide along dismal passages running beneath the streets and extending away interminably roughly arched overhead with stone from which depend festoons of a sort of black fungus caused by the exhalations of the wine nothing was ever uglier than this fungus it is strange that the most ethereal effervescence of rich wine can produce nothing better the first series of vaults which we entered were filled with portwine and occupied a space variously estimated at from eleven to sixteen acres which i suppose would hold more portwine than ever was made at any rate the pipes and butts were so thickly piled that in some places we could hardly squeeze past them we drank from two or three vintages but i was not impressed with any especial excellence in the wine we were not the only visitors for far in the depths of the vault we passed a gentleman and two young ladies wandering about like the ghosts of defunct winebibhers in a tophet specially prepared for then people employed here sometimes go astray and their lamps being extinguished they remain long in this everlasting gloom we went likewise to the vaults of sherrywine which have the same characteristics as those just described but are less extensive it is no guaranty for the excellence or even for the purity of the wine that it is kept in these cellars under the lock and key of the government for the merchants are allowed to mix different vintages according to their own pleasure and to adulterate it as they like very little of the wine probably comes out as it goes in or is exactly what it pretends to be i went back to mr s office and we drove together to make some calls jointly and separately i went alone to mrs heywoods afterwards with mrto the american ministers whom we found at home and i requested of him on the part of the americans at liverpool to tell me the facts about the american gentleman being refused admittance to the levee the ambassador did not seem to me to make his point good for having withdrawn with the rejected guest july th our weddingday we were invited yesterday evening to mrs s c halls where jenny lind was to sing so we left blackheath at about eight oclock in a brougham and reached ashley place as the dusk was gathering after nine the halls reside in a handsome suite of apartments arranged on the new system of flats each story constituting a separate tenement and the various families having an entrancehall in common the plan is borrowed from the continent and seems rather alien to the traditionary habits of the english though no doubt a good degree of seclusion is compatible with it mr hall received us with the greatest cordiality before we entered the drawingroom mrs hall too greeted us with most kindly warmth jenny lind had not yet arrived but i found dr mackay there and i was introduced to miss catherine sinclair who is a literary lady though none of her works happen to be known to me soon the servant announced madam goldschmidt and this famous lady made her appearance looking quite different from what i expected mrs hall established her in the inner drawingroom where was a piano and a harp and shortly after our hostess came to me and said that madam goldschmidt wished to be introduced to me there was a gentle peremptoriness in the summons that made it something like being commanded into the presence of a princess a great favor no doubt but yet a little humbling to the recipient however i acquiesced with due gratitude and was presented accordingly she made room for me on the sofa and i sat down and began to talk jenny lind is rather tall quite tall for a woman certainly no beauty but with sense and selfreliance in her aspect and manners she was suffering under a severe cold and seemed worn down besides so probably i saw her under disadvantages her conversation is quite simple and i should have great faith in her sincerity and there is about her the manner of a person who knows the world and has conquered it she said something or other about the scarlet letter and on my part i paid her such compliments as a man could pay who had never heard her sing her conversational voice is an agreeable one rather deep and not particularly smooth she talked about america and of our unwholesome modes of life as to eating and exercise and of the illhealth especially of our women but i opposed this view as far as i could with any truth insinuating my opinion that we are about as healthy as other people and affirming for a certainty that we live longer in good faith so far as i have any knowledge of the matter the women of england are as generally out of health as those of america always something has gone wrong with them and as for jenny lind she looks wan and worn enough to be an american herself this charge of illhealth is almost universally brought forward against us nowadays and taking the whole country together i do not believe the statistics will bear it out the rooms which were respectably filled when we arrived were now getting quite full i saw mr stevens the american man of libraries and had some talk with him and durham the sculptor and mr and mrs hall introduced me to various people some of whom were of note for instance sir emerson tennent a man of the world of some parliamentary distinction wearing a star mr samuel lover a most goodnatured pleasant irishman with a shining and twinkling visage miss jewsbury whom i found very conversable she is known in literature but not to me we talked about emerson whom she seems to have been well acquainted with while he was in england and she mentioned that miss martineau had given him a lock of hair it was not her own hair but a mummys after our return mrstold us that miss jewsbury had written among other things three histories and as she asked me to introduce her to s and means to cultivate our acquaintance it would be well to know something of them we were told that she is now employed in some literary undertaking of lady morgans who at the age of ninety is still circulating in society and is as brisk in faculties as ever i should like to see her ladyship that is i should not be sorry to see her for distinguished people are so much on a par with others socially that it would be foolish to be overjoyed at seeing anybody whomsoever leaving out the illustrious jenny lind i suspect that i was myself the greatest lion of the evening for a good many persons sought the felicity of knowing me and had little or nothing to say when that honor and happiness was conferred on them it is surely very wrong and illmannered in people to ask for an introduction unless they are prepared to make talk it throws too great an expense and trouble on the wretched lion who is compelled on the spur of the moment to convert a conversable substance out of thin air perhaps for the twentieth time that evening i am sure i did not say and i think i did not hear said one rememberable word in the course of this visit though nevertheless it was a rather agreeable one in due season ices and jellies were handed about and some ladies and gentlemen professional perhaps were kind enough to sing songs and play on the piano and harp while persons in remote corners went on with whatever conversation they had in hand then came supper but there were so many people to go into the supperroom that we could not all crowd thither together and coming late i got nothing but some spongecake and a glass of champagne neither of which i care for after supper mr lover sang some irish songs his own in music and words with rich humorous effect to which the comicality of his face contributed almost as much as his voice and words the lord mayor looked in for a little while and though a hardfeatured jew enough was the most picturesque person there july th mrs heywood had invited me to dinner last evening her house is very finely situated overlooking hyde park and not a great way from where tyburn tree used to stand when i arrived there were no guests but mr and mrs d but by and by came mr monckton milnes and lady the bishop of lichfield mr tom taylor mr ewart m p sir somebody somerville mr and mrs musgrave and others mr milnes whom i had not seen for more than a year greeted me very cordially and so did mr taylor i took mrs musgrave in to dinner she is an irish lady and mrs heywood had recommended her to me as being very conversable but i had a good deal more talk with mrs m with whom i was already acquainted than with her mrs mis of noble blood and therefore not snobbish quite unaffected gentle sweet and easy to get on with reminding me of the bestmannered american women but how can anything characteristic be said or done among a dozen people sitting at table in full dress speaking of full dress the bishop wore smallclothes and silk stockings and entered the drawingroom with a threecornered hat which he kept flattened out under his arm he asked the briefest blessing possible and sitting at the ultra end of the table i heard nothing further from him till he officiated as briefly before the cloth was withdrawn mrs mtalked about tennyson with whom her husband was at the university and whom he continues to know intimately she says that he considers maud his best poem he now lives in the isle of wight spending all the year round there and has recently bought the place on which he resides she was of opinion that he would have been gratified by my calling on him which i had wished to do while we were at southampton but this is a liberty which i should hardly venture upon with a shy man like tennyson more especially as he might perhaps suspect me of doing it on the score of my own literary character but i should like much to see him mr tom taylor during dinner made some fun for the benefit of the ladies on either side of him i liked him very well this evening when the ladies had not long withdrawn and after the wine had once gone round i asked mr heywood to make my apologies to mrs heywood and took leave all london lying betwixt me and the london bridge station where i was to take the rail homeward at the station i found mr bennoch who had been dining with the lord mayor to meet sir william williams and we railed to greenwich and reached home by midnight mr and mrs bennoch have set out on their continental journey today leaving us for a little space in possession of what will be more like a home than anything that we shall hereafter find in england this afternoon i had taken up the fourth volume of jerdans autobiography wretched twaddle though it records such constant and apparently intimate intercourse with distinguished people and was reading it between asleep and awake on the sofa when mr jerdan himself was announced i saw him in company with mr bennoch nearly three years ago at rock park and wondered then what there was in so uncouth an individual to get him so freely into polished society he now looks rougher than ever timeworn but not reverend a thatch of gray hair on his head an imperfect set of false teeth a careless apparel checked trousers and a stick for he had walked a mile or two from his own dwelling i suspect and long practice at the consulate has made me keensighted that mr jerdan contemplated some benefit from my purse and to the extent of a sovereign or so i would not mind contributing to his comfort he spoke of a secret purpose of mrand himself to obtain me a degree or diploma in some literary institution what one i know not and did not ask but the honor cannot be a high one if this poor old fellow can do aught towards it i am afraid he is a very disreputable senior but certainly not the less to be pitied on that account and there was something very touching in his stiff and infirm movement as he resumed his stick and took leave waving me a courteous farewell and turning upon me a smile grim with age as he went down the steps in that gesture and smile i fancied some trace of the polished man of society such as he may have once been though time and hard weather have roughened him as they have the once polished marble pillars which i saw so rude in aspect at netley abbey speaking of dickens last evening mrmentioned his domestic tastes how he preferred home enjoyments to all others and did not willingly go much into society mrs too the other day told us of his taking on himself all possible trouble as regards his domestic affairs there is a great variety of testimony various and varied as to the character of dickens i must see him before i finally leave england july th on friday morning th at nine oclock i took the rail into town to breakfast with mr milnes as he had named a little after ten as the hour i could not immediately proceed to his house and so walked moderately over london bridge and into the city meaning to take a cab from charing cross or thereabouts passing through some street or other contiguous to cheapside i saw in a courtyard the entrance to the guildhall and stepped in to look at it it is a spacious hall about one hundred and fifty feet long and perhaps half as broad paved with flagstones which look worn and some of them cracked across the roof is very lofty and was once vaulted but has been shaped anew in modern times there is a vast window partly filled with painted glass extending quite along each end of the hall and a row of arched windows on either side throwing their light from far above downward upon the pavement this fashion of high windows not reaching within twenty or thirty feet of the floor serves to give great effect to the large enclosed space of an antique hall against the walls are several marble monuments one to the earl of chatham a statue of white marble with various allegorical contrivances fronting an obelisk or pyramid of dark marble and another to his son william pitt of somewhat similar design and of equal size each of them occupying the whole space i believe between pavement and ceiling there is likewise a statue of beckford a famous lord mayor the most famous except whittington and that one who killed wat tyler and like those two his fame is perhaps somewhat mythological though he lived and bustled within less than a century he is said to have made a bold speech to the king but this i will not believe of any englishman at least of any plebeian englishman until i hear it but there stands his statue in the guildhall in the act of making his speech as if the monstrous attempt had petrified him lord nelson too has a monument and so i think has some other modern worthy at one end of the hall under one of the great painted windows stand three or four old statues of mediaeval kings whose identities i forget and in the two corners of the opposite end are two gigantic absurdities of painted wood with grotesque visages whom i quickly recognized as gog and magog they stand each on a pillar and seem to be about fifteen feet high and look like enormous playthings for the children of giants and it is strange to see them in this solemn old hall among the memorials of dead heroes and statesmen there is an annual banquet in the guildhall given by the lord mayor and sheriffs and i believe it is the very acme of civic feasting after viewing the hall as it still lacked something of ten i continued my walk through that entanglement of city streets and quickly found myself getting beyond my reckoning i cannot tell whither i went but i passed through a very dirty region and i remember a long narrow evilodored street cluttered up with stalls in which were vegetables and little bits of meat for sale and there was a frowzy multitude of buyers and sellers still i blundered on and was getting out of the density of the city into broader streets but still shabby ones when looking at my watch i found it to be past ten and no cabstand within sight it was a quarter past when i finally got into one and the driver told me that it would take half an hour to go from thence to upper brook street so that i was likely to exceed the license implied in mr milness invitation whether i was quite beyond rule i cannot say but it did not lack more than ten minutes of eleven when i was ushered up stairs and i found all the company assembled however it is of little consequence except that if i had come early i should have been introduced to many of the guests whom now i could only know across the table mrs milnes greeted me very kindly and mr milnes came towards me with an elderly gentleman in a blue coat and gray pantaloons with a long rather thin homely visage exceedingly shaggy eyebrows though no great weight of brow and thin gray hair and introduced me to the marquis of lansdowne the marquis had his right hand wrapped up in a blacksilk handkerchief so he gave me his left and from some awkwardness in meeting it when i expected the right i gave him only three of my fingers a thing i never did before to any person and it is droll that i should have done it to a marquis he addressed me with great simplicity and natural kindness complimenting me on my works and speaking about the society of liverpool in former days lord lansdowne was the friend of moore and has about him the aroma communicated by the memories of many illustrious people with whom he has associated mr ticknor the historian of spanish literature now greeted me mr milnes introduced me to mrs browning and assigned her to me to conduct into the breakfastroom she is a small delicate woman with ringlets of dark hair a pleasant intelligent and sensitive face and a low agreeable voice she looks youthful and comely and is very gentle and ladylike and so we proceeded to the breakfastroom which is hung round with pictures and in the middle of it stood a large round table worthy to have been king arthurs and here we seated ourselves without any question of precedence or ceremony on one side of me was an elderly lady with a very fine countenance and in the course of breakfast i discovered her to be the mother of florence nightingale one of her daughters not florence was likewise present mrs milnes mrs browning mrs nightingale and her daughter were the only ladies at table and i think there were as many as eight or ten gentlemen whose names as i came so late i was left to find out for myself or to leave unknown it was a pleasant and sociable meal and thanks to my cold beef and coffee at home i had no occasion to trouble myself much about the fare so i just ate some delicate chicken and a very small cutlet and a slice of dry toast and thereupon surceased from my labors mrs browning and i talked a good deal during breakfast for she is of that quickly appreciative and responsive order of women with whom i can talk more freely than with any man and she has besides her own originality wherewith to help on conversation though i should say not of a loquacious tendency she introduced the subject of spiritualism which she says interests her very much indeed she seems to be a believer mr browning she told me utterly rejects the subject and will not believe even in the outward manifestations of which there is such overwhelming evidence we also talked of miss bacon and i developed something of that ladys theory respecting shakespeare greatly to the horror of mrs browning and that of her next neighbor a nobleman whose name i did not hear on the whole i like her the better for loving the man shakespeare with a personal love we talked too of margaret fuller who spent her last night in italy with the brownings and of william story with whom they have been intimate and who mrs browning says is much stirred about spiritualism really i cannot help wondering that so fine a spirit as hers should not reject the matter till at least it is forced upon her i like her very much mrs nightingale had been talking at first with lord lansdowne who sat next her but by and by she turned to nee and began to speak of london smoke then there being a discussion about lord byron on the other side of the table she spoke to me about lady byron whom she knows intimately characterizing her as a most excellent and exemplary person highprincipled unselfish and now devoting herself to the care of her two grandchildren their mother byrons daughter being dead lady byron she says writes beautiful verses somehow or other all this praise and more of the same kind gave me an idea of an intolerably irreproachable person and i asked mrs nightingale if lady byron were warmhearted with some hesitation or mental reservation at all events not quite outspokenly she answered that she was i was too much engaged with these personal talks to attend much to what was going on elsewhere but all through breakfast i had been more and more impressed by the aspect of one of the guests sitting next to milnes he was a man of large presence a portly personage grayhaired but scarcely as yet aged and his face had a remarkable intelligence not vivid nor sparkling but conjoined with great quietude and if it gleamed or brightened at one time more than another it was like the sheen over a broad surface of sea there was a somewhat careless selfpossession large and broad enough to be called dignity and the more i looked at him the more i knew that he was a distinguished person and wondered who he might have been a minister of state only there is not one of them who has any right to such a face and presence at last i do not know how the conviction came but i became aware that it was macaulay and began to see some slight resemblance to his portraits but i have never seen any that is not wretchedly unworthy of the original as soon as i knew him i began to listen to his conversation but he did not talk a great deal contrary to his usual custom for i am told he is apt to engross all the talk to himself probably he may have been restrained by the presence of ticknor and mr palfrey who were among his auditors and interlocutors and as the conversation seemed to turn much on american subjects he could not well have assumed to talk them down i am glad to have seen him a face fit for a scholar a man of the world a cultivated intelligence after we left the table and went into the library mr browning introduced himself to me a younger man than i expected to see handsome with brown hair he is very simple and agreeable in manner gently impulsive talking as if his heart were uppermost he spoke of his pleasure in meeting me and his appreciation of my books and which has not often happened to me mentioned that the blithedale romance was the one he admired most i wonder why i hope i showed as much pleasure at his praise as he did at mine for i was glad to see how pleasantly it moved him after this i talked with ticknor and miles and with mr palfrey to whom i had been introduced very long ago by george hillard and had never seen him since we looked at some autographs of which mr milnes has two or three large volumes i recollect a leaf from swifts journal to stella a letter from addison one from chatterton in a most neat and legible hand and a characteristic sentence or two and signature of oliver cromwell written in a religious book there were many curious volumes in the library but i had not time to look at them i liked greatly the manners of almost all yes as far as i observed all the people at this breakfast and it was doubtless owing to their being all people either of high rank or remarkable intellect or both an englishman can hardly be a gentleman unless he enjoy one or other of these advantages and perhaps the surest way to give him good manners is to make a lord of him or rather of his grandfather or greatgrandfather in the third generation scarcely sooner he will be polished into simplicity and elegance and his deportment will be all the better for the homely material out of which it is wrought and refined the marquis of lansdowne for instance would have been a very commonplace man in the common ranks of life but it has done him good to be a nobleman not that his tact is quite perfect in going up to breakfast he made me precede him in returning to the library he did the same although i drew back till he impelled me up the first stair with gentle persistence by insisting upon it he showed his sense of condescension much more than if when he saw me unwilling to take precedence he had passed forward as if the point were not worth either asserting or yielding heaven knows it was in no humility that i would have trodden behind him but he is a kind old man and i am willing to believe of the english aristocracy generally that they are kind and of beautiful deportment for certainly there never can have been mortals in a position more advantageous for becoming so i hope there will come a time when we shall be so and i already know a few americans whose noble and delicate manners may compare well with any i have seen i left the house with mr palfrey he has cone to england to make some researches in the state paper office for the purposes of a work which he has in hand he mentioned to me a letter which he had seen written from new england in the time of charles ii and referring to the order sent by the minister of that day for the appearance of governor bellingham and my ancestor on this side of the water the signature of this letter is an anagram of my ancestors name the letter itself is a very bold and able one controverting the propriety of the measure above indicated and mr palfrey feels certain that it was written by my aforesaid ancestor i mentioned my wish to ascertain the place in england whence the family emigrated and mr palfrey took me to the record office and introduced me to mr joseph hunter a venerable and courteous gentleman of antiquarian pursuits the office was odorous of musty parchments hundreds of years old mr hunter received me with great kindness and gave me various old records and rolls of parchment in which to seek for my family name but i was perplexed with the crabbed characters and soon grew weary and gave up the quest he says that it is very seldom that an american family springing from the early settlers can be satisfactorily traced back to their english ancestry july th monday morning i took the rail from blackheath to london it is a very pleasant place blackheath and far more rural than one would expect within five or six miles of london a great many trees making quite a mass of foliage in the distance green enclosures pretty villas with their nicely kept lawns and gardens with grassplots and flower borders and village streets set along the sidewalks with ornamental trees and the houses standing a little back and separated one from another all this within what is called the park which has its gateways and the sort of semiprivacy with which i first became acquainted at rock park from the london bridge station i took a cab for paddington and then had to wait above two hours before a train started for birkenhead meanwhile i walked a little about the neighborhood which is very dull and uninteresting made up of crescents and terraces and rows of houses that have no individuality and secondrate shops in short the outskirts of the vast city when it begins to have a kind of village character but no rurality or sylvan aspect as at blackheath my journey when at last we started was quite unmarked by incident and extremely tedious it being a slow train which plods on without haste and without rest at about ten oclock we reached birkenhead and there crossed the familiar and detestable mersey which as usual had a cloudy sky brooding over it mrs blodgett received me most hospitably but was impelled by an overflow of guests to put me into a little back room looking into the court and formerly occupied by my predecessor general armstrong she expressed a hope that i might not see his ghost nor have i as yet speaking of ghosts mr h a btold me a singular story today of an apparition that haunts the times office in printinghouse square a mr wis the engineer of the establishment and has his residence in the edifice which is built i believe on the site of merchant taylors school an old house that was no longer occupied for its original purpose and being supposed haunted was left untenanted the fatherinlaw of mr w an old seacaptain came on a visit to him and his wife and was put into their guestchamber where he passed the night the next morning assigning no very satisfactory reason he cut his visit short and went away shortly afterwards a young lady came to visit the ws but she too went away the next morning going first to make a call as she said to a friend and sending thence for her trunks mrs wwrote to this young lady asking an explanation the young lady replied and gave a singular account of an apparition how she was awakened in the night by a bright light shining through the window which was parallel to the bed then if i remember rightly her curtains were withdrawn and a shape looked in upon her a womans shape she called it but it was a skeleton with lambent flames playing about its bones and in and out among the ribs other persons have since slept in this chamber and some have seen the shape others not mr whas slept there himself without seeing anything he has had investigations by scientific people apparently under the idea that the phenomenon might have been caused by some of the timess workpeople playing tricks on the magiclantern principle but nothing satisfactory has thus far been elucidated mr bhad this story from mrs gaskell supposing it a ghost nothing else is so remarkable as its choosing to haunt the precincts of the times newspaper july th on saturday th i took the rail from the lime street station for london via the trent valley and reached blackheath in the evening sunday morning my wife and i with j railed into london and drove to the essex street chapel where mr channing was to preach the chapel is the same where priestley and belsham used to preach one of the plainest houses of worship i was ever in as simple and undecorated as the faith there inculcated they retain however all the form and ceremonial of the english established church though so modified as to meet the doctrinal views of the unitarians there may be good sense in this inasmuch as it greatly lessens the ministerial labor to have a stated form of prayer instead of a necessity for extempore outpourings but it must be i should think excessively tedious to the congregation especially as having made alterations in these prayers they cannot attach much idea of sanctity to them here follows a long record of mr hawthornes visit to miss bacon condensed in our old hone in the paper called recollections of a gifted woman august d on wednesday th july we went to marlborough house to see the vernon gallery of pictures they are the works almost entirely of english artists of the last and present century and comprise many famous paintings and i must acknowledge that i had more enjoyment of them than of those portions of the national gallery which i had before seen including specimens of the grand old masters my comprehension has not reached their height i think nothing pleased me more than a picture by sir david wilkie the parish beadle with a vagrant boy and a monkey in custody it is exceedingly good and true throughout and especially the monkeys face is a wonderful production of genius condensing within itself the whole moral and pathos of the picture marlborough house was the residence of the great duke and is to be that of the prince of wales when another place is found for the pictures it adjoins st jamess palace in its present state it is not a very splendid mansion the rooms being small though handsomely shaped with vaulted ceilings and carved whitemarble fireplaces i left s here after an hour or two and walked forth into the hot and busy city with j i called at routledges bookshop in hopes to make an arrangement with him about miss bacons business but routledge himself is making a journey in the north and neither of the partners was there so that i shall have to go thither some other day then we stepped into st pauls cathedral to cool ourselves and it was delightful so to escape from the sunny sultry turmoil of fleet street and ludgate and find ourselves at once in this remote solemn shadowy seclusion marblecool o that we had cathedrals in america were it only for the sensuous luxury we strolled round the cathedral and i delighted j much by pointing out the monuments of three british generals who were slain in america in the last war the naughty and bloodthirsty little man we then went to guildhall where i thought j would like to see gog and magog but he had never heard of those illustrious personages and took no interest in them but truly i am grateful to the piety of former times for raising this vast cool canopy of marble st pauls in the midst of the feverish city i wandered quite round it and saw in a remote corner a monument to the officers of the coldstream guards slain in the crimea it was a mural tablet with the names of the officers on an escutcheon and two privates of the guards in marble basrelief were mourning over them over the tablet hung two silken banners new and glossy with the battles in which the regiment has been engaged inscribed on them not merely crimean but peninsular battles these banners will bang there till they drop away in tatters after thus refreshing myself in the cathedral i went again to routledges in farrington street and saw one of the firm he expressed great pleasure at seeing me as indeed he might having published and sold without any profit on my part uncounted thousands of my books i introduced the subject of miss bacons work and he expressed the utmost willingness to do everything in his power towards bringing it before the world but thought that his firm it being their business to publish for the largest circle of readers was not the most eligible for the publication of such a book very likely this may be so at all events however i am to send him the manuscript and he will at least give me his advice and assistance in finding a publisher he was good enough to express great regret that i had no work of my own to give him for publication and truly i regret it too since being a resident in england i could now have all the publishing privileges of a native author he presented me with a copy of an illustrated edition of longfellows poems and i took my leave thence i went to the picture gallery at the british institution where there are three rooms full of paintings by the first masters the property of private persons every one of them no doubt was worth studying for a long long time and i suppose i may have given on an average a minute to each what an absurdity it would seem to pretend to read two or three hundred poems of all degrees between an epic and a ballad in an hour or two and a picture is a poem only requiring the greater study to be felt and comprehended because the spectator must necessarily do much for himself towards that end i saw many beautiful things among them some landscapes by claude which to the eye were like the flavor of a rich ripe melon to the palate august th yesterday we took the rail for london it being a fine sunny day though not so very warm as many of the preceding days have been we went along piccadilly as far as the egyptian hall it is quite remarkable how comparatively quiet the town has become now that the season is over one can see the difference in all the region west of temple bar and indeed either the hot weather or some other cause seems to have operated in assuaging the turmoil in the city itself i never saw london bridge so little thronged as yesterday at the egyptian hall or in the same edifice there is a gallery of pictures the property of lord ward who allows the public to see them five days of the week without any trouble or restriction a great kindness on his lordships part it must be owned it is a very valuable collection i presume containing specimens of many famous old masters some of the early and hard pictures by raphael and his master and fellowpupils very curious and nowise beautiful a perfect sunny glimpse of venice by canaletto and saints and scriptural allegorical and mythological people by titian guido correggio and many more names than i can remember there is likewise a dead magdalen by canova and a venus by the same very pretty and with a vivid light of joyous expression in her face also powerss greek slave in which i see little beauty or merit and two or three other statues we then drove to ashley place to call on mrs s c hall whom we found at home in fact wednesday is her receptionday although as now everybody is out of town we were the only callers she is an agreeable and kindly woman she told us that her husband and herself propose going to america next year and i heartily wish they may meet with a warm and friendly reception i have been seldom more assured of the existence of a heart than in her also a good deal of sentiment she had been visiting bessie the widow of moore at sloperton and gave s a rose from his cottage such things are very true and unaffected in her the only wonder is that she has not lost such girlish freshness of feeling as prompts them we did not see mr hall he having gone to the crystal palace taking our leave we returned along victoria street a new street penetrating through what was recently one of the worst parts of the town and now bordered with large blocks of buildings in a dreary halffinished state and left so for want of funds till we came to westminster abbey we went in and spent an hour there wandering all round the nave and aisles admiring the grand old edifice itself but finding more to smile at than to admire in the monuments the interior view of the abbey is better than can be described the heart aches as one gazes at it for lack of power and breadth enough to take its beauty and grandeur in the effect was heightened by the sun shining through the painted window in the western end and by the bright sunshine that came through the open portal and lay on the pavement that space so bright the rest of the vast floor so solemn and sombre at the western end in a corner from which spectators are barred out there is a statue of wordsworth which i do not recollect seeing at any former visit its only companion in the same nook is popes friend secretary craggs downing street that famous official precinct took its name from sir george downing who was proprietor or lessee of property there he was a native of my own old native town and his descendants still reside there collateral descendants i suppose and follow the drygoods business drapers august th i journeyed to liverpool via chester one sees a variety of climate temperature and season in a ride of two hundred miles north and south through england near london for instance the grain was reaped and stood in sheaves in the stubblefields over which girls and children might be seen gleaning farther north the golden or greenishgolden crops were waving in the wind in one part of our way the atmosphere was hot and dry at another point it had been cooled and refreshed by a heavy thundershower the pools of which still lay along our track it seems to me that local varieties of weather are more common in this island and within narrower precincts than in america i never saw england of such a dusky and dusty green before almost sunbrowned indeed sometimes the green hedges formed a marked framework to a broad sheet of golden grainfield as we drew near oxford just before reaching the station i had a good view of its domes towers and spires better i think than when j and i rambled through the town a month or two ago mr frank scott haydon of the record office london writes me that he has found a henry atte hawthorne on a roll which he is transcribing of the first edward iii he belonged to the parish of aldremeston in the hundred of blakenhurste worcester county august st yesterday at twelve oclock i took the steamer for runcorn from the pierhead in the streets i had noticed that it was a breezy day but on the river there was a very stiff breeze from the northeast right ahead blowing directly in our face the whole way and truly this river mersey is never without a breeze and generally in the direction of its course an eviltempered unkindly blustering wind that you cannot meet without being exasperated by it as it came straight against us it was impossible to find a shelter anywhere on deck except it were behind the stovepipe and besides the day was overcast and threatening rain i have undergone very miserable hours on the mersey where in the space of two years i voyaged thousands of miles and this trip to runcorn reminded me of them though it was less disagreeable after more than a twelvemonths respite we had a good many passengers on board most of whom were of the second class and congregated on the forward deck more women than men i think and some of them with their husbands and children several produced lunch and bottles and refreshed themselves very soon after we started by and by the wind became so disagreeable that i went below and sat in the cabin only occasionally looking out to get a peep at the shores of the river which i had never before seen above eastham however they are not worth looking at level and monotonous without trees or beauty of any kind here and there a village and a modern church on the low ridge behind perhaps a windmill which the gusty day had set busily to work the river continues very wide no river indeed but an estuary during almost the whole distance to runcorn and nearly at the end of our voyage we approached some abrupt and prominent hills which many a time i have seen on my passages to rock ferry looking blue and dim and serving for prophets of the weather for when they can be distinctly seen adown the river it is a token of coming rain we met many vessels and passed many which were beating up against the wind and which keeled over so that their decks must have dipped schooners and vessels that come from the bridgewater canal we shipped a sea ourselves which gave the foredeck passengers a wetting before reaching runcorn we stopped to land some passengers at another little port where there was a pier and a lighthouse and a church within a few yards of the riverside a good many of the rivercraft too in dock forming quite a crowd of masts about ten minutes further steaming brought us to runcorn where were two or three tall manufacturing chimneys with a pennant of black smoke from each two vessels of considerable size on the stocks a church or two and a meagre uninteresting shabby brickbuilt town rising from the edge of the river with irregular streets not villagelike but paved and looking like a dwarfed stunted city i wandered through it till i came to a tall highpedestalled windmill on the outer verge the vans of which were going briskly round thence retracing my steps i stopped at a poor hotel and took lunch and finding that i was in time to take the steamer back i hurried on board and we set sail or steam before three i have heard of an old castle at runcorn but could discover nothing of it it was well that i returned so promptly for we had hardly left the pier before it began to rain and there was a heavy downfall throughout the voyage homeward runcorn is fourteen miles from liverpool and is the farthest point to which a steamer runs i had intended to come home by rail a circuitous route but the advice of the landlady of the hotel and the aspect of the weather and a feeling of general discouragement prevented me an incident in s c halls ireland of a stone cross buried in cromwells time to prevent its destruction by his soldiers it was forgotten and became a mere doubtful tradition but one old man had been told by his father and he by his father etc that it was buried near a certain spot and at last two hundred years after the cross was buried the vicar of the parish dug in that spot and found it in my english romance an american might bring the tradition from over the sea and so discover the cross which had been altogether forgotten august th day before yesterday i took the rail for southport a cool generally overcast day with glimmers of faint sunshine the ride is through a most uninteresting tract of country at first glimpses of the river with the thousands of masts in the docks the dismal outskirts of a great town still spreading onward with beginnings of streets and insulated brick buildings and blocks farther on a wide monotony of level plain and here and there a village and a church almost always a windmill in sight there being plenty of breeze to turn its vans on this windy coast the railway skirts along the sea the whole distance but is shut out from the sight of it by the low sandhills which seem to have been heaped up by the waves there are one or two lighthouses on the shore i have not seen a drearier landscape even in lancashire reaching southport at three i rambled about with a view to discover whether it be a suitable residence for my family during september it is a large village or rather more than a village which seems to be almost entirely made up of lodginghouses and at any rate has been built up by the influx of summer visitors a sandy soil level and laid out with wellpaved streets the principal of which are enlivened with bazaars markets shops hotels of various degrees and a showy vivacity of aspect there are a great many donkeycarriages large vehicles drawn by a pair of donkeys bathchairs with invalid ladies refreshmentrooms in great numbers a place where everybody seems to be a transitory guest nobody at home the main street leads directly down to the seashore along which there is an elevated embankment with a promenade on the top and seats and the toll of a penny the shore itself the tide being then low stretched out interminably seaward a wide waste of glistering sands and on the dry border people were riding on donkeys with the drivers whipping behind and children were digging with their little wooden spades and there were donkeycarriages far out on the sands a pleasant and breezy drive a whole city of bathingmachines was stationed near the shore and i saw others in the seaward distance the seaair was refreshing and exhilarating and if s needs a seaside residence i should think this might do as well as any other i saw a large brick edifice enclosed within a wall and with somewhat the look of an almshouse or hospital and it proved to be an infirmary charitably established for the reception of poor invalids who need seaair and cannot afford to pay for it two or three of such persons were sitting under its windows i do not think that the visitors of southport are generally of a very opulent class but of the middle rank from manchester and other parts of this northern region the lodginghouses however are of sufficiently handsome style and arrangement oxford mr hawthorne extracted from his recorded oxford experiences his excursion to blenheim but left his observations of the town itself untouched and these i now transcribe ed august st yesterday we took the rail for london and drove across the city to the paddington station where we met bennoch and set out with him for oxford i do not quite understand the matter but it appears that we were expected guests of mr spiers a very hospitable gentleman and exmayor of oxford and a friend of bennoch and of the halls mr s c hall met us at the oxford station and under his guidance we drove to a quiet comfortable house in st giles street where rooms had been taken for us durham the sculptor is likewise of the party after establishing ourselves at these lodgings we walked forth to take a preliminary glimpse of the city and mr hall being familiar with the localities served admirably as a guide if i remember aright i spoke very slightingly of the exterior aspect of oxford as i saw it with j during an hour or twos stay here on my way to southampton to meet s on her return from lisbon i am bound to say that my impressions are now very different and that i find oxford exceedingly picturesque and rich in beauty and grandeur and in antique stateliness i do not remember very particularly what we saw timeworn fronts of famous colleges and halls of learning everywhere about the streets and arched entrances passing through which we saw bits of sculpture from monkish hands the most grotesque and ludicrous faces as if the slightest whim of these old carvers took shape in stone the material being so soft and manageable by them an ancient stone pulpit in the quadrangle of maudlin college magdalen one of only three now extant in england a splendid no not splendid but dimly magnificent chapel belonging to the same college with painted windows of rare beauty not brilliant with diversified hues but of a sombre tint in this chapel there is an alabaster monument a recumbent figure of the founders father as large as life which though several centuries old is as well preserved as if fresh from the chisel in the high street which i suppose is the noblest old street in england mr hall pointed out the crown inn where shakespeare used to spend the night and was most hospitably welcomed by the pretty hostess the mother of sir william davenant on his passage between stratford and london it is a threestory house with other houses contiguous an old timber mansion though now plastered and painted of a yellowish line the groundfloor is occupied as a shoeshop but the rest of the house is still kept as a tavern it is not now term time and oxford loses one of its most characteristic features by the absence of the gownsmen but still there is a good deal of liveliness in the streets we walked as far as a bridge beyond maudlin college and then drove homeward at six we went to dine with the hospitable exmayor across the wide treebordered street for his house is nearly opposite our lodgings he is an intelligent and gentlemanly person and was mayor two years ago and has done a great deal to make peace between the university and the town heretofore bitterly inimical his house is adorned with pictures and drawings and he has an especial taste for art the dinnertable was decorated with pieces of plate vases and other things which were presented to him as tokens of public or friendly regard and approbation of his action in the mayoralty after dinner too he produced a large silver snuffbox which had been given him on the same account in fact the inscription affirmed that it was one of five pieces of plate so presented the vases are really splendid one of them two feet high and richly ornamented it will hold five or six bottles of wine and he said that it had been filled and i believe sent round as a lovingcup at some of his entertainments he cordially enjoys these things and his genuine benevolence produces all this excellent hospitality but bennoch proposed a walk and we set forth we rambled pretty extensively about the streets sometimes seeing the shapes of old edifices dimly and doubtfully it being an overcast night or catching a partial view of a gray wall or a pillar or a gothic archway by lamplight the clock had some time ago struck eleven when we were passing under a long extent of antique wall and towers which were those of baliol college mr dled us into the middle of the street and showed us a cross which was paved into it on a level with the rest of the road this was the spot where latimer and ridley and another bishop were martyred in bloody marys time there is a memorial to them in another street but this where i set my foot at nearly midnight was the very spot where their flesh burned to ashes and their bones whitened it has been a most beautiful morning and i have seen few pleasanter scenes than this street in which we lodge with its spacious breadth its two rows of fine old trees with sidewalks as wide as the whole width of some streets and on the opposite side the row of houses some of them ancient with picturesque gables partially disclosed through the intervening foliage from our window we have a slantwise glimpse to the right of the walls of st johns college and the general aspect of st giles it is of an antiquity not to shame those mediaeval halls our own lodgings are in a house that seems to be very old with panelled walls and beams across the ceilings latticewindows in the chambers and a musty odor such as old houses inevitably have nevertheless everything is extremely neat clean and comfortable and in term time our apartments are occupied by a mr stebbing whose father is known in literature by some critical writings and who is a graduate and an admirable scholar there is a bookcase of five shelves containing his books mostly standard works and indicating a safe and solid taste after lunch today we that is mrs hall her adopted daughter s and i with the exmayor set forth in an open barouche to see the remarkables of oxford while the rest of the guests went on foot we first drew up at new college a strange name for such an old place but it was new some time since the conquest and went through its quiet and sunny quadrangles and into its sunny and shadowy gardens i am in despair about the architecture and old edifices of these oxford colleges it is so impossible to express them in words they are themselves as the architect left them and as time has modified and improved them the expression of an idea which does not admit of being otherwise expressed or translated into anything else those old battlemented walls around the quadrangles many gables the windows with stone pavilions so very antique yet some of them adorned with fresh flowers in pots a very sweet contrast the ivy mantling the gray stone and the infinite repose both in sunshine and shadow it is as if half a dozen bygone centuries had set up their rest here and as if nothing of the present time ever passed through the deeply recessed archway that shuts in the college from the street not but what people have very free admittance and many parties of young men and girls and children came into the gardens while we were there these gardens of new college are indescribably beautiful not gardens in an american sense but lawns of the richest green and softest velvet grass shadowed over by ancient trees that have lived a quiet life here for centuries and have been nursed and tended with such care and so sheltered from rude winds that certainly they must have been the happiest of all trees such a sweet quiet sacred stately seclusion so agelong as this has been and i hope will continue to be cannot exist anywhere else one side of the garden wall is formed by the ancient wall of the city which cromwells artillery battered and which still retains its pristine height and strength at intervals there are round towers that formed the bastions that is to say on the exterior they are round towers but within in the garden of the college they are semicircular recesses with iron gardenseats arranged round them the loopholes through which the archers and musketeers used to shoot still pierce through deep recesses in the wall which is here about six feet thick i wish i could put into one sentence the whole impression of this garden but it could not be done in many pages we looked also at the outside of the wall and mr parker deeply skilled in the antiquities of the spot showed us a weed growing here in little sprigs there in large and heavy festoons hanging plentifully downward from a shallow root it is called the oxford plant being found only here and not easily if at all introduced anywhere else it bears a small and pretty blue flower not altogether unlike the forgetmenot and we took some of it away with us for a memorial we went into the chapel of new college which is in such fresh condition that i think it must be modern and yet this cannot be since there are old brasses inlaid into tombstones in the pavement representing mediaeval ecclesiastics and college dignitaries and busts against the walls in antique garb and old painted windows unmistakable in their antiquity but there is likewise a window lamentable to look at which was painted by sir joshua reynolds and exhibits strikingly the difference between the work of a man who performed it merely as a matter of taste and business and what was done religiously and with the whole heart at least it shows that the artists and public of the last age had no sympathy with gothic art in the chancel of this church there are more painted windows which i take to be modern too though they are in much better taste and have an infinitely better effect than sir joshuas at any rate with the sunshine through them they looked very beautiful and tinted the high altar and the pavement with brilliant lines the sacristan opened a tall and narrow little recess in the wall of the chancel and showed it entirely filled with the crosier of william of wickham it appears to be made of silver gilt and is a most rich and elaborate relic at least six feet high modern art cannot or does not equal the chasing and carving of this splendid crosier which is enriched with figures of saints and apostles and various gothic devices very minute but all executed as faithfully as if the artists salvation had depended upon every notch he made in the silver leaving new college bennoch and i under mr parkers guidance walked round christ church meadows part of our way lying along the banks of the cherwell which unites with the isis to form the thames i believe the cherwell is a narrow and remarkably sluggish stream but is deep in spots and capriciously so so that a person may easily step from kneedeep to fifteen feet in depth a gentleman present used a queer expression in reference to the drowning of two college men he said it was an awkward affair i think this is equal to longfellows story of the frenchman who avowed himself very much displeased at the news of his fathers death at the confluence of the cherwell and isis we saw a good many boats belonging to the students of the various colleges some of them being very large and handsome barges capable of accommodating a numerous party with room on board for dancing and merrymaking some of them are calculated to be drawn by horses in the manner of canalboats others are propellable by oars it is practicable to perform the voyage between oxford and london a distance of about one hundred and thirty miles in three days the students of oxford are famous boatmen there is a constant rivalship on this score among the different colleges and annually i believe there is a match between oxford and cambridge the cambridge men beat the oxonians in this years trial on our return into the city we passed through christ church which as regards the number of students is the most considerable college of the university it has a stately dome but my memory is confused with battlements towers and gables and gothic staircases and cloisters if there had been nothing else in oxford but this one establishment my anticipations would not have been disappointed the bell was tolling for worship in the chapel and mr parker told us that dr pusey is a canon or in some sort of dignity in christ church and would soon probably make his appearance in the quadrangle on his way to chapel so we walked to and fro waiting an opportunity to see him a gouty old dignitary in a white surplice came hobbling along from one extremity of the court and by and by from the opposite corner appeared dr pusey also in a white surplice and with a lady by his side we met him and i stared pretty fixedly at him as i well might for he looked on the ground as if conscious that he would be stared at he is a man past middle life of sufficient breadth and massiveness with a pale intellectual manly face he was talking with the lady and smiled but not jollily mr parker who knows him says that he is a man of kind and gentle affections the lady was his niece thence we went through high street and broad street and passing by baliol college a most satisfactory pile and range of old towered and gabled edifices we came to the cross on the pavement which is supposed to mark the spot where the bishops were martyred but mr parker told us the mortifying fact that he had ascertained that this could not possibly have been the genuine spot of martyrdom which must have taken place at a point within view but considerably too far off to be moistened by any tears that may be shed here it is too bad we concluded the rambles of the day by visiting the gardens of st johns college and i desire if possible to say even more in admiration of them than of those of new college such beautiful lawns with tall ancient trees and heavy clouds of foliage and sunny glimpses through archways of leafy branches where today we could see parties of girls making cheerful contrast with the sombre walls and solemn shade the world surely has not another place like oxford it is a despair to see such a place and ever to leave it for it would take a lifetime and more than one to comprehend and enjoy it satisfactorily at dinner today the golden vases were all ranged on the table the largest and central one containing a most magnificent bouquet of dahlias and other brighthued flowers on tuesday our first visit was to christ church where we saw the large and stately hall above a hundred feet long by forty wide and fifty to the top of its carved oaken roof which is ornamented with festoons as it were and pendants of solid timber the walls are panelled with oak perhaps halfway upward and above are the rows of arched windows on each side but near the upper end two great windows come nearly to the floor there is a dais where the great men of the college and the distinguished guests sit at table and the tables of the students are arranged along the length of the hall all around looking down upon those who sit at meat are the portraits of a multitude of illustrious personages who were members of the learned fraternity in times past not a portrait being admitted there unless it he a king and i remember only henry viii save those who were actually students on the foundation receiving the eleemosynary aid of the college most of them were divines but there are likewise many statesmen eminent during the last three hundred years and among many earlier ones the marquis of wellesley and canning it is an excellent idea for their own glory and as examples to the rising generations to have this multitude of men who have done good and great things before the eyes of those who ought to do as well as they in their own time archbishops prime ministers poets deep scholars but doubtless an outward success has generally been their claim to this position and christ church may have forgotten a better man than the best of them it is not i think the tendency of english life nor of the education of their colleges to lead young men to high moral excellence but to aim at illustrating themselves in the sight of mankind thence we went into the kitchen which is arranged very much as it was three centuries ago with two immense fireplaces there was likewise a gridiron which without any exaggeration was large enough to have served for the martyrdom of st lawrence the college dinners are good but plain and cost the students one shilling and eleven pence each being rather cheaper than a similar one could be had at an inn there is no provision for breakfast or supper in commons but they can have these meals sent to their rooms from the buttery at a charge proportioned to the dishes they order there seems to be no necessity for a great expenditure on the part of oxford students from the kitchen we went to the chapel which is the cathedral of oxford and well worth seeing if there had not been so many other things to see it is now under repair and there was a great heap of old woodwork and panelling lying in one of the aisles which had been stripped away from some of the ancient pillars leaving them as good as new there is a shrine of a saint with a wooden canopy over it and some painted glass old and new and a statue of cyril jackson with a face of shrewdness and insight and busts as mural monuments our next visit was to merton college which though not one of the great colleges is as old as any of them and looks exceedingly venerable we were here received by a friend of mr spiers in his academic cap but without his gown which is not worn except in term time he is a very civil gentleman and showed us some antique points of architecture such as a norman archway with a passage over it through which the queen of charles i used to go to chapel and an edifice of the thirteenth century with a stone roof which is considered to be very curious how ancient is the aspect of these college quadrangles so gnawed by time as they are so crumbly so blackened and so gray where they are not black so quaintly shaped too with here a line of battlement and there a row of gables and here a turret with probably a winding stair inside and latticewindows with stone mullions and little panes of glass set in lead and the cloisters with a long arcade looking upon the green or pebbled enclosure the quality of the stone has a great deal to do with the apparent antiquity it is a stone found in the neighborhood of oxford and very soon begins to crumble and decay superficially when exposed to the weather so that twenty years do the work of a hundred so far as appearances go if you strike one of the old walls with a stick a portion of it comes powdering down the effect of this decay is very picturesque and is especially striking i think on edifices of classic architecture such as some of the oxford colleges are greatly enriching the grecian columns which look so cold when the outlines are hard and distinct the oxford people however are tired of this crumbly stone and when repairs are necessary they use a more durable material which does not well assort with the antiquity into which it is intruded mr eshowed us the library of merton college it occupies two sides of an old building and has a very delightful fragrance of ancient books the halls containing it are vaulted and roofed with oak not carved and ornamented but laid flat so that they look very like a grand and spacious old garret all along there is a row of alcoves on each side with rude benches and readingdesks in the simplest style and nobody knows how old the books look as old as the building the more valuable were formerly chained to the bookcases and a few of them have not yet broken their chains it was a good emblem of the dark and monkish ages when learning was imprisoned in their cloisters and chained in their libraries in the days when the schoolmaster had not yet gone abroad mr eshowed us a very old copy of the bible and a vellum manuscript most beautifully written in blackletter and illuminated of the works of duns scotus who was a scholar of merton college he then showed us the chapel a large part of which has been renewed and ornamented with pictured windows and other ecclesiastical splendor and paved with encaustic tiles according to the puseyite taste of the day for merton has adopted the puseyite doctrines and is one of their chief strongholds in oxford if they do no other good they at least do much for the preservation and characteristic restoration of the old english churches but perhaps even here there is as much antiquity spoiled as retained in the portion of the chapel not yet restored we saw the rude old pavement inlaid with gravestones in some of which were brasses with the figures of the college dignitaries whose dust slumbered beneath and i think it was here that i saw the tombstone of anthonyawood the gossiping biographer of the learned men of oxford from the chapel we went into the college gardens which are very pleasant and possess the advantage of looking out on the broad verdure of christ church meadows and the river beyond we loitered here awhile and then went to mr s rooms to which the entrance is by a fine old staircase they had a very comfortable aspect a wainscoted parlor and bedroom as nice and cosey as a bachelor could desire with a good collection of theological books and on a peg hung his gown with a red border about it denoting him to be a proproctor he was kind enough to order a lunch consisting of bread and cheese college ale and a certain liquor called archdeacon we ate and drank and bidding farewell to good mr e we pursued our way to the ratcliffe library this is a very handsome edifice of a circular shape the lower story consisting altogether of arches open on all sides as if to admit anybody to the learning here stored up i always see great beauty and lightsomeness in these classic and grecian edifices though they seem cold and intellectual and not to have had their mortar moistened with human lifeblood nor to have the mystery of human life in them as gothic structures do the library is in a large and beautiful room in the story above the basement and as far as i saw consisted chiefly or altogether of scientific works i saw sillimans journal on one of the desks being the only trace of american science or american learning or ability in any department which i discovered in the university of oxford after seeing the library we went to the top of the building where we had an excellent view of oxford and the surrounding country then we went to the convocation hall and afterwards to the theatre where s sat down in the chancellors chair which is very broad and ponderously wrought of oak i remember little here except the amphitheatre of benches and the roof which seems to be supported by golden ropes and on the wall opposite the door some fulllength portraits among which one of that ridiculous coxcomb george iv was the most prominent these kings thrust themselves impertinently forward by bust statue and picture on all occasions and it is not wise in them to show their shallow foreheads among men of mind the bodleian library mr spiers tried to get us admittance to the bodleian library but this is just the moment when it is closed for the purpose of being cleaned so we missed seeing the principal halls of this library and were only admitted into what was called the picture gallery this however satisfied all my desires so far as the backs of books are concerned for they extend through a gallery running round three sides of a quadrangle making an aggregate length of more than four hundred feet a solid array of bookcases full of books within a protection of open ironwork up and down the gallery there are models of classic temples and about midway in its extent stands a brass statue of earl pembroke who was chancellor of the university in james is time not in scholarly garb however but in plate and mail looking indeed like a thunderbolt of war i rapped him with my knuckles and he seemed to be solid metal though i should imagine hollow at heart a thing which interested me very much was the lantern of guy fawkes it was once tinned no doubt but is now nothing but rusty iron partly broken as this is called the picture gallery i must not forget the pictures which are ranged in long succession over the bookcases and include almost all englishmen whom the world has ever heard of whether in statesmanship or literature i saw a canvas on which had once been a lovely and unique portrait of mary of scotland but it was consigned to a picturecleaner to be cleansed and discovering that it was painted over another picture he had the curiosity to clean poor mary quite away thus revealing a wishywashy womans face which now hangs in the gallery i am so tired of seeing notable things that i almost wish that whatever else is remarkable in oxford could he obliterated in some similar manner from the bodleian we went to the taylor institute which was likewise closed but the woman who had it in charge had formerly been a servant of mr spiers and he so overpersuaded her that she finally smiled and admitted us it would truly have been a pity to miss it for here on the basement floor are the original models of chantreys busts and statues great and small and in the rooms above are a far richer treasure a large collection of original drawings by raphael and michael angelo these are far better for my purpose than their finished pictures that is to say they bring me much closer to the hands that drew them and the minds that imagined them it is like looking into their brains and seeing the first conception before it took shape outwardly i have somewhere else said about the same thing of such sketches i noticed one of raphaels drawings representing the effect of eloquence it was a man speaking in the centre of a group between whose ears and the orators mouth connecting lines were drawn raphaels idea must have been to compose his picture in such a way that their auricular organs should not fail to be in a proper relation with the eloquent voice and though this relation would not have been individually traceable in the finished picture yet the general effect that of deep and entranced attention would have been produced in another room there are some copies of raphaels cartoons and some queer mediaeval pictures as stiff and ugly as can well be conceived yet successful in telling their own story we looked a little while at these and then thank heaven went home and dressed for dinner i can write no more today indeed what a mockery it is to write at all here follows the drive to cumnor place stanton harcourt nuneham courtney godstowe etc already published in our old home ed september th the morning after our excursion on the thames was as bright and beautiful as many preceding ones had been after breakfast s and i walked a little about the town and bought thomas a kempis in both french and english for u mr de la motte the photographer had breakfasted with us and mr spiers wished him to take a photograph of our whole party so in the first place before the rest were assembled he made an experimental group of such as were there and i did not like my own aspect very much afterwards when we were all come he arranged us under a tree in the garden mr and mrs spiers with their eldest son mr and mrs hall and fanny mr addison my wife and me and stained the glass with our figures and faces in the twinkling of an eye not s s face however for she turned it away and left only a portion of her bonnet and dress and mrs hall too refused to countenance the proceeding but all the rest of us were caught to the life and i was really a little startled at recognizing myself so apart from myself and done so quickly too this was the last important incident of our visit to oxford except that mr spiers was again most hospitable at lunch never did anybody attend more faithfully to the comfort of his friends than does this good gentleman but he has shown himself most kind in every possible way and i shall always feel truly grateful no better way of showing our sense of his hospitality and all the trouble he has taken for us and our memory of him has occurred to us than to present him with a set of my tales and romances so by the next steamer i shall write to ticknor and fields to send them elegantly bound and s will emblazon his coat of arms in each volume he accompanied us and mr and mrs hall to the railway station and we left oxford at two oclock it had been a very pleasant visit and all the persons whom we met were kind and agreeable and disposed to look at one another in a sunny aspect i saw a good deal of mr hall he is a thoroughly genuine man of kind heart and true affections a gentleman of taste and refinement and full of humor on the saturday after our return to blackheath we went to hampton court about which as i have already recorded a visit to it i need say little here but i was again impressed with the stately grandeur of wolseys great hall with its great window at each end and one side window descending almost to the floor and a row of windows on each side high towards the roof and throwing down their manycolored light on the stone pavement and on the gobelin tapestry which must have been gorgeously rich when the walls were first clothed with it i fancied then that no modern architect could produce so fine a room but oddly enough in the great entrancehall of the euston station yesterday i could not see how this last fell very much short of wolseys hall in grandeur we were quite wearied in passing through the endless suites of rooms in hampton court and gazing at the thousands of pictures it is too much for one day almost enough for one life in such measure as life can be bestowed on pictures it would have refreshed us had we spent half the time in wandering about the grounds which as we glimpsed at them from the windows of the palace seemed very beautiful though laid out with an antique formality of straight lines and broad gravelled paths before the central window there is a beautiful sheet of water and a fountain upshooting itself and plashing into it with a continuous and pleasant sound how beautifully the royal robe of a monarchy is embroidered palaces pictures parks they do enrich life and kings and aristocracies cannot keep these things to themselves they merely take care of them for others even a king with all the glory that can be shed around him is but the liveried and bedizened footman of his people and the toy of their delight i am very glad that i came to this country while the english are still playing with such a toy yesterday j and i left blackheath and reached liverpool last night the rest of my family will follow in a few days and so finishes our residence in bennochs house where i for my part have spent some of the happiest hours that i have known since we left our american home it is a strange vagabond gypsy sort of life this that we are leading and i know not whether we shall finally be spoiled for any other or shall enjoy our quiet wayside as we never did before when once we reach it again the evening set in misty and obscure and it was dark almost when j and i arrived at the landing stage on our return i was struck with the picturesque effect of the high tower and tall spire of st nicholas rising upward with dim outline into the duskiness while midway of its height the dialplates of an illuminated clock blazed out like two great eyes of a giant september th on saturday my wife with all her train arrived at mrs bs and on tuesday vagabonds as we are we again struck our tent and set out for southport i do not know what sort of character it will form in the children this unsettled shifting vagrant life with no central home to turn to except what we carry in ourselves it was a windy day and judging by the look of the trees on the way to southport it must be almost always windy and with the blast in one prevailing direction for invariably their branches and the whole contour and attitude of the tree turn from seaward with a strangely forlorn aspect reaching southport we took an omnibus and under the drivers guidance came to our tall stone house fronting on the sands and styled brunswick terrace the english system of lodginghouses has its good points but it is nevertheless a contrivance for bearing the domestic cares of home about with you whithersoever you go and immediately you have to set about producing your own bread and cheese however fanny took most of this trouble off our hands though there was inevitably the stiffness and discomfort of a new housekeeping on the first day of our arrival besides that it was cool and the wind whistled and grumbled and eddied into the chinks of the house meanwhile in all my experience of southport i have never yet seen the sea but only an interminable breadth of sands looking pooly or plashy in some places and barred across with drier reaches of sand but no expanse of water it must be miles and miles at low water to the veritable seashore we are about twenty miles north of liverpool on the border of the irish sea and ireland and i suppose the isle of man intervene betwixt us and the ocean not much to our benefit for the air of the english coast under ocean influences is said to be milder than when it comes across the land milder therefore above or below ireland because then the gulf stream ameliorates it betimes the forenoon after our arrival i had to take the rail to liverpool but returned a little after five in the midst of a rain still low water and interminable sands still a dreary howling blast we had a cheerful fireside however and should have had a pleasant evening only that the wind on the sea made us excessively drowsy this morning we awoke to hear the wind still blustering and blowing up clouds with fitful little showers and soon blowing them away again and letting the brightest of sunshine fall over the plashy waste of sand we have already walked forth on the shore with j and r who pick up shells and dig wells in the sand with their little wooden spades but soon we saw a rainbow on the western sky and then a shower came spattering down upon us in good earnest we first took refuge under the bridge that stretches between the two portions of the promenade but as there was a chill draught there we made the best of our way home the sun has now again come out brightly though the wind is still tumbling a great many clouds about the sky evening later i walked out with u and looking seaward we saw the foam and spray of the advancing tide tossed about on the verge of the horizon a long line like the crests and gleaming helmets of an army in about half an hour we found almost the whole waste of sand covered with water and white waves breaking out all over it but the bottom being so nearly level and the water so shallow there was little of the spirit and exultation of the sea in a strong breeze of the long line of bathingmachines one after another was hitched to a horse and trundled forth into the water where at a long distance from shore the bathers found themselves hardly middle deep september th the wind grumbled and made itself miserable all last night and this morning it is still howling as illnaturedly as ever and roaring and rumbling in the chimneys the tide is far out but from an upper window i fancied at intervals that i could see the plash of the surfwave on the distant limit of the sand perhaps however it was only a gleam on the sky constantly there have been sharp spatters of rain hissing and rattling against the windows while a little before or after or perhaps simultaneously a rainbow somewhat watery of texture paints itself on the western clouds gray sullen clouds hang about the sky or sometimes cover it with a uniform dulness at other times the portions towards the sun gleam almost lightsomely now there may be an airy glimpse of clear blue sky in a fissure of the clouds now the very brightest of sunshine comes out all of a sudden and gladdens everything the breadth of sands has a various aspect according as there are pools or moisture enough to glisten or a drier tract and where the light gleams along a yellow ridge or bar it is like sunshine itself certainly the temper of the day shifts but the smiles come far the seldomest and its frowns and angry tears are most reliable by seven oclock pedestrians began to walk along the promenade close buttoned against the blast later a single bathingmachine got under way by means of a horse and travelled forth seaward but within what distance it finds the invisible margin i cannot say at all events it looks like a dreary journey just now i saw a seagull wheeling on the blast close in towards the promenade september st yesterday morning was bright sunny and windy and cool and exhilarating i went to liverpool at eleven and returning at five found the weather still bright and cool the temperature methinks must soon diminish the population of southport which judging from appearances must be mainly made up of temporary visitors there is a newspaper the southport visitor published weekly and containing a register of all the visitants in the various hotels and lodginghouses it covers more than two sides of the paper to the amount of some hundreds the guests come chiefly from liverpool manchester and the neighboring countrytowns and belong to the middle classes it is not a fashionable wateringplace only one noblemans name and those of two or three baronets now adorn the list the people whom we see loitering along the beach and the promenade have at best a welltodo tradesmanlike air i do not find that there are any public amusements nothing but strolling on the sands donkeyriding or drives in donkeycarts and solitary visitors must find it a dreary place yet one or two of the streets are brisk and lively and being well thronged have a holiday aspect there are no carriages in town save donkeycarts some of which are drawn by three donkeys abreast and are large enough to hold a whole family these conveyances will take you far out on the sands through wet and dry the beach is haunted by the flying dutchman a sort of boat on wheels schoonerrigged with sails and which sometimes makes pretty good speed with a fair wind this morning we have been walking with j and r out over the ribbed sea sands a good distance from shore throughout the week the tides will be so low as not to cover the shallow basin of this bay if a bay it be the weather was sullen with now and then a faint gleam of sunshine lazily tracing our shadows on the sand the wind rather quieter than on preceding days in the sunshine the sands seem to be frequented by great numbers of gulls who begin to find the northern climate too wintry you see their white wings in the sunlight but they become almost or quite invisible in the shade we shall soon have an opportunity of seeing how a wateringplace looks when the season is quite over for we have concluded to remain here till december and everybody else will take flight in a week or two a short time ago in the evening in a street of liverpool i saw a decent man of the lower orders taken much aback by being roughly brushed against by a rowdy fellow he looked after him and exclaimed indignantly is that a yankee it shows the kind of character we have here october th on saturday evening i gave a dinner to bennoch at the adelphi hotel the chief point or characteristic of english customs was that mr radley our landlord himself attended at table and officiated as chief waiter he has a fortune of pounds half a million of dollars and is an elderly man of good address and appearance in america such a man would very probably be in congress at any rate he would never conceive the possibility of changing plates or passing round the table with hock and champagne some of his hock was a most rich and imperial wine such as can hardly be had on the rhine itself there were eight gentlemen besides bennoch a donkey the other day stubbornly refusing to come out of a boat which had brought him across the mersey at last after many kicks had been applied and other persecutions of that kind a man stepped forward addressing him affectionately come along brother and the donkey obeyed at once october th on thursday instead of taking the rail for liverpool i set out about eleven for a long walk it was an overcast morning such as in new england would have boded rain but english clouds are not nearly so portentous as american in that respect accordingly the sun soon began to peep through crevices and i had not gone more than a mile or two when it shone a little too warmly for comfort yet not more than i liked it was very much like our pleasant october days at home indeed the climates of the two countries more nearly coincide during the present month than at any other season of the year the air was almost perfectly still but once in a while it stirred and breathed coolly in my face it is very delightful this latent freshness in a warm atmosphere the country about southport has as few charms as it is possible for any region to have in the close neighborhood of the shore it is nothing but sandhillocks covered with coarse grass and this is the original nature of the whole site on which the town stands although it is now paved and has been covered with soil enough to make gardens and to nourish here and there a few trees a little farther inland the surface seems to have been marshy but has been drained by ditches across the fields and along the roadside and the fields are embanked on all sides with parapets of earth which appear as if intended to keep out inundations in fact holland itself cannot be more completely on a level with the sea the only dwellings are the old whitewashed stone cottages with thatched roofs on the brown straw of which grow various weeds and mosses brightening it with green patches and sprouting along the ridgepole the homeliest hovels that ever mortals lived in and which they share with pigs and cows at one end hens too run in and out of the door one or two of these hovels bore signs licensed to sell beer ale and tobacco and generally there were an old woman and some children visible in all cases there was a ditch full of water close at hand stagnant and often quite covered with a growth of waterweeds very unwholesome one would think in the neighborhood of a dwelling and in truth the children and grown people did look pale in the fields along the roadside men and women were harvesting their carrots and other rootcrops especially digging potatoes the pleasantest of all farm labor in my opinion there being such a continual interest in opening the treasures of each hill as i went on the country began to get almost imperceptibly less flat and there was some little appearance of trees i had determined to go to ormskirk but soon got out of the way and came to a little hamlet that looked antique and picturesque with its small houses of stone and brick built with the one material and repaired with the other perhaps ages afterward here i inquired my way of a woman who told me in broad lancashire dialect that i main go back and turn to my left till i came to a fingerpost and so i did and found another little hamlet the principal object in which was a publichouse with a large sign representing a dance round a maypole it was now about one oclock so i entered and being ushered into what i suppose they called the coffeeroom i asked for some cold neat and ale there was a jolly round rather comely woman for a hostess with a free hospitable yet rather careless manner the coffeeroom smelt rather disagreeably of bad tobaccosmoke and was shabbily furnished with an old sofa and flagbottomed chairs and adorned with a print of old billy a horse famous for a longevity of about sixty years and also with colored engravings of oldfashioned huntingscenes conspicuous with scarlet coats there was a very small bust of milton on the mantelpiece by and by the remains of an immense round of beef three quarters cut away were put on the table then some smokinghot potatoes and finally the hostess told me that their own dinner was just ready and so she had brought me in some hot chops thinking i might prefer them to the cold meat i did prefer them and they were stewed or fried chops instead of broiled and were very savory there was household bread too and rich cheese and a pint of ale home brewed not very mighty but good to quench thirst and by way of condiment some pickled cabbage so instead of a lunch i made quite a comfortable dinner moreover there was a cold pudding on the table and i called for a clean plate and helped myself to some of it it was of rice and was strewn over rather than intermixed with some kinds of berries the nature of which i could not exactly make out i then set forth again it was still sunny and warm and i walked more slowly than before dinner in fact i did little more than lounge along sitting down at last on the stone parapet of a bridge the country grew more pleasant more sylvan and though still of a level character not so drearily flat soon appeared the first symptom that i had seen of a gentlemans residence a lodge at a park gate then a long stretch of wall with a green lawn and afterwards an extent of wooded land then another gateway with a neat lodge on each side of it and lastly another extent of wood the hall or mansionhouse however was nowhere apparent being doubtless secluded deep and far within its grounds i inquired of a boy who was the owner of the estate and he answered mr scarisbrick and no doubt it is a family of local eminence along the road an old inn some aged stone houses built for merely respectable occupants a canal with two canalboats heaped up with a cargo of potatoes two little girls who were watching lest some cows should go astray and had their two little chairs by the roadside and their dolls and other playthings and so followed the footsteps of the cows all day long i met two boys coming from ormskirk mounted on donkeys with empty panniers on which they had carried vegetables to market finally between two and three oclock i saw the great tower of ormskirk church with its spire not rising out of the tower but sprouting up close beside it and entering the town i directed my steps first to this old church ormskirk church it stands on a gentle eminence sufficient to give it a good site and has a pavement of flat gravestones in front it is doubtless as regards its foundation a very ancient church but has not exactly a venerable aspect being in too good repair and much restored in various parts not ivygrown either though green with moss here and there the tower is square and immensely massive and might have supported a very lofty spire so that it is the more strange that what spire it has should be so oddly stuck beside it springing out of the church wall i should have liked well enough to enter the church as it is the burialplace of the earls of derby and perhaps may contain some interesting monuments but as it was all shut up and even the iron gates of the churchyard closed and locked i merely looked at the outside from the church a street leads to the marketplace in which i found a throng of men and women it being marketday wares of various kinds tin earthen and cloth set out on the pavements droves of pigs ducks and fowls baskets of eggs and a man selling quack medicines recommending his nostrums as well as he could the aspect of the crowd was very english portly and ruddy women yeomen with smallclothes and broadbrimmed hats all very quiet and heavy and goodhumored their dialect was so provincial that i could not readily understand more than here and there a word but after all there were few traits that could be made a note of i soon grew weary of the scene and so i went to the railway station and waited there nearly an hour for the train to take me to southport ormskirk is famous for its gingerbread which women sell to the railway passengers at a sixpence for a rouleau of a dozen little cakes november th a week ago last monday herman melville came to see me at the consulate looking much as he used to do and with his characteristic gravity and reserve of manner we soon found ourselves on pretty much our former terms of sociability and confidence he is thus far on his way to constantinople i do not wonder that he found it necessary to take an airing through the world after so many years of toilsome penlabor following upon so wild and adventurous a youth as his was i invited him to come and stay with us at southport as long as he might remain in this vicinity and accordingly he did come the next day on wednesday we took a pretty long walk together and sat down in a hollow among the sandhills sheltering ourselves from the high cool wind melville as he always does began to reason of providence and futurity and of everything else that lies beyond human ken he has a very high and noble nature and is better worth immortality than the most of us on saturday we went to chester together i love to take every opportunity of going to chester it being the one only place within easy reach of liverpool which possesses any old english interest we went to the cathedral its gray nave impressed me more than at any former visit passing into the cloisters an attendant took possession of us and showed us about within the choir there is a profusion of very rich oaken carving both on the screen that separates it from the nave and on the seats and walls very curious and most elaborate and lavished one would say most wastefully where nobody would think of looking for it where indeed amid the dimness of the cathedral the exquisite detail of the elaboration could not possibly be seen our guide lighted some of the gasburners of which there are many hundreds to help us see them but it required close scrutiny even then it must have been out of the question when the whole means of illumination were only a few smoky torches or candles there was a row of niches where the monks used to stand for four hours together in the performance of some of their services and to relieve them a little they were allowed partially to sit on a projection of the seats which were turned up in the niche for that purpose but if they grew drowsy so as to fail to balance themselves the seat was so contrived as to slip down thus bringing the monk to the floor these projections on the seats are each and all of them carved with curious devices no two alike the guide showed us one representing apparently the first quarrel of a newmarried couple wrought with wonderful expression indeed the artist never failed to bring out his idea in the most striking manner as for instance satan under the guise of a lion devouring a sinner bodily and again in the figure of a dragon with a man halfway down his gullet the legs hanging out the carver may not have seen anything grotesque in this nor intended it at all by way of joke but certainly there would appear to be a grim mirthfulness in some of the designs one does not see why such fantasies should be strewn about the holy interior of a cathedral unless it were intended to contain everything that belongs to the heart of man both upward and downward in a side aisle of the choir we saw a tomb said to be that of the emperor henry iv of germany though on very indistinct authority this is an oblong tomb carved and on one side painted with bright colors and gilded during a very long period it was built and plastered into the wall and the exterior side was whitewashed but on being removed the inner side was found to have been ornamented with gold and color in the manner in which we now see it if this were customary with tombs it must have added vastly to the gorgeous magnificence to which the painted windows and polished pillars and ornamented ceilings contributed so much in fact a cathedral in its fresh estate seems to have been like a pavilion of the sunset all purple and gold whereas now it more resembles deepest and grayest twilight afterwards we were shown into the ancient refectory now used as the city grammarschool and furnished with the usual desks and seats for the boys in one corner of this large room was the sort of pulpit or elevated seat with a broken staircase of stone ascending to it where one of the monks used to read to his brethren while sitting at their meals the desks were cut and carved with the scholars knives just as they used to be in the schoolrooms where i was a scholar thence we passed into the chapterhouse but before that we went through a small room in which melville opened a cupboard and discovered a dozen or two of winebottles but our guide told us that they were now empty and never were meant for jollity having held only sacramental wine in the chapterhouse we saw the library some of the volumes of which were antique folios there were two dusty and tattered banners hanging on the wall and the attendant promised to make us laugh by something that he would tell us about them the joke was that these two banners had been in the battle of bunker hill and our countrymen he said always smiled on hearing this he had discovered us to be americans by the notice we took of a mural tablet in the choir to the memory of a lieutenantgovernor clarke of new york who died in chester before the revolution from the chapterhouse he ushered us back into the nave ever and anon pointing out some portion of the edifice more ancient than the rest and when i asked him how he knew this he said that he had learnt it from the archaeologists who could read off such things like a book this guide was a lively quickwitted man who did his business less by rote and more with a vivacious interest than any guide i ever met after leaving the cathedral we sought out the yacht inn near the watergate this was for a long period of time the principal inn of chester and was the house at which swift once put up on his way to holyhead and where he invited the clergy to come and sup with him we sat down in a small snuggery conversing with the landlord the chester people according to my experience are very affable and fond of talking with strangers about the antiquities and picturesque characteristics of their town it partly lives the landlord told us by its visitors and many people spend the summer here on account of the antiquities and the good air he showed us a broad balustraded staircase leading into a large comfortable oldfashioned parlor with windows looking on the street and on the custom house that stood opposite this was the room where swift expected to receive the clergy of chester and on one of the windowpanes were two acrid lines written with the diamond of his ring satirizing those venerable gentlemen in revenge for their refusing his invitation the first line begins rather indistinctly but the writing grows fully legible as it proceeds the yacht tavern is a very old house in the gabled style the timbers and framework are still perfectly sound in the same street is the bishops house so called as having been the residence of a prelate long ago which is covered with curious sculpture representing scriptural scenes and in the same neighborhood is the county court accessible by an archway through which we penetrated and found ourselves in a passage very ancient and dusky overlooked from the upper story by a gallery to which an antique staircase ascended with balustrades and square landingplaces a printer saw us here and asked us into his printingoffice and talked very affably indeed he could have hardly been more civil if he had known that both melville and i have given a good deal of employment to the brethren of his craft december th an old gentleman has recently paid me a good many visits a kentucky man who has been a good deal in england and europe generally without losing the freshness and unconventionality of his earlier life he was a boatman and afterwards captain of a steamer on the ohio and mississippi but has gained property and is now the owner of mines of coal and iron which he is endeavoring to dispose of here in england a plain respectable welltodolooking personage of more than seventy years very free of conversation and beginning to talk with everybody as a matter of course tall stalwart a dark face with white curly hair and keen eyes and an expression shrewd yet kindly and benign he fought through the whole war of beginning with general harrison at the battle of tippecanoe which he described to me he says that at the beginning of the battle and for a considerable time he heard tecumsehs voice loudly giving orders there was a man named wheatley in the american camp a strange incommunicative person a volunteer making war entirely on his own book and seeking revenge for some relatives of his who had been killed by the indians in the midst of the battle this wheatley ran at a slow trot past rmy informant trailing his rifle and making towards the point where tecumsehs voice was heard the fight drifted around and ralong with it and by and by he reached a spot where wheatley lay dead with his head on tecumsehs breast tecumseh had been shot with a rifle but before expiring appeared to have shot wheatley with a pistol which he still held in his hand raffirms that tecumseh was flayed by the kentucky men on the spot and his skin converted into razorstraps i have left out the most striking point of the narrative after all as rtold it viz that soon after wheatley passed him he suddenly ceased to hear tecumsehs voice ringing through the forest as he gave his orders he was at the battle of new orleans and gave me the story of it from beginning to end but i remember only a few particulars in which he was personally concerned he confesses that his hair bristled upright every hair in his head when he heard the shouts of the british soldiers before advancing to the attack his uncomfortable sensations lasted till he began to fire after which he felt no more of them it was in the dusk of the morning or a little before sunrise when the assault was made and the fight lasted about two hours and a half during which rfired twentyfour times and said he i saw my object distinctly each time and i was a good rifleshot he was raising his rifle to fire the twentyfifth time when an american officer general carroll pressed it down and bade him fire no more enough is enough quoth the general for there needed no more slaughter the british being in utter rout and confusion in this retreat many of the enemy would drop down among the dead then rise run a considerable distance and drop again thus confusing the riflemens aim one fellow had thus got about four hundred and fifty yards from the american line and thinking himself secure he made a derisive gesture ill have a shot at him anyhow cried a rifleman so he fired and the poor devil dropped rhimself with one of his twentyfour shots hit a british officer who fell forward on his face about thirty paces from our line and as the enemy were then retreating they advanced and were repelled two or three times he ran out and turned him over on his back the officer was a man about thirtyeight tall and finelooking his eyes were wide open clear and bright and were fixed full on rwith a somewhat stern glance but there was the sweetest and happiest smile over his face that could be conceived he seemed to be dead at least rthinks that he did not really see him fixedly as he appeared to gaze the officer held his sword in his hand and rtried in vain to wrest it from him until suddenly the clutch relaxed rstill keeps the sword hung up over his mantelpiece i asked him how the dead mans aspect affected him he replied that he felt nothing at the time but that ever since in all trouble in uneasy sleep and whenever he is out of tune or waking early or lying awake at night he sees this officers face with the clear bright eyes and the pleasant smile just as distinctly as if he were bending over him his wound was in the breast exactly on the spot that rhad aimed at and bled profusely the enemy advanced in such masses he says that it was impossible not to hit them unless by purposely firing over their heads after the battle rleaped over the rampart and took a prisoner who was standing unarmed in the midst of the slain having probably dropped down during the heat of the action to avoid the hailstorm of rifleshots as he led him in the prisoner paused and pointed to an officer who was lying dead beside his dead horse with his foot still in the stirrup there lies our general said he the horse had been killed by a grapeshot and pakenham himself apparently by a sixpounder ball which had first struck the earth covering him from head to foot with mud and clay and had then entered his side and gone upward through his breast his face was all besmirched with the moist earth rtook the slain generals foot out of the stirrup and then went to report his death much more he told me being an exceedingly talkative old man and seldom i suppose finding so good a listener as myself i like the man a goodtempered upright bold and free old fellow of a rough breeding but sufficiently smoothed by society to be of pleasant intercourse he is as dogmatic as possible having formed his own opinions often on very disputable grounds and hardened in them taking queer views of matters and things and giving shrewd and not ridiculous reasons for them but with a keen strong sense at the bottom of his character a little while ago i met an englishman in a railway carriage who suggests himself as a kind of contrast to this warlike and vicissitudinous backwoodsman he was about the same age as r but had spent apparently his whole life in liverpool and has long occupied the post of inspector of nuisances a rather puffy and consequential man gracious however and affable even to casual strangers like myself the great contrast betwixt him and the american lies in the narrower circuit of his ideas the latter talking about matters of history of his own country and the world glancing over the whole field of politics propounding opinions and theories of his own and showing evidence that his mind had operated for better or worse on almost all conceivable matters while the englishman was odorous of his office strongly flavored with that and otherwise most insipid he began his talk by telling me of a dead body which he had lately discovered in a house in liverpool where it had been kept about a fortnight by the relatives partly from want of funds for the burial and partly in expectation of the arrival of some friends from glasgow there was a plate of glass in the coffinlid through which the inspector of nuisances as he told me had looked and seen the dead mans face in an ugly state of decay which he minutely described however his conversation was not altogether of this quality for he spoke about larks and how abundant they are just now and what a good pie they make only they must be skinned else they will have a bitter taste we have since had a larkpie ourselves and i believe it was very good in itself only the recollection of the nuisancemans talk was not a very agreeable flavor a very racy and peculiarly english character might be made out of a man like this having his lifeconcern wholly with the disagreeables of a great city he seemed to be a good and kindly person too but earthy even as if his frame had been moulded of clay impregnated with the draining of slaughterhouses december st on thursday evening i dined for the first time with the new mayor at the town hall i wish to preserve all the characteristic traits of such banquets because being peculiar to england these municipal feasts may do well to picture in a novel there was a big old silver tobaccobox nearly or quite as large round as an ordinary plate out of which the dignitaries of liverpool used to fill their pipes while sitting in council or after their dinners the date was on the lid it is now used as a snuffbox and wends its way from guest to guest round the table we had turtle and among other good things american canvasback ducks these dinners are certainly a good institution and likely to be promotive of good feeling the mayor giving them often and inviting in their turn all the respectable and eminent citizens of whatever political bias about fifty gentlemen were present that evening i had the post of honor at the mayors right hand and france turkey and austria were toasted before the republic for as the mayor whispered me he must first get his allies out of the way the turkish consul and the austrian both made better english speeches than any englishman during the evening for it is inconceivable what shapeless and ragged utterances englishmen are content to put forth without attempting anything like a wholeness but inserting a patch here and a patch there and finally getting out what they wish to say indeed but in most disorganized guise i can conceive of very high enjoyment in making a speech one is in such a curious sympathy with his audience feeling instantly how every sentence affects them and wonderfully excited and encouraged by the sense that it has gone to the right spot then too the imminent emergency when a man is overboard and must sink or swim sharpens concentrates and invigorates the mind and causes matters of thought and sentiment to assume shape and expression though perhaps it seemed hopeless to express them just before you rose to speak yet i question much whether public speaking tends to elevate the orator intellectually or morally the effort of course being to say what is immediately received by the audience and to produce an effect on the instant i dont quite see how an honest man can be a good and successful orator but i shall hardly undertake to decide the question on my merely postprandial experience the mayor toasted his guests by their professions the merchants for instance the bankers the solicitors and while one of the number responded his brethren also stood up each in his place thus giving their assent to what he said i think the very worst orator was a major of artillery who spoke in a meek little nervous voice and seemed a good deal more discomposed than probably he would have been in the face of the enemy the first toast was the ladies to which an old bachelor responded december st thus far we have come through the winter on this bleak and blasty shore of the irish sea where perhaps the drowned body of miltons friend lycidas might have been washed ashore more than two centuries ago this would not be very likely however so wide a tract of sands never deeply covered by the tide intervening betwixt us and the sea but it is an excessively windy place especially here on the promenade always a whistle and a howl always an eddying gust through the corridors and chambers often a patter of hail or rain or snow against the windows and in the long evenings the sounds outside are very much as if we were on shipboard in midocean with the waves dashing against the vessels sides i go to town almost daily starting at about eleven and reaching southport again at a little past live by which time it is quite dark and continues so till nearly eight in the morning christmas time has been marked by few characteristics for a week or two previous to christmas day the newspapers contained rich details respecting marketstalls and butchers shops what magnificent carcasses of prize oxen and sheep they displayed the christmas waits came to us on christmas eve and on the day itself in the shape of little parties of boys or girls singing wretched doggerel rhymes and going away well pleased with the guerdon of a penny or two last evening came two or three older choristers at pretty near bedtime and sang some carols at our door they were psalm tunes however everybody with whom we have had to do in any manner of service expects a christmasbox but in most cases a shilling is quite a satisfactory amount we have had holly and mistletoe stuck up on the gasfixtures and elsewhere about the house on the mantelpiece in the coroners court the other day i saw corked and labelled phials which it may be presumed contained samples of poisons that have brought some poor wretches to their deaths either by murder or suicide this court might be wrought into a very good and pregnant description with its grimy gloom illuminated by a conical skylight constructed to throw daylight down on corpses its greasy testament covered over with millions of perjured kisses the coroner himself whose life is fed on all kinds of unnatural death its subordinate officials who go about scenting murder and might be supposed to have caught the scent in their own garments its stupid brutish juries settling round corpses like flies its criminals whose guilt is brought face to face with them here in closer contact than at the subsequent trial o p the famous mormonite called on me a little while ago a short blackhaired darkcomplexioned man a shrewd intelligent but unrefined countenance excessively unprepossessing an uncouth gait and deportment the aspect of a person in comfortable circumstances and decently behaved but of a vulgar nature and destitute of early culture i think i should have taken him for a shoemaker accustomed to reflect in a rude strong evildisposed way on matters of this world and the next as he sat on his bench he said he had been residing in liverpool about six months and his business with me was to ask for a letter of introduction that should gain him admittance to the british museum he intending a visit to london he offered to refer me to respectable people for his character but i advised him to apply to mr dallas as the proper person for his purpose march st on the night of last wednesday week our house was broken into by robbers they entered by the back window of the breakfastroom which is the childrens schoolroom breaking or cutting a pane of glass so as to undo the fastening i have a dim idea of having heard a noise through my sleep but if so it did not more than slightly disturb me u heard it she being at watch with r and j having a cold was also wakeful and thought the noise was of servants moving about below neither did the idea of robbers occur to u j however hearing u at her mothers door asking for medicine for r called out for medicine for his cold and the thieves probably thought we were bestirring ourselves and so took flight in the morning the servants found the hall door and the breakfastroom window open some silver cups and some other trifles of plate were gone from the sideboard and there were tokens that the whole lower part of the house had been ransacked but the thieves had evidently gone off in a hurry leaving some articles which they would have taken had they been more at leisure we gave information to the police and an inspector and constable soon came to make investigations taking a list of the missing articles and informing themselves as to all particulars that could be known i did not much expect ever to hear any more of the stolen property but on sunday a constable came to request my presence at the policeoffice to identify the lost things the thieves had been caught in liverpool and some of the property found upon them and some of it at a pawnbrokers where they had pledged it the policeoffice is a small dark room in the basement story of the town hall of southport and over the mantelpiece hanging one upon another there are innumerable advertisements of robberies in houses and on the highway murders too and garrotings and offences of all sorts not only in this district but wide away and forwarded from other policestations bring thus aggregated together one realizes that there are a great many more offences than the public generally takes note of most of these advertisements were in pen and ink with minute lists of the articles stolen but the more important were in print and there too i saw the printed advertisement of our own robbery not for public circulation but to be handed about privately among policeofficers and pawnbrokers a rogue has a very poor chance in england the police being so numerous and their system so well organized in a corner of the policeoffice stood a contrivance for precisely measuring the heights of prisoners and i took occasion to measure j and found him four feet seven inches and a half high a set of rules for the selfgovernment of policeofficers was nailed on the door between twenty and thirty in number and composing a system of constabulary ethics the rules would be good for men in almost any walk of life and i rather think the policeofficers conform to them with tolerable strictness they appear to be subordinated to one another on the military plan the ordinary constable does not sit down in the presence of his inspector and this latter seems to be half a gentleman at least such is the bearing of our southport inspector who wears a handsome uniform of green and silver and salutes the principal inhabitants when meeting them in the street with an air of something like equality then again there is a superintendent who certainly claims the rank of a gentleman and has perhaps been an officer in the army the superintendent of this district was present on this occasion the thieves were brought down from liverpool on tuesday and examined in the town hall i had been notified to be present but as a matter of courtesy the policeofficers refrained from calling me as a witness the evidence of the servants being sufficient to identify the property the thieves were two young men not much over twenty james and john macdonald terribly shabby dirty jailbird like yet intelligent of aspect and one of them handsome the police knew them already and they seemed not much abashed by their position there were half a dozen magistrates on the bench idle old gentlemen of southport and the vicinity who lounged into the court more as a matter of amusement than anything else and lounged out again at their own pleasure for these magisterial duties are a part of the pastime of the country gentlemen of england they wore their hats on the bench there were one or two of them more active than their fellows but the real duty was done by the clerk of the court the seats within the bar were occupied by the witnesses and around the great table sat some of the more respectable people of southport and without the bar were the commonalty in great numbers for this is said to be the first burglary that has occurred here within the memory of man and so it has caused a great stir there seems to be a strong case against the prisoners a boy attached to the railway testified to having seen them at birchdale on wednesday afternoon and directed them on their way to southport peter pickup recognized them as having applied to him for lodgings in the course of that evening a pawnbroker swore to one of them as having offered my topcoat for sale or pledge in liverpool and my boots were found on the feet of one of them all this in addition to other circumstances of pregnant suspicion so they were committed for trial at the liverpool assizes to be holden some time in the present month i rather wished them to escape february th coming along the promenade a little before sunset i saw the mountains of the welsh coast shadowed very distinctly against the horizon mr channing told me that he had seen these mountains once or twice during his stay at southport but though constantly looking for them they have never before greeted my eyes in all the months that we have spent here it is said that the isle of man is likewise discernible occasionally but as the distance must be between sixty and seventy miles i should doubt it how misty is england i have spent four years in a gray gloom and yet it suits me pretty well to york april th at skipton my wife j and i left southport today for a short tour to york and its neighborhood the weather has been exceedingly disagreeable for weeks past but yesterday and today have been pleasant and we take advantage of the first glimpses of springlike weather we came by preston along a road that grew rather more interesting as we proceeded to this place which is about sixty miles from southport and where we arrived between five and six oclock first of all we got some tea and then as it was a pleasant sunset we set forth from our oldfashioned inn to take a walk skipton is an ancient town and has an ancient though wellrepaired aspect the houses being built of gray stone but in no picturesque shapes the streets well paved the site irregular and rising gradually towards skipton castle which overlooks the town as an old lordly castle ought to overlook the feudal village which it protects the castle was built shortly after the conquest by robert de romeli and was afterwards the property and residence of the famous cliffords we met an honest man as we approached the gateway who kindly encouraged us to apply for admittance notwithstanding it was good friday telling us how to find the housekeeper who would probably show us over the castle so we passed through the gate between two embattled towers and in the castle court we met a flock of young damsels who had been rambling about the precincts they likewise directed us in our search for the housekeeper and s being bolder than i in such assaults on feudal castles led the way down a dark archway and up an exterior stairway and knocking at a door immediately brought the housekeeper to a parley she proved to be a nowise awful personage but a homely neat kindly intelligent and middleaged body she seemed to be all alone in this great old castle and at once consented to show us about being no doubt glad to see any christian visitors the castle is now the property of sir r tufton but the present family do not make it their permanent residence and have only occasionally visited it indeed it could not well be made an eligible or comfortable residence according to modern ideas the rooms occupying the several stories of large round towers and looking gloomy and sombre if not dreary not the less so for what has been done to modernize them for instance modern paperhangings and in some of the rooms marble fireplaces they need a great deal more light and higher ceilings and i rather imagine that the warm rich effect of glowing tapestry is essential to keep ones spirit cheerful in these ancient rooms modern paperhangings are too superficial and wishywashy for the purpose tapestry it is true there is now completely covering the walls of several of the rooms but all faded into ghastliness nor could some of it have been otherwise than ghastly even in its newness for it represented persons suffering various kinds of torture with crowds of monks and nuns looking on in another room there was the story of solomon and the queen of sheba and other subjects not to be readily distinguished in the twilight that was gathering in these antique chambers we saw too some very old portraits of the cliffords and the thanets in black frames and the pictures themselves sadly faded and neglected the famous countess anne of pembroke dorset and montgomery was represented on one of the leaves of a pair of folding doors and one of her husbands i believe on the other leaf there was the picture of a little idiot lordling who had choked himself to death and a portrait of oliver cromwell who battered this old castle together with almost every other english or welsh castle that i ever saw or heard of the housekeeper pointed out the grove of trees where his cannon were planted during the siege there was but little furniture in the rooms amongst other articles an antique chair in which mary queen of scots is said to have rested the housekeeper next took us into the part of the castle which has never been modernized since it was repaired after the siege of cromwell this is a dismal series of cellars above ground with immensely thick walls letting in but scanty light and dim staircases of stone and a large hall with a vast fireplace where every particle of heat must needs have gone up chimney a chill and heartbreaking place enough quite in the midst of this part of the castle is the courtyard a space of some thirty or forty feet in length and breadth open to the sky but shut completely in on every side by the buildings of the castle and paved over with flat stones out of this pavement however grows a yewtree ascending to the tops of the towers and completely filling with its branches and foliage the whole open space between them some small birds quite a flock of them were twittering and fluttering among the upper branches we went upward through two or three stories of dismal rooms among others through the ancient guardroom till we came out on the roof of one of the towers and had a very fine view of an amphitheatre of ridgy hills which shut in and seclude the castle and the town the upper foliage was within our reach close to the parapet of the tower so we gathered a few twigs as memorials the housekeeper told us that the yewtree is supposed to be eight hundred years old and comparing it with other yews that i have seen i should judge that it must measure its antiquity by centuries at all events it still seems to be in its prime along the base of the castle on the opposite side to the entrance flows a stream sending up a pleasant murmur from among the trees the housekeeper said it was not a stream but only a wash whatever that may be and i conjecture that it creates the motivepower of some factorylooking edifices which we saw on our first arrival at skipton we now took our leave of the housekeeper and came homeward to our inn where i have written the foregoing pages by a bright fire but i think i write better descriptions after letting the subject lie in my mind a day or two it is too new to be properly dealt with immediately after coming from the scene the castle is not at all crumbly but in excellent repair though so venerable there are rooks cawing about the shapeless patches of their nests in the tops of the trees in the castle wall as well as in the round towers of the gateway there seem to be little tenements perhaps inhabited by the servants and dependants of the family they looked in very good order with tokens of present domesticity about them the whole of this old castle indeed was as neat as a new small dwelling in spite of an inevitable musty odor of antiquity april th this morning we took a carriage and two horses and set out for bolton priory a distance of about six miles the morning was cool with breezy clouds intermingled with sunshine and on the whole as good as are nine tenths of english mornings j sat beside the driver and s and i in the carriage all closed but one window as we drove through skipton the little town had a livelier aspect than yesterday when it wore its good fridays solemnity but now its marketplace was thronged principally with butchers displaying their meat under little movable penthouses and their customers the english people really like to think and talk of butchers meat and gaze at it with delight and they crowd through the avenues of the markethouses and stand enraptured round a dead ox we passed along by the castle wall and noticed the escutcheon of the cliffords or the thanets carved in stone over the portal with the motto desormais the application of which i do not well see these ancestral devices usually referring more to the past than to the future there is a large old church just at the extremity of the village and just below the castle on the slope of the hill the gray wall of the castle extends along the road a considerable distance in good repair with here and there a buttress and the semicircular bulge of a tower the scenery along the road was not particularly striking long slopes descending from ridges a generally hard outline of country with not many trees and those as yet destitute of foliage it needs to be softened with a good deal of wood there were stone farmhouses looking ancient and able to last till twice as old instead of the hedges so universal in other parts of england there were stone fences of good height and painful construction made of small stones which i suppose have been picked up out of the fields through hundreds of years they reminded me of old massachusetts though very unlike our rude stone walls which nevertheless last longer than anything else we build another new england feature was the little brooks which here and there flowed across our road rippling over the pebbles clear and bright i fancied too an intelligence and keenness in some of the yorkshire physiognomies akin to those characteristics in my countrymens faces we passed an ancient manygabled inn large low and comfortable bearing the name of the devonshire house as does our own hotel for the duke of devonshire is a great proprietor in these parts a mile or so beyond we came to a gateway broken through what i believe was an old wall of the priory grounds and here we alighted leaving our driver to take the carriage to the inn passing through this hole in the wall we saw the ruins of the priory at the bottom of the beautiful valley about a quarter of a mile off and well as the monks knew how to choose the sites of their establishments i think they never chose a better site than this in the green lap of protecting hills beside a stream and with peace and fertility looking down upon it on every side the view down the valley is very fine and for my part i am glad that some peaceable and comfortloving people possessed these precincts for many hundred years when nobody else knew how to appreciate peace and comfort the old gateway tower beneath which was formerly the arched entrance into the domain of the priory is now the central part of a huntingseat of the duke of devonshire and the edifice is completed by a wing of recent date on each side a few hundred yards from this huntingbox are the remains of the priory consisting of the nave of the old church which is still in good repair and used as the worshippingplace of the neighborhood being a perpetual curacy of the parish of skipton and the old ruined choir roofless with broken arches ivygrown but not so rich and rare a ruin as either melrose netley or furness its situation makes its charm it stands near the river wharfe a broad and rapid stream which hurries along between high banks with a sound which the monks must have found congenial to their slumberous moods it is a good river for trout too and i saw two or three anglers with their rods and baskets passing through the ruins towards its shore it was in this river wharfe that the boy of egremont was drowned at the strid a mile or two higher up the stream in the first place we rambled round the exterior of the ruins but as i have said they are rather bare and meagre in comparison with other abbeys and i am not sure that the especial care and neatness with which they are preserved does not lessen their effect on the beholder neglect wildness crumbling walls the climbing and conquering ivy masses of stone lying where they fell trees of old date growing where the pillars of the aisles used to stand these are the best points of ruined abbeys but everything here is kept with such trimness that it gives you the idea of a petrifaction decay is no longer triumphant the duke of devonshire has got the better of it the grounds around the church and the ruins are still used for burial and there are several flat tombstones and altar tombs with crosiers engraved or carved upon them which at first i took to be the memorials of bishops or abbots and wondered that the sculpture should still be so distinct on one however i read the date and the name of a layman for the tombstones were all modern the humid english atmosphere giving them their mossy look of antiquity and the crosier had been assumed only as a pretty device close beside the ruins there is a large old stone farmhouse which must have been built on the site of a part of the priory the cells dormitories refectory and other portions pertaining to the monks daily life i suppose and built no doubt with the sacred stones i should imagine it would be a haunted house swarming with cowled spectres we wished to see the interior of the church and procured a guide from this farmhouse the sexton probably a grayhaired ruddy cheery and intelligent man of familiar though respectful address the entrance of the church was undergoing improvement under the last of the abbots when the reformation occurred and it has ever remained in an unfinished state till now it is mossy with age and has a beautiful tuft of wallflowers growing on a ledge over the gothic arch of the doorway the body of the church is of much anterior date though the oaken roof is supposed to have been renewed in henry viiis time this as i said before was the nave of the old abbey church and has a onesided and unbalanced aspect there being only a single aisle with its row of sturdy pillars the pavement is covered with pews of old oak very homely and unornamental on the side opposite the aisle there are two or three windows of modern stained glass somewhat gaudy and impertinent there are likewise some hatchments and escutcheons over the altar and elsewhere on the whole it is not an impressive interior but at any rate it had the true musty odor which i never conceived of till i came to england the odor of dead mens decay garnered up and shut in and kept from generation to generation not disgusting nor sickening because it is so old and of the past on one side of the altar there was a small square chapel or what had once been a chapel separated from the chancel by a partition about a mans height if i remember aright our guide led us into it and observed that some years ago the pavement had been taken up in this spot for burial purposes but it was found that it had already been used in that way and that the corpses had been buried upright inquiring further i found that it was the clapham family and another that was called morley that were so buried and then it occurred to me that this was the vault wordsworth refers to in one of his poems the burialplace of the claphams and mauleverers whose skeletons for aught i know were even then standing upright under our feet it is but a narrow place perhaps a square of ten feet we saw little or nothing else that was memorable unless it were the signature of queen adelaide in a visitors book on our way back to skipton it rained and hailed but the sun again shone out before we arrived we took the train for leeds at half past ten and arrived there in the afternoon passing the ruined abbey of kirkstall on our way the ruins looked more interesting than those of bolton though not so delightfully situated and now in the close vicinity of manufactories and only two or three miles from leeds we took a dish of soup and spent a miserable hour in and about the railway station of leeds whence we departed at four and reached york in an hour or two we put up at the black swan and before tea went out on the cool bright edge of evening to get a glimpse of the cathedral which impressed me more grandly than when i first saw it nearly a year ago indeed almost any object gains upon me at the second sight i have spent the evening in writing up my journal an act of real virtue after walking round the cathedral we went up a narrow and crooked street very old and shabby but with an antique house projecting as much as a yard over the pavement on one side a timber house it seemed to be plastered over and stained yellow or buff there was no external door affording entrance into this edifice but about midway of its front we came to a low gothic stone archway passing right through the house and as it looked much timeworn and was sculptured with untraceable devices we went through there was an exceedingly antique battered and shattered pair of oaken leaves which used doubtless to shut up the passage in former times and keep it secure but for the last centuries probably there has been free ingress and egress indeed the portal arch may never have been closed since the reformation within we found a quadrangle of which the house upon the street formed one side the others being composed of ancient houses with gables in a row all looking upon the paved quadrangle through quaint windows of various fashion an elderly neat pleasantlooking woman now came in beneath the arch and as she had a look of being acquainted here we asked her what the place was and she told us that in the old popish times the prebends of the cathedral used to live here to keep them from doing mischief in the town the establishment she said was now called the college and was let in rooms and small tenements to poor people on consulting the york guide i find that her account was pretty correct the house having been founded in henry vis time and called st williams college the statue of the patron saint being sculptured over the arch it was intended for the residence of the parsons and priests of the cathedral who had formerly caused troubles and scandals by living in the town we returned to the front of the cathedral on our way homeward and an old man stopped us to inquire if we had ever seen the fiddler of york we answered in the negative and said that we had not time to see him now but the old gentleman pointed up to the highest pinnacle of the southern front where stood the fiddler of york one of those gothic quaintnesses which blotch the grandeur and solemnity of this and other cathedrals april th this morning was bleak and most ungenial a chilly sunshine a piercing wind a prevalence of watery cloud april weather without the tenderness that ought to be half revealed in it this is easter sunday and service at the cathedral commenced at half past ten so we set out betimes and found admittance into the vast nave and thence into the choir an attendant ushered s and j to a seat at a distance from me and then gave me a place in one of the stalls where the monks used to sit or kneel while chanting the services i think these stalls are now appropriated to the prebends they are of carved oaken wood much less elaborate and wonderfully wrought than those of chester cathedral where all was done with head and heart each a separate device instead of cut by machinery like this the whole effect of this carved work however lining the choir with its light tracery and pinnacles is very fine the whole choir from the roof downward except the old stones of the outer walls is of modern renovation it being but a few years since this part of the cathedral was destroyed by fire the arches and pillars and lofty roof however have been well restored and there was a vast east window full of painted glass which if it be modern is wonderfully chaste and gothiclike all the other windows have painted glass which does not flare and glare as if newly painted but the light whitewashed aspect of the general interior of the choir has a cold and dreary effect there is an enormous organ all clad in rich oaken carving of similar pattern to that of the stalls it was communion day and near the high altar within a screen i saw the glistening of the gold vessels wherewith the services were to be performed the choir was respectably filled with a pretty numerous congregation among whom i saw some officers in full dress with their swords by their sides and one old whitebearded warrior who sat near me seemed very devout at his religious exercises in front of me and on the corresponding benches on the other side of the choir sat two rows of whiterobed choristers twenty in all and these with some women performed the vocal part of the music it is not good to see musicians for they are sometimes coarse and vulgar people and so the auditor loses faith in any fine and spiritual tones that they may breathe forth the services of easter sunday comprehend more than the ordinary quantity of singing and chanting at all events nearly an hour and a half were thus employed with some intermixture of prayers and reading of scriptures and being almost congealed with cold i thought it would never come to an end the spirit of my puritan ancestors was mighty within me and i did not wonder at their being out of patience with all this mummery which seemed to me worse than papistry because it was a corruption of it at last a canon gave out the text and preached a sermon about twenty minutes long the coldest driest most superficial rubbish for this gorgeous setting of the magnificent cathedral the elaborate music and the rich ceremonies seem inevitably to take the life out of the sermon which to be anything must be all the puritans showed their strength of mind and heart by preferring a sermon an hour and a half long into which the preacher put his whole soul and lopping away all these externals into which religious life had first leafed and flowered and then petrified after the service while waiting for my wife in the nave i was accosted by a young gentleman who seemed to be an american and whom i have certainly seen before but whose name i could not recollect this he said was his first visit to york and he was evidently inclined to join me in viewing the curiosities of the place but not knowing his name i could not introduce him to my wife and so made a parting salute after dinner we set forth and took a promenade along the wall and a ramble through some of the crooked streets noting the old juttingstoried houses story above story and the old churches gnawed like a bone by the tooth of time till we came suddenly to the black swan before we expected it i rather fancy that i must have observed most of the external peculiarities at my former visit and therefore need not make another record of them in this journal in the course of our walk we saw a procession of about fifty charityschool boys in flat caps each with bands under his chin and a green collar to his coat all looking unjoyous and as if they had no home nor parents love they turned into a gateway which closed behind them and as the adjoining edifice seemed to be a public institution at least not private we asked what it was and found it to be a hospital or residence for old maiden ladies founded by a gentlewoman of york i know not whether she herself is of the sisterhood it must be a very singular institution and worthy of intimate study if it were possible to make ones way within the portal after writing the above j and i went out for another ramble before tea and taking a new course we came to a grated iron fence and gateway through which we could see the ruins of st marys abbey they are very extensive and situated quite in the midst of the city and the wall and then a tower of the abbey seem to border more than one of the streets our walk was interesting as it brought us unexpectedly upon several relics of antiquity a loopholed and battlemented gateway and at various points fragments of the old gothic stonework built in among more recent edifices which themselves were old grimness intermixed with quaintness and grotesqueness old fragments of religious or warlike architecture mingled with queer domestic structures the general effect sombre sordid and grimy but yet with a fascination that makes us fain to linger about such scenes and come to them again we passed round the cathedral and saw jackdaws fluttering round the pinnacles while the bells chimed the quarters and little children played on the steps under the grand arch of the entrance it is very stately very beautiful this minster and doubtless would be very satisfactory could i only know it long and well enough so rich as its front is even with almost all the niches empty of their statues not stern in its effect which i suppose must be owing to the elaborate detail with which its great surface is wrought all over like the chasing of a ladys jewelbox and yet so grand there is a dwellinghouse on one side gray with antiquity which has apparently grown out of it like an excrescence and though a goodsized edifice yet the cathedral is so large that its vastness is not in the least deformed by it if it be a dwellinghouse i suppose it is inhabited by the person who takes care of the cathedral this morning while listening to the tedious chanting and lukewarm sermon i depreciated the whole affair cathedral and all but now i do more justice at least to the latter and am only sorry that its noble echoes must follow at every syllable and rereverberate at the commas and semicolons such poor discourses as the canons but after all it was the puritans who made the sermon of such importance in religious worship as we newenglanders now consider it and we are absurd in considering this magnificent church and all those embroidered ceremonies only in reference to it before going back to the hotel i went again up the narrow and twisted passage of college street to take another glance at st williams college i underestimated the projection of the front over the street it is considerably more than three feet and is about eight or nine feet above the pavement the little statue of st william is an altorelievo over the arched entrance and has an escutcheon of arms on each side all much defaced in the interior of the quadrangle the houses have not gables nor peaked fronts but have peaked windows on the redtiled roofs the doorway opposite the entrancearch is rather stately and on one side is a large projecting window which is said to belong to the room where the printingpress of charles i was established in the days of the parliament the minster monday april th this morning was chill and worse it was showery so that our purposes to see york were much thwarted at about ten oclock however we took a cab and drove to the cathedral where we arrived while service was going on in the choir and ropes were put up as barriers between us and the nave so that we were limited to the south transept and a part of one of the aisles of the choir it was dismally cold we crept cheerlessly about within our narrow precincts narrow that is to say in proportion to the vast length and breadth of the cathedral gazing up into the hollow height of the central tower and looking at a monumental brass fastened against one of the pillars representing a beruffed lady of the tudor times and at the canopied tomb of archbishop de grey who ruled over the diocese in the thirteenth century then we went into the side aisle of the choir where there were one or two modern monuments and i was appalled to find that a sermon was being preached by the ecclesiastic of the day nor were there any signs of an imminent termination i am not aware that there was much pith in the discourse but there was certainly a good deal of labor and earnestness in the preachers mode of delivery although when he came to a close it appeared that the audience was not more than half a dozen people the barriers being now withdrawn we walked adown the length of the nave which did not seem to me so dim and vast as the recollection which i have had of it since my visit of a year ago but my preimaginations and my memories are both apt to play me false with all admirable things and so create disappointments for me while perhaps the thing itself is really far better than i imagine or remember it we engaged an old man one of the attendants pertaining to the cathedral to be our guide and he showed us first the stone screen in front of the choir with its sculptured kings of england and then the tombs in the north transept one of a modern archbishop and one of an ancient one behind which the insane person who set fire to the church a few years ago hid himself at nightfall then our guide unlocked a side door and led us into the chapterhouse an octagonal hall with a vaulted roof a tessellated floor and seven arched windows of old painted glass the richest that i ever saw or imagined each looking like an inestimable treasury of precious stories with a gleam and glow even in the sullen light of this gray morning what would they be with the sun shining through them with all their brilliancy moreover they were as soft as roseleaves i never saw any piece of human architecture so beautiful as this chapterhouse at least i thought so while i was looking at it and think so still and it owed its beauty in very great measure to the painted windows i remember looking at these windows from the outside yesterday and seeing nothing but an opaque old crust of conglomerated panes of glass but now that gloomy mystery was radiantly solved returning into the body of the cathedral we next entered the choir where instead of the crimson cushions and draperies which we had seen yesterday we found everything folded in black it was a token of mourning for one of the canons who died on saturday night the great east window seventyfive feet high and full of old painted glass in many exquisitely wrought and imagined scriptural designs is considered the most splendid object in the minster it is a pity that it is partially hidden from view even in the choir by a screen before the high altar but indeed the gothic architects seem first to imagine beautiful and noble things and then to consider how they may best be partially screened from sight a certain secrecy and twilight effect belong to their plan we next went round the side aisles of the choir which contain many interesting monuments of prelates and a specimen of the very common elizabethan design of an old gentleman in a double ruff and trunk breeches with one of his two wives on either side of him all kneeling in prayer and their conjoint children in two rows kneeling in the lower compartments of the tomb we saw too a rich marble monument of one of the strafford family and the tombstone of the famous earl himself a flat tombstone in the pavement of the aisle covering the vault where he was buried and with four iron rings fastened into the four corners of the stone whereby to lift it and now the guide led us into the vestry where there was a good fire burning in the grate and it really thawed my heart which was congealed with the dismal chill of the cathedral here we saw a good many curious things for instance two wooden figures in knightly armor which had stood sentinels beside the ancient clock before it was replaced by a modern one and opening a closet the guide produced an old iron helmet which had been found in a tomb where a knight had been buried in his armor and three gold rings and one brass one taken out of the graves and off the fingerbones of mediaeval archbishops one of them with a ruby set in it and two silvergilt chalices also treasures of the tombs and a wooden head carved in human likeness and painted to the life likewise taken from a grave where an archbishop was supposed to have been buried they found no veritable skull nor bones but only this blockhead as if death had betrayed the secret of what the poor prelate really was we saw too a canopy of cloth wrought with gold threads which had been borne over the head of king james i when he came to york on his way to receive the english crown there were also some old brass dishes in which pence used to be collected in monkish times over the door of this vestry were hung two banners of a yorkshire regiment tattered in the peninsular wars and inscribed with the names of the battles through which they had been borne triumphantly and waterloo was among them the vestry i think occupies that excrescential edifice which i noticed yesterday as having grown out of the cathedral after looking at these things we went down into the crypts under the choir these were very interesting as far as we could see them being more antique than anything above ground but as dark as any cellar there is here in the midst of these sepulchral crypts a spring of water said to be very pure and delicious owing to the limestone through which the rain that feeds its source is filtered near it is a stone trough in which the monks used to wash their hands i do not remember anything more that we saw at the cathedral and at noon we returned to the black swan the rain still continued so that s could not share in any more of my rambles but j and i went out again and discovered the guildhall it is a very ancient edifice of richard iis time and has a statue over the entrance which looks timegnawed enough to be of coeval antiquity although in reality it is only a representation of george ii in his royal robes we went in and found ourselves in a large and lofty hall with an oaken roof and a stone pavement and the farther end was partitioned off as a court of justice in that portion of the hall the judge was on the bench and a trial was going forward but in the hither portion a mob of people with their hats on were lounging and talking and enjoying the warmth of the stoves the window over the judgmentseat had painted glass in it and so i think had some of the hall windows at the end of the hall hung a great picture of paul defending himself before agrippa where the apostle looked like an athlete and had a remarkably bushy black beard between two of the windows hung an indian bell from burmah ponderously thick and massive both the picture and the bell had been presented to the city as tokens of affectionate remembrance by its children and it is pleasant to think that such failings exist in these old stable communities and that there are permanent localities where such gifts can be kept from generation to generation at four oclock we left the city of york still in a pouring rain the black swan where we had been staying is a good specimen of the old english inn sombre quiet with dark staircases dingy rooms curtained beds all the possibilities of a comfortable life and good english fare in a fashion which cannot have been much altered for half a century it is very homelike when one has ones family about him but must be prodigiously stupid for a solitary man we took the train for manchester over pretty much the same route that i travelled last year many of the higher hills in yorkshire were white with snow which in our lower region softened into rain but as we approached manchester the western sky reddened and gave promise of better weather we arrived at nearly eight oclock and put up at the palatine hotel in the evening i scrawled away at my journal till past ten oclock for i have really made it a matter of conscience to keep a tolerably full record of my travels though conscious that everything good escapes in the process in the morning we went out and visited the manchester cathedral a particularly black and grimy edifice containing some genuine old wood carvings within the choir we stayed a good while in order to see some people married one couple with their groomsman and bridesmaid were sitting within the choir but when the clergyman was robed and ready there entered five other couples each attended by groomsman and bridesmaid they all were of the lower orders one or two respectably dressed but most of them povertystricken the men in their ordinary loafers or laborers attire the women with their poor shabby shawls drawn closely about them faded untimely wrinkled with penury and care nothing fresh virginlike or hopeful about them joining themselves to their mates with the idea of making their own misery less intolerable by adding anothers to it all the six couple stood up in a row before the altar with the groomsmen and bridesmaids in a row behind them and the clergyman proceeded to marry them in such a way that it almost seemed to make every man and woman the husband and wife of every other however there were some small portions of the service directed towards each separate couple and they appeared to assort themselves in their own fashion afterwards each one saluting his bride with a kiss the clergyman the sexton and the clerk all seemed to find something funny in this affair and the woman who admitted us into the church smiled too when she told us that a weddingparty was waiting to be married but i think it was the saddest thing we have seen since leaving home though funny enough if one likes to look at it from a ludicrous point of view this mob of poor marriages was caused by the fact that no marriage fee is paid during easter this ended the memorable things of our tour for my wife and j left manchester for southport and i for liverpool before noon april th on the th having been invited to attend at the laying of the cornerstone of mr brownes free library i went to the town hall according to the programme at eleven oclock there was already a large number of people invited guests members of the historical society and other local associations assembled in the great hallroom and one of these was delivering an address to mr browne as i entered approaching the outer edge of the circle i was met and cordially greeted by monckton milnes whom i like and who always reminds me of longfellow though his physical man is more massive while we were talking together a young man approached him with a pretty little expression of surprise and pleasure at seeing him there he had a slightly affected or madeup manner and was rather a comely person mr milnes introduced him to me as lord hereupon of course i observed him more closely and i must say that i was not long in discovering a gentle dignity and halfimperceptible reserve in his manner but still my first impression was quite as real as my second one he occupies i suppose the foremost position among the young men of england and has the fairest prospects of a high course before him nevertheless he did not impress me as possessing the native qualities that could entitle him to a high public career he has adopted public life as his hereditary profession and makes the very utmost of all his abilities cultivating himself to a determined end knowing that he shall have every advantage towards attaining his object his natural disadvantages must have been in some respects unusually great his voice for instance is not strong and appeared to me to have a more positive defect than mere weakness doubtless he has struggled manfully against this defect and it made me feel a certain sympathy and indeed a friendliness for which he would not at all have thanked me had he known it i felt in his person what a burden it is upon human shoulders the necessity of keeping up the fame and historical importance of an illustrious house at least when the heir to its honors has sufficient intellect and sensibility to feel the claim that his country and his ancestors and his posterity all have upon him lordis fully capable of feeling these claims but i would not care methinks to take his position unless i could have considerably more than his strength in a little while we formed ourselves into a procession four in a row and set forth from the town hall through james street lord street lime street all the way through a line of policemen and a throng of people and all the windows were alive with heads and i never before was so conscious of a great mass of humanity though perhaps i may often have seen as great a crowd but a procession is the best point of view from which to see the crowd that collects together the day too was very fine even sunshiny and the streets dry a blessing which cannot be overestimated for we should have been in a strange trim for the banquet had we been compelled to wade through the ordinary mud of liverpool the procession itself could not have been a very striking object in america it would have had a hundred picturesque and perhaps ludicrous features the symbols of the different trades banners with strange devices flowershows children volunteer soldiers cavalcades and every suitable and unsuitable contrivance but we were merely a trail of ordinarylooking individuals in greatcoats and with precautionary umbrellas the only characteristic or professional costume as far as i noticed was that of the bishop of chester in his flat cap and blacksilk gown and that of sir henry smith the general of the district in full uniform with a star and half a dozen medals on his breast mr browne himself the hero of the day was the plainest and simplest man of all an exceedingly unpretending gentleman in black small whitehaired pale quiet and respectable i rather wondered why he chose to be the centre of all this ceremony for he did not seem either particularly to enjoy it or to be at all incommoded by it as a more nervous and susceptible man might have been the site of the projected edifice is on one of the streets bordering on st georges hall and when we came within the enclosure the cornerstone a large square of red freestone was already suspended over its destined place it has a brass plate let into it with an inscription which will perhaps not be seen again till the present english type has grown as antique as blackletter is now two or three photographs were now taken of the site the cornerstone mr browne the distinguished guests and the crowd at large then ensued a prayer from the bishop of chester and speeches from mr holme mr browne lord sir john pakington sir henry smith and as many others as there was time for lordacquitted himself very creditably though brought out unexpectedly and with evident reluctance i am convinced that men liable to be called on to address the public keep a constant supply of commonplaces in their minds which with little variation can be adapted to one subject about as well as to another and thus they are always ready to do well enough though seldom to do particularly well from the scene of the cornerstone we went to st georges hall where a drawingroom and dressingroom had been prepared for the principal guests before the banquet i had some conversation with sir james kay shuttleworth who had known miss bronte very intimately and bore testimony to the wonderful fidelity of mrs gaskells life of her he seemed to have had an affectionate regard for her and said that her marriage promised to have been productive of great happiness her husband being not a remarkable man but with the merit of an exceeding love for her mr browne now took me up into the gallery which by this time was full of ladies and thence we had a fine view of the noble hall with the tables laid in readiness for the banquet i cannot conceive of anything finer than this hall it needs nothing but painted windows to make it perfect and those i hope it may have one day or another at two oclock we sat down to the banquet which hardly justified that name being only a cold collation though sufficiently splendid in its way in truth it would have been impossible to provide a hot dinner for nine hundred people in a place remote from kitchens the principal table extended lengthwise of the hall and was a little elevated above the other tables which stretched across about twenty in all before each guest besides the bill of fare was laid a programme of the expected toasts among which appeared my own name to be proposed by mr monckton milnes these things do not trouble me quite as much as they used though still it sufficed to prevent much of the enjoyment which i might have had if i could have felt myself merely a spectator my lefthand neighbor was colonel campbell of the artillery my righthand one was mr picton of the library committee and i found them both companionable men especially the colonel who had served in china and in the crimea and owned that he hated the french we did not make a very long business of the eatables and then came the usual toasts of ceremony and afterwards those more peculiar to the occasion one of the first of which was the house of stanley to which lordresponded it was a noble subject giving scope for as much eloquence as any man could have brought to bear upon it and capable of being so wrought out as to develop and illustrate any sort of conservative or liberal tendencies which the speaker might entertain there could not be a richer opportunity for reconciling and making friends betwixt the old system of society and the new but lorddid not seem to make anything of it i remember nothing that he said excepting his statement that the family had been five hundred years connected with the town of liverpool i wish i could have responded to the house of stanley and his lordship could have spoken in my behalf none of the speeches were remarkably good the bishop of chesters perhaps the best though he is but a little man in aspect not at all filling up ones idea of a bishop and the rest were on an indistinguishable level though being all practised speakers they were less humy and hay than english orators ordinarily are i was really tired to death before my own turn came sitting all that time as it were on the scaffold with the rope round my neck at last monckton milnes was called up and made a speech of which to my dismay i could hardly hear a single word owing to his being at a considerable distance on the other side of the chairman and flinging his voice which is a bass one across the hall instead of adown it in my direction i could not distinguish one word of any allusions to my works nor even when he came to the toast did i hear the terms in which he put it nor whether i was toasted on my own basis or as representing american literature or as consul of the united states at all events there was a vast deal of clamor and uprose peers and bishop general mayor knights and gentlemen everybody in the hall greeting me with all the honors i had uprisen too to commence my speech but had to sit down again till matters grew more quiet and then i got up and proceeded to deliver myself with as much composure as i ever felt at my own fireside it is very strange this selfpossession and clearsightedness which i have experienced when standing before an audience showing me my way through all the difficulties resulting from my not having heard monckton milness speech and on since reading the latter i do not see how i could have answered it better my speech certainly was better cheered than any other especially one passage where i made a colossus of mr browne at which the audience grew so tumultuous in their applause that they drowned my figure of speech before it was half out of my mouth after rising from table lordand i talked about our respective oratorical performances and he appeared to have a perception that he is not naturally gifted in this respect i like lord and wish that it were possible that we might know one another better if a nobleman has any true friend out of his own class it ought to be a republican nothing further of interest happened at the banquet and the next morning came out the newspapers with the reports of my speech attributing to me a variety of forms of ragged nonsense which poor speaker as i am i was quite incapable of uttering may th the winter is over but as yet we scarcely have what ought to be called spring nothing but cold eastwinds accompanied with sunshine however as eastwinds generally are in this country all milder winds seem to bring rain the grass has been green for a month indeed it has never been entirely brown and now the trees and hedges are beginning to be in foliage weeks ago the daisies bloomed even in the sandy grassplot bordering on the promenade beneath our front windows and in the progress of the daisy and towards its consummation i saw the propriety of burnss epithet wee modest crimsonnipped flower its little white petals in the bud being fringed all round with crimson which fades into pure white when the flower blooms at the beginning of this month i saw fruittrees in blossom stretched out flat against stone walls reminding me of a dead bird nailed against the side of a barn but it has been a backward and dreary spring and i think southport in the course of it has lost its advantage over the rest of the liverpool neighborhood in point of milder atmosphere the eastwind feels even rawer here than in the city nevertheless the columns of the southport visitor begin to be well replenished with the names of guests and the town is assuming its aspect of summer life to say the truth except where cultivation has done its utmost there is very little difference between winter and summer in the mere material aspect of southport there being nothing but a waste of sand intermixed with plashy pools to seaward and a desert of sandhillocks on the land side but now the brown weatherhardened donkeywomen haunt people that stray along the reaches and delicate persons face the cold rasping illtempered blast on the promenade and children dig in the sands and for want of something better it seems to be determined that this shall be considered spring southport is as stupid a place as i ever lived in and i cannot but bewail our ill fortune to have been compelled to spend so many months on these barren sands when almost every other square yard of england contains something that would have been historically or poetically interesting our life here has been a blank there was indeed a shipwreck a month or two ago when a large ship came ashore within a mile from our windows the larger portion of the crew landing safely on the hither sands while six or seven betook themselves to the boat and were lost in attempting to gain the shore on the other side of the ribble after a lapse of several weeks two or three of their drowned bodies were found floating in this vicinity and brought to southport for burial so that it really is not at all improbable that miltons lycidas floated hereabouts in the rise and lapse of the tides and that his bones may still be whitening among the sands in the same gale that wrecked the abovementioned vessel a portion of a ships mast was driven ashore after evidently having been a very long time in and under water for it was covered with great barnacles and torn seaweed insomuch that there was scarcely a bare place along its whole length clusters of seaanemones were sticking to it and i know not what strange marine productions besides j at once recognized the seaanemones knowing them by his much reading of gosses aquarium and though they must now have been two or three days high and dry out of water he made an extempore aquarium out of a bowl and put in above a dozen of these strange creatures in a little while they bloomed out wonderfully and even seemed to produce young anemones but from some fault in his management they afterwards grew sickly and died s thinks that the old stormshattered mast so studded with the growth of the ocean depths is a relic of the spanish armada which strewed its wrecks along all the shores of england but i hardly think it would have taken three hundred years to produce this crop of barnacles and seaanemones a single summer might probably have done it yesterday we all of us except r went to liverpool to see the performances of an american circus company i had previously been a day or two before with j and had been happy to perceive that the fact of its being an american establishment really induced some slight swelling of the heart within me it is ridiculous enough to be sure but i like to find myself not wholly destitute of this noble weakness patriotism as for the circus i never was fond of that species of entertainment nor do i find in this one the flash and glitter and whirl which i remember in other american exhibitions here follow the visits to lincoln and boston printed in our old home ed may th we left boston by railway at noon and arrived in peterborough in about an hour and a quarter and have put up at the railway hotel after dinner we walked into the town to see the cathedral of the towers and arches of which we had already had a glimpse from our parlor window our journey from boston hitherward was through a perfectly level country the fens of lincolnshire green green and nothing else with old villages and farmhouses and old churchtowers very pleasant and rather wearisomely monotonous to return to peterborough it is a town of ancient aspect and we passed on our way towards the marketplace a very ancientlooking church with a very far projecting porch opening in front and on each side through arches of broad sweep the street by which we approached from our hotel led us into the marketplace which had what looked like an old guildhall on one side on the opposite side above the houses appeared the towers of the cathedral and a street leads from the marketplace to its front through an arched gateway which used to be the external entrance to the abbey i suppose of which the cathedral was formerly the church the front of the cathedral is very striking and unlike any other that i have seen being formed by three lofty and majestic arches in a row with three gable peaks above them forming a sort of colonnade within which is the western entrance of the nave the towers are massive but low in proportion to their bulk there are no spires but pinnacles and statues and all the rich detail of gothic architecture the whole of a venerable gray line it is in perfect repair and has not suffered externally except by the loss of multitudes of statues gargoyles and miscellaneous eccentricities of sculpture which used to smile frown laugh and weep over the faces of these old fabrics we entered through a side portal and sat down on a bench in the nave and kept ourselves quiet for the organ was sounding and the choristers were chanting in the choir the nave and transepts are very noble with clustered pillars and norman arches and a great height under the central tower the whole however being covered with plaster and whitewash except the roof which is of painted oak this latter adornment has the merit i believe of being veritably ancient but certainly i should prefer the oak of its native hue for the effect of the paint is to make it appear as if the ceiling were covered with imitation mosaicwork or an oilcloth carpet after sitting awhile we were invited by a verger who came from within the screen to enter the choir and hear the rest of the service we found the choristers there in their white garments and an audience of half a dozen people and had time to look at the interior of the choir all the carved woodwork of the tabernacle the bishops throne the prebends stalls and whatever else is modern for this cathedral seems to have suffered wofully from cromwells soldiers who hacked at the old oak and hammered and pounded upon the marble tombs till nothing of the first and very few of the latter remain it is wonderful how suddenly the english people lost their sense of the sanctity of all manner of externals in religion without losing their religion too the french in their revolution underwent as sudden a change but they became pagans and atheists and threw away the substance with the shadow i suspect that the interior arrangement of the choir and the chancel has been greatly modernized for it is quite unlike anything that i have seen elsewhere instead of one vast eastern window there are rows of windows lighting the lady chapel and seen through rows of arches in the screen of the chancel the effect being whoever is to have the credit of it very rich and beautiful there is i think no stained glass in the windows of the nave though in the windows of the chancel there is some of recent date and from fragments of veritable antique the effect of the whole interior is grand expansive and both ponderous and airy not dim mysterious and involved as gothic interiors often are the roundness and openness of the arches being opposed to this latter effect when the chanting came to a close one verger took his stand at the entrance of the choir and another stood farther up the aisle and then the door of a stall opened and forth came a clerical dignity of much breadth and substance aged and infirm and was ushered out of the choir with a great deal of ceremony we took him for the bishop but he proved to be only a canon we now engaged an attendant to show us through the lady chapel and the other penetralia which it did not take him long to accomplish one of the first things he showed us was the tombstone in the pavement of the southern aisle beneath which mary queen of scots had been originally buried and where she lay for a quarter of a century till borne to her present restingplace in westminster abbey it is a plain marble slab with no inscription near this there was a saxon monument of the date with sculpture in relief upon it the memorial of an abbot hedda who was killed by the danes when they destroyed the monastery that preceded the abbey and church i remember likewise the recumbent figure of the prelate whose face has been quite obliterated by puritanic violence and i think that there is not a single tomb older than the parliamentary wars which has not been in like manner battered and shattered except the saxon abbots just mentioned the most pretentious monument remaining is that of a mr deacon a gentleman of george is time in wig and breeches leaning on his elbow and resting one hand upon a skull in the north aisle precisely opposite to that of queen mary the attendant pointed out to us the slab beneath which lie the ashes of catharine of aragon the divorced queen of henry viii in the nave there was an ancient font a venerable and beautiful relic which has been repaired not long ago but in such a way as not to lessen its individuality this sacred vessel suffered especial indignity from cromwells soldiers insomuch that if anything could possibly destroy its sanctity they would have effected that bad end on the eastern wall of the nave and near the entrance hangs the picture of old scarlet the sexton who buried both mary of scotland and catharine of aragon and not only these two queens but everybody else in peterborough twice over i think one feels a sort of enmity and spite against these gravediggers who live so long and seem to contract a kindred and partnership with death being boon companions with him and taking his part against mankind in a chapel or some side apartment there were two pieces of tapestry wretchedly faded the handiwork of two nuns and copied from two of raphaels cartoons we now emerged from the cathedral and walked round its exterior admiring it to our utmost capacity and all the more because we had not heard of it beforehand and expected to see nothing so huge majestic grand and gray and of all the lovely closes that i ever beheld that of peterborough cathedral is to me the most delightful so quiet it is so solemnly and nobly cheerful so verdant so sweetly shadowed and so presided over by the stately minster and surrounded by ancient and comely habitations of christian men the most enchanting place the most enviable as a residence in all this world seemed to me that of the bishops secretary standing in the rear of the cathedral and bordering on the churchyard so that you pass through hallowed precincts in order to come at it and find it a paradise the holier and sweeter for the dead men who sleep so near we looked through the gateway into the lawn which really seemed hardly to belong to this world so bright and soft the sunshine was so fresh the grass so lovely the trees so trained and refined and mellowed down was the whole nature of the spot and so shut in and guarded from all intrusion it is in vain to write about it nowhere but in england can there be such a spot nor anywhere but in the close of peterborough cathedral may th i walked up into the town this morning and again visited the cathedral on the way i observed the falcon inn a very oldfashioned hostelry with a thatched roof and what looked like the barn door or stable door in a side front very likely it may have been an inn ever since queen elizabeths time the guildhall as i supposed it to be in the marketplace has a basement story entirely open on all sides but from its upper story it communicates with a large old house in the rear i have not seen an olderlooking town than peterborough but there is little that is picturesque about it except within the domain of the cathedral it was very fortunate for the beauty and antiquity of these precincts that henry viii did not suffer the monkish edifices of the abbey to be overthrown and utterly destroyed as was the case with so many abbeys at the reformation but converting the abbey church into a cathedral he preserved much of the other arrangement of the buildings connected with it and so it happens that to this day we have the massive and stately gateway with its great pointed arch still keeping out the world from those who have inherited the habitations of the old monks for though the gate is never closed one feels himself in a sacred seclusion the instant he passes under the archway and everywhere there are old houses that appear to have been adapted from the monkish residences or from their spacious offices and made into convenient dwellings for ecclesiastics or vergers or great or small people connected with the cathedral and with all modern comfort they still retain much of the quaintness of the olden time arches even rows of arcades pillars walls beautified with patches of gothic sculpture not wilfully put on by modern taste but lingering from a long past deep niches let into the fronts of houses and occupied by images of saints a growth of ivy overspreading walls and just allowing the windows to peep through so that no novelty nor anything of our hard ugly and actual life comes into these limits through the defences of the gateway without being mollified and modified except in some of the old colleges of oxford i have not seen any other place that impressed me in this way and the grounds of peterborough cathedral have the advantage over even the oxford colleges insomuch that the life is here domestic that of the family that of the affections a natural life which one deludes himself with imagining may be made into something sweeter and purer in this beautiful spot than anywhere else doubtless the inhabitants find it a stupid and tiresome place enough and get morbid and sulky and heavy and obtuse of head and heart with the monotony of their life but still i must needs believe that a man with a full mind and objects to employ his affection ought to be very happy here and perhaps the forms and appliances of human life are never fit to make people happy until they cease to be used for the purposes for which they were directly intended and are taken as it were in a sidelong application i mean that the monks probably never enjoyed their own edifices while they were a part of the actual life of the day so much as these present inhabitants now enjoy them when a new use has grown up apart from the original one towards noon we all walked into the town again and on our way went into the old church with the projecting portal which i mentioned yesterday a woman came hastening with the keys when she saw us looking up at the door the interior had an exceeding musty odor and was very ancient with side aisles opening by a row of pointed arches into the nave and a gallery of wood on each side and built across the two rows of arches it was paved with tombstones and i suppose the dead people contributed to the musty odor very naked and unadorned it was except with a few mural monuments of no great interest we stayed but a little while and amply rewarded the poor woman with a sixpence thence we proceeded to the cathedral pausing by the way to look at the old guildhall which is no longer a guildhall but a buttermarket and then we bought some prints of exterior and interior views of the minster of which there are a great variety on notepaper lettersheets large engravings and lithographs it is very beautiful there seems to be nothing better than to say this over again we found the doors most hospitably open and every part entirely free to us a kindness and liberality which we have nowhere else experienced in england whether as regards cathedrals or any other public buildings my wife sat down to draw the font and i walked through the lady chapel meanwhile pausing over the empty bed of queen mary and the grave of queen catharine and looking at the rich and sumptuous roof where a fountain as it were of groins of arches spouts from numberless pilasters intersecting one another in glorious intricacy under the central tower opening to either transept to the nave and to the choir are four majestic arches which i think must equal in height those of which i saw the ruins and one all but perfect at furness abbey they are about eighty feet high i may as well give up peterborough here though i hate to leave it undescribed even to the tufts of yellow flowers which grow on the projections high out of reach where the winds have sown their seeds in soil made by the aged decay of the edifice i could write a page too about the rooks or jackdaws that flit and clamor about the pinnacles and dart in and out of the eyeletholes the piercings whatever they are called in the turrets and buttresses on our way back to the hotel j saw an advertisement of some knights in armor that were to tilt today so he and i waited and by and by a procession appeared passing through the antique marketplace and in front of the abbey gateway which might have befitted the same spot three hundred years ago they were about twenty menatarms on horseback with lances and banners we were a little too near for the full enjoyment of the spectacle for though some of the armor was real i could not help observing that other suits were made of silver paper or gold tinsel a policeman a queer anomaly in reference to such a mediaeval spectacle told us that they were going to joust and run at the ring in a field a little beyond the bridge to nottingham may th we left peterborough this afternoon and however reluctant to leave the cathedral we were glad to get away from the hotel for though outwardly pretentious it is a wretched and uncomfortable place with scanty table poor attendance and enormous charges the first stage of our journey today was to grantham through a country the greater part of which was as level as the lincolnshire landscapes have been throughout our experience of them we saw several old villages gathered round their several churches and one of these little communities little byforth had a very primitive appearance a group of twenty or thirty dwellings of stone and thatch without a house among them that could be so modern as a hundred years it is a little wearisome to think of people living from century to century in the same spot going in and out of the same doors cultivating the same fields meeting the same faces and marrying one another over and over again and going to the same church and lying down in the same churchyard to appear again and go through the same monotonous round in the next generation at grantham our route branches off from the main line and there was a delay of about an hour during which we walked up into the town to take a nearer view of a tall gray steeple which we saw from the railway station the streets that led from the station were poor and commonplace and indeed a railway seems to have the effect of making its own vicinity mean we noticed nothing remarkable until we got to the marketplace in the centre of which there is a cross doubtless of great antiquity though it is in too good condition not to have been recently repaired it consists of an upright pillar with a pedestal of half a dozen stone steps which are worn hollow by the many feet that have scraped their hobnailed shoes upon them among these feet it is highly probable may have been those of sir isaac newton who was a scholar of the free school of this town and when j scampered up the steps we told him so visible from the marketplace also stands the angel inn which seems to be a wonderfully old inn being adorned with gargoyles and other antique sculpture with projecting windows and an arched entrance and presenting altogether a frontispiece of so much venerable state that i feel curious to know its history had i been aware that the chief hotel of grantham were such a timehonored establishment i should have arranged to pass the night there especially as there were interesting objects enough in the town to occupy us pleasantly the church the steeple of which is seen over the marketplace but is removed from it by a street or two is very fine the tower and spire being adorned with arches canopies and niches twelve of the latter for the twelve apostles all of whom have now vanished and with fragments of other gothic ornaments the jackdaws have taken up their abodes in the crevices and crannies of the upper half of the steeple we left grantham at nearly seven and reached nottingham just before eight the castle situated on a high and precipitous rock directly over the edge of which look the walls was visible as we drove from the station to our hotel we followed the advice of a railway attendant in going first to the may pole which proved to be a commercial inn with the air of a drinkingshop in a byalley and furthermore they could not take us in so we drove to the george the fourth which seems to be an excellent house and here i have remained quiet the size of the town discouraging me from going out in the twilight which was fast coming on after tea these are glorious long days for travel daylight fairly between four in the morning and nine at night and a margin of twilight on either side may th after breakfast this morning i wandered out and lost myself but at last found the postoffice and a letter from mr wilding with some perplexing intelligence nottingham is an unlovely and uninteresting town the castle i did not see but i happened upon a large and stately old church almost cathedralic in its dimensions on returning to the hotel we deliberated on the mode of getting to newstead abbey and we finally decided upon taking a fly in which conveyance accordingly we set out before twelve it was a slightly overcast day about half intermixed of shade and sunshine and rather cool but not so cool that we could exactly wish it warmer our drive to newstead lay through what was once a portion of sherwood forest though all of it i believe has now become private property and is converted into fertile fields except where the owners of estates have set out plantations we have now passed out of the fencountry and the land rises and falls in gentle swells presenting a pleasant but not striking character of scenery i remember no remarkable object on the road here and there an old inn a gentlemans seat of moderate pretension a great deal of tall and continued hedge a quiet english greenness and rurality till drawing near newstead abbey we began to see copious plantations principally of firs larches and trees of that order looking very sombre though with some intermingling of lighter foliage it was after one when we reached the hut a small modern wayside inn almost directly across the road from the entrancegate of newstead the postboy calls the distance ten miles from nottingham he also averred that it was forbidden to drive visitors within the gates so we left the fly at the inn and set out to walk from the entrance to the house there is no porters lodge and the grounds in this outlying region had not the appearance of being very primly kept but were well wooded with evergreens and much overgrown with ferns serving for cover for hares which scampered in and out of their hidingplaces the road went winding gently along and at the distance of nearly a mile brought us to a second gate through which we likewise passed and walked onward a good way farther seeing much wood but as yet nothing of the abbey at last through the trees we caught a glimpse of its battlements and saw too the gleam of water and then appeared the abbeys venerable front it comprises the western wall of the church which is all that remains of that fabric a great central window entirely empty without tracery or mullions the ivy clambering up on the inside of the wall and hanging over in front the front of the inhabited part of the house extends along on a line with this church wall rather low with battlements along its top and all in good keeping with the ruinous remnant we met a servant who replied civilly to our inquiries about the mode of gaining admittance and bade us ring a bell at the corner of the principal porch we rang accordingly and were forthwith admitted into a low vaulted basement ponderously wrought with intersecting arches dark and rather chilly just like what i remember to have seen at battle abbey and after waiting here a little while a respectable elderly gentlewoman appeared of whom we requested to be shown round the abbey she courteously acceded first presenting us to a book in which to inscribe our names i suppose ten thousand people three fourths of them americans have written descriptions of newstead abbey and none of them so far as i have read give any true idea of the place neither will my description if i write one in fact i forget very much that i saw and especially in what order the objects came in the basement was byrons bath a dark and cold and cellarlike hole which it must have required good courage to plunge into in this region too or near it was the chapel which colonel wildman has decorously fitted up and where service is now regularly performed but which was used as a dogs kennel in byrons time after seeing this we were led to byrons own bedchamber which remains just as when he slept in it the furniture and all the other arrangements being religiously preserved it was in the plainest possible style homely indeed and almost mean an ordinary paperhanging and everything so commonplace that it was only the deep embrasure of the window that made it look unlike a bedchamber in a middlingclass lodginghouse it would have seemed difficult beforehand to fit up a room in that picturesque old edifice so that it should be utterly void of picturesqueness but it was effected in this apartment and i suppose it is a specimen of the way in which old mansions used to be robbed of their antique character and adapted to modern tastes before mediaeval antiquities came into fashion some prints of the cambridge colleges and other pictures indicating byrons predilections at the time and which he himself had hung there were on the walls this the housekeeper told us had been the abbots chamber in the monastic time adjoining it is the haunted room where the ghostly monk whom byron introduces into don juan is said to have his lurkingplace it is fitted up in the same style as byrons and used to be occupied by his valet or page no doubt in his lordships day these were the only comfortable bedrooms in the abbey and by the housekeepers account of what colonel wildman has done it is to be inferred that the place must have been in a most wild shaggy tumbledown condition inside and out when he bought it it is very different now after showing us these two apartments of byron and his servant the housekeeper led us from one to another and another magnificent chamber fitted up in antique style with oak panelling and heavily carved bedsteads of queen elizabeths time or of the stuarts hung with rich tapestry curtains of similar date and with beautiful old cabinets of carved wood sculptured in relief or tortoiseshell and ivory the very pictures and realities these rooms were of stately comfort and they were called by the name of kings king edwards king charles iis king henry viis chamber and they were hung with beautiful pictures many of them portraits of these kings the chimneypieces were carved and emblazoned and all so far as i could judge was in perfect keeping so that if a prince or noble of three centuries ago were to come to lodge at newstead abbey he would hardly know that he had strayed out of his own century and yet he might have known by some token for there are volumes of poetry and light literature on the tables in these royal bedchambers and in that of henry vii i saw the house of the seven gables and the scarlet letter in routledges edition certainly the house is admirably fitted up and there must have been something very excellent and comprehensive in the domestic arrangements of the monks since they adapt themselves so well to a state of society entirely different from that in which they originated the library is a very comfortable room and provocative of studious ideas though lounging and luxurious it is long and rather low furnished with soft couches and on the whole though a man might dream of study i think he would be most likely to read nothing but novels there i know not what the room was in monkish times but it was waste and ruinous in lord byrons here i think the housekeeper unlocked a beautiful cabinet and took out the famous skull which lord byron transformed into a drinkinggoblet it has a silver rim and stand but still the ugly skull is bare and evident and the naked inner bone receives the wine i should think it would hold at least a quart enough to overpower any living head into which this deathshead should transfer its contents and a man must be either very drunk or very thirsty before he would taste wine out of such a goblet i think byrons freak was outdone by that of a cousin of my own who once solemnly assured me that he had a spittoon made out of the skull of his enemy the ancient coffin in which the gobletskull was found was shown us in the basement of the abbey there was much more to see in the house than i had any previous notion of but except the two chambers already noticed nothing remained the least as byron left it yes another place there was his own small diningroom with a table of moderate size where no doubt the skullgoblet has often gone its rounds colonel wildmans diningroom was once byrons shootinggallery and the original refectory of the monks it is now magnificently arranged with a vaulted roof a musicgallery at one end suits of armor and weapons on the walls and mailed arms extended holding candelabras there are one or two painted windows commemorative of the peninsular war and the battles in which the colonel and his two brothers fought for these wildmen seem to have been mighty troopers and colonel wildman is represented as a fiercelooking mustachioed hussar at two different ages the housekeeper spoke of him affectionately but says that he is now getting into years and that they fancy him failing he has no children he appears to have been on good terms with byron and had the latter ever returned to england he was under promise to make his first visit to his old home and it was in such an expectation that colonel wildman had kept byrons private apartments in the same condition in which he found them byron was informed of all the colonels fittings up and restorations and when he introduces the abbey in don juan the poet describes it not as he himself left it but as colonel wildman has restored it there is a beautiful drawingroom and all these apartments are adorned with pictures the collection being especially rich in portraits by sir peter lely that of nell gwynn being one who is one of the few beautiful women whom i have seen on canvas we parted with the housekeeper and i with a good many shillings at the door by which we entered and our next business was to see the private grounds and gardens a little boy attended us through the first part of our progress but soon appeared the veritable gardener a shrewd and sensible old man who has been very many years on the place there was nothing of special interest as concerning byron until we entered the original old monkish garden which is still laid out in the same fashion as the monks left it with a large oblong piece of water in the centre and terraced banks rising at two or three different stages with perfect regularity around it so that the sheet of water looks like the plate of an immense lookingglass of which the terraces form the frame it seems as if were there any giant large enough he might raise up this mirror and set it on end in the monks garden there is a marble statue of pan which the gardener told us was brought by the wicked lord greatuncle of byron from italy and was supposed by the country people to represent the devil and to be the object of his worship a natural idea enough in view of his horns and cloven feet and tail though this indicates at all events a very jolly devil there is also a female statue beautiful from the waist upward but shaggy and clovenfooted below and holding a little clovenfooted child by the hand this the old gardener assured us was pandora wife of the abovementioned pan with her son not far from this spot we came to the tree on which byron carved his own name and that of his sister augusta it is a tree of twin stems a birchtree i think growing up side by side one of the stems still lives and flourishes but that on which he carved the two names is quite dead as if there had been something fatal in the inscription that has made it forever famous the names are still very legible although the letters had been closed up by the growth of the bark before the tree died they must have been deeply cut at first there are old yewtrees of unknown antiquity in this garden and many other interesting things and among them may be reckoned a fountain of very pure water called the holy well of which we drank there are several fountains besides the large mirror in the centre of the garden and these are mostly inhabited by carp the genuine descendants of those which peopled the fishponds in the days of the monks coming in front of the abbey the gardener showed us the oak that byron planted now a vigorous young tree and the monument which he erected to his newfoundland dog and which is larger than most christians get being composed of a marble altarshaped tomb surrounded by a circular area of steps as much as twenty feet in diameter the gardener said however that byron intended this not merely as the burialplace of his dog but for himself too and his sister i know not how this may have been but this inconvenience would have attended his being buried there that on transfer of the estate his mortal remains would have become the property of some other man we had now come to the empty space a smooth green lawn where had once been the abbey church the length had been sixtyfour yards the gardener said and within his remembrance there had been many remains of it but now they are quite removed with the exception of the one ivygrown western wall which as i mentioned forms a picturesque part of the present front of the abbey through a door in this wall the gardener now let us out in the evening our landlady who seems to be a very intelligent woman of a superior class to most landladies came into our parlor while i was out and talked about the present race of byrons and lovelaces who have often been at this house there seems to be a taint in the byron blood which makes those who inherit it wicked mad and miserable even colonel wildman comes in for a share of this ill luck for he has almost ruined himself by his expenditure on the estate and by his lavish hospitality especially to the duke of sussex who liked the colonel and used often to visit him during his lifetime and his royal highnesss gentlemen ate and drank colonel wildman almost up so says our good landlady at any rate looking at this miserable race of byrons who held the estate so long and at colonel wildman whom it has ruined in forty years we might see grounds for believing in the evil fate which is supposed to attend confiscated church property nevertheless i would accept the estate were it offered me glancing back i see that i have omitted some items that were curious in describing the house for instance one of the cabinets had been the personal property of queen elizabeth it seems to me that the fashion of modern furniture has nothing to equal these old cabinets for beauty and convenience in the state apartments the floors were so highly waxed and polished that we slid on them as if on ice and could only make sure of our footing by treading on strips of carpeting that were laid down june th we left nottingham a week ago and made our first stage to derby where we had to wait an hour or two at a great bustling pellmell crowded railway station it was much thronged with second and third class passengers coming and departing in continual trains for these were the whitsuntide holidays which set all the lower orders of english people astir this time of festival was evidently the origin of the old election holidays in massachusetts the latter occurring at the same period of the year and being celebrated so long as they could be so in very much the same way with games idleness merriment of set purpose and drunkenness after a weary while we took the train for matlock via ambergate and arrived of the former place late in the afternoon the village of matlock is situated on the banks of the derwent in a delightful little nook among the hills which rise above it in steeps and in precipitous crags and shut out the world so effectually that i wonder how the railway ever found it out indeed it does make its approach to this region through a long tunnel it was a beautiful sunny afternoon when we arrived and my present impressions are that i have never seen anywhere else such exquisite scenery as that which surrounds the village the street itself to be sure is commonplace enough and hot dusty and disagreeable but if you look above it or on either side there are green hills descending abruptly down and softened with woods amid which are seen villas cottages castles and beyond the river is a line of crags perhaps three hundred feet high clothed with shrubbery in some parts from top to bottom but in other places presenting a sheer precipice of rock over which tumbles as it were a cascade of ivy and creeping plants it is very beautiful and i might almost say very wild but it has those characteristics of finish and of being redeemed from nature and converted into a portion of the adornment of a great garden which i find in all english scenery not that i complain of this on the contrary there is nothing that delights an american more in contrast with the roughness and ruggedness of his native scenes to which also he might be glad to return after a while we put up at the old bath hotel an immense house with passages of such extent that at first it seemed almost a days journey from parlor to bedroom the house stands on a declivity and after ascending one pair of stairs we came in travelling along the passageway to a door that opened upon a beautifully arranged garden with arbors and grottos and the hillside rising steep above during all the time of our stay at matlock there was brilliant sunshine and the grass and foliage being in their freshest and most luxuriant phase the place has left as bright a picture as i have anywhere in my memory the morning after our arrival we took a walk and following the sound of a churchbell entered what appeared to be a park and passing along a road at the base of a line of crags soon came in sight of a beautiful church i rather imagine it to be the place of worship of the arkwright family whose seat is in this vicinity the descendants of the famous arkwright who contributed so much towards turning england into a cotton manufactory we did not enter the church but passed beyond it and over a bridge and along a road that ascended among the hills and finally brought us out by a circuit to the other end of matlock village after a walk of three or four miles in the afternoon we took a boat across the derwent a passage which half a dozen strokes of the oars accomplished and reached a very pleasant seclusion called the lovers walk a ferriage of twopence pays for the transit across the river and gives the freedom of these grounds which are threaded with paths that meander and zigzag to the top of the precipitous ridge amid trees and shrubbery and the occasional ease of rustic seats it is a sweet walk for lovers and was so for us although j with his scramblings and disappearances and shouts from above and headlong scamperings down the precipitous paths occasionally frightened his mother after gaining the heights the path skirts along the precipice allowing us to see down into the village street and nearer the derwent winding through the valley so close beneath us that we might have flung a stone into it these crags would be very rude and harsh if left to themselves but they are quite softened and made sweet and tender by the great deal of foliage that clothes their sides and creeps and clambers over them only letting a stern face of rock be seen here and there and with a smile rather than a frown the next day monday we went to see the grand cavern the entrance is high up on the hillside whither we were led by a guide of whom there are many and they all pay tribute to the proprietor of the cavern there is a small shed by the side of the cavern mouth where the guide provided himself and us with tallow candles and then led us into the darksome and ugly pit the entrance of which is not very imposing for it has a door of rough pine boards and is kept under lock and key this is the disagreeable phaseone of the disagreeable phases of mans conquest over nature in england cavern mouths shut up with cellar doors cataracts under lock and key precipitous crags compelled to figure in ornamented gardens and all accessible at a fixed amount of shillings or pence it is not possible to draw a full free breath under such circumstances when you think of it it makes the wildest scenery look like the artificial rockwork which englishmen are so fond of displaying in the little bit of grassplot under their suburban parlor windows however the cavern was dreary enough and wild enough though in a mean sort of way for it is but a long series of passages and crevices generally so narrow that you scrape your elbows and so low that you hit your head it has nowhere a lofty height though sometimes it broadens out into ample space but not into grandeur the roof being always within reach and in most places smoky with the tallow candles that have been held up to it a very dirty sordid disagreeable burrow more like a cellar gone mad than anything else but it served to show us how the crust of the earth is moulded this cavern was known to the romans and used to be worked by them as a leadmine derbyshire spar is now taken from it and in some of its crevices the gleam of the tallow candles is faintly reflected from the crystallizations but on the whole i felt like a mole as i went creeping along and was glad when we came into the sunshine again i rather think my idea of a cavern is taken from the one in the forty thieves or in gil blas a vast hollow womb roofed and curtained with obscurity this reality is very mean leaving the cavern we went to the guides cottage situated high above the village where he showed us specimens of ornaments and toys manufactured by himself from derbyshire spar and other materials there was very pretty mosaic work flowers of spar and leaves of malachite and miniature copies of cleopatras needle and other egyptian monuments and vases of graceful pattern brooches too and many other things the most valuable spar is called blue john and is only to be found in one spot where also the supply is said to be growing scant we bought a number of articles and then came homeward still with our guide who showed us on the way the romantic rocks these are some crags which have been rent away and stand insulated from the hillside affording a pathway between it and then while the places can yet be seen where the sundered rocks would fit into the craggy hill if there were but a titan strong enough to adjust them again it is a very picturesque spot and the price for seeing it is twopence though in our case it was included in the four shillings which we had paid for seeing the cavern the representative men of england are the showmen and the policemen both very good people in their way returning to the hotel j and his mother went through the village to the river near the railway where j set himself to fishing and caught three minnows i followed after a while to fetch them back and we called into one or two of the many shops in the village which have articles manufactured of the spar for sale some of these are nothing short of magnificent there was an inlaid table valued at sixty guineas and a splendid ornament for any drawingroom another inlaid with the squares of a chessboard we heard of a table in the possession of the marquis of westminster the value of which is three hundred guineas it would be easy and pleasant to spend a great deal of money in such things as we saw there but all our purchases in matlock did not amount to more than twenty shillings invested in brooches shawlpins little vases and toys which will be valuable to us as memorials on the other side of the water after this we visited a petrifying cave of which there are several hereabouts the process of petrifaction requires some months or perhaps a year or two varying with the size of the article to be operated upon the articles are placed in the cave under the drippings from the roof and a hard deposit is formed upon them and sometimes as in the case of a birdsnest causes a curious result every straw and hair being immortalized and stiffened into stone a horses head was in process of petrifaction and j bought a broken eggshell for a penny though larger articles are expensive the process would appear to be entirely superficial a mere crust on the outside of things but we saw some specimens of petrified oak where the stony substance seemed to be intimately incorporated with the wood and to have really changed it into stone these specimens were immensely ponderous and capable of a high polish which brought out beautiful streaks and shades one might spend a very pleasant summer in matlock and i think there can be no more beautiful place in the world but we left it that afternoon and railed to manchester where we arrived between ten and eleven at night the next day i left s to go to the art exhibition and took j with me to liverpool where i had an engagement that admitted of no delay thus ended our tour in which we had seen but a little bit of england yet rich with variety and interest what a wonderful land it is our forefathers land our land for i will not give up such a precious inheritance we are now back again in flat and sandy southport which during the past week has been thronged with whitsuntide people who crowd the streets and pass to and fro along the promenade with a universal and monotonous air of nothing to do and very little enjoyment it is a pity that poor folks cannot employ their little hour of leisure to better advantage in a country where the soil is so veined with gold these are delightfully long days last night at half past nine i could read with perfect ease in parts of the room remote from the window and at nearly half past eleven there was a broad sheet of daylight in the west gleaming brightly over the plashy sands i question whether there be any total night at this season june st southport i presume is now in its most vivid aspect there being a multitude of visitors here principally of the middling classes and a frequent crowd whom i take to be workingpeople from manchester and other factory towns it is the strangest place to come to for the pleasures of the sea of which we scarcely have a glimpse from months end to mouths end nor any fresh exhilarating breath from it but a lazy languid atmosphere brooding over the waste of sands or even if there be a sulky and bitter wind blowing along the promenade it still brings no salt elixir i never was more weary of a place in all my life and never felt such a disinterested pity as for the people who come here for pleasure nevertheless the town has its amusements in the first place the daylong and perennial one of donkeyriding along the sands large parties of men and girls pottering along together the flying dutchman trundles hither and thither when there is breeze enough an arch cryman sets up his targets on the beach the bathinghouses stand by scores and fifties along the shore and likewise on the banks of the ribble a mile seaward the hotels have their billiardrooms there is a theatre every evening from morning till night comes a succession of organgrinders playing interminably under your window and a man with a bassoon and a monkey who takes your pennies and pulls off his cap in acknowledgment and wandering minstrels with guitar and voice and a highland bagpipe squealing out a tangled skein of discord together with a highland maid who dances a hornpipe and punch and judy in a word we have specimens of all manner of vagrancy that infests england in these long days and long and pleasant ones the promenade is at its liveliest about nine oclock which is but just after sundown and our little r finds it difficult to go to sleep amid so much music as comes to her ears from bassoon bagpipe organ guitar and now and then a military band one feature of the place is the sick and infirm people whom we see dragged along in bathchairs or dragging their own limbs languidly or sitting on benches or meeting in the streets and making acquaintance on the strength of mutual maladies pale men leaning on their ruddy wives cripples three or four together in a ring and planting their crutches in the centre i dont remember whether i have ever mentioned among the notabilities of southport the town crier a meeklooking old man who sings out his messages in a most doleful tone as if he took his title in a literal sense and were really going to cry or crying in the worlds behalf one other stroller a foreigner with a dog shaggy round the head and shoulders and closely shaven behind the poor little beast jumped through hoops ran about on two legs of one side danced on its hind legs or on its fore paws with its hind ones straight up in the air all the time keeping a watch on his masters eye and evidently mindful of many a beating june th the warsteamer niagara came up the mersey a few days since and day before yesterday captain hudson called at my office a somewhat meagre elderly gentleman of simple and hearty manners and address having his purser mr eldredge with him who i think rather prides himself upon having a napoleonic profile the captain is an old acquaintance of mrs blodgett and has cone ashore principally with a view to calling on her so after we had left our cards for the mayor i showed these naval gentlemen the way to her house mrs blodgett and miss wwere prodigiously glad to see him and they all three began to talk of old times and old acquaintances for when mrs blodgett was a rich lady at gibraltar she used to have the whole navylist at her table young midshipmen and lieutenants then perhaps but old gouty paralytic commodores now if still even partly alive it was arranged that mrs blodgett with as many of the ladies of her family as she chose to bring should accompany me on my official visit to the ship the next day and yesterday we went accordingly mrs blodgett miss w and six or seven american captains wives their husbands following in another boat i know too little of ships to describe one or even to feel any great interest in the details of this or of any other ship but the nautical people seemed to see much to admire she lay in the sloyne in the midst of a broad basin of the mersey with a pleasant landscape of green england now warm with summer sunshine on either side with churches and villa residences and suburban and rural beauty the officers of the ship are gentlemanly men externally very well mannered although not polished and refined to any considerable extent at least i have not found naval men so in general but still it is pleasant to see americans who are not stirred by such motives as usually interest our countrymen no hope nor desire of growing rich but planting their claims to respectability on other grounds and therefore acquiring a certain nobleness whether it be inherent in their nature or no it always seems to me they look down upon civilians with quiet and not illnatured scorn which one has the choice of smiling or being provoked at it is not a true life which they lead but shallow and aimless and unsatisfactory it must be to the better minds among them nor do they appear to profit by what would seem the advantages presented to them in their worldwide though not worlddeep experience they get to be very clannish too after seeing the ship we landed all of us ladies and captain and went to the gardens of the rock ferry hotel where j and i stayed behind the rest to scotland june th on the th my wife j and i left southport taking the train for preston and as we had to stop an hour or two before starting for carlisle i walked up into the town the street through which most of my walk lay was brickbuilt lively bustling and not particularly noteworthy but turning a little way down another street the town had a more ancient aspect the day was intensely hot the sun lying bright and broad as ever i remember it in an american city so that i was glad to get back again to the shade and shelter of the station the heat and dust moreover made our journey to carlisle very uncomfortable it was through very pretty and sometimes picturesque scenery being on the confines of the hillcountry which we could see on our left dim and blue and likewise we had a refreshing breath from the sea in passing along the verge of morecambe bay we reached carlisle at about five oclock and after taking tea at the bush hotel set forth to look at the town the notable objects were a castle and a cathedral and we first found our way to the castle which stands on elevated ground on the side of the city towards scotland a broad wellconstructed path winds round the castle at the base of the wall on the verge of a steep descent to the plain beneath through which winds the river eden along this path we walked quite round the castle a circuit of perhaps half a mile pleasant being shaded by the castles height and by the foliage of trees the walls have been so much rebuilt and restored that it is only here and there that we see an old buttress or a few timeworn stones intermixed with the new facing with which the aged substance is overlaid the material is red freestone which seems to be very abundant in this part of the country we found no entrance to the castle till the path had led us from the free and airy country into a very mean part of the town where the wretched old houses thrust themselves between us and the castle wall and then passing through a narrow street we walked up what appeared like a bylane and the portal of the castle was before us there was a sentrybox just within the gate and a sentinel was on guard for carlisle castle is a national fortress and has usually been a depot for arms and ammunition the sergeant or corporal of the guard sat reading within the gateway and on my request for admittance he civilly appointed one of the soldiers to conduct us to the castle as i recollect the chief gateway of the castle with the guardroom in the thickness of the wall is situated some twenty yards behind the first entrance where we met the sentinel it was an intelligent young soldier who showed as round the castle and very civil as i always find soldiers to be he had not anything particularly interesting to show nor very much to say about it and what be did say so far as it referred to the history of the castle was probably apocryphal the castle has an inner and outer ward on the descent of the hill and included within the circuit of the exterior wall having been always occupied by soldiers it has not been permitted to assume the picturesque aspect of a ruin but the buildings of the interior have either been constantly repaired as they required it or have been taken down when past repair we saw a small part of the tower where mary queen of scots was confined on her first coming to england these remains consist only of a portion of a winding stone staircase at which we glanced through a window the keep is very large and massive and no doubt old in its inner substance we ascended to the castle walls and looked out over the river towards the scottish hills which are visible in the distance the scottish border being not more than eight or nine miles off carlisle castle has stood many sieges and witnessed many battles under its walls there are now on its ramparts only some half a dozen oldfashioned guns which our soldier told us had gone quite out of use in these days they were long iron twelvepounders with one or two carronades the soldier was of an artillery regiment and wore the crimean medal he said the garrison now here consists only of about twenty men all of whom had served in the crimea like himself they seem to lead a very dull and monotonous life as indeed it must be without object or much hope or any great employment of the present like prisoners as indeed they are our guide showed us on the rampart a place where the soldiers had been accustomed to drop themselves down at night hanging by their hands from the top of the wall and alighting on their feet close beside the path on the outside the height seemed at least that of an ordinary house but the soldier said that nine times out of ten the fall might be ventured without harm and he spoke from experience having himself got out of the castle in this manner the place is now boarded up so as to make egress difficult or impossible the castle after all was not particularly worth seeing the soldiers most romantic story was of a daughter of lord scroope a former governor of the castle when mary of scotland was confined here she attempted to assist the queen in escaping but was shot dead in the gateway by the warder and the soldier pointed out the very spot where the poor young lady fell and died all which would be very interesting were there a word of truth in the story but we liked our guide for his intelligence simplicity and for the pleasure which he seemed to take as an episode of his dull daily life in talking to strangers he observed that the castle walls were solid and indeed there was breadth enough to drive a coach and four along the top but the artillery of the crimea would have shelled them into ruins in a very few hours when we got back to the guardhouse he took us inside and showed the dismal and comfortless rooms where soldiers are confined for drunkenness and other offences against military laws telling us that he himself had been confined there and almost perished with cold i should not much wonder if he were to get into durance again through misuse of the fee which i put into his hand at parting the cathedral is at no great distance from the castle and though the streets are mean and sordid in the vicinity the close has the antique repose and shadowy peace at once domestic and religious which seem peculiar and universal in cathedral closes the foundation of this cathedral church is very ancient it having been the church portion of an old abbey the refectory and other remains of which are still seen around the close but the whole exterior of the building except here and there a buttress and one old patch of gray stones seems to have been renewed within a very few years with red freestone and really i think it is all the more beautiful for being new the ornamental parts being so sharply cut and the stone moreover showing various shadings which will disappear when it gets weatherworn there is a very large and fine east window of recent construction wrought with delicate stone tracery the door of the south transept stood open though barred by an iron grate we looked in and saw a few monuments on the wall but found nobody to give us admittance the portal of this entrance is very lovely with wreaths of stone foliage and flowers round the arch recently carved yet not so recently but that the swallows have given their sanction to it as if it were a thousand years old and have built their nests in the deeply carved recesses while we were looking a little bird flew into the small opening between two of these petrified flowers behind which was his nest quite out of sight after some attempts to find the verger we went back to the hotel in the morning my wife and j went back to see the interior of the cathedral while i strayed at large about the town again passing round the castle site and thence round the city where i found some inconsiderable portions of the wall which once girt it about it was marketday in carlisle and the principal streets were much thronged with human life and business on that account and in as busy a street as any stands a marble statue in robes of antique state fitter for a niche in westminster abbey than for the thronged street of a town it is a statue of the earl of lonsdale lord lieutenant of cumberland who died about twenty years ago here follows the record of the visits to the haunts of burns already published in our old home ed glasgow july st immediately after our arrival yesterday we went out and inquired our way to the cathedral which we reached through a good deal of scotch dirt and a rabble of scotch people of all sexes and ages the women of scotland have a faculty of looking exceedingly ugly as they grow old the cathedral i have already noticed in the record of my former visit to scotland i did it no justice then nor shall do it any better justice now but it is a fine old church although it makes a colder and severer impression than most of the gothic architecture which i have elsewhere seen i do not know why this should be so for portions of it are wonderfully rich and everywhere there are arches opening beyond arches and clustered pillars and groined roofs and vistas lengthening along the aisles the person who shows it is an elderly man of jolly aspect and demeanor he is enthusiastic about the edifice and makes it the thought and object of his life and being such a merry sort of man always saying something mirthfully and yet in all his thoughts words and actions having reference to this solemn cathedral he has the effect of one of the corbels or gargoyles those ludicrous strange sculptures which the gothic architects appended to their arches the upper portion of the minster though very stately and beautiful is not nearly so extraordinary as the crypts here the intricacy of the arches and the profound system on which they are arranged is inconceivable even when you see them a whole company of arches uniting in one keystone arches uniting to form a glorious canopy over the shrine or tomb of a prelate arches opening through and beyond one another whichever way you look all amidst a shadowy gloom yet not one detail wrought out the less beautifully and delicately because it could scarcely be seen the wreaths of flowers that festoon one of the arches are cut in such relief that they do but just adhere to the stone on which they grow the pillars are massive and the arches very low the effect being a twilight which at first leads the spectator to imagine himself underground but by and by i saw that the sunshine came in through the narrow windows though it scarcely looked like sunshine then for many years these crypts were used as burialground and earth was brought in for the purpose of making graves so that the noble columns were half buried and the beauty of the architecture quite lost and forgotten now the dead mens bones and the earth that covered them have all been removed leaving the original pavement of the crypt or a new one in its stead with only the old relics of saints martyrs and heroes underneath where they have lain so long that they have become a part of the spot i was quite chilled through and the old verger regretted that we had not come during the late hot weather when the everlasting damp and chill of the spot would have made us entirely comfortable these crypts originated in the necessity of keeping the floor of the upper cathedral on one level the edifice being built on a declivity and the height of the crypt being measured by the descent of the site after writing the above we walked out and saw something of the newer portion of glasgow and really i am inclined to think it the stateliest of cities the exchange and other public buildings and the shops in buchanan street are very magnificent the latter especially excelling those of london there is however a pervading sternness and grimness resulting from the dark gray granite which is the universal buildingmaterial both of the old and new edifices later in the forenoon we again walked out and went along argyle street and through the trongate and the saltmarket the two latter were formerly the principal business streets and together with high street the abode of the rich merchants and other great people of the town high street and still more the saltmarket now swarm with the lower orders to a degree which i never witnessed elsewhere so that it is difficult to make ones way among the sullen and unclean crowd and not at all pleasant to breathe in the noisomeness of the atmosphere the children seem to have been unwashed from birth some of the gray houses appear to have once been stately and handsome and have their high gable ends notched at the edges like a flight of stairs we saw the tron steeple and the statue of king william iii and searched for the old tolbooth wandering up the high street we turned once more into the quadrangle of the university and mounted a broad stone staircase which ascends square and with rightangular turns on one corner on the outside of the edifices it is very striking in appearance being ornamented with a balustrade on which are large globes of stone and a great lion and unicorn curiously sculptured on the opposite side while we waited here staring about us a man approached and offered to show us the interior he seemed to be in charge of the college buildings we accepted his offer and were led first up this stone staircase and into a large and stately hall panelled high towards the ceiling with dark oak and adorned with elaborately carved cornices and other woodwork there was a long readingtable towards one end of the hall on which were laid pamphlets and periodicals and a venerable old gentleman with white head and bowed shoulders sat there reading a newspaper this was the principal of the university and as he looked towards us graciously yet as if expecting some explanation of our entrance i approached and apologized for intruding on the plea of our being strangers and anxious to see the college he made a courteous response though in exceedingly decayed and broken accents being now eightysix years old and gave us free leave to inspect everything that was to be seen this hall was erected two years after the restoration of charles ii and has been the scene doubtless of many ceremonials and high banquetings since that period and among other illustrious personages queen victoria has honored it with her presence thence we went into several recitation or lecture rooms in various parts of the buildings but they were all of an extreme plainness very unlike the rich old gothic libraries and chapels and halls which we saw in oxford indeed the contrast between this scotch severity and that noble luxuriance and antique majesty and rich and sweet repose of oxford is very remarkable both within the edifices and without but we saw one or two curious things for instance a chair of mahogany elaborately carved with the arms of scotland and other devices and having a piece of the kingly stone of scone inlaid in its seat this chair is used by the principal on certain high occasions and we ourselves of course sat down in it our guide assigned to it a date preposterously earlier than could have been the true one judging either by the character of the carving or by the fact that mahogany has not been known or used much more than a century and a half afterwards he led us into the divinity hall where he said there were some old portraits of historic people and among them an original picture of mary queen of scots there was indeed a row of old portraits at each end of the apartment for instance zachariah boyd who wrote the rhyming version of the bible which is still kept safe from any critical eye in the library of the university to which he presented this besides other more valuable benefactions for which they have placed his bust in a niche in the principal quadrangle also john knox makes one of the row of portraits and a dozen or two more of scotch worthies all very dark and dingy as to the picture of mary of scotland it proved to be not hers at all but a picture of queen mary the consort of william iii whose portrait together with that of her sister queen anne hangs in the same row we told our guide this but he seemed unwilling to accept it as a fact there is a museum belonging to the university but this for some reason or other could not be shown to us just at this time and there was little else to show we just looked at the gardens but though of large extent they are so meagre and bare so unlike that lovely shade of the oxford gardens that we did not care to make further acquaintance with them then we went back to our hotel and if there were not already more than enough of description both past and to come i should describe georges square on one side of which the hotel is situated a tall column rises in the grassy centre of it lifting far into the upper air a fine statue of sir walter scott which we saw to great advantage last night relieved against the sunset sky and there are statues of sir john moore a native of glasgow and of james watt at corners of the square glasgow is certainly a noble city after lunch we embarked on board the steamer and came up the clyde ben lomond and other highland hills soon appeared on the horizon we passed douglas castle on a point of land projecting into the river and passing under the precipitous height of dumbarton castle which we had long before seen came to our voyages end at this village where we have put up at the elephant hotel july d after tea not far from seven oclock it being a beautiful decline of day we set out to walk to dumbarton castle which stands apart from the town and is said to have been once surrounded by the waters of the clyde the rocky height on which the castle stands is a very striking object bulging up out of the clyde with abrupt decision to the elevation of five hundred feet the summit is cloven in twain the cleft reaching nearly to the bottom on the side towards the river but not coming down so deeply on the landward side it is precipitous all around and wherever the steepness admits or does not make assault impossible there are gray ramparts round the hill with cannon threatening the lower world our path led its beneath one of these precipices several hundred feet sheer down and with an ivied fragment of ruined wall at the top a soldier who sat by the wayside told us that this was called the lovers leap because a young girl in some loveexigency had once jumped down from it and came safely to the bottom we reached the castle gate which is near the shore of the clyde and there found another artillery soldier who guided us through the fortress he said that there were now but about a dozen soldiers stationed in the castle and no officer the lowest battery looks towards the river and consists of a few twelvepound cannon but probably the chief danger of attack was from the land and the chief pains have been taken to render the castle defensible in that quarter there are flights of stone stairs ascending up through the natural avenue in the cleft of the doublesummited rock and about midway there is an arched doorway beneath which there used to be a portcullis so that if an enemy had won the lower part of the fortress the upper portion was still inaccessible where the cleft of the rock widens into a gorge there are several buildings old but not appertaining to the ancient castle which has almost entirely disappeared we ascended both summits and reaching the loftiest point on the right stood upon the foundation of a tower that dates back to the fifth century whence we had a glorious prospect of highlands and lowlands the chief object being ben lomond with its great dome among a hundred other blue and misty hills with the sun going down over them and in another direction the clyde winding far downward through the plain with the headland of dumbeck close at hand and douglas castle at no great distance on the ramparts beneath us the soldier pointed out the spot where wallace scaled the wall climbing an apparently inaccessible precipice and taking the castle the principal parts of the ancient castle appear to have been on the other and lower summit of the hill and thither we now went and traced the outline of its wall although none of it is now remaining here is the magazine still containing some powder and here is a battery of eighteenpound guns with pyramids of balls all in readiness against an assault which however hardly any turn of human affairs can hereafter bring about the appearance of a fortress is kept up merely for ceremonys sake and these cannon have grown antiquated moreover as the soldier told us they are seldom or never fired even for purposes of rejoicing or salute because their thunder produces the singular effect of depriving the garrison of water there is a large tank and the concussion causes the rifts of the stone to open and thus lets the water out above this battery and elsewhere about the fortress there are warders turrets of stone resembling great pepperboxes when dr johnson visited the castle he introduced his bulky person into one of these narrow receptacles and found it difficult to get out again a gentleman who accompanied him was just stepping forward to offer his assistance but boswell whispered him to take no notice lest johnson should be offended so they left him to get out as he could he did finally extricate himself else we might have seen his skeleton in the turret boswell does not tell this story which seems to have been handed down by local tradition the less abrupt declivities of the rock are covered with grass and afford food for a few sheep who scamper about the heights and seem to have attained the dexterity of goats in clambering i never knew a purer air than this seems to be nor a lovelier golden sunset descending into the gorge again we went into the armory which is in one of the buildings occupying the space between the two hilltops it formerly contained a large collection of arms but these have been removed to the tower of london and there are now only some tattered banners of which i do not know the history and some festoons of pistols and grenades shells and grape and canister shot kept merely as curiosities and far more interesting than the above a few battleaxes daggers and spearheads from the field of bannockburn and more interesting still the sword of william wallace it is a formidablelooking weapon made for being swayed with both hands and with its hilt on the floor reached about to my chin but the young girl who showed us the armory said that about nine inches had been broken off the point the blade was not massive but somewhat thin compared with its great length and i found that i could blandish it using both hands with perfect ease it is twoedged without any gaps and is quite brown and lustreless with old rust from point to hilt these were all the memorables of our visit to dumbarton castle which is a most interesting spot and connected with a long series of historical events it was first besieged by the danes and had a prominent share in all the warfare of scotland so long as the old warlike times and manners lasted our soldier was very intelligent and courteous but as usual with these guides was somewhat apocryphal in his narrative telling us that mary queen of scots was confined here before being taken to england and that the cells in which she then lived are still extant under one of the ramparts the fact is she was brought here when a child of six years old before going to france and doubtless scrambled up and down these heights as freely and merrily as the sheep we saw we now returned to our hotel a very nice one and found the street of dumbarton all alive in the summer evening with the sports of children and the gossip of grown people there was almost no night for at twelve oclock there was still a golden daylight and yesterday before it died must have met the morrow in the lower part of the fortress there is a large sundial of stone which was made by a french officer imprisoned here during the peninsular war it still numbers faithfully the hours that are sunny and it is a lasting memorial of him in the stronghold of his enemies inverannan evening after breakfast at dumbarton i went out to look at the town which is of considerable size and possesses both commerce and manufactures there was a screwsteamship at the pier and many sailorlooking people were seen about the streets there are very few old houses though still the town retains an air of antiquity which one does not well see how to account for when everywhere there is a modern front and all the characteristics of a street built today turning from the main thoroughfare i crossed a bridge over the clyde and gained from it the best view of the cloven crag of dumbarton castle that i had yet found the two summits are wider apart more fully relieved from each other than when seen from other points and the highest ascends into a perfect pyramid the lower one being obtusely rounded there seem to be ironworks or some kind of manufactory on the farther side of the bridge and i noticed a quaint chateaulike mansion with hanging turrets standing apart from the street probably built by some person enriched by business we left dumbarton at noon taking the rail to balloch and the steamer to the head of loch lomond wild mountain scenery is not very good to describe nor do i think any distinct impressions are ever conveyed by such attempts so i mean to be brief in what i saw about this part of our tour especially as i suspect that i have said whatever i knew how to say in the record of my former visit to the highlands as for loch lomond it lies amidst very striking scenery being poured in among the gorges of steep and lofty mountains which nowhere stand aside to give it room but on the contrary do their best to shut it in it is everywhere narrow compared with its length of thirty miles but it is the beauty of a lake to be of no greater width than to allow of the scenery of one of its shores being perfectly enjoyed from the other the scenery of the highlands so far as i have seen it cannot properly be called rich but stern and impressive with very hard outlines which are unsoftened mostly by any foliage though at this season they are green to their summits they have hardly flesh enough to cover their bones hardly earth enough to lie over their rocky substance as may be seen by the minute variety the notched and jagged appearance of the profile of their sides and tops this being caused by the scarcely covered rocks wherewith these great hills are heaped together our little steamer stopped at half a dozen places on its voyage up the lake most of them being stations where hotels have been established morally the highlands must have been more completely sophisticated by the invention of railways and steamboats than almost any other part of the world but physically it can have wrought no great change these mountains in their general aspect must be very much the same as they were thousands of years ago for their sides never were capable of cultivation nor even with such a soil and so bleak an atmosphere could they have been much more richly wooded than we see them now they seem to me to be among the unchangeable things of nature like the sea and sky but there is no saying what use human ingenuity may hereafter put them to at all events i have no doubt in the world that they will go out of fashion in due time for the taste for mountains and wild scenery is with most people an acquired taste and it was easy to see today that nine people in ten care nothing about them one group of gentlemen and ladies at least men and women spent the whole time in listening to a trial for murder which was read aloud by one of their number from a newspaper i rather imagine that a taste for trim gardens is the most natural and universal taste as regards landscape but perhaps it is necessary for the health of the human mind and heart that there should be a possibility of taking refuge in what is wild and uncontaminated by any meddling of mans hand and so it has been ordained that science shall never alter the aspect of the sky whether stern angry or beneficent nor of the awful sea either in calm or tempest nor of these rude highlands but they will go out of general fashion as i have said and perhaps the next fashionable taste will be for cloud land that is looking skyward and observing the wonderful variety of scenery that now constantly passes unnoticed among the clouds at the head of the lake we found that there was only a horsecart to convey our luggage to the hotel at inverannan and that we ourselves must walk the distance being two miles it had sprinkled occasionally during our voyage but was now sunshiny and not excessively warm so we set forth contentedly enough and had an agreeable walk along an almost perfectly level road for it is one of the beauties of these hills that they descend abruptly down instead of undulating away forever there were lofty heights on each side of us but not so lofty as to have won a distinctive name and adown their sides we could see the rocky pathways of cascades which at this season are either quite dry or mere trickles of a rill the hills and valleys abound in streams sparkling through pebbly beds and forming here and there a dark pool and they would be populous with trout if all england with one fell purpose did not come hither to fish them a fisherman must find it difficult to gratify his propensities in these days for even the lakes and streams in norway are now preserved j by the way threatens ominously to be a fisherman he rode the latter portion of the way to the hotel on the luggagecart and when we arrived we found that he had already gone off to catch fish or to attempt it for there is as much chance of his catching a whale as a trout in a mountain stream near the house i went in search of him but without success and was somewhat startled at the depth and blackness of some of the pools into which the stream settled itself and slept finally he came in while we were at dinner we afterwards walked out with him to let him play at fishing again and discovered on the bank of the stream a wonderful oak with as many as a dozen holes springing either from close to the ground or within a foot or two of it and looking like twelve separate trees at least instead of one inversnaid july d last night seemed to close in clear and even at midnight it was still light enough to read but this morning rose on us misty and chill with spattering showers of rain clouds momentarily settled and shifted on the hilltops shutting us in even more completely than these steep and rugged green walls would be sure to do even in the clearest weather often these clouds came down and enveloped us in a drizzle or rather a shower of such minute drops that they had not weight enough to fall this i suppose was a genuine scotch mist and as such it is well enough to have experienced it though i would willingly never see it again such being the state of the weather my wife did not go out at all but i strolled about the premises in the intervals of raindrops gazing up at the hillsides and recognizing that there is a vast variety of shape of light and shadow and incidental circumstance even in what looks so monotonous at first as the green slope of a hill the little rills that come down from the summits were rather more distinguishable than yesterday having been refreshed by the nights rain but still they were very much out of proportion with the wide pathways of bare rock adown which they ran these little rivulets no doubt often lead through the wildest scenery that is to be found in the highlands or anywhere else and to the formation and wildness of which they have greatly contributed by sawing away for countless ages and thus deepening the ravines i suspect the american clouds are more picturesque than those of great britain whatever our mountains may be at least i remember the berkshire hills looking grander under the influence of mist and cloud than the highlands did today our clouds seem to be denser and heavier and more decided and form greater contrasts of light and shade i have remarked in england that the cloudy firmament even on a day of settled rain always appears thinner than those i had been accustomed to at home so as to deceive me with constant expectations of better weather it has been the same today whenever i looked upward i thought it might be going to clear up but instead of that it began to rain more in earnest after midday and at half past two we left inverannan in a smart shower at the head of the lake we took the steamer with the rain pouring more heavily than ever and landed at inversnaid under the same dismal auspices we left a very good hotel behind us and have come to another that seems also good we are more picturesquely situated at this spot than at inverannan our hotel being within a short distance of the lake shore with a glen just across the water which will doubtless be worth looking at when the mist permits us to see it a good many tourists were standing about the door when we arrived and looked at us with the curiosity of idle and weatherbound people the lake is here narrow but a hundred fathoms deep so that a great part of the height of the mountains which beset it round is hidden beneath its surface july th this morning opened still misty but with a more hopeful promise than yesterday and when i went out after breakfast there were gleams of sunshine here and there on the hillsides falling one did not exactly see how through the volumes of cloud close beside the hotel of inversnaid is the waterfall all night my room being on that side of the house i had heard its voice and now i ascended beside it to a point where it is crossed by a wooden bridge there is thence a view upward and downward of the most striking descents of the river as i believe they call it though it is but a mountainstream which tumbles down an irregular and broken staircase in its headlong haste to reach the lake it is very picturesque however with its ribbons of white foam over the precipitous steps and its deep black pools overhung by black rocks which reverberate the rumble of the falling water j and i ascended a little distance along the cascade and then turned aside he going up the hill and i taking a path along its side which gave me a view across the lake i rather think this particular stretch of loch lomond in front of inversnaid is the most beautiful lake and mountain view that i have ever seen it is so shut in that you can see nothing beyond nor would suspect anything more to exist than this watery vale among the hills except that directly opposite there is the beautiful glen of invernglass which winds away among the feet of ben crook ben ein ben vain and ben voirlich standing mistinwreathed together the mists this morning had a very soft and beautiful effect and made the mountains tenderer than i have hitherto felt them to be and they lingered about their heads like morningdreams flitting and retiring and letting the sunshine in and snatching it away again my wife came up and we enjoyed it together till the steamer came smoking its pipe along the loch stopped to land some passengers and steamed away again while we stood there a highlander passed by us with a very dark tartan and bare shanks most enormously calved i presume he wears the dress for the sole purpose of displaying those stalwart legs for he proves to be no genuine gael but a manufacturer who has a shootingbox or a share in one on the hill above the hotel we now engaged a boat and were rowed to rob roys cave which is perhaps half a mile distant up the lake the shores look much more striking from a rowboat creeping along near the margin than from a steamer in the middle of the loch and the ridge beneath which robs cave lies is precipitous with gray rocks and clothed too with thick foliage over the cave itself there is a huge ledge of rock from which immense fragments have tumbled down ages and ages ago and fallen together in such a way as to leave a large irregular crevice in rob roys cave we scrambled up to its mouth by some natural stairs and scrambled down into its depths by the aid of a ladder i suppose i have already described this hole in the record of my former visit certainly rob roy and robert bruce who is said to have inhabited it before him were not to be envied their accommodations yet these were not so very intolerable when compared with a highland cabin or with cottages such as burns lived in j had chosen to remain to fish on our return from the cave we found that he had caught nothing but just as we stepped into the boat a fish drew his float far under water and jtugging at one end of the line and the fish at the other the latter escaped with the hook in his month javers that he saw the fish and gives its measurement as about eighteen inches but the fishes that escape us are always of tremendous size the boatman thought however that it might have been a pike the trosachs hotel ardcheanochrochan july th not being able to get a postchaise we took places in the omnibus for the bead of loch katrine going up to pay a parting visit to the waterfall before starting i met with miss c as she lately was who is now on her wedding tour as mrs b she was painting the falls in oil with good prospect of a successful picture she came down to the hotel to see my wife and soon afterwards j and i set out to ascend the steep hill that comes down upon the lake of inversnaid leaving the omnibus to follow at leisure the highlander who took us to rob roys cave had foreboded rain from the way in which the white clouds hung about the mountaintops nor was his augury at fault for just at three oclock the time he foretold there were a few raindrops and a more defined shower during the afternoon while we were on loch katrine the few drops however did not disturb us and reaching the top of the hill j and i turned aside to examine the old stone fortress which was erected in this mountain pass to bridle the highlanders after the rebellion of it stands in a very desolate and dismal situation at the foot of long bare slopes on mossy ground in the midst of a disheartening loneliness only picturesque because it is so exceedingly ungenial and unlovely the chief interest of this spot in the fact that wolfe in his earlier military career was stationed here the fortress was a very plain structure built of rough stones in the form of a parallelogram one side of which i paced and found it between thirty and forty of my paces long the two ends have fallen down the two sides that remain are about twenty feet high and have little portholes for defence but no openings of the size of windows the roof is gone and the interior space overgrown with grass two little girls were at play in one corner and going round to the rear of the ruin i saw that a small highland cabin had been built against the wall a dog sat in the doorway and gave notice of my approach and some hens kept up their peculiarly domestic converse about the door we kept on our way often looking back towards loch lomond and wondering at the grandeur which ben vain and ben voirlich and the rest of the ben fraternity had suddenly put on the mists which had hung about them all day had now descended lower and lay among the depths and gorges of the hills where also the sun shone softly down among them and filled those deep mountain laps as it were with a dimmer sunshine ben vain too and his brethren had a veil of mist all about them which seemed to render them really transparent and they had unaccountably grown higher vastly higher than when we viewed them from the shore of the lake it was as if we were looking at them through the medium of a poets imagination all along the road since we left inversnaid there had been the stream which there formed the waterfall and which here was brawling down little declivities and sleeping in black pools which we disturbed by flinging stones into them from the roadside we passed a drunken old gentleman who civilly bade me good day and a man and woman at work in a field the former of whom shouted to inquire the hour and we had come in sight of little loch arklet before the omnibus came up with us it was about five oclock when we reached the head of loch katrine and went on board the steamer rob roy and setting forth on our voyage a highland piper made music for us the better part of the way we did not see loch katrine perhaps under its best presentment for the surface was roughened with a little wind and darkened even to inky blackness by the clouds that overhung it the hilltops too wore a very dark frown a lake of this size cannot be terrific and is therefore seen to best advantage when it is beautiful the scenery of its shores is not altogether so rich and lovely as i had preimagined not equal indeed to the best parts of loch lomond the hills being lower and of a more ridgy shape and exceedingly bare at least towards the lower end but they turn the lake aside with headland after headland and shut it in closely and open one vista after another so that the eye is never weary and least of all as we approach the end the length of the loch is ten miles and at its termination it meets the pass of the trosachs between ben an and ben venue which are the rudest and shaggiest of hills the steamer passes ellens isle but to the right which is the side opposite to that on which fitzjames must be supposed to have approached it it is a very small island situated where the loch narrows and is perhaps less than a quarter of a mile distant from either shore it looks like a lump of rock with just soil enough to support a crowd of dwarf oaks birches and firs which do not grow so high as to be shadowy trees our voyage being over we landed and found two omnibuses one of which took us through the famous pass of the trosachs a distance of a mile and a quarter to a hotel erected in castellated guise by lord willoughby deresby we were put into a parlor within one of the round towers panelled all round and with four narrow windows opening through deep embrasures no playcastle was ever more like the reality and it is a very good hotel like all that we have had experience of in the highlands after tea we walked out and visited a little kirk that stands near the shore of loch achray at a good point of view for seeing the hills round about this morning opened cloudily but after breakfast i set out alone and walked through the pass of the trosachs and thence by a path along the right shore of the lake it is a very picturesque and beautiful path following the windings of the lake now along the beach now over an impending bank until it comes opposite to ellens isle which on this side looks more worthy to be the island of the poem than as we first saw it its shore is craggy and precipitous but there was a point where it seemed possible to land nor was it too much to fancy that there might be a rustic habitation among the shrubbery of this rugged spot it is foolish to look into these matters too strictly scott evidently used as much freedom with his natural scenery as he did with his historic incidents and he could have made nothing of either one or the other if he had been more scrupulous in his arrangement and adornment of them in his description of the trosachs he has produced something very beautiful and as true as possible though certainly its beauty has a little of the scenepainters gloss on it nature is better no doubt but nature cannot be exactly reproduced on canvas or in print and the artists only resource is to substitute something that may stand instead of and suggest the truth the path still kept onward after passing ellens isle and i followed it finding it wilder more shadowy with overhanging foliage of trees old and young more like a mountainpath in berkshire or new hampshire yet still with an old world restraint and cultivation about it the farther i went at last i came upon some bars and though the track was still seen beyond i took this as a hint to stop especially as i was now two or three miles from the hotel and it just then began to rain my umbrella was a poor one at best and had been tattered and turned inside out a day or two ago by a gust on loch lomond but i spread it to the shower and furthermore took shelter under the thickest umbrage i could find the rain came straight down and bubbled in the loch the little rills gathered force and plashed merrily over the stones the leaves of the trees condensed the shower into large drops and shed them down upon me where i stood still i was comfortable enough in a thick skye tweed and waited patiently till the rain abated then took my way homeward and admired the pass of the trosachs more than when i first traversed it if it has a fault it is one that few scenes in great britain share with it that is the trees and shrubbery with which the precipices are shagged conceal them a little too much a crag streaked with black and white here and there shows its head aloft or its whole height from base to summit and suggests that more of such sublimity is bidden than revealed i think however that it is this unusual shagginess which made the scene a favorite with scott and with the people on this side of the ocean generally there are many scenes as good in america needing only the poet july th we dined yesterday at the table dhote at the suggestion of the butler in order to give less trouble to the servants of the hotel and afford them an opportunity to go to kirk the diningroom is in accordance with the rest of the architecture and fittings up of the house and is a very good reproduction of an old baronial hall with high panellings and a roof of dark polished wood there were about twenty guests at table and if they and the waiters had been dressed in mediaeval costume we might have imagined ourselves banqueting in the middle ages after dinner we all took a walk through the trosachs pass again and by the righthand path along the lake as far as ellens isle it was very pleasant there being gleams of calm evening sunshine gilding the mountainsides and putting a golden crown occasionally on the tread of ben venue it is wonderful how many aspects a mountain has how many mountains there are in every single mountain how they vary too in apparent attitude and bulk when we reached the lake its surface was almost unruffled except by now and then the narrow pathway of a breeze as if the wing of an unseen spirit had just grazed it in flitting across the scene was very beautiful and on the whole i do not know that walter scott has overcharged his description although he has symbolized the reality by types and images which it might not precisely suggest to other minds we were reluctant to quit the spot and cherish still a hope of seeing it again though the hope does not seem very likely to be gratified this was a lowering and sullen morning but soon after breakfast i took a walk in the opposite direction to loch katrine and reached the brig of turk a little beyond which is the new trosachs hotel and the little rude village of duncraggan consisting of a few hovels of stone at the foot of a bleak and dreary hill to the left stretching up between this and other hills is the valley of glenfinlas a very awful region in scotts poetry and in highland tradition as the haunt of spirits and enchantments it presented a very desolate prospect the walk back to the trosachs showed me ben venue and ben an under new aspects the bare summit of the latter rising in a perfect pyramid whereas from other points of view it looks like quite a different mountain sometimes a gleam of sunshine came out upon the rugged side of ben venue but his prevailing mood like that of the rest of the landscape was stern and gloomy i wish i could give an idea of the variety of surface upon one of these hillsides so bulging out and hollowed in so bare where the rock breaks through so shaggy in other places with heath and then perhaps a thick umbrage of birch oak and ash ascending from the base high upward when i think i have described them i remember quite a different aspect and find it equally true and yet lacking something to make it the whole or an adequate truth j had gone with me part of the way but stopped to fish with a pinhook in loch achray which bordered along our path when i returned i found him much elated at having caught a fish which however had got away carrying his pinhook along with it then he had amused himself with taking some lizards by the tail and had collected several in a small hollow of the rocks we now walked home together and at half past three we took our seats in a genuine oldfashioned stagecoach of which there are few specimens now to be met with the coachman was smartly dressed in the queens scarlet and was a very pleasant and affable personage conducting himself towards the passengers with courteous authority inside we were four including j but on the top there were at least a dozen and i would willingly have been there too but had taken an inside seat under apprehension of rain and was not allowed to change it our drive was not marked by much describable incident on changing horses at callender we alighted and saw ben ledi behind us making a picturesque background to the little town which seems to be the meetingpoint of the highlands and lowlands we again changed horses at doune an old town which would doubtless have been well worth seeing had time permitted thence we kept on till the coach drew up at a spacious hotel where we alighted fancying that we had reached stirling which was to have been our journeys end but after fairly establishing ourselves we found that it was the brig of allan the place is three miles short of stirling nevertheless we did not much regret the mistake finding that the brig of allan is the principal spa of scotland and a very pleasant spot to all outward appearance after tea we walked out both up and down the village street and across the bridge and up a gentle eminence beyond it whence we had a fine view of a glorious plain out of which rose several insulated headlands one of these was the height on which stands stirling castle and which reclines on the plain like a hound or a lion or a sphinx holding the castle on the highest part where its head should be a mile or two distant from this picturesque hill rises another still more striking called the abbey craig on which is a ruin and where is to be built the monument to william wallace i cannot conceive a nobler or more fitting pedestal the sullenness of the day had vanished the air was cool but invigorating and the cloud scenery was as fine as that below it though it was nearly ten oclock the boys of the village were in full shout and play for these long and late summer evenings keep the children out of bed interminably stirling july th we bestirred ourselves early this morning and took the rail for stirling before eight it is but a few minutes ride so that doubtless we were earlier on the field than if we had slept at stirling after our arrival our first call was at the postoffice where i found a large package containing letters from america but none from u we then went to a booksellers shop and bought some views of stirling and the neighborhood and it is surprising what a quantity and variety of engravings there are of every noted place that we have visited you seldom find two sets alike it is rather nauseating to find that what you came to see has already been looked at in all its lights over and over again with thousandfold repetition and beyond question its depictment in words has been attempted still oftener than with the pencil it will be worth while to go back to america were it only for the chance of finding a still virgin scene we climbed the steep slope of the castle hill sometimes passing an antiquelooking house with a high notched gable perhaps with an ornamented front until we came to the sculptures and battlemented wall with an archway that stands just below the castle a shabbylooking man now accosted us and could hardly be shaken off i have met with several such boors in my experience of sightseeing he kept along with us in spite of all hints to the contrary and insisted on pointing out objects of interest he showed us a house in broad street below the castle and cathedral which he said had once been inhabited by henry darnley queen marys husband there was little or nothing peculiar in its appearance a large gray gabled house standing lengthwise to the street with three windows in the roof and connected with other houses on each side almost directly across the street he pointed to an archway through the side of a house and peeping through it we found a soldier on guard in a courtyard the sides of which were occupied by an old mansion of the argyle family having towers at the corners with conical tops like those reproduced in the hotel at the trosachs it is now occupied as a military hospital shaking off our selfinflicted guide we now made our way to the castle parade and to the gateway where a soldier with a tremendously red nose and two medals at once took charge of us beyond all doubt i have written quite as good a description of the castle and carse of stirling in a former portion of my journal as i can now write we passed through the outer rampart of queen anne through the old round gatetower of an earlier day and beneath the vacant arch where the portcullis used to fall thus reaching the inner region where stands the old palace on one side and the old parliament house on the other the former looks aged ragged and rusty but makes a good appearance enough pictorially being adorned all round about with statues which may have been white marble once but are as gray as weatherbeaten granite now and look down from between the windows above the basement story a photograph would give the idea of very rich antiquity but as it really stands looking on a gravelled courtyard and with canteen painted on one of its doors the spectator does not find it very impressive the great hall of this palace is now partitioned off into two or three rooms and the whole edifice is arranged to serve as barracks of course no trace of ancient magnificence if anywise destructible can be left in the interior we were not shown into this palace nor into the parliament house nor into the tower where king james stabbed the earl of douglas when i was here a year ago i went up the old staircase and into the room where the murder was committed although it had recently been the scene of a fire which consumed as much of it as was inflammable the window whence the earls body was thrown then remained but now the whole tower seems to have been renewed leaving only the mullions of the historic window we merely looked up at the new lightcolored freestone of the restored tower in passing and ascended to the ramparts where we found one of the most splendid views morally and materially that this world can show indeed i think there cannot be such a landscape as the carse of stirling set in such a frame as it is the highlands comprehending our friends ben lomond ben venue ben an and the whole ben brotherhood with the grampians surrounding it to the westward and northward and in other directions some range of prominent objects to shut it in and the plain itself so worthy of the richest setting so fertile so beautiful so written over and over again with histories the silver links of forth are as sweet and gently picturesque an object as a man sees in a lifetime i do not wonder that providence caused great things to happen on this plain it was like choosing a good piece of canvas to paint a great picture upon the battle of bannockburn which we saw beneath us with the gillies hill on the right could not have been fought upon a meaner plain nor wallaces victory gained and if any other great historic act still remains to be done in this country i should imagine the carse of stirling to be the future scene of it scott seems to me hardly to have done justice to this landscape or to have bestowed pains enough to put it in strong relief before the world although it is from the light shed on it and so much other scottish scenery by his mind that we chiefly see it and take an interest in it i do not remember seeing the hill of execution before a mound on the same level as the castles base looking towards the highlands a solitary cow was now feeding upon it i should imagine that no person could ever have been unjustly executed there the spot is too much in the sight of heaven and earth to countenance injustice descending from the ramparts we went into the armory which i did not see on my former visit the superintendent of this department is an old soldier of very great intelligence and vast communicativeness and quite absorbed in thinking of and handling weapons for he is a practical armorer he had few things to show us that were very interesting a helmet or two a bomb and grenade from the crimea also some muskets from the same quarter one of which with a sword at the end he spoke of admiringly as the best weapon in the collection its only fault being its extreme weight he showed us too some minie rifles and whole ranges of the oldfashioned brown bess which had helped to win wellingtons victories also the halberts of sergeants now laid aside and some swords that had been used at the battle of sheriffmuir these latter were very short not reaching to the floor when i held one of them point downward in my hand the shortness of the blade and consequent closeness of the encounter must have given the weapon a most daggerlike murderousness ranging in the hall of arms there were two tattered banners that had gone through the peninsular battles one of them belonging to the gallant d regiment the armorer gave my wife a rag from each of these banners consecrated by so much battlesmoke also a piece of old oak half burned to charcoal which had been rescued from the panelling of the douglas tower we saw better things moreover than all these rusty weapons and ragged flags namely the pulpit and communiontable of john knox the frame of the former if i remember aright is complete but one or two of the panels are knocked out and lost and on the whole it looks as if it had been shaken to pieces by the thunder of his holdings forth much wormeaten too is the old oak wood as well it may be for the letters md are carved on its front the communiontable is polished and in much better preservation then the armorer showed us a damascus blade of the kind that will cut a delicate silk handkerchief while floating in the air and some inlaid matchlock guns a childs little toygun was lying on a workbench among all this array of weapons and when i took it up and smiled he said that it was his sons so he called in a little fellow four years old who was playing in the castle yard and made him go through the musket exercise which he did with great goodwill this small son of a gun the father assured us cares for nothing but arms and has attained all his skill with the musket merely by looking at the soldiers on parade our soldier who had resigned the care of us to the armorer met us again at the door and led us round the remainder of the ramparts dismissing us finally at the gate by which we entered all the time we were in the castle there had been a great discordance of drums and fifes caused by the musicians who were practising just under the walls likewise the sergeants were drilling their squads of men and putting them through strange gymnastic motions most if not all of the garrison belongs to a highland regiment and those whom we saw on duty in full costume looked very martial and gallant emerging from the castle we took the broad and pleasant footpath which circles it about midway on the grassy steep which descends from the rocky precipice on which the walls are built this is a very beautiful walk and affords a most striking view of the castle right above our heads the height of its wall forming one line with the precipice the grassy hillside is almost as precipitous as the dark gray rock that rises out of it to form the foundations of the castle but wild rosebushes both of a white and red variety are abundant here and all in bloom nor are these the only flowers there is also shrubbery in some spots tossing up green waves against the precipice and broad sheets of ivy here and there mantle the headlong rock which also has a growth of weeds in its crevices the castle walls above however are quite bare of any such growth thus looking up at the old storied fortress and looking down over the wide historic plain we wandered halfway round the castle and then retracing our steps entered the town close by an old hospital a hospital it was or had been intended for but the authorities of the town had made some convenient arrangement with those entitled to its charity and had appropriated the ancient edifice to themselves so said a boy who showed us into the guildhall an apartment with a vaulted oaken roof and otherwise of antique aspect and furniture all of which however were modern restorations we then went into an old church or cathedral which was divided into two parts one of them in which i saw the royal arms being probably for the churchofengland service and the other for the kirk of scotland i remember little or nothing of this edifice except that the covenanters had uplifted it with pews and a gallery and whitewash though i doubt not it was a stately gothic church with innumerable enrichments and incrustations of beauty when it passed from popish hands into theirs thence we wandered downward through a back street amid very shabby houses some of which bore tokens of having once been the abodes of courtly and noble personages we paused before one that displayed i think the sign of a spiritretailer and looked as disreputable as a house could yet was built of stalwart stone and had two circular towers in front once doubtless crowned with conical tops we asked an elderly man whether he knew anything of the history of this house and he said that he had been acquainted with it for almost fifty years but never knew anything noteworthy about it reaching the foot of the hill along whose back the streets of stirling run and which blooms out into the castle craig we returned to the railway and at noon took leave of stirling i forgot to tell of the things that awakened rather more sympathy in us than any other objects in the castle armory these were some rude weapons pikes very roughly made and old rusty muskets broken and otherwise out of order and swords by no means with damascus blades that had been taken from some poor weavers and other handicraft men who rose against the government in i pitied the poor fellows much seeing how wretched were their means of standing up against the cannon bayonets swords shot shell and all manner of murderous facilities possessed by their oppressors afterwards our guide showed in a gloomy quadrangle of the castle the low windows of the dungeons where two of the leaders of the insurrectionists had been confined before their execution i have not the least shadow of doubt that these men had a good cause to fight for but what availed it with such weapons and so few even of those i believe i cannot go on to recount any further this evening the experiences of today it has been a very rich day only that i have seen more than my sluggish powers of reception can well take in at once after quitting stirling we came in somewhat less than an hour to linlithgow and alighting took up our quarters at the star and garter hotel which like almost all the scottish caravansaries of which we have had experience turns out a comfortable one we stayed within doors for an hour or two and i busied myself with writing up my journal at about three however the sky brightened a little and we set forth through the ancient rusty and queerlooking town of linlithgow towards the palace and the ancient church which latter was one of st davids edifices and both of which stand close together a little removed from the long street of the village but i can never describe them worthily and shall make nothing of the description if i attempt it now july th at about three oclock yesterday as i said we walked forth through the ancient street of linlithgow and coming to the marketplace stopped to look at an elaborate and heavy stone fountain which we found by an inscription to be the facsimile of an old one that used to stand on the same site turning to the right the outer entrance to the palace fronts on this marketplace if such it be and close to it a little on one side is the church a young woman with a key in her hand offered to admit us into the latter so we went in and found it divided by a wall across the middle into two parts the hither portion being the nave was whitewashed and looked as bare and uninteresting as an old gothic church of st davids epoch possibly could do the interior portion being the former choir is covered with pews over the whole floor and further defaced by galleries that unmercifully cut midway across the stately and beautiful arches it is likewise whitewashed there were i believe some mural monuments of bailies and other such people stuck up about the walls but nothing that much interested me except an ancient oaken chair which the girl said was the chair of st crispin and it was fastened to the wall in the holiest part of the church i know not why it was there but as it had been the chair of so distinguished a personage we all sat down in it it was in this church that the apparition of st james appeared to king james iv to warn him against engaging in that war which resulted in the battle of flodden where he and the flower of his nobility were slain the young woman showed us the spot where the apparition spake to him a side chapel with a groined roof at the end of the choir next the nave the covenanters seem to have shown some respect to this one chapel by refraining from drawing the gallery across its height so that except for the whitewash and the loss of the painted glass in the window and probably of a good deal of rich architectural detail it looks as it did when the ghostly saint entered beneath its arch while the king was kneeling there we stayed but a little while in the church and then proceeded to the palace which as i said is close at hand on entering the outer enclosure through an ancient gateway we were surprised to find how entire the walls seemed to be but the reason is i suppose that the ruins have not been used as a stonequarry as has almost always been the case with old abbeys and castles the palace took fire and was consumed so far as consumable in while occupied by the soldiers of general hawley but even yet the walls appear so stalwart that i should imagine it quite possible to rebuild and restore the stately rooms on their original plan it was a noble palace one hundred and seventyfive feet in length by one hundred and sixtyfive in breadth and though destitute of much architectural beauty externally yet its aspect from the quadrangle which the four sides enclose is venerable and sadly beautiful at each of the interior angles there is a circular tower up the whole height of the edifice and overtopping it and another in the centre of one of the sides all containing winding staircases the walls facing upon the enclosed quadrangle are pierced with many windows and have been ornamented with sculpture rich traces of which still remain over the arched entranceways and in the grassy centre of the court there is the ruin and broken fragments of a fountain which once used to play for the delight of the king and queen and lords and ladies who looked down upon it from hall and chamber many old carvings that belonged to it are heaped together there but the water has disappeared though had it been a natural spring it would have outlasted all the heavy stonework as far as we were able and could find our way we went through every room of the palace all round the four sides from the first floor upwards it is entirely roofless in some of the chambers there is an accumulation of soil and a goodly crop of grass in others there is still a flooring of flags or brick tiles though damp and mossgrown and with weeds sprouting between the crevices grass and weeds indeed have found soil enough to flourish in even on the highest ranges of the walls though at a dizzy height above the ground and it was like an old and trite touch of romance to see how the weeds sprouted on the many hearthstones and aspired under the chimneyflues as if in emulation of the longextinguished flame it was very mournful very beautiful very delightful too to see how nature takes back the palace now that kings have done with it and adopts it as a part of her great garden on one side of the quadrangle we found the roofless chamber where mary queen of scots was born and in the same range the bedchamber that was occupied by several of the scottish jameses and in one corner of the latter apartment there is a narrow winding staircase down which i groped expecting to find a door either into the enclosed quadrangle or to the outside of the palace but it ends in nothing unless it be a dungeon and one does not well see why the bedchamber of the king should be so convenient to a dungeon it is said that king james iii once escaped down this secret stair and lay concealed from some conspirators who had entered his chamber to murder him this range of apartments is terminated like the other sides of the palace by a circular tower enclosing a staircase up which we mounted winding round and round and emerging at various heights until at last we found ourselves at the very topmost point of the edifice and here there is a small pepperbox of a turret almost as entire as when the stones were first laid it is called queen margarets bower and looks forth on a lovely prospect of mountain and plain and on the old red roofs of linlithgow town and on the little loch that lies within the palace grounds the cold northwind blew chill upon us through the empty windowframes which very likely were never glazed but it must be a delightful nook in a calmer and warmer summer evening descending from this high perch we walked along ledges and through arched corridors and stood contemplative in the dampness of the banquetinghall and sat down on the seats that still occupy the embrasures of the deep windows in one of the rooms the sculpture of a huge fireplace has recently been imitated and restored so as to give an idea of what the richness of the adornments must have been when the building was perfect we burrowed down too a little way in the direction of the cells where prisoners used to be confined but these were too ugly and too impenetrably dark to tempt us far one vault exactly beneath a queens very bedchamber was designated as a prison i should think bad dreams would have winged up and made her pillow an uncomfortable one there seems to be no certain record as respects the date of this palace except that the most recent part was built by james i of england and bears the figures on its central tower in this part were the kitchens and other domestic offices in robert bruces time there was a castle here instead of a palace and an ancestor of our friend bennoch was the means of taking it from the english by a stratagem in which valor went halves four centuries afterwards it was a royal residence and might still have been nominally so had not hawleys dragoons lighted their fires on the floors of the magnificent rooms but on the whole i think it more valuable as a ruin than if it were still perfect scotland and the world needs only one holyrood and linlithgow were it still a perfect palace must have been second in interest to that from its lack of association with historic events so grand and striking after tea we took another walk and this time went along the high street in quest of the house whence bothwellhaugh fired the shot that killed the regent murray it has been taken down however or if any part of it remain it has been built into and incorporated with a small house of dark stone which forms one range with two others that stand a few feet back from the general line of the street it is as meanlooking and commonplace an edifice as is anywhere to be seen and is now occupied by one steele a tailor we went under a square arch if an arch can be square that goes quite through the house and found ourselves in a little court but it was not easy to identify anything as connected with the historic event so we did but glance about us and returned into the street it is here narrow and as bothwellhaugh stood in a projecting gallery the regent must have been within a few yards of the muzzle of his carbine the street looks as old as any that i have seen except perhaps a vista here and there in chester the houses all of stone many of them tall with notched gables and with stone staircases going up outside the steps much worn by feet now dust a pervading ugliness which yet does not fail to be picturesque a general filth and evil odor of gutters and people suggesting sorrowful ideas of what the inner houses must be when the outside looks and smells so badly and finally a great rabble of the inhabitants talking idling sporting staring about their own thresholds and those of dramshops the town being most alive in the long twilight of the summer evening there was nothing uncivil in the deportment of these dirty people old or young but they did stare at us most unmercifully we walked very late entering after all that we had seen into the palace grounds and skirting along linlithgow loch which would be very beautiful if its banks were made shadowy with trees instead of being almost bare we viewed the palace on the outside too and saw what had once been the principal entrance but now looked like an arched window pretty high in the wall for it had not been accessible except by a drawbridge i might write pages in telling how venerable the ruin looked as the twilight fell deeper and deeper around it but we have had enough of linlithgow especially as there have been so many old palaces and old towns to write about and there will still be more we left linlithgow early this morning and reached edinburgh in half an hour tomorrow i suppose i shall try to set down what i see at least some points of it july th arriving at edinburgh and acting under advice of the cabman we drove to addisons alma hotel which we find to be in princes street having scotts monument a few hundred yards below and the castle hill about as much above the edinburgh people seem to be accustomed to climb mountains within their own houses so we had to mount several staircases before we reached our parlor which is a very good one and commands a beautiful view of princes street and of the picturesque old town and the valley between and of the castle on its hill our first visit was to the castle which we reached by going across the causeway that bridges the valley and has some edifices of grecian architecture on it contrasting strangely with the nondescript ugliness of the old town into which we immediately pass as this is my second visit to edinburgh i surely need not dwell upon describing it at such length as if i had never been here before after climbing up through various wards of the castle to the topmost battery where mons meg holds her station looking like an uncouth dragon with a pile of huge stone balls beside her for eggs we found that we could not be admitted to queen marys apartments nor to the crownroom till twelve oclock moreover that there was no admittance to the crownroom without tickets from the crownoffice in parliament square there being no help for it i left my wife and j to wander through the fortress and came down through high street in quest of parliament square which i found after many inquiries of policemen and after first going to the justiciary court where there was a great throng endeavoring to get in for the trial of miss smith for the murder of her lover is causing great excitement just now there was no difficulty made about the tickets and returning found s and j but j grew tired of waiting and set out to return to our hotel through the great strange city all by himself through means of an attendant we were admitted into queen margarets little chapel on the top of the rock and then we sat down in such shelter as there was to avoid the keen wind blowing through the embrasures of the ramparts and waited as patiently as we could twelve oclock came and we went into the crownroom with a throng of other visitors so many that they could only be admitted in separate groups the regalia of scotland lie on a circular table within an iron railing round and round which the visitors pass gazing with all their eyes the room was dark however except for the dim twinkle of a candle or gaslight and the regalia did not show to any advantage though there are some rich jewels set in their ancient gold the articles consist of a twohanded sword with a hilt and scabbard of gold ornamented with gems and a mace with a silver handle all very beautifully made besides the golden collar and jewelled badge of the garter and something else which i forget why they keep this room so dark i cannot tell but it is a poor show and gives the spectator an idea of the poverty of scotland and the minuteness of her sovereignty which i had not gathered from her royal palaces thence we went into queen marys room and saw that beautiful portrait that very queen and very woman with which i was so much impressed at my last visit it is wonderful that this picture does not drive all the other portraits of mary out of the field whatever may be the comparative proofs of their authenticity i do not know the history of this one except that it is a copy by sir william gordon of a picture by an italian preserved at dunrobin castle after seeing what the castle had to show which is but little except itself its rocks and its old dwellings of princes and prisoners we came down through the high street inquiring for john knoxs house it is a strangelooking edifice with gables on high projecting far and some sculpture and inscriptions referring to knox there is a tobacconists shop in the basement story where i learned that the house used to be shown to visitors till within three months but it is now closed for some reason or other thence we crossed a bridge into the new town and came back through princes street to the hotel and had a good dinner as preparatory to fresh wearinesses for there is no other weariness at all to be compared to that of sightseeing in mid afternoon we took a cab and drove to holyrood palace which i have already described as well as the chapel and do not mean to meddle with either of them again we looked at our faces in the old mirrors that queen mary brought from france with her and which had often reflected her own lovely face and figure and i went up the winding stair through which the conspirators ascended this i think was not accessible at my former visit before leaving the palace one of the attendants advised us to see some pictures in the apartments occupied by the marquis of breadalbane during the queens residence here we found some fine old portraits and other paintings by vandyke sir peter lely sir godfrey kneller and a strange head by rubens amid all which i walked wearily wishing that there were nothing worth looking at in the whole world my wife differs altogether from me in this matter but we agreed on this occasion in being tired to death just as we got through with the pictures i became convinced of what i had been dimly suspecting all the while namely that at my last visit to the palace i had seen these selfsame pictures and listened to the selfsame womans civil answers in just the selfsame miserable weariness of mood we left the palace and toiled up through the dirty canongate looking vainly for a fly and employing our time as well as we could in looking at the squalid mob of edinburgh and peeping down the horrible vistas of the closes which were swarming with dirty life as some mouldy and halfdecayed substance might swarm with insects vistas down alleys where sin sorrow poverty drunkenness all manner of sombre and sordid earthly circumstances had imbued the stone brick and wood of the habitations for hundreds of years and such a multitude of children too that was a most striking feature after tea i went down into the valley between the old town and the new which is now laid out as an ornamental garden with grass shrubbery flowers gravelled walks and frequent seats here the sun was setting and gilded the old town with its parting rays making it absolutely the most picturesque scene possible to be seen the mass of tall ancient houses heaped densely together looked like a gothic dream for there seemed to be towers and all sorts of stately architecture and spires ascended out of the mass and above the whole was the castle with a diadem of gold on its topmost turret it wanted less than a quarter of nine when the last gleam faded from the windows of the old town and left the crowd of buildings dim and indistinguishable to reappear on the morrow in squalor lifting their meanness skyward the home of layer upon layer of unfortunate humanity the change symbolized the difference between a poets imagination of life in the past or in a state which he looks at through a colored and illuminated medium and the sad reality this morning we took a cab and set forth between ten and eleven to see edinburgh and its environs driving past the university and other noticeable objects in the old town and thence out to arthurs seat salisbury crags are a very singular feature of the outskirts from the heights beneath arthurs seat we had a fine prospect of the sea with leith and portobello in the distance and of a fertile plain at the foot of the hill in the course of our drive our cabman pointed out dumbiedikes house also the cottage of jeanie deans at least the spot where it formerly stood and muschats cairn of which a small heap of stones is yet remaining near this latter object are the ruins of st anthonys chapel a roofless gable and other remains standing on the abrupt hillside we drove homeward past a paradeground on which a body of cavalry was exercising and we met a company of infantry on their route thither then we drove near calton hill which seems to be not a burialground although the site of stately monuments in fine we passed through the grassmarket where we saw the cross in the pavement in the street marking the spot as i recorded before where porteous was executed thence we passed through the cowgate all the latter part of our drive being amongst the tall quaint edifices of the old town alike venerable and squalid from the grassmarket the rock of the castle looks more precipitous than as we had hitherto seen it and its prisons palaces and barracks approach close to its headlong verge and form one steep line with its descent we drove quite round the castle hill and returned down princes street to our hotel there can be no other city in the world that affords more splendid scenery both natural and architectural than edinburgh then we went to st giless cathedral which i shall not describe it having been kirkified into three interior divisions by the covenanters and i left my wife to take drawings while j and i went to shorts observatory near the entrance of the castle here we saw a cameraobscura which brought before us without our stirring a step almost all the striking objects which we had been wandering to and fro to see we also saw the mites in cheese gigantically magnified by a solar microscope likewise some dioramic views with all which i was mightily pleased and for myself being tired to death of sights i would as lief see them as anything else we found on calling for mamma at st giless that she had gone away but she rejoined us between four and five oclock at our hotel where the next thing we did was to dine again after dinner we walked out looking at the shopwindows of jewellers where ornaments made of cairngorm pebbles are the most peculiar attraction as it was our weddingday i gave s a golden and amethystbodied cairngorm beetle with a ruby head and after sitting awhile in princes street gardens we came home july th last evening i walked round the castle rock and through the grassmarket where i stood on the inlaid cross in the pavement thence down the high street beyond john knoxs house the throng in that part of the town was very great there is a strange fascination in these old streets and in the peeps down the closes but it doubtless would be a great blessing were a fire to sweep through the whole of ancient edinburgh this system of living on flats up to i know not what story must be most unfavorable to cleanliness since they have to fetch their water all that distance towards heaven and how they get rid of their rubbish is best known to themselves my wife has gone to roslin this morning and since her departure it has been drizzly so that j and i after a walk through the new part of the town are imprisoned in our parlor with little resource except to look across the valley to the castle where mons meg is plainly visible on the upper platform and the lower ramparts zigzagging about the edge of the precipice which nearly in front of us is concealed or softened by a great deal of shrubbery but farther off descends steeply down to the grass below somewhere on this side of the rock was the point where claverhouse on quitting edinburgh before the battle of killiecrankie clambered up to hold an interview with the duke of gordon what an excellent thing it is to have such striking and indestructible landmarks and timemarks that they serve to affix historical incidents to and thus as it were nail down the past for the benefit of all future ages the old town of edinburgh appears to be situated in its densest part on the broad back of a ridge which rises gradually to its termination in the precipitous rock on which stands the castle between the old town and the new is the valley which runs along at the base of this ridge and which in its natural state was probably rough and broken like any mountain gorge the lower part of the valley adjacent to the canongate is now a broad hollow space fitted up with dwellings shops or manufactories the next portion between two bridges is converted into an ornamental garden free to the public and contains scotts beautiful monument a canopy of gothic arches and a fantastic spire beneath which he sits thoughtful and observant of what passes in the contiguous street the third portion of the valley above the last bridge is another ornamental garden open only to those who have passkeys it is an admirable garden with a great variety of surface and extends far round the castle rock with paths that lead up to its very base among leafy depths of shrubbery and winds beneath the sheer black precipice j and i walked there this forenoon and took refuge from a shower beneath an overhanging jut of the rock where a bench had been placed and where a curtain of hanging ivy helped to shelter us on our return to the hotel we found mamma just alighting from a cab she had had very bad fortune in her excursion to roslin having had to walk a long distance to the chapel and being caught in the rain and after all she could only spend seven minutes in viewing the beautiful roslin architecture melrose july th we left edinburgh where we had found at addisons princes street the most comfortable hotel in great britain and went to melrose where we put up at the george this is all travelled ground with me so that i need not much perplex myself with further description especially as it is impossible by any repetition of attempts to describe melrose abbey we went thither immediately after tea and were shown over the ruins by a very delectable old scotchman incomparably the best guide i ever met with i think he must take pains to speak the scotch dialect he does it with such pungent felicity and effect and it gives a flavor to everything he says like the mustard and vinegar in a salad this is not the man i saw when here before the scotch dialect is still in a greater or less degree universally prevalent in scotland insomuch that we generally find it difficult to comprehend the answers to our questions though more i think from the unusual intonation than either from strange words or pronunciation but this old man though he spoke the most unmitigated scotch was perfectly intelligible perhaps because his speech so well accorded with the classic standard of the waverley novels moreover he is thoroughly acquainted with the abbey stone by stone and it was curious to see him as we walked among its aisles and over the grass beneath its roofless portions pick up the withered leaves that had fallen there and do other such little things as a good housewife might do to a parlor i have met with two or three instances where the guardian of an old edifice seemed really to love it and this was one although the old man evidently had a scotch covenanters contempt and dislike of the faith that founded the abbey he repeated king davids dictum that king david the first was a sair saint for the crown as bestowing so much wealth on religious edifices but really unless it be walter scott i know not any scotchman who has done so much for his country as this same st david as the founder of melrose and many other beautiful churches and abbeys he left magnificent specimens of the only kind of poetry which the age knew how to produce and the world is the better for him to this day which is more i believe than can be said of any hero or statesman in scottish annals we went all over the ruins of course and saw the marble stone of king alexander and the spot where bruces heart is said to be buried and the slab of michael scott with the cross engraved upon it also the exquisitely sculptured kailleaves and other foliage and flowers with which the gothic artists inwreathed this edifice bestowing more minute and faithful labor than an artist of these days would do on the most delicate piece of cabinetwork we came away sooner than we wished but we hoped to return thither this morning and for my part i cherish a presentiment that this will not be our last visit to scotland and melrose j and i then walked to the tweed where we saw two or three people angling with naked legs or trousers turned up and wading among the rude stones that make something like a dam over the wide and brawling stream i did not observe that they caught any fish but j was so fascinated with the spectacle that he pulled out his poor little fishingline and wished to try his chance forthwith i never saw the anglers instinct stronger in anybody we walked across the footbridge that here spans the tweed and j observed that he did not see how william of deloraine could have found so much difficulty in swimming his horse across so shallow a river neither do i it now began to sprinkle and we hastened back to the hotel it was not a pleasant morning but we started immediately after breakfast for abbotsford which is but about three miles distant the country between melrose and that place is not in the least beautiful nor very noteworthy one or two old irregular villages one tower that looks principally domestic yet partly warlike and seems to be of some antiquity and an undulation or rounded hilly surface of the landscape sometimes affording wide vistas between the slopes these hills which i suppose are some of them on the abbotsford estate are partly covered with woods but of scotch fir or some tree of that species which creates no softened undulation but overspreads the hill like a tightly fitting wig it is a cold dreary disheartening neighborhood that of abbotsford at least it has appeared so to me at both of my visits one of which was on a bleak and windy may morning and this one on a chill showery morning of midsummer the entranceway to the house is somewhat altered since my last visit and we now following the direction of a painted finger on the wall went round to a side door in the basement story where we found an elderly man waiting as if in expectation of visitors he asked us to write our names in a book and told us that the desk on the leaf of which it lay was the one in which sir walter found the forgotten manuscript of waverley while looking for some fishingtackle there was another desk in the room which had belonged to the colonel gardiner who appears in waverley the first apartment into which our guide showed us was sir walters study where i again saw his clothes and remarked how the sleeve of his old green coat was worn at the cuff a minute circumstance that seemed to bring sir walter very near me thence into the library thence into the drawingroom whence methinks we should have entered the diningroom the most interesting of all as being the room where he died but this room seems not to be shown now we saw the armory with the gun of rob roy into the muzzle of which i put my finger and found the bore very large the beautifully wrought pistol of claverhouse and a pair of pistols that belonged to napoleon the sword of montrose which i grasped and drew half out of the scabbard and queen marys iron jewelbox six or eight inches long and two or three high with a lid rounded like that of a trunk and much corroded with rust there is no use in making a catalogue of these curiosities the feeling in visiting abbotsford is not that of awe it is little more than going to a museum i do abhor this mode of making pilgrimages to the shrines of departed great men there is certainly something wrong in it for it seldom or never produces in me at least the right feeling it is an odd truth too that a house is forever after spoiled and ruined as a home by having been the abode of a great man his spirit haunts it as it were with a malevolent effect and takes hearth and hall away from the nominal possessors giving all the world the right to enter there because he had such intimate relations with all the world we had intended to go to dryburgh abbey but as the weather more than threatened rain we gave up the idea and so took the rail for berwick after one oclock on our road we passed several ruins in scotland and some in england one old castle in particular beautifully situated beside a deepbanked stream the road lies for many miles along the coast affording a fine view of the german ocean which was now blue sunny and breezy the day having risen out of its morning sulks we waited an hour or more at berwick and j and i took a hasty walk into the town it is a rough and rude assemblage of rather mean houses some of which are thatched there seems to have been a wall about the town at a former period and we passed through one of the gates the view of the river tweed here is very fine both above and below the railway bridge and especially where it flows a broad tide and between high banks into the sea thence we went onward along the coast as i have said pausing a few moments in smoky newcastle and reaching durham about eight oclock durham i wandered out in the dusk of the evening for the dusk comes on comparatively early as we draw southward and found a beautiful and shadowy path along the riverside skirting its high banks up and adown which grow noble elms i could not well see in that obscurity of twilight boughs whither i was going or what was around me but i judged that the castle or cathedral or both crowned the highest line of the shore and that i was walking at the base of their walls there was a pair of lovers in front of me and i passed two or three other tender couples the walk appeared to go on interminably by the riverside through the same sweet shadow but i turned and found my way into the cathedral close beneath an ancient archway whence issuing again i inquired my way to the waterloo hotel where we had put up items we saw the norham castle of marmion at a short distance from the station of the same name viewed from the railway it has not a very picturesque appearance a high square ruin of what i suppose was the keep at abbotsford treasured up in a glass case in the drawingroom were memorials of sir walter scotts servants and humble friends for instance a brass snuffbox of tom purdie there too among precious relics of illustrious persons in the armory i grasped with some interest the sword of sir adam ferguson which he had worn in the peninsular war our guide said of his own knowledge that he was a very funny old gentleman he died only a year or two since july th the morning after our arrival in durham being sunday we attended service in the cathedral we found a tolerable audience seated on benches within and in front of the choir and people continually strayed in and out of the sunny churchyard and sat down or walked softly and quietly up and down the side aisle sometimes too one of the vergers would come in with a handful of little boys whom he had caught playing among the tombstones durham cathedral has one advantage over the others which i have seen there being no organscreen nor any sort of partition between the choir and nave so that we saw its entire length nearly five hundred feet in one vista the pillars of the nave are immensely thick but hardly of proportionate height and they support the round norman arch nor is there as far as i remember a single pointed arch in the cathedral the effect is to give the edifice an air of heavy grandeur it seems to have been built before the best style of church architecture had established itself so that it weighs upon the soul instead of helping it to aspire first there are these round arches supported by gigantic columns then immediately above another row of round arches behind which is the usual gallery that runs as it were in the thickness of the wall around the nave of the cathedral then above all another row of round arches enclosing the windows of the clerestory the great pillars are ornamented in various ways some with a great spiral groove running from bottom to top others with two spirals ascending in different directions so as to cross over one another some are fluted or channelled straight up and down some are wrought with chevrons like those on the sleeve of a policeinspector there are zigzag cuttings and carvings which i do not know how to name scientifically round the arches of the doors and windows but nothing that seems to have flowered out spontaneously as natural incidents of a grand and beautiful design in the nave between the columns of the side aisles i saw one or two monuments the cathedral service is very long and though the choral part of it is pleasant enough i thought it not best to wait for the sermon especially as it would have been quite unintelligible so remotely as i sat in the great space so i left my seat and after strolling up and down the aisle a few times sallied forth into the churchyard on the cathedral door there is a curious old knocker in the form of a monstrous face which was placed there centuries ago for the benefit of fugitives from justice who used to be entitled to sanctuary here the exterior of the cathedral being huge is therefore grand it has a great central tower and two at the western end and reposes in vast and heavy length without the multitude of niches and crumbling statues and richness of detail that make the towers and fronts of some cathedrals so endlessly interesting one piece of sculpture i remember a carving of a cow a milkmaid and a monk in reference to the legend that the site of the cathedral was in some way determined by a woman bidding her cow go home to dunholme cadmus was guided to the site of his destined city in some such way as this it was a very beautiful day and though the shadow of the cathedral fell on this side yet it being about noontide it did not cover the churchyard entirely but left many of the graves in sunshine there were not a great many monuments and these were chiefly horizontal slabs some of which looked aged but on closer inspection proved to be mostly of the present century i observed an old stone figure however half worn away which seemed to have something like a bishops mitre on its head and may perhaps have lain in the proudest chapel of the cathedral before occupying its present bed among the grass about fifteen paces from the central tower and within its shadow i found a weatherworn slab of marble seven or eight feet long the inscription on which interested me somewhat it was to the memory of robert dodsley the bookseller johnsons acquaintance who as his tombstone rather superciliously avers had made a much better figure as an author than could have been expected in his rank of life but after all it is inevitable that a mans tombstone should look down on him or at all events comport itself towards him de haut en bas i love to find the graves of men connected with literature they interest me more even though of no great eminence than those of persons far more illustrious in other walks of life i know not whether this is because i happen to be one of the literary kindred or because all men feel themselves akin and on terms of intimacy with those whom they know or might have known in books i rather believe that the latter is the case my wife had stayed in the cathedral but she came out at the end of the sermon and told me of two little birds who had got into the vast interior and were in great trouble at not being able to find their way out again thus two winged souls may often have been imprisoned within a faith of heavy ceremonials we went round the edifice and passing into the close penetrated through an arched passage into the crypt which methought was in a better style of architecture than the nave and choir at one end stood a crowd of venerable figures leaning against the wall being stone images of bearded saints apostles patriarchs kings personages of great dignity at all events who had doubtless occupied conspicuous niches in and about the cathedral till finally imprisoned in this cellar i looked at every one and found not an entire nose among them nor quite so many heads as they once had thence we went into the cloisters which are entire but not particularly interesting indeed this cathedral has not taken hold of my affections except in one aspect when it was exceedingly grand and beautiful after looking at the crypt and the cloisters we returned through the close and the churchyard and went back to the hotel through a path by the riverside this is the same dim and dusky path through which i wandered the night before and in the sunshine it looked quite as beautiful as i knew it must a shadow of elmtrees clothing the high bank and overarching the paths above and below some of the elms growing close to the waterside and flinging up their topmost boughs not nearly so high as where we stood and others climbing upward and upward till our way wound among their roots while through the foliage the quiet river loitered along with this lovely shade on both its banks to pass through the centre of the town the stately cathedral rose high above us and farther onward in a line with it the battlemented walls of the old norman castle gray and warlike though now it has become a university this delightful walk terminates at an old bridge in the heart of the town and the castle hangs immediately over its busiest street on this bridge last night in the embrasure or just over the pier where there is a stone seat i saw some old men seated smoking their pipes and chatting in my judgment a river flowing through the centre of a town and not too broad to make itself familiar nor too swift but idling along as if it loved better to stay there than to go is the pleasantest imaginable piece of scenery so transient as it is and yet enduring just the same from lifes end to lifes end and this river wear with its sylvan wildness and yet so sweet and placable is the best of all little rivers not that it is so very small but with a bosom broad enough to be crossed by a threearched bridge just above the cathedral there is a mill upon its shore as ancient as the times of the abbey we went homeward through the marketplace and one or two narrow streets for the town has the irregularity of all ancient settlements and moreover undulates upward and downward and is also made more unintelligible to a stranger in its points and bearings by the tortuous course of the river after dinner j and i walked along the bank opposite to that on which the cathedral stands and found the paths there equally delightful with those which i have attempted to describe we went onward while the river gleamed through the foliage beneath us and passed so far beyond the cathedral that we began to think we were getting into the country and that it was time to return when all at once we saw a bridge before us and beyond that on the opposite bank of the wear the cathedral itself the stream had made a circuit without our knowing it we paused upon the bridge and admired and wondered at the beauty and glory of the scene with those vast ancient towers rising out of the green shade and looking as if they were based upon it the situation of durham cathedral is certainly a noble one finer even than that of lincoln though the latter stands even at a more lordly height above the town but as i saw it then it was grand venerable and sweet all at once and i never saw so lovely and magnificent a scene nor being content with this do i care to see a better the castle beyond came also into the view and the whole picture was mirrored in the tranquil stream below and so crossing the bridge the path led us back through many a bower of hollow shade and we then quitted the hotel and took the rail for york where we arrived at about half past nine we put up at the black swan with which we had already made acquaintance at our previous visit to york it is a very ancient hotel for in the coffeeroom i saw on the wall an old printed advertisement announcing that a stagecoach would leave the black swan in london and arrive at the black swan in york with gods permission in four days the date was and still after a hundred and fifty years the black swan receives travellers in coney street it is a very good hotel and was much thronged with guests when we arrived as the sessions come on this week we found a very smart waiter whose english faculties have been brightened by a residence of several years in america in the morning before breakfast i strolled out and walked round the cathedral passing on my way the sheriffs javelinmen in long gowns of faded purple embroidered with gold carrying halberds in their hands also a gentleman in a cocked hat goldlace and breeches who no doubt had something to do with the ceremonial of the sessions i saw too a procession of a good many old cabs and other carriages filled with people and a banner flaunting above each vehicle these were the pianoforte makers of york who were going out of town to have a jollification together after breakfast we all went to the cathedral and no sooner were we within it than we found how much our eyes had recently been educated by our greater power of appreciating this magnificent interior for it impressed us both with a joy that we never felt before j felt it too and insisted that the cathedral must have been altered and improved since we were last here but it is only that we have seen much splendid architecture since then and so have grown in some degree fitted to enjoy it york cathedral i say it now for it is my present feeling is the most wonderful work that ever came from the hands of man indeed it seems like a house not made with hands but rather to have come down from above bringing an awful majesty and sweetness with it and it is so light and aspiring with all its vast columns and pointed arches that one would hardly wonder if it should ascend back to heaven again by its mere spirituality positively the pillars and arches of the choir are so very beautiful that they give the impression of being exquisitely polished though such is not the fact but their beauty throws a gleam around them i thank god that i saw this cathedral again and i thank him that he inspired the builder to make it and that mankind has so long enjoyed it and will continue to enjoy it july th we left york at twelve oclock and were delayed an hour or two at leeds waiting for a train i strolled up into the town and saw a fair with puppetshows booths of penny actors merrygorounds clowns boxers and other such things as i saw above a year ago at greenwich fair and likewise at tranmere during the whitsuntide holidays we resumed our journey and reached southport in pretty good trim at about nine oclock it has been a very interesting tour we find southport just as we left it with its regular streets of little and big lodginghouses where the visitors perambulate to and fro without any imaginable object the tide too seems not to have been up over the waste of sands since we went away and far seaward stands the same row of bathingmachines and just on the verge of the horizon a gleam of water even this being not the sea but the mouth of the river ribble seeking the sea amid the sandy desert but we shall soon say goodby to southport old trafford manchester july d we left southport for good on the th and have established ourselves in this place in lodgings that had been provided for us by mr swain our principal object being to spend a few weeks in the proximity of the arts exhibition we are here about three miles from the victoria railway station in manchester on one side and nearly a mile from the exhibition on the other this is a suburb of manchester and consists of a long street called the stratford road bordered with brick houses two stories high such as are usually the dwellings of tradesmen or respectable mechanics but which are now in demand for lodgings at high prices on account of the exhibition it seems to be rather a new precinct of the city and the houses though ranged along a continuous street are but a brick border of the green fields in the rear occasionally you get a glimpse of this country aspect between two houses but the street itself even with its little grassplots and bits of shrubbery under the front windows is as ugly as it can be made some of the houses are better than i have described but the brick used here in building is very unsightly in hue and surface betimes in the morning the exhibition omnibuses begin to trundle along and pass at intervals of two and a half minutes through the day immense vehicles constructed to carry thirtynine passengers and generally with a good part of that number inside and out the omnibuses are painted scarlet bordered with white have three horses abreast and a conductor in a red coat they perform the journey from this point into town in about half an hour and yesterday morning being in a hurry to get to the railway station i found that i could outwalk them taking into account their frequent stoppages we have taken the whole house except some inscrutable holes into which the family creeps of respectable people who never took lodgers until this juncture their furniture however is of the true lodginghouse pattern sofas and chairs which have no possibility of repose in them rickety tables an old piano and old music with lady helen elizabeth somebodys name written on it it is very strange how nothing but a genuine home can ever look homelike they appear to be good people a little girl of twelve a daughter waits on table and there is an elder daughter who yesterday answered the doorbell looking very like a young lady besides five or six smaller children who make less uproar of grief or merriment than could possibly be expected the husband is not apparent though i see his hat in the hall the house is new and has a trim lightcolored interior of halfgentility i suppose the rent in ordinary times might be pounds per annum but we pay at the rate of pounds for the part which we occupy this like all the other houses in the neighborhood was evidently built to be sold or let the builder never thought of living in it himself and so that subtile element which would have enabled him to create a home was entirely left out this morning j and i set forth on a walk first towards the palace of the arts exhibition which looked small compared with my idea of it and seems to be of the crystal palace order of architecture only with more iron to its glass its front is composed of three round arches in a row we did not go in turning to the right we walked onward two or three miles passing the botanic garden and thence along by suburban villas belgrave terraces and other such prettinesses in the modern gothic or elizabethan style with fancifully ornamented flowerplats before them thence by hedgerows and fields and through two or three villages with here and there an old plaster and timberbuilt thatched house among a street full of modern brickfronts the alehouse or rural inn being generally the most ancient house in the village it was a sultry heavy day and i walked without much enjoyment of the air and exercise we crossed a narrow and swift river flowing between deep banks it must have been either the mersey still an infant stream and little dreaming of the thousand mighty ships that float on its farther tide or else the irwell which empties into the mersey we passed through the village beyond this stream and went to the railway station and then were brought back to old trafford and deposited close by the exhibition it has showered this afternoon and i beguiled my time for half an hour by setting down the vehicles that went past not that they were particularly numerous but for the sake of knowing the character of the travel along the road july th day before yesterday we went to the arts exhibition of which i do not think that i have a great deal to say the edifice being built more for convenience than show appears better in the interior than from without long vaulted vistas lighted from above extending far away all hung with pictures and on the floor below statues knights in armor cabinets vases and all manner of curious and beautiful things in a regular arrangement scatter five thousand people through the scene and i do not know how to make a better outline sketch i was unquiet from a hopelessness of being able to enjoy it fully nothing is more depressing to me than the sight of a great many pictures together it is like having innumerable books open before you at once and being able to read only a sentence or two in each they bedazzle one another with cross lights there never should be more than one picture in a room nor more than one picture to be studied in one day galleries of pictures are surely the greatest absurdities that ever were contrived there being no excuse for them except that it is the only way in which pictures can be made generally available and accessible we went first into the gallery of british painters where there were hundreds of pictures every one of which would have interested me by itself but i could not fix nay mind on one more than another so i wandered about to get a general idea of the exhibition truly it is very fine truly also every great show is a kind of humbug i doubt whether there were half a dozen people there who got the kind of enjoyment that it was intended to create very respectable people they seemed to be and very well behaved but all skimming the surface as i did and none of them so feeding on what was beautiful as to digest it and make it a part of themselves such a quantity of objects must be utterly rejected before you can get any real profit from one it seemed like throwing away time to look twice even at whatever was most precious and it was dreary to think of not fully enjoying this collection the very flower of time which never bloomed before and never by any possibility can bloom again viewed hastily moreover it is somewhat sad to think that mankind after centuries of cultivation of the beautiful arts can produce no more splendid spectacle than this it is not so very grand although poor as it is i lack capacity to take in even the whole of it what gave me most pleasure because it required no trouble nor study to come at the heart of it were the individual relics of antiquity of which there are some very curious ones in the cases ranged along the principal saloon or nave of the building for example the dagger with which felton killed the duke of buckingham a knife with a bone handle and a curved blade not more than three inches long sharppointed murderouslooking but of very coarse manufacture also the duke of alvas leading staff of iron and the target of the emperor charles v which seemed to be made of hardened leather with designs artistically engraved upon it and gilt i saw wolseys portrait and in close proximity to it his veritable cardinals hat in a richly ornamented glass case on which was an inscription to the effect that it had been bought by charles kean at the sale of horace walpoles collection it is a felt hat with a brim about six inches wide all round and a rather high crown the color was doubtless a bright red originally but now it is mottled with a grayish hue and there are cracks in the brim as if the hat had seen a good deal of wear i suppose a far greater curiosity than this is the signetring of one of the pharaohs who reigned over egypt during josephs prime ministry a large ring to be worn on the thumb if at all of massive gold seal part and all and inscribed with some characters that looked like hebrew i had seen this before in mr mayers collection in liverpool the mediaeval and english relics however interested me more such as the golden and enamelled george worn by sir thomas more or the embroidered shirt of charles i the very one i presume which he wore at his execution there are no bloodmarks on it it being very nicely washed and folded the texture of the linen cloth if linen it be is coarser than any peasant would wear at this day but the needlework is exceedingly fine and elaborate another relic of the same period the cavalier general sir jacob astleys buffcoat with his belt and sword the leather of the buffcoat for i took it between my fingers is about a quarter of an inch thick of the same material as a washleather glove and by no means smoothly dressed though the sleeves are covered with silverlace of old armor there are admirable specimens and it makes ones head ache to look at the iron pots which men used to thrust their heads into indeed at one period they seem to have worn an inner iron cap underneath the helmet i doubt whether there ever was any age of chivalry it certainly was no chivalric sentiment that made men case themselves in impenetrable iron and ride about in iron prisons fearfully peeping at their enemies through little slits and gimletholes the unprotected breast of a private soldier must have shamed his leaders in those days the point of honor is very different now i mean to go again and again many times more and will take each day some one department and so endeavor to get some real use and improvement out of what i see much that is most valuable must be immitigably rejected but something according to the measure of my poor capacity will really be taken into my mind after all it was an agreeable day and i think the next one will be more so july th day before yesterday i paid a second visit to the exhibition and devoted the day mainly to seeing the works of british painters which fill a very large space two or three great saloons at the right side of the nave among the earliest are hogarths pictures including the sigismunda which i remember to have seen before with her lovers heart in her hand looking like a monstrous strawberry and the march to finchley than which nothing truer to english life and character was ever painted nor ever can be and a large stately portrait of captain coram and others all excellent in proportion as they come near to ordinary life and are wrought out through its forms all english painters resemble hogarth in this respect they cannot paint anything high heroic and ideal and their attempts in that direction are wearisome to look at but they sometimes produce good effects by means of awkward figures in illmade coats and smallclothes and hard coarsecomplexioned faces such as they might see anywhere in the street they are strong in homeliness and ugliness weak in their efforts at the beautiful sir thomas lawrence attains a sort of grace which you feel to be a trick and therefore get disgusted with it reynolds is not quite genuine though certainly he has produced some noble and beautiful heads but hogarth is the only english painter except in the landscape department there are no others who interpret life to me at all unless it be some of the modern preraphaelites pretty village scenes of common life pleasant domestic passages with a touch of easy humor in them little pathoses and fancynesses are abundant enough and wilkie to be sure has done more than this though not a great deal more his merit lies not in a high aim but in accomplishing his aim so perfectly it is unaccountable that the english painters achievements should be so much inferior to those of the english poets who have really elevated the human mind but to be sure painting has only become an english art subsequently to the epochs of the greatest poets and since the beginning of the last century during which england had no poets i respect haydon more than i once did not for his pictures they being detestable to see but for his heroic rejection of whatever his countrymen and he himself could really do and his bitter resolve to achieve something higher failing in which he died no doubt i am doing vast injustice to a great many gifted men in what i have here written as for instance copley who certainly has painted a slain man to the life and to a crowd of landscapepainters who have made wonderful reproductions of little english streams and shrubbery and cottage doors and country lanes and there is a picture called the evening gun by danby a ship of war on a calm glassy tide at sunset with the cannonsmoke puffing from her porthole it is very beautiful and so effective that you can even hear the report breaking upon the stillness with so grand a roar that it is almost like stillness too as for turner i care no more for his lightcolored pictures than for so much lacquered ware or painted gingerbread doubtless this is my fault my own deficiency but i cannot help it not at least without sophisticating myself by the effort the only modern pictures that accomplish a higher end than that of pleasing the eye the only ones that really take hold of my mind and with a kind of acerbity like unripe fruit are the works of hunt and one or two other painters of the preraphaelite school they seem wilfully to abjure all beauty and to make their pictures disagreeable out of mere malice but at any rate for the thought and feeling which are ground up with the paint they will bear looking at and disclose a deeper value the longer you look never was anything so stiff and unnatural as they appear although every single thing represented seems to be taken directly out of life and reality and as it were pasted down upon the canvas they almost paint even separate hairs accomplishing so much and so perfectly it seems unaccountable that the picture does not live but nature has an art beyond these painters and they leave out some medium some enchantment that should intervene and keep the object from pressing so baldly and harshly upon the spectators eyeballs with the most lifelike reproduction there is no illusion i think if a semiobscurity were thrown over the picture after finishing it to this nicety it might bring it nearer to nature i remember a heap of autumn leaves every one of which seems to have been stiffened with gum and varnish and then put carefully down into the stiffly disordered heap perhaps these artists may hereafter succeed in combining the truth of detail with a broader and higher truth coming from such a depth as their pictures do and having really an idea as the seed of them it is strange that they should look like the most madeup things imaginable one picture by hunt that greatly interested me was of some sheep that had gone astray among heights and precipices and i could have looked all day at these poor lost creatures so true was their meek alarm and hopeless bewilderment their huddling together without the slightest confidence of mutual help all that the courage and wisdom of the bravest and wisest of them could do being to bleat and only a few having spirits enough even for this after going through these modern masters among whom were some french painters who do not interest me at all i did a miscellaneous business chiefly among the watercolors and photographs and afterwards among the antiquities and works of ornamental art i have forgotten what i saw except the breastplate and helmet of henry of navarre of steel engraved with designs that have been half obliterated by scrubbing i remember too a breastplate of an elector of saxony with a bullethole through it he received his mortal wound through that hole and died of it two days afterwards three hundred years ago there was a crowd of visitors insomuch that it was difficult to get a satisfactory view of the most interesting objects they were nearly all middlingclass people the exhibition i think does not reach the lower classed at all in fact it could not reach them nor their betters either without a good deal of study to help it out i shall go today and do my best to get profit out of it july th we all with r and fanny went to the exhibition yesterday and spent the day there not j however for he went to the botanical gardens after some little skirmishing with other things i devoted myself to the historical portraits which hang on both sides of the great nave and went through them pretty faithfully the oldest are pictures of richard ii and henry iv and edward iv and jane shore and seem to have little or no merit as works of art being cold and stiff the life having perhaps faded out of them but these older painters were trustworthy inasmuch as they had no idea of making a picture but only of getting the face before them on canvas as accurately as they could all english history scarcely supplies half a dozen portraits before the time of henry viii after that period and through the reigns of elizabeth and james there are many ugly pictures by dutchmen and italians and the collection is wonderfully rich in portraits of the time of charles i and the commonwealth vandyke seems to have brought portraitpainting into fashion and very likely the kings love of art diffused a taste for it throughout the nation and remotely suggested even to his enemies to get their pictures painted elizabeth has perpetuated her cold thin visage on many canvases and generally with some fantasy of costume that makes her ridiculous to all time there are several of mary of scotland none of which have a gleam of beauty but the stiff old brushes of these painters could not catch the beautiful of all the older pictures the only one that i took pleasure in looking at was a portrait of lord deputy falkland by vansomer in james is time a very stately fulllength figure in white looking out of the picture as if he saw you the catalogue says that this portrait suggested an incident in horace walpoles castle of otranto but i do not remember it i have a haunting doubt of the value of portraitpainting that is to say whether it gives you a genuine idea of the person purporting to be represented i do not remember ever to have recognized a man by having previously seen his portrait vandykes pictures are full of grace and nobleness but they do not look like englishmen the burly rough wineflushed and weatherreddened faces and sturdy flesh and blood which we see even at the present day when they must naturally have become a good deal refined from either the country gentleman or the courtier of the stuarts age there is an old fat portrait of gervoyse holles in a buffcoat a coarse hoggish yet manly man the painter is unknown but i honor him and gervoyse holles too for one was willing to be truly rendered and the other dared to do it it seems to be the aim of portraitpainters generally especially of those who have been most famous to make their pictures as beautiful and noble as can anywise consist with retaining the very slightest resemblance to the person sitting to them they seldom attain even the grace and beauty which they aim at but only hit some temporary or individual taste vandyke however achieved graces that rise above time and fashion and so did sir peter lely in his female portraits but the doubt is whether the works of either are genuine history not more so i suspect than the narrative of a historian who should seek to make poetry out of the events which he relates rejecting those which could not possibly be thus idealized i observe furthermore that a fulllength portrait has seldom face enough not that it lacks its fair proportion by measurement but the artist does not often find it possible to make the face so intellectually prominent as to subordinate the figure and drapery vandyke does this however in his pictures of charles i for instance it is the melancholy grace of the visage that attracts the eye and it passes to the rest of the composition only by an effort earlier and later pictures are but a few inches of face to several feet of figure and costume and more insignificant than the latter because seldom so well done and i suspect the same would generally be the case now only that the present simplicity of costume gives the face a chance to be seen i was interrupted here and cannot resume the thread but considering how much of his own conceit the artist puts into a portrait how much affectation the sitter puts on and then again that no face is the same to any two spectators also that these portraits are darkened and faded with age and can seldom be more than half seen being hung too high or somehow or other inconvenient on the whole i question whether there is much use in looking at them the truest test would be for a man well read in english history and biography and himself an observer of insight to go through the series without knowing what personages they represented and write beneath each the name which the portrait vindicated for itself after getting through the portraitgallery i went among the engravings and photographs and then glanced along the old masters but without seriously looking at anything while i was among the dutch painters a gentleman accosted me it was mr j whom i once met at dinner with bennoch he told me that the poet laureate as he called him was in the exhibition rooms and as i expressed great interest mr jwas kind enough to go in quest of him not for the purpose of introduction however for he was not acquainted with tennyson soon mr jreturned and said that he had found the poet laureate and going into the saloon of the old masters we saw him there in company with mr woolner whose bust of him is now in the exhibition gazing at him with all my eyes i liked him well and rejoiced more in him than in all the other wonders of the exhibition how strange that in these two or three pages i cannot get one single touch that may call him up hereafter i would most gladly have seen more of this one poet of our day but forbore to follow him for i must own that it seemed mean to be dogging him through the saloons or even to look at him since it was to be done stealthily if at all he is as unenglish as possible indeed an englishman of genius usually lacks the national characteristics and is great abnormally even the great sailor nelson was unlike his countrymen in the qualities that constituted him a hero he was not the perfection of an englishman but a creature of another kind sensitive nervous excitable and really more like a frenchman unenglish as he was tennyson had not however an american look i cannot well describe the difference but there was something more mellow in him softer sweeter broader more simple than we are apt to be living apart from men as he does would hurt any one of us more than it does him i may as well leave him here for i cannot touch the central point august d day before yesterday i went again to the exhibition and began the day with looking at the old masters positively i do begin to receive some pleasure from looking at pictures but as yet it has nothing to do with any technical merit nor do i think i shall ever get so far as that some landscapes by ruysdael and some portraits by murillo velasquez and titian were those which i was most able to appreciate and i see reason for allowing contrary to my opinion as expressed a few pages back that a portrait may preserve some valuable characteristics of the person represented the pictures in the english portraitgallery are mostly very bad and that may be the reason why i saw so little in them i saw too at this last visit a virgin and child which appeared to me to have an expression more adequate to the subject than most of the innumerable virgins and children in which we see only repetitions of simple maternity indeed any mother with her first child would serve an artist for one of them but in this picture the virgin had a look as if she were loving the infant as her own child and at the same time rendering him an awful worship as to her creator while i was sitting in the central saloon listening to the music a young man accosted me presuming that i was soandso the american author he himself was a traveller for a publishing firm and he introduced conversation by talking of uttoxeter and my description of it in an annual he said that the account had caused a good deal of pique among the good people of uttoxeter because of the ignorance which i attribute to them as to the circumstance which connects johnson with their town the spot where johnson stood can it appears still be pointed out it is on one side of the marketplace and not in the neighborhood of the church i forget whether i recorded at the time that an uttoxeter newspaper was sent me containing a proposal that a statue or memorial should be erected on the spot it would gratify me exceedingly if such a result should come from my pious pilgrimage thither my new acquaintance who was cockneyish but very intelligent and agreeable went on to talk about many literary matters and characters among others about miss bronte whom he had seen at the chapter coffee house when she and her sister anne first went to london he was at that time connected with the house ofand and he described the surprise and incredulity of mr when this little commonplacelooking woman presented herself as the author of jane eyre his story brought out the insignificance of charlotte brontes aspect and the bluff rejection of her by mr much more strongly than mrs gaskells narrative chorlton road august th we have changed our lodgings since my last date those at old trafford being inconvenient and the landlady a sharp peremptory housewife better fitted to deal with her own family than to be complaisant to guests we are now a little farther from the exhibition and not much better off as regards accommodation but the housekeeper is a pleasant civil sort of a woman auspiciously named mrs honey the house is a specimen of the poorer middleclass dwellings as built nowadays narrow staircase thin walls and being constructed for sale very ill put together indeed the floors with wide cracks between the boards and wide crevices admitting both air and light over the doors so that the house is full of draughts the outer walls it seems to me are but of one brick in thickness and the partition walls certainly no thicker and the movements and sometimes the voices of people in the contiguous house are audible to us the exhibition has temporarily so raised the value of lodgings here that we have to pay a high price for even such a house as this mr wilding having gone on a tour to scotland i had to be at the consulate every day last week till yesterday when i absented myself from duty and went to the exhibition u and i spent an hour together looking principally at the old dutch masters who seem to me the most wonderful set of men that ever handled a brush such lifelike representations of cabbages onions brass kettles and kitchen crockery such blankets with the woollen fuzz upon them such everything i never thought that the skill of man could produce even the photograph cannot equal their miracles the closer you look the more minutely true the picture is found to be and i doubt if even the microscope could see beyond the painters touch gerard dow seems to be the master among these queer magicians a straw mat in one of his pictures is the most miraculous thing that human art has yet accomplished and there is a metal vase with a dent in it that is absolutely more real than reality these painters accomplish all they aim at a praise methinks which can be given to no other men since the world began they must have laid down their brushes with perfect satisfaction knowing that each one of their million touches had been necessary to the effect and that there was not one too few nor too many and it is strange how spiritual and suggestive the commonest household article an earthen pitcher for example becomes when represented with entire accuracy these dutchmen got at the soul of common things and so made them types and interpreters of the spiritual world afterwards i looked at many of the pictures of the old masters and found myself gradually getting a taste for them at least they give me more and more pleasure the oftener i come to see them doubtless i shall be able to pass for a man of taste by the time i return to america it is an acquired taste like that for wines and i question whether a man is really any truer wiser or better for possessing it from the old masters i went among the english painters and found myself more favorably inclined towards some of them than at my previous visits seeing something wonderful even in turners lights and mists and yeasty waves although i should like him still better if his pictures looked in the least like what they typify the most disagreeable of english painters is etty who had a diseased appetite for womans flesh and spent his whole life apparently in painting them with enormously developed busts i do not mind nudity in a modest and natural way but ettys women really thrust their nudity upon you with malice aforethought and the worst of it is they are not beautiful among the last pictures that i looked at was hogarths march to finchley and surely nothing can be covered more thick and deep with english nature than that piece of canvas the face of the tall grenadier in the centre between two women both of whom have claims on him wonderfully expresses trouble and perplexity and every touch in the picture meant something and expresses what it meant the price of admission after two oclock being sixpence the exhibition was thronged with a class of people who do not usually come in such large numbers it was both pleasant and touching to see how earnestly some of them sought to get instruction from what they beheld the english are a good and simple people and take life in earnest august th passing by the gateway of the manchester cathedral the other morning on my way to the station i found a crowd collected and high overhead the bells were chiming for a wedding these chimes of bells are exceedingly impressive so broadly gladsome as they are filling the whole air and every nook of ones heart with sympathy they are good for a people to rejoice with and good also for a marriage because through all their joy there is something solemn a tone of that voice which we have heard so often at funerals it is good to see how everybody up to this old age of the world takes an interest in weddings and seems to have a faith that now at last a couple have come together to make each other happy the high black rough old cathedral tower sent out its chime of bells as earnestly as for any bridegroom and bride that came to be married five hundred years ago i went into the churchyard but there was such a throng of people on its pavement of flat tombstones and especially such a cluster along the pathway by which the bride was to depart that i could only see a white dress waving along and really do not know whether she was a beauty or a fright the happy pair got into a postchaise that was waiting at the gate and immediately drew some crimson curtains and so vanished into their paradise there were two other postchaises and pairs and all three had postilions in scarlet this is the same cathedral where last may i saw a dozen couples married in the lump in a railway carriage two or three days ago an old merchant made rather a good point of one of the uncomfortable results of the electric telegraph he said that formerly a man was safe from bad news such as intelligence of failure of debtors except at the hour of opening his letters in the morning and then he was in some degree prepared for it since among say fifteen letters he would be pretty certain to find some queer one but since the telegraph has come into play he is never safe and may be hit with news of failure shipwreck fall of stocks or whatever disaster at all hours of the day i went to the exhibition on wednesday with u and looked at the pencil sketches of the old masters also at the pictures generally old and new i particularly remember a spring landscape by john linnell the younger it is wonderfully good so tender and fresh that the artist seems really to have caught the evanescent april and made her permanent here at least is eternal spring i saw a little man behind an immense beard whom i take to be the duke of newcastle at least there was a photograph of him in the gallery with just such a beard he was at the palace on that day august th i went again to the exhibition day before yesterday and looked much at both the modern and ancient pictures as also at the watercolors i am making some progress as a connoisseur and have got so far as to be able to distinguish the broader differences of style as for example between rubens and rembrandt i should hesitate to claim any more for myself thus far in fact however i do begin to have a liking for good things and to be sure that they are good murillo seems to me about the noblest and purest painter that ever lived and his good shepherd the loveliest picture i have seen it is a hopeful symptom moreover of improving taste that i see more merit in the crowd of painters than i was at first competent to acknowledge i could see some of their defects from the very first but that is the earliest stage of connoisseurship after a formal and ignorant admiration mounting a few steps higher one sees beauties but how much study how many opportunities are requisite to form and cultivate a taste the exhibition must be quite thrown away on the mass of spectators both they and i are better able to appreciate the specimens of ornamental art contained in the oriental room and in the numerous cases that are ranged up and down the nave the gewgaws of all time are here in precious metals glass china ivory and every other material that could be wrought into curious and beautiful shapes great basins and dishes of embossed gold from the queens sideboard or from the beaufets of noblemen vessels set with precious stones the pastoral staffs of prelates some of them made of silver or gold and enriched with gems and what have been found in the tombs of the bishops state swords and silver maces the rich plate of colleges elaborately wrought great cups salvers tureens that have been presented by loving sons to their alma mater the heirlooms of old families treasured from generation to generation and hitherto only to be seen by favored friends famous historical jewels some of which are painted in the portraits of the historical men and women that hang on the walls numerous specimens of the beautiful old venetian glass some of which looks so fragile that it is a wonder how it could bear even the weight of the wine that used to be poured into it without breaking these are the glasses that tested poison by being shattered into fragments at its touch the strangest and ugliest old crockery pictured over with monstrosities the palissy ware embossed with vegetables fishes lobsters that look absolutely real the delicate sevres china each piece made inestimable by pictures from a masters hand in short it is a despair and misery to see so much that is curious and beautiful and to feel that far the greater portion of it will slip out of the memory and be as if we had never seen it but i mean to look again and again at these things we soon perceive that the present day does not engross all the taste and ingenuity that has ever existed in the mind of man that in fact we are a barren age in that respect august th i went to the exhibition on monday and again yesterday and measurably enjoyed both visits i continue to think however that a picture cannot be fully enjoyed except by long and intimate acquaintance with it nor can i quite understand what the enjoyment of a connoisseur is he is not usually i think a man of deep poetic feeling and does not deal with the picture through his heart nor set it in a poem nor comprehend it morally if it be a landscape he is not entitled to judge of it by his intimacy with nature if a picture of human action he has no experience nor sympathy of lifes deeper passages however as my acquaintance with pictures increases i find myself recognizing more and more the merit of the acknowledged masters of the art but possibly it is only because i adopt the wrong principles which may have been laid down by the connoisseurs but there can be no mistake about murillo not that i am worthy to admire him yet however seeing the many pictures of holy families and the virgin and child which have been painted for churches and convents the idea occurs that it was in this way that the poor monks and nuns gratified as far as they could their natural longing for earthly happiness it was not mary and her heavenly child that they really beheld or wished for but an earthly mother rejoicing over her baby and displaying it probably to the world as an object worthy to be admired by kings as mary does in the adoration of the magi every mother i suppose feels as if her first child deserved everybodys worship i left the exhibition at three oclock and went to manchester where i sought out mr c s in his little office he greeted me warmly and at five we took the omnibus for his house about four miles from town he seems to be on pleasant terms with his neighbors for almost everybody that got into the omnibus exchanged kindly greetings with him and indeed his kindly simple genial nature comes out so evidently that it would be difficult not to like him his house stands with others in a green park a small pretty semidetached suburban residence of brick with a lawn and garden round it in close vicinity there is a deep clough or dell as shaggy and wild as a poet could wish and with a little stream running through it as much as five miles long the interior of the house is very pretty and nicely even handsomely and almost sumptuously furnished and i was very glad to find him so comfortable his recognition as a poet has been hearty enough to give him a feeling of success for he showed me various tokens of the estimation in which he is held for instance a presentation copy of southeys works in which the latter had written amicus amico poeta poetae he said that southey had always been most kind to him there were various other testimonials from people of note american as well as english in his parlor there is a good oilpainting of himself and in the drawingroom a very fine crayon sketch wherein his face handsome and agreeable is lighted up with all a poets ecstasy likewise a large and fine engraving from the picture the government has recognized his poetic merit by a pension of fifty pounds a small sung it is true but enough to mark him out as one who has deserved well of his country the man himself is very good and lovable i was able to gratify him by saying that i had recently seen many favorable notices of his poems in the american newspapers an edition having been published a few months since on our side of the ocean he was much pleased at this and asked me to send him the notices august th i have been two or three times to the exhibition since my last date and enjoy it more as i become familiar with it there is supposed to be about a third of the good pictures here which england contains and it is said that the tory nobility and gentry have contributed to it much more freely and largely than the whigs the duke of devonshire for instance seems to have sent nothing mr ticknor the spanish historian whom i met yesterday observed that we should not think quite so much of this exhibition as the english do after we have been to italy although it is a good school in which to gain a preparatory knowledge of the different styles of art i am glad to hear that there are better things still to be seen nevertheless i should suppose that certain painters are better represented here than they ever have been or will be elsewhere vandyke certainly can be seen nowhere else so well rembrandt and rubens have satisfactory specimens and the whole series of english pictorial achievement is shown more perfectly than within any other walls perhaps it would be wise to devote myself to the study of this latter and leave the foreigners to be studied on their own soil murillo can hardly have done better than in the pictures by him which we see here there is nothing of raphaels here that is impressive titian has some noble portraits but little else that i care to see in all these old masters murillo only excepted it is very rare i must say to find any trace of natural feeling and passion and i am weary of naked goddesses who never had any real life and warmth in the painters imagination or if so it was the impure warmth of an unchaste woman who sat for him last week i dined at mr f heywoods to meet mr adolphus the author of a critical work on the waverley novels published long ago and intended to prove from internal evidence that they were written by sir walter scott his wife was likewise of the party and also a young spanish lady their niece and daughter of a spaniard of literary note she herself has literary tastes and ability and is well known to prescott whom i believe she has assisted in his historical researches and also to professor ticknor and furthermore she is very handsome and unlike an english damsel very youthful and maidenlike and her manners have all ardor and enthusiasm that were pleasant to see especially as she spoke warmly of my writings and yet i should wrong her if i left the impression of her being forthputting and obtrusive for it was not the fact in the least she speaks english like a native insomuch that i should never have suspected her to be anything else my nerves recently have not been in an exactly quiet and normal state i begin to weary of england and need another clime september th i think i paid my last visit to the exhibition and feel as if i had had enough of it although i have got but a small part of the profit it might have afforded me but pictures are certainly quite other things to me now from what they were at my first visit it seems even as if there were a sort of illumination within them that makes me see them more distinctly speaking of pictures the miniature of anne of cleves is here on the faith of which henry viii married her also the picture of the infanta of spain which buckingham brought over to charles i while prince of wales this has a delicate rosy prettiness one rather interesting portion of the exhibition is the refreshmentroom or rather rooms for very much space is allowed both to the first and second classes i have looked most at the latter because there john ball and his wife may be seen in full gulp aid guzzle swallowing vast quantities of cold boiled beef thoroughly moistened with porter or bitter ale and very good meat and drink it is at my last visit on friday i met judge pollock of liverpool who introduced me to a gentleman in a gray slouched hat as mr du val an artist resident in manchester and mr du val invited me to dine with him at six oclock so i went to carlton grove his residence and found it a very pretty house with its own lawn and shrubbery about it there was a mellow fire in the grate which made the drawingroom very cosey and pleasant as the dusk came on before dinner mr du val looked like an artist and like a remarkable man we had very good talk chiefly about the exhibition and du val spoke generously and intelligently of his brotherartists he says that england might furnish five exhibitions each one as rich as the present i find that the most famous picture here is one that i have hardly looked at the three marys by annibal caracci in the drawingroom there were several pictures and sketches by du val one of which i especially liked a misty moonlight picture of the mersey near seacombe i never saw painted such genuine moonlight i took my leave at half past ten and found my cab at the door and my cabman snugly asleep inside of it and when mr du val awoke him he proved to be quite drunk insomuch that i hesitated whether to let him clamber upon the box or to take post myself and drive the cabman home however i propounded two questions to him first whether his horse would go of his own accord and secondly whether be himself was invariably drunk at that time of night because if it were his normal state i should be safer with him drunk than sober being satisfied on these points i got in and was driven home without accident or adventure except indeed that the cabman drew up and opened the door for me to alight at a vacant lot on stratford road just as if there had been a house and home and cheerful lighted windows in that vacancy on my remonstrance he resumed the whip and reins and reached boston terrace at last and thanking me for an extra sixpence as well as he could speak he begged me to inquire for little john whenever i next wanted a cab cabmen are as a body the most illnatured and ungenial men in the world but this poor little man was excellently goodhumored speaking of the former rudeness of manners now gradually refining away of the manchester people judgesaid that when he first knew manchester women meeting his wife in the street would take hold of her dress and say ah three and sixpence a yard the men were very rough after the old lancashire fashion they have always however been a musical people and this may have been a germ of refinement in them they are still much more simple and natural than the liverpool people who love the aristocracy and whom they heartily despise it is singular that the great artexhibition should have come to pass in the rudest great town in england leamington lansdowne cirrus september th we have become quite weary of our small mean uncomfortable and unbeautiful lodgings at chorlton road with poor and scanty furniture within doors and no better prospect from the parlor windows than a mudpuddle larger than most english lakes on a vacant buildinglot opposite our house the exhibition too was fast becoming a bore for you must really love a picture in order to tolerate the sight of it many times moreover the smoky and sooty air of that abominable manchester affected my wifes throat disadvantageously so on a tuesday morning we struck our tent and set forth again regretting to leave nothing except the kind disposition of mrs honey our housekeeper i do not remember meeting with any other lodginghouse keeper who did not grow hateful and fearful on short acquaintance but i attribute this not so much to the people themselves as primarily to the unfair and ungenerous conduct of some of their english guests who feel so sure of being cheated that they always behave as if in an enemys country and therefore they find it one the rain poured down upon us as we drove away in two cabs laden with mountainous luggage to the london road station and the whole day was grim with cloud and moist with showers we went by way of birmingham and stayed three hours at the great dreary station there waiting for the train to leamington whither fanny had gone forward the day before to secure lodgings for us as she is english and understands the matter we all were tired and dull by the time we reached the leamington station where a note from fanny gave us the address of our lodgings lansdowne circus is really delightful after that ugly and grimy suburb of manchester indeed there could not possibly be a greater contrast than between leamington and manchester the latter built only for dirty uses and scarcely intended as a habitation for man the former so cleanly so set out with shade trees so regular in its streets so neatly paved its houses so prettily contrived and nicely stuccoed that it does not look like a portion of the workaday world kenilworth september th the weather was very uncertain through the last week and yesterday morning too was misty and sunless notwithstanding which we took the rail for kenilworth before eleven the distance from leamington is less than five miles and at the kenilworth station we found a little bit of an omnibus into which we packed ourselves together with two ladies one of whom at least was an american i begin to agree partly with the english that we are not a people of elegant manners at all events there is sometimes a bare hard meagre sort of deportment especially in our women that has not its parallel elsewhere but perhaps what sets off this kind of behavior and brings it into alto relievo is the fact of such uncultivated persons travelling abroad and going to see sights that would not be interesting except to people of some education and refinement we saw but little of the village of kenilworth passing through it sidelong fashion in the omnibus but i learn that it has between three and four thousand inhabitants and is of immemorial antiquity we saw a few old gabled and timberframed houses but generally the town was of modern aspect although less so in the immediate vicinity of the castle gate across the road from which there was an inn with bowlinggreens and a little bunch of houses and shops apart from the high road there is a gatehouse ancient but in excellent repair towered turreted and battlemented and looking like a castle in itself until cromwells time the entrance to the castle used to be beneath an arch that passed through this structure but the gatehouse being granted to one of the parliament officers he converted it into a residence and apparently added on a couple of gables which now look quite as venerable as the rest of the edifice admission within the outer grounds of the castle is now obtained through a little wicket close beside the gatehouse at which sat one or two old men who touched their hats to us in humble willingness to accept a fee one of them had guidebooks for sale and finding that we were not to be bothered by a cicerone we bought one of his books the ruins are perhaps two hundred yards from the gatehouse and the road and the space between is a pasture for sheep which also browse in the inner court and shelter themselves in the dungeons and state apartments of the castle goats would be fitter occupants because they would climb to the tops of the crumbling towers and nibble the weeds and shrubbery that grow there the first part of the castle which we reach is called caesars tower being the oldest portion of the ruins and still very stalwart and massive and built of red freestone like all the rest caesars tower being on the right leicesters buildings erected by the earl of leicester queen elizabeths favorite are on the left and between these two formerly stood other structures which have now as entirely disappeared as if they had never existed and through the wide gap thus opened appears the grassy inner court surrounded on three sides by halffallen towers and shattered walls some of these were erected by john of gaunt and among these ruins is the banquetinghall or rather was for it has now neither floor nor roof but only the broken stonework of some tall arched windows and the beautiful old ivied arch of the entranceway now inaccessible from the ground the ivy is very abundant about the ruins and hangs its green curtains quite from top to bottom of some of the windows there are likewise very large and aged trees within the castle there being no roof nor pavement anywhere except in some dungeonlike nooks so that the trees having soil and air enough and being sheltered from unfriendly blasts can grow as if in a nursery hawthorn however next to ivy is the great ornament and comforter of these desolate ruins i have not seen so much nor such thriving hawthorn anywhere else in the court high up on crumbly heights on the sod that carpets roofless rooms everywhere indeed and now rejoicing in plentiful crops of red berries the ivy is even more wonderfully luxuriant its trunks being in some places two or three feet in diameter and forming real buttresses against the walls which are actually supported and vastly strengthened by this parasite that clung to them at first only for its own convenience and now holds them up lest it should be ruined by their fall thus an abuse has strangely grown into a use and i think we may sometimes see the same fact morally in english matters there is something very curious in the close firm grip which the ivy fixes upon the wall closer and closer for centuries neither is it at all nice as to what it clutches in its necessity for support i saw in the outer court an old hawthorntree to which a plant of ivy had married itself and the ivy trunk and the hawthorn trunk were now absolutely incorporated and in their close embrace you could not tell which was which at one end of the banquetinghall there are two large baywindows one of which looks into the inner court and the other affords a view of the surrounding country the former is called queen elizabeths dressingroom beyond the banquetinghall is what is called the strong tower up to the top of which we climbed principally by the aid of the stones that have tumbled down from it a lady sat halfway down the crumbly descent within the castle on a campstool and before an easel sketching this tower on the summit of which we sat she said it was amy robsarts tower and within it open to the day and quite accessible we saw a room that we were free to imagine had been occupied by her i do not find that these associations of real scenes with fictitious events greatly heighten the charm of them by this time the sun had come out brightly and with such warmth that we were glad to sit down in the shadow several sightseers were now rambling about and among them some schoolboys who kept scrambling up to points whither no other animal except a goat would have ventured their shouts and the sunshine made the old castle cheerful and what with the ivy and the hawthorn and the other old trees it was very beautiful and picturesque but a castle does not make nearly so interesting and impressive a ruin as an abbey because the latter was built for beauty and on a plan in which deep thought and feeling were involved and having once been a grand and beautiful work it continues grand and beautiful through all the successive stages of its decay but a castle is rudely piled together for strength and other material conveniences and having served these ends it has nothing left to fall back upon but crumbles into shapeless masses which are often as little picturesque as a pile of bricks without the ivy and the shrubbery this huge kenilworth would not be a pleasant object except for one or two windowframes with broken tracery in the banquetinghall we stayed from eleven till two and identified the various parts of the castle as well as we could by the guidebook the ruins are very extensive though less so than i should have imagined considering that seven acres were included within the castle wall but a large part of the structures have been taken away to build houses in kenilworth village and elsewhere and much too to make roads with and a good deal lies under the green turf in the courtyards inner and outer as we returned to the gate my wife and u went into the gatehouse to see an old chimneypiece and other antiquities and j and i proceeded a little way round the outer wall and saw the remains of the moat and lins tower a real and shattered fabric of john of gaunt the omnibus now drove up and one of the old men at the gate came hobbling up to open the door and was rewarded with a sixpence and we drove down to the kings head we then walked out and bought prints of the castle and inquired our way to the church and to the ruins of the priory the latter so far as we could discover them are very few and uninteresting and the church though it has a venerable exterior and an aged spire has been so modernized within and in so plain a fashion as to have lost what beauty it may once have had there were a few brasses and mural monuments one of which was a marble group of a dying woman and her family by westmacott the sexton was a cheerful little man but knew very little about his church and nothing of the remains of the priory the day was spent very pleasantly amid this beautiful green english scenery these fine old warwickshire trees and broad gently swelling fields liverpool september th i took the train for rugby and thence to liverpool the most noticeable character at mrs blodgetts now is mr t a yankee who has seen the world and gathered much information and experience already though still a young man a handsome man with black curly hair a dark intelligent bright face and rather cold blue eyes but a very pleasant air and address his observing faculties are very strongly developed in his forehead and his reflective ones seem to be adequate to making some if not the deepest use of what he sees he has voyaged and travelled almost all over the world and has recently published a book of his peregrinations which has been well received he is of exceeding fluent talk though rather too much inclined to unfold the secret springs of action in louis napoleon and other potentates and to tell of revolutions that are coming at some unlookedfor moment but soon still i believe in his wisdom and foresight about as much as in any other mans there are no such things he is a merchant and meditates settling in london and making a colossal fortune there during the next ten or twenty years that being the period during which london is to hold the exchanges of the world and to continue its metropolis after that new york is to be the worlds queen city there is likewise here a young american named a who has been at a german university and favors us with descriptions of his student life there which seems chiefly to have consisted in drinking beer and fighting duels he shows a cut on his nose as a trophy of these combats he has with him a dog of st bernard who is a much more remarkable character than himself an immense dog a noble and gentle creature and really it touches my heart that his master is going to take him from his native snowmountain to a southern plantation to die mr asays that there are now but five of these dogs extant at the convent there having within two or three years been a disease among them with which this dog also has suffered his master has a certificate of his genuineness and of himself being the rightful purchaser and he says that as he descended the mountain every peasant along the road stopped him and would have compelled him to give up the dog had he not produced this proof of property the neighboring mountaineers are very jealous of the breed being taken away considering them of such importance to their own safety this huge animal the very biggest dog i ever saw though only eleven months old and not so high by two or three inches as he will be allows mrto play with him and take him on his shoulders he weighs at least a hundred pounds like any lapdog leamington lansdowne circus october th i returned hither from liverpool last week and have spent the time idly since then reposing myself after the four years of unnatural restraint in the consulate being already pretty well acquainted with the neighborhood of leamington i have little or nothing to record about the prettiest cheerfullest cleanest of english towns on saturday we took the rail for coventry about a halfhours travel distant i had been there before more than two years ago no doubt i described it on my first visit and it is not remarkable enough to be worth two descriptions a large town of crooked and irregular streets and lanes not looking nearly so ancient as it is because of new brick and stuccoed fronts which have been plastered over its antiquity although still there are interspersed the peaked gables of oldfashioned timberbuilt houses or an archway of worn stone which if you pass through it shows like an avenue from the present to the past for just in the rear of the newfangled aspect lurks the old arrangement of courtyards and rustiness and grimness that would not be suspected from the exterior right across the narrow street stands st michaels church with its tall tall tower and spire the body of the church has been almost entirely recased with stone since i was here before but the tower still retains its antiquity and is decorated with statues that look down from their lofty niches seemingly in good preservation the tower and spire are most stately and beautiful the whole church very noble we went in and found that the vulgar plaster of cromwells time has been scraped from the pillars and arches leaving them all as fresh and splendid as if just made we looked also into trinity church which stands close by st michaels separated only i think by the churchyard we also visited st johns church which is very venerable as regards its exterior the stone being worn and smoothed if not roughened rather by centuries of storm and fitful weather this wear and tear however has almost ceased to be a charm to my mind comparatively to what it was when i first began to see old buildings within the church is spoiled by wooden galleries built across the beautiful pointed arches we saw nothing else particularly worthy of remark except fords hospital in grey friars street it has an elizabethan front of timber and plaster facing on the street with two or three peaked gables in a row beneath which is a low arched entrance giving admission into a small paved quadrangle open to the sky above but surrounded by the walls lozengepaned windows and gables of the hospital the quadrangle is but a few paces in width and perhaps twenty in length and through a halfclosed doorway at the farther end there was a glimpse into a garden just within the entrance through an open door we saw the neat and comfortable apartment of the matron of the hospital and along the quadrangle on each side there were three or four doors through which we glanced into little rooms each containing a fireplace a bed a chair or two a little homely domestic scene with one old woman in the midst of it one old woman in each room they are destitute widows who have their lodging and home here a small room for each one to sleep cook and be at home in and three and sixpence a week to feed and clothe themselves with a cloak being the only garment bestowed on them when one of the sisterhood dies each old woman has to pay twopence towards the funeral and so they slowly starve and wither out of life and claim each their twopence contribution in turn i am afraid they have a very dismal time there is an old mans hospital in another part of the town on a similar plan a collection of sombre and lifelike tales might be written on the idea of giving the experiences of these hospitallers male and female and they might be supposed to be written by the matron of one who had acquired literary taste and practice as a governess and by the master of the other a retired schoolusher it was marketday in coventry and far adown the street leading from it there were booths and stalls and apples pears toys books among which i saw my twicetold tales with an awful portrait of myself as frontispiece and various country produce offered for sale by men women and girls the scene looked lively but had not much vivacity in it october th the autumn has advanced progressively and is now fairly established though still there is much green foliage in spite of many brown trees and an enormous quantity of withered leaves too damp to rustle strewing the paths whence however they are continually swept up and carried off in wheelbarrows either for neatness or for the agricultural worth as manure of even a withered leaf the pastures look just as green as ever a deep bright verdure that seems almost sunshine in itself however sombre the sky may be the little plats of grass and flowers in front of our circle of houses might still do credit to an american midsummer for i have seen beautiful roses here within a day or two and dahlias asters and such autumnal flowers are plentiful and i have no doubt that the old years flowers will bloom till those of the new year appear really the english winter is not so terrible as ours october th wednesday was one of the most beautiful of all days and gilded almost throughout with the precious english sunshine the most delightful sunshine ever made both for its positive fine qualities and because we seldom get it without too great an admixture of water we made no use of this lovely day except to walk to an arboretum and pinetum on the outskirts of the town u and mrs shepard made an excursion to guys cliff here comes in the visit to leicesters hospital and redferns shop and st marys church printed in our old home ed from redferns we went back to the marketplace expecting to find j at the museum but the keeper said he had gone away we went into this museum which contains the collections in natural history etc of a county society it is very well arranged and is rich in specimens of ornithology among which was an albatross huge beyond imagination i do not think that coleridge could have known the size of the fowl when he caused it to be hung round the neck of his ancient mariner there were a great many hummingbirds from various parts of the world and some of their breasts actually gleamed and shone as with the brightest lustre of sunset also many strange fishes and a huge pike taken from the river avon and so long that i wonder how he could turn himself about in such a little river as the avon is near warwick a great curiosity was a bunch of skeleton leaves and flowers prepared by a young lady and preserving all the most delicate fibres of the plant looking like inconceivably fine lacework white as snow while the substance was quite taken away in another room there were minerals shells and a splendid collection of fossils among which were remains of antediluvian creatures several feet long in still another room we saw some historical curiosities the most interesting of which were two locks of reddishbrown hair one from the head and one from the beard of edward iv they were fastened to a manuscript letter which authenticates the hair as having been taken from king edwards tomb in near these relics was a seal of the great earl of warwick the mighty kingmaker also a sword from bosworth field smaller and shorter than those now in use for indeed swords seem to have increased in length weight and formidable aspect now that the weapon has almost ceased to be used in actual warfare the short roman sword was probably more murderous than any weapon of the same species except the bowieknife here too were parliamentary cannonballs etc the visit to whitnash intervenes here ed london great russell street november th we have been thinking and negotiating about taking lodgings in london lately and this morning we left leamington and reached london with no other misadventure than that of leaving the great bulk of our luggage behind us the van which we hired to take it to the railway station having broken down under its prodigious weight in the middle of the street on our journey we saw nothing particularly worthy of note but everywhere the immortal verdure of england scarcely less perfect than in june so far as the fields are concerned though the foliage of the trees presents pretty much the same hues as those of our own forests after the gayety and gorgeousness have departed from them our lodgings are in close vicinity to the british museum which is the great advantage we took them for i felt restless and uncomfortable and soon strolled forth without any definite object and walked as far as charing cross very dull and dreary the city looked and not in the least lively even where the throng was thickest and most brisk as i trudged along my reflection was that never was there a dingier uglier less picturesque city than london and that it is really wonderful that so much brick and stone for centuries together should have been built up with so poor a result yet these old names of the city fleet street ludgate hill the strandused to throw a glory over these homely precincts when i first saw them and still do so in a less degree where farrington street opens upon fleet street moreover i had a glimpse of st pauls along ludgate street in the gathering dimness and felt as if i saw an old friend in that neighborhood speaking of old friends i met mr parker of boston who told me sad news of a friend whom i love as much as if i had known him for a lifetime though he is indeed but of two or three years standing he said that my friends bankruptcy is in todays gazette of all men on earth i had rather this misfortune should have happened to any other but i hope and think he has sturdiness and buoyancy enough to rise up beneath it i cannot conceive of his face otherwise than with a glow on it like that of the sun at noonday before i reached our lodgings the dusk settled into the streets and a mist bedewed and bedamped me and i went astray as is usual with me and had to inquire my way indeed except in the principal thoroughfares london is so miserably lighted that it is impossible to recognize ones whereabouts on my arrival i found our parlor looking cheerful with a brisk fire but the first day or two in new lodgings is at best an uncomfortable time fanny has just come in with more unhappy news about pray heaven it may not be true troubles are a sociable brotherhood they love to come hand in hand or sometimes even to come side by side with long lookedfor and hopedfor good fortune november th this morning we all went to the british museum always a most wearisome and depressing task to me i strolled through the lower rooms with a good degree of interest looking at the antique sculptures some of which were doubtless grand and beautiful in their day the egyptian remains are on the whole the more satisfactory for though inconceivably ugly they are at least miracles of size and ponderosity for example a hand and arm of polished granite as much as ten feet in length the upper rooms containing millions of specimens of natural history in all departments really made my heart ache with a pain and woe that i have never felt anywhere but in the british museum and i hurried through them as rapidly as i could persuade j to follow me we had left the rest of the party still intent on the grecian sculptures and though j was much interested in the vast collection of shells he chose to quit the museum with me in the prospect of a stroll about london he seems to have my own passion for thronged streets and the utmost bustle of human life we went first to the railway station in quest of our luggage which we found then we made a pretty straight course down to holborn and through newgate street stopping a few moments to look through the iron fence at the christs hospital boys in their long blue coats and yellow petticoats and stockings it was between twelve and one oclock and i suppose this was their hour of play for they were running about the enclosed space chasing and overthrowing one another without their caps with their yellow petticoats tucked up and all in immense activity and enjoyment they were eminently a healthy and handsome set of boys then we went into cheapside where i called at mr bennetts shop to inquire what are the facts about when i mentioned his name mr bennett shook his head and expressed great sorrow but on further talk i found that he referred only to the failure and had heard nothing about the other rumor it cannot therefore be true for bennett lives in his neighborhood and could not have remained ignorant of such a calamity there must be some mistake none however in regard to the failure it having been announced in the times from bennetts shop which is so near the steeple of bow church that it would tumble upon it if it fell over we strolled still eastward aiming at london bridge but missed it and bewildered ourselves among many dingy and frowzy streets and lanes i bore towards the right however knowing that that course must ultimately bring me to the thames and at last i saw before me ramparts towers circular and square with battlemented summits large sweeps and curves of fortification as well as straight and massive walls and chimneys behind them all a great confusion to my eye of ancient and more modern structure and four loftier turrets rising in the midst the whole great space surrounded by a broad dry moat which now seemed to be used as an ornamental walk bordered partly with trees this was the tower but seen from a different and more picturesque point of view than i have heretofore gained of it being so convenient for a visit i determined to go in at the outer gate which is not a part of the fortification a sentinel walks to and fro besides whom there was a warder in the rich old costume of henry viiis time looking very gorgeous indeed as much so as scarlet and gold can make him as j and i were not going to look at the jewelroom we loitered about in the open space before the white tower while the tall slender whitehaired gentlemanly warder led the rest of the party into that apartment we found what one might take for a square in a town with gabled houses lifting their peaks on one side and various edifices enclosing the other sides and the great white tower now more black than white rising venerable and rather picturesque than otherwise the most prominent object in the scene i have no plan nor available idea of it whatever in my mind but it seems really to be a town within itself with streets avenues and all that pertains to human life there were soldiers going through their exercise in the open space and along at the base of the white tower lay a great many cannon and mortars some of which were of turkish manufacture and immensely long and ponderous others likewise of mighty size had once belonged to the famous ship great harry and had lain for ages under the sea others were eastindian several were beautiful specimens of workmanship the mortars some so large that a fairsized man might easily be rammed into them held their great mouths slanting upward to the sky and mostly contained a quantity of rainwater while we were looking at these warlike toys for i suppose not one of them will ever thunder in earnest again the warder reappeared with his ladies and leading us all to a certain part of the open space he struck his foot on the small stones with which it is paved and told us that we were standing on the spot where anne boleyn and catharine parr were beheaded it is not exactly in the centre of the square but on a line with one of the angles of the white tower i forgot to mention that the middle of the open space is occupied by a marble statue of wellington which appeared to me very poor and laboriously spirited lastly the warder led us under the bloody tower and by the side of the wakefield tower and showed us the traitors gate which is now closed up so as to afford no access to the thames no we first visited the beauchamp tower famous as the prison of many historical personages some of its former occupants have left their initials or names and inscriptions of piety and patience cut deep into the freestone of the walls together with devices as a crucifix for instance neatly and skilfully done this room has a long deep fireplace it is chiefly lighted by a large window which i fancy must have been made in modern times but there are four narrow apertures throwing in a little light through deep alcoves in the thickness of the octagon wall one would expect such a room to be picturesque but it is really not of striking aspect being low with a plastered ceiling the beams just showing through the plaster a boarded floor and the walls being washed over with a buff color a warder sat within a railing by the great window with sixpenny books to sell containing transcripts of the inscriptions on the walls we now left the tower and made our way deviously westward passing st pauls which looked magnificently and beautifully so huge and dusky as it was with here and there a space on its vast form where the original whiteness of the marble came out like a streak of moonshine amid the blackness with which time has made it grander than it was in its newness it is a most noble edifice and i delight too in the statues that crown some of its heights and in the wreaths of sculpture which are hung around it november th this morning began with such fog that at the window of my chamber lighted only from a small courtyard enclosed by high dingy walls i could hardly see to dress it kept alternately darkening and then brightening a little and darkening again so much that we could but just discern the opposite houses but at eleven or thereabouts it grew so much clearer that we resolved to venture out our plan for the day was to go in the first place to westminster abbey and to the national gallery if we should find time the fog darkened again as we went down regent street and the duke of yorks column was but barely visible looming vaguely before us nor from pall mall was nelsons pillar much more distinct though methought his statue stood aloft in a somewhat clearer atmosphere than ours passing whitehall however we could scarcely see inigo joness banquetinghouse on the other side of the street and the towers and turrets of the new houses of parliament were all but invisible as was the abbey itself so that we really were in some doubt whither we were going we found our way to poets corner however and entered those holy precincts which looked very dusky and grim in the smoky light i was strongly impressed with the perception that very commonplace people compose the great bulk of society in the home of the illustrious dead it is wonderful how few names there are that one cares anything about a hundred years after their departure but perhaps each generation acts in good faith in canonizing its own men but the fame of the buried person does not make the marble live the marble keeps merely a cold and sad memory of a man who would else be forgotten no man who needs a monument ever ought to have one the painted windows of the abbey though mostly modern are exceedingly rich and beautiful and i do think that human art has invented no other such magnificent method of adornment as this our final visit today was to the national gallery where i came to the conclusion that murillos st john was the most lovely picture i have ever seen and that there never was a painter who has really made the world richer except murillo november th this morning we issued forth and found the atmosphere chill and almost frosty tingling upon our cheeks the gateway of somerset house attracted us and we walked round its spacious quadrangle encountering many government clerks hurrying to their various offices at least i presumed them to be so this is certainly a handsome square of buildings with its grecian facades and pillars and its sculptured basreliefs and the group of statuary in the midst of the court besides the part of the edifice that rises above ground there appear to be two subterranean stories below the surface from somerset house we pursued our way through temple bar but missed it and therefore entered by the passage from what was formerly alsatia but which now seems to be a very respectable and humdrum part of london we came immediately to the temple gardens which we walked quite round the grass is still green but the trees are leafless and had an aspect of not being very robust even at more genial seasons of the year there were however large quantities of brilliant chrysanthemums golden and of all hues blooming gorgeously all about the borders and several gardeners were at work tending these flowers and sheltering them from the weather i noticed no roses nor even rosebushes in the spot where the factions of york and lancaster plucked their two hostile flowers leaving these grounds we went to the hall of the middle temple where we knocked at the portal and finding it not fastened thrust it open a boy appeared within and the porter or keeper at a distance along the inner passage called to us to enter and opening the door of the great hall left us to view it till he should be at leisure to attend to us truly it is a most magnificent apartment very lofty so lofty indeed that the antique oak roof was quite hidden as regarded all its details in the sombre gloom that brooded under its rafters the hall was lighted by four great windows i think on each of the two sides descending halfway from the ceiling to the floor leaving all beneath enclosed by oaken panelling which on three sides was carved with escutcheons of such members of the society as have held the office of reader there is likewise in a large recess or transept a great window occupying the full height of the hall and splendidly emblazoned with the arms of the templars who have attained to the dignity of chief justices the other windows are pictured in like manner with coats of arms of local dignitaries connected with the temple and besides all these there are arched lights high towards the roof at either end full of richly and chastely colored glass and all the illumination that the great hall had come through these glorious panes and they seemed the richer for the sombreness in which we stood i cannot describe or even intimate the effect of this transparent glory glowing down upon us in that gloomy depth of the hall the screen at the lower end was of carved oak very dark and highly polished and as old as queen elizabeths time the keeper told us that the story of the armada was said to be represented in these carvings but in the imperfect light we could trace nothing of it out along the length of the apartment were set two oaken tables for the students of law to dine upon and on the dais at the upper end there was a crosstable for the bigwigs of the society the latter being provided with comfortable chairs and the former with oaken benches from a notification posted near the door i gathered that the cost of dinners is two shillings to each gentleman including as the attendant told me ale and wine i am reluctant to leave this hall without expressing how grave how grand how sombre and how magnificent i feel it to be as regards historical association it was a favorite dancinghall of queen elizabeth and sir christopher hatton danced himself into her good graces here we next went to the temple church and finding the door ajar made free to enter beneath its norman arches which admitted us into a circular vestibule very ancient and beautiful in the body of the church beyond we saw a boy sitting but nobody either forbade or invited our entrance on the floor of the vestibule lay about half a score of templars the representatives of the warlike priests who built this church and formerly held these precincts all in chain armor grasping their swords and with their shields beside them except two or three they lay crosslegged in token that they had really fought for the holy sepulchre i think i have seen nowhere else such wellpreserved monumental knights as these we proceeded into the interior of the church and were greatly impressed with its wonderful beauty the roof springing as it were in a harmonious and accordant fountain out of the clustered pillars that support its groined arches and these pillars immense as they are are polished like so many gems they are of purbeck marble and if i mistake not had been covered with plaster for ages until latterly redeemed and beautified anew but the glory of the church is its old painted windows and positively those great spaces over the chancel appeared to be set with all manner of precious stones or it was as if the manycolored radiance of heaven were breaking upon us or as if we saw the wings of angels storied over with richly tinted pictures of holy things but it is idle to talk of this marvellous adornment it is to be seen and wondered at not written about before we left the church the porter made his appearance in time to receive his fee which somebody indeed is always ready to stretch out his hand for and so ended our visit to the temple which by the by though close to the midmost bustle of london is as quiet as if it were always sunday there we now went to st pauls u and miss shepard ascended to the whispering gallery and we sitting under the dome at the base of one of the pillars saw them far above us looking very indistinct for those misty upperdepths seemed almost to be hung with clouds this cathedral i think does not profit by gloom but requires cheerful sunshine to show it to the best advantage the statues and sculptures in st pauls are mostly covered with years of dust and look thereby very grim and ugly but there are few memories there from which i should care to brush away the dust they being in nine cases out of ten naval and military heroes of second or third class merit i really remember no literary celebrity admitted solely on that account except dr johnson the crimean war has supplied two or three monuments chiefly mural tablets and doubtless more of the same excrescences will yet come out upon the walls one thing that i newly noticed was the beautiful shape of the great covered marble vase that serves for a font from st pauls we went down cheapside and turning into king street visited guildhall which we found in process of decoration for a public ball to take place next week it looked rather gewgawish thus gorgeous being hung with flags of all nations and adorned with military trophies and the scene was repeated by a range of lookingglasses at one end of the room the execrably painted windows really shocked us by their vulgar glare after those of the temple hall and church yet a few years ago i might very likely have thought them beautiful our own national banner i must remember to say was hanging in guildhall but with only ten stars and an insufficient number of stripes november th yesterday morning we went to london bridge and along lower thames street and quickly found ourselves in billingsgate market a dirty evilsmelling crowded precinct thronged with people carrying fish on their heads and lined with fishshops and fishstalls and pervaded with a fishy odor the footwalk was narrow as indeed was the whole street and filthy to travel upon and we had to elbow our way among rough men and slatternly women and to guard our heads from the contact of fishtrays very ugly grimy and misty moreover is billingsgate market and though we heard none of the foul language of which it is supposed to be the fountainhead yet it has its own peculiarities of behavior for instance u tells me that one man staring at her and her governess as they passed cried out what beauties another looking under her veil greeted her with good morning my love we were in advance and heard nothing of these civilities struggling through this fishy purgatory we caught sight of the tower as we drew near the end of the street and i put all my party under charge of one of the trump cards not being myself inclined to make the rounds of the small part of the fortress that is shown so soon after my late visit when they departed with the warder i set out by myself to wander about the exterior of the tower looking with interest at what i suppose to be tower hill a slight elevation of the large open space into which great tower street opens though perhaps what is now called trinity square may have been a part of tower hill and possibly the precise spot where the executions took place keeping to the right round the tower i found the moat quite surrounded by a fence of iron rails excluding me from a pleasant gravelpath among flowers and shrubbery on the inside where i could see nurserymaids giving children their airings possibly these may have been the privileged inhabitants of the tower which certainly might contain the population of a large village the aspect of the fortress has so much that is new and modern about it that it can hardly be called picturesque and yet it seems unfair to withhold that epithet from such a collection of gray ramparts i followed the iron fence quite round the outer grounds till it approached the thames and in this direction the moat and the pleasureground terminate in a narrow graveyard which extends beneath the walls and looks neglected and shaggy with long grass it appeared to contain graves enough but only a few tombstones of which i could read the inscription of but one it commemorated a mr george gibson a person of no note nor apparently connected with the place st katharines dock lies along the thames in this vicinity and while on one side of me were the tower the quiet gravelpath and the shaggy graveyard on the other were draymen and their horses docklaborers sailors empty puncheons and a miscellaneous spectacle of life including organgrinders men roasting chestnuts over small ovens on the sidewalk boys and women with boards or wheelbarrows of apples oysterstands besides pedlers of small wares dirty children at play and other figures and things that a dutch painter would seize upon i went a little way into st katharines dock and found it crowded with great ships then returning i strolled along the range of shops that front towards this side of the tower they have all something to do with ships sailors and commerce being for the sale of ships stores nautical instruments arms clothing together with a tavern and grogshop at every other door bookstalls too covered with cheap novels and songbooks cigarshops in great numbers and everywhere were sailors and here and there a soldier and children at the doorsteps and women showing themselves at the doors or windows of their domiciles these latter figures however pertain rather to the street up which i walked penetrating into the interior of this region which i think is blackwall no i forget what its name is at all events it has an ancient and most grimy and rough look with its old gabled houses each of them the seat of some petty trade and business in its basement story among these i saw one house with three or four peaks along its front a second story projecting over the basement and the whole clapboarded over there was a butchers stall in the lower story with a front open to the street in the ancient fashion which seems to be retained only by butchers shops this part of london having escaped the great fire i suppose there may be many relics of architectural antiquity hereabouts at the end of an hour i went back to the refreshmentroom within the outer gate of the tower where the rest of us shortly appeared we now returned westward by way of great tower street eastcheap and cannon street and entering st pauls sat down beneath the misty dome to rest ourselves the muffled roar of the city as we heard it there is very soothing and keeps one listening to it somewhat as the flow of a river keeps us looking at it it is a grand and quiet sound and ever and anon a distant door slammed somewhere in the cathedral and reverberated long and heavily like the roll of thunder or the boom of cannon every noise that is loud enough to be heard in so vast an edifice melts into the great quietude the interior looked very sombre and the dome hung over us like a cloudy sky i wish it were possible to pass directly from st pauls into york minster or from the latter into the former that is if ones mind could manage to stagger under both in the same day there is no other way of judging of their comparative effect under the influence of that grand lullaby the roar of the city we sat for some time after we were sufficiently rested but at last plunged forth again and went up newgate street pausing to look through the iron railings of christs hospital the boys however were not at play so we went onward in quest of smithfield and on our way had a greeting from mr silsbee a gentleman of our own native town parting with him we found smithfield which is still occupied with pens for cattle though i believe it has ceased to be a cattlemarket except it be st bartholomews hospital on one side there is nothing interesting in this ugly square though no doubt a few feet under the pavement there are bones and ashes as precious as anything of the kind on earth i wonder when men will begin to erect monuments to human error hitherto their pillars and statues have only been for the sake of glorification but after all the present fashion may be the better and wholesomer november th mr silsbee called yesterday and talked about matters of art in which he is deeply interested and which he has had good opportunities of becoming acquainted with during three years travel on the continent he is a man of great intelligence and true feeling and absolutely brims over with ideas his conversation flowing in a constant stream which it appears to be no trouble whatever to him to keep up he took his leave after a long call and left with us a manuscript describing a visit to berlin which i read to my wife in the evening it was well worth reading he made an engagement to go with us to the crystal palace and came rather for that purpose this morning we drove to the london bridge station where we bought return tickets that entitled us to admission to the palace as well as conveyance thither for half a crown apiece on our arrival we entered by the garden front thus gaining a fine view of the ornamental grounds with their fountains and stately pathways bordered with statues and of the edifice itself so vast and fairylike looking as if it were a bubble and might vanish at a touch there is as little beauty in the architecture of the crystal palace however as was possible to be with such gigantic use of such a material no doubt an architectural order of which we have as yet little or no idea is to be developed from the use of glass as a buildingmaterial instead of brick and stone it will have its own rules and its own results but meanwhile even the present palace is positively a very beautiful object on entering we found the atmosphere chill and comfortless more so it seemed to me than the open air itself it was not a genial day though now and then the sun gleamed out and once caused fine effects in the glasswork of a crystal fountain in one of the courts we were under mr silshees guidance for the day and first we looked at the sculpture which is composed chiefly of casts or copies of the most famous statues of all ages and likewise of those crumbs and little fragments which have fallen from times jaw and halfpicked bones as it were that have been gathered up from spots where he has feasted full torsos heads and broken limbs some of them half worn away as if they had been rolled over and over in the sea i saw nothing in the sculptural way either modern or antique that impressed me so much as a statue of a nude mother by a french artist in a sitting posture with one knee over the other she was clasping her highest knee with both hands and in the hollow cradle thus formed by her arms lay two sweet little babies as snug and close to her heart as if they had not yet been born two little loveblossoms and the mother encircling them and pervading them with love but an infinite pathos and strange terror are given to this beautiful group by some faint basreliefs on the pedestal indicating that the happy mother is eve and cain and abel the two innocent babes then we went to the alhambra which looks like an enchanted palace if it had been a sunny day i should have enjoyed it more but it was miserable to shiver and shake in the court of the lions and in those chambers which were contrived as places of refuge from a fervid temperature furthermore it is not quite agreeable to see such clever specimens of stage decoration they are so very good that it gets to be past a joke without becoming actual earnest i had not a similar feeling in respect to the reproduction of mediaeval statues arches doorways all brilliantly colored as in the days of their first glory yet i do not know but that the first is as little objectionable as the last certainly in both cases scenes and objects of a past age are here more vividly presented to the dullest mind than without such material facilities they could possibly be brought before the most powerful imagination truly the crystal palace in all its departments offers wonderful means of education i marvel what will come of it among the things that i admired most was benvenuto cellinis statue of perseus holding the head of medusa and standing over her headless and still writhing body out of which at the severed neck gushed a vast exuberance of snakes likewise a sitting statue by michel angelo of one of the medici full of dignity and grace and reposeful might also the bronze gate of a baptistery in florence carved all over with relieves of scripture subjects executed in the most lifelike and expressive manner the cast itself was a miracle of art i should have taken it for the genuine original bronze we then wandered into the house of diomed which seemed to me a dismal abode affording no possibility of comfort we sat down in one of the rooms on an iron bench very cold it being by this time two oclock we went to the refreshmentroom and lunched and before we had finished our repast my wife discovered that she had lost her sable tippet which she had been carrying on her arm mr silsbee most kindly and obligingly immediately went in quest of it but to no purpose upon entering the tropical saloon we found a most welcome and delightful change of temperature among those gigantic leaves of banyantrees and the broad expanse of waterplants floating on lakes and spacious aviaries where birds of brilliant plumage sported and sang amid such foliage as they knew at home howbeit the atmosphere was a little faint and sickish perhaps owing to the odor of the halftepid water the most remarkable object here was the trunk of a tree huge beyond imagination a pinetree from california it was only the strippedoff bark however which had been conveyed hither in segments and put together again beyond the height of the palace roof and the hollow interior circle of the tree was large enough to contain fifty people i should think we entered and sat down in all the remoteness from one another that is attainable in a goodsized drawingroom we then ascended the gallery to get a view of this vast tree from a more elevated position and found it looked even bigger from above then we loitered slowly along the gallery as far as it extended and afterwards descended into the nave for it was getting dusk and a horn had sounded and a bell rung a warning to such as delayed in the remote regions of the building mr silsbee again most kindly went in quest of the sables but still without success i have not much enjoyed the crystal palace but think it a great and admirable achievement november th on tuesday evening mr silsbee came to read some letters which he has written to his friends chiefly giving his observations on art together with descriptions of venice and other cities on the continent they were very good and indicate much sensibility and talent after the reading we had a little oystersupper and wine i had written a note to and received an answer indicating that he was much weighed down by his financial misfortune however he desired me to come and see him so yesterday morning i wended my way down into the city and after various reluctant circumlocutions arrived at his house the interior looked confused and dismal it seems to me nobody else runs such risks as a man of business because he risks everything every other man into whatever depth of poverty he may sink has still something left be he author scholar handicraftman or what not the merchant has nothing we parted with a long and strong grasp of the hand andpromised to come and see us soon on my way home i called at truebners in pater noster row i waited a few minutes he being busy with a tall muscular englishbuilt man who after he had taken leave truebner told me was charles reade i once met him at an evening party but should have been glad to meet him again now that i appreciate him so much better after reading never too late to mend december th all these days since my last date have been marked by nothing very well worthy of detail and description i have walked the streets a great deal in the dull november days and always take a certain pleasure in being in the midst of human life as closely encompassed by it as it is possible to be anywhere in this world and in that way of viewing it there is a dull and sombre enjoyment always to be had in holborn fleet street cheapside and the other busiest parts of london it is human life it is this material world it is a grim and heavy reality i have never had the same sense of being surrounded by materialisms and hemmed in with the grossness of this earthly existence anywhere else these broad crowded streets are so evidently the veins and arteries of an enormous city london is evidenced in every one of them just as a megatherium is in each of its separate bones even if they be small ones thus i never fail of a sort of selfcongratulation in finding myself for instance passing along ludgate hill but in spite of this it is really an ungladdened life to wander through these huge thronged ways over a pavement foul with mud ground into it by a million of footsteps jostling against people who do not seem to be individuals but all one mass so homogeneous is the streetwalking aspect of them the roar of vehicles pervading me wearisome cabs and omnibuses everywhere the dingy brick edifices heaving themselves up and shutting out all but a strip of sullen cloud that serves london for a sky in short a general impression of grime and sordidness and at this season always a fog scattered along the vista of streets sometimes so densely as almost to spiritualize the materialism and make the scene resemble the other world of worldly people gross even in ghostliness it is strange how little splendor and brilliancy one sees in london in the city almost none though some in the shops of regent street my wife has had a season of indisposition within the last few weeks so that my rambles have generally been solitary or with j only for a companion i think my only excursion with my wife was a week ago when we went to lincolns inn fields which truly are almost fields right in the heart of london and as retired and secluded as if the surrounding city were a forest and its heavy roar were the wind among the branches we gained admission into the noble hall which is modern but built in antique style and stately and beautiful exceedingly i have forgotten all but the general effect with its lofty oaken roof its panelled walls with the windows high above and the great arched window at one end full of painted coats of arms which the light glorifies in passing through them as if each were the escutcheon of some illustrious personage thence we went to the chapel of lincolns inn where on entering we found a class of young choristers receiving instruction from their musicmaster while the organ accompanied their strains these young clear fresh elastic voices are wonderfully beautiful they are like those of women yet have something more birdlike and aspiring more like what one conceives of the singing of angels as for the singing of saints and blessed spirits that have once been human it never can resemble that of these young voices for no duration of heavenly enjoyments will ever quite take the mortal sadness out of it in this chapel we saw some painted windows of the time of james i a period much subsequent to the age when painted glass was in its glory but the pictures of scriptural people in these windows were certainly very fine the figures being as large as life and the faces having much expression the sunshine came in through some of them and produced a beautiful effect almost as if the painted forms were the glorified spirits of those holy personages after leaving lincolns inn we looked at grays inn which is a great quiet domain quadrangle beyond quadrangle close beside holborn and a large space of greensward enclosed within it it is very strange to find so much of ancient quietude right in the monster citys very jaws which yet the monster shall not eat up right in its very belly indeed which yet in all these ages it shall not digest and convert into the same substance as the rest of its bustling streets nothing else in london is so like the effect of a spell as to pass under one of these archways and find yourself transported from the jumble mob tumult uproar as of an age of weekdays condensed into the present hour into what seems an eternal sabbath thence we went into staple inn i think it was which has a front upon holborn of four or five ancient gables in a row and a low arch under the impending story admitting you into a paved quadrangle beyond which you have the vista of another i do not understand that the residences and chambers in these inns of court are now exclusively let to lawyers though such inhabitants certainly seem to preponderate there since then j and i walked down into the strand and found ourselves unexpectedly mixed up with a crowd that grew denser as we approached charing cross and became absolutely impermeable when we attempted to make our way to whitehall the wicket in the gate of northumberland house by the by was open and gave me a glimpse of the front of the edifice within a very partial glimpse however and that obstructed by the solid person of a footman who with some women were passing out from within the crowd was a real english crowd perfectly undemonstrative and entirely decorous being composed mostly of welldressed people and largely of women the cause of the assemblage was the opening of parliament by the queen but we were too late for any chance of seeing her majesty however we extricated ourselves from the multitude and going along pall mall got into the park by the steps at the foot of the duke of yorks column and thence went to the whitehall gateway outside of which we found the horse guards drawn up a regiment of black horses and burnished cuirasses on our way thither an open carriage came through the gateway into the park conveying two ladies in court dresses and another splendid chariot pressed out through the gateway the coachman in a cocked hat and scarlet and gold embroidery and two other scarlet and gold figures hanging behind it was one of the queens carriages but seemed to have nobody in it i have forgotten to mention what i think produced more effect on me than anything else namely the clash of the bells from the steeple of st martins church and those of st margaret really london seemed to cry out through them and bid welcome to the queen december th this being a muddy and dismal day i went only to the british museum which is but a short walk down the street great russell street i have now visited it often enough to be on more familiar terms with it than at first and therefore do not feel myself so weighed down by the many things to be seen i have ceased to expect or hope or wish to devour and digest the whole enormous collection so i content myself with individual things and succeed in getting now and then a little honey from them unless i were studying some particular branch of history or science or art this is the best that can be done with the british museum i went first today into the townley gallery and so along through all the ancient sculpture and was glad to find myself able to sympathize more than heretofore with the forms of grace and beauty which are preserved there poor maimed immortalities as they are headless and legless trunks godlike cripples faces beautiful and brokennosed heroic shapes which have stood so long or lain prostrate so long in the open air that even the atmosphere of greece has almost dissolved the external layer of the marble and yet however much they may be worn away or battered and shattered the grace and nobility seem as deep in them as the very heart of the stone it cannot be destroyed except by grinding them to powder in short i do really believe that there was an excellence in ancient sculpture which has yet a potency to educate and refine the minds of those who look at it even so carelessly and casually as i do as regards the frieze of the parthenon i must remark that the horses represented on it though they show great spirit and lifelikeness are rather of the pony species than what would be considered fine horses now doubtless modern breeding has wrought a difference in the animal flaxman in his outlines seems to have imitated these classic steeds of the parthenon and thus has produced horses that always appeared to me affected and diminutively monstrous from the classic sculpture i passed through an assyrian room where the walls are lined with great slabs of marble sculptured in basrelief with scenes in the life of senmacherib i believe very ugly to be sure yet artistically done in their own style and in wonderfully good preservation indeed if the chisel had cut its last stroke in them yesterday the work could not be more sharp and distinct in glass cases in this room are little relics and scraps of utensils and a great deal of fragmentary rubbish dug up by layard in his researches things that it is hard to call anything but trash but which yet may be of great significance as indicating the modes of life of a longpast race i remember nothing particularly just now except some pieces of broken glass iridescent with certainly the most beautiful hues in the world indescribably beautiful and unimaginably unless one can conceive of the colors of the rainbow and a thousand glorious sunsets and the autumnal forestleaves of america all condensed upon a little fragment of a glass cup and that too without becoming in the least glaring or flagrant but mildly glorious as we may fancy the shifting lines of an angels wing may be i think this chaste splendor will glow in my memory for years to come it is the effect of time and cannot be imitated by any known process of art i have seen it in specimens of old roman glass which has been famous here in england but never in anything is there the brilliancy of these oriental fragments how strange that decay in dark places and underground and where there are a billion chances to one that nobody will ever see its handiwork should produce these beautiful effects the glass seems to become perfectly brittle so that it would vanish like a soapbubble if touched ascending the stairs i went through the halls of fossil remains which i care little for though one of them is a human skeleton in limestone and through several rooms of mineralogical specimens including all the gems in the world among which is seen not the kohinoor itself but a facsimile of it in crystal i think the aerolites are as interesting as anything in this department and one piece of pure iron laid against the wall of the room weighs about fourteen hundred pounds whence could it have come if these aerolites are bits of other planets how happen they to be always iron but i know no more of this than if i were a philosopher then i went through rooms of shells and fishes and reptiles and tortoises crocodiles and alligators and insects including all manner of butterflies some of which had wings precisely like leaves a little withered and faded even the skeleton and fibres of the leaves represented and immense hairy spiders covering with the whole circumference of their legs a space as big as a saucer and centipedes little less than a foot long and winged insects that look like jointed twigs of a tree in america i remember when i lived in lenox i found an insect of this species and at first really mistook it for a twig it was smaller than these specimens in the museum i suppose every creature almost that runs or creeps or swims or flies is represented in this collection of natural history and it puzzles me to think what they were all made for though it is quite as mysterious why man himself was made by and by i entered the room of egyptian mummies of which there are a good many one of which the body of a priestess is unrolled except the innermost layer of linen the outline of her face is perfectly visible mummies of cats dogs snakes and children are in the wallcases together with a vast many articles of egyptian manufacture and use even childrens toys bread too in flat cakes grapes that have turned to raisins in the grave queerest of all methinks a curly wig that is supposed to have belonged to a woman together with the wooden box that held it the hair is brown and the wig is as perfect as if it had been made for some now living dowager from egypt we pass into rooms containing vases and other articles of grecian and roman workmanship and funeral urns and beads and rings none of them very beautiful i saw some splendid specimens however at a former visit when i obtained admission to a room not indiscriminately shown to visitors what chiefly interested me in that room was a cast taken from the face of cromwell after death representing a widemouthed longchinned uncomely visage with a triangular english nose in the very centre there were various other curiosities which i fancied were safe in my memory but they do not now come uppermost to return to my todays progress through the museum next to the classic rooms are the collections of saxon and british and early english antiquities the earlier portions of which are not very interesting to me possessing little or no beauty in themselves and indicating a kind of life too remote from our own to be readily sympathized with who cares for glass beads and copper brooches and knives spearheads and swords all so rusty that they look as much like pieces of old iron hoop as anything else the bed of the thames has been a rich treasury of antiquities from the time of the roman conquest downwards it seems to preserve bronze in considerable perfection but not iron among the mediaeval relics the carvings in ivory are often very exquisite and elaborate there are likewise caskets and coffers and a thousand other old world ornamental works but i saw so many and such superior specimens of them at the manchester exhibition that i shall say nothing of them here the sealring of mary queen of scots is in one of the cases it must have been a thumbring judging from its size and it has a dark stone engraved with armorial bearings in another case is the magic glass formerly used by dr doe and in which if i rightly remember used to be seen prophetic visions or figures of persons and scenes at a distance it is a round ball of glass or crystal slightly tinged with a pinkish hue and about as big as a small apple or a little bigger than an egg would be if perfectly round this ancient humbug kept me looking at it perhaps ten minutes and i saw my own face dimly in it but no other vision lastly i passed through the ethnographical rooms but i care little for the varieties of the human race all that is really important and interesting being found in our own variety perhaps equally in any other this brought me to the head of one of the staircases descending which i entered the library here not to speak of the noble rooms and halls there are numberless treasures beyond all price too valuable in their way for me to select any one as more curious and valuable than many others letters of statesmen and warriors of all nations and several centuries back among which long as it has taken europe to produce them i saw none so illustrious as those of washington nor more so than franklins whom america gave to the world in her nonage and epistles of poets and artists and of kings too whose chirography appears to have been much better than i should have expected from fingers so often cramped in iron gauntlets in another case there were the original autograph copies of several famous works for example that of popes homer written on the backs of letters the direction and seals of which appear in the midst of the tale of troy divine which also is much scratched and interlined with popes corrections a manuscript of one of ben jonsons masques of the sentimental journey written in much more careful and formal style than might be expected the book pretending to be a harumscarum of walter scotts kenilworth bearing such an aspect of straightforward diligence that i shall hardly think of it again as a romance in short i may as well drop the whole matter here all through the long vista of the kings library we come to cases in which with their pages open beneath the glass we see books worth their weight in gold either for their uniqueness or their beauty or because they have belonged to illustrious men and have their autographs in them the copy of the english translation of montaigne containing the strange scrawl of shakespeares autograph is here bacons name is in another book queen elizabeths in another and there is a little devotional volume with lady jane greys writing in it she is supposed to have taken it to the scaffold with her here too i saw a copy which was printed at a venetian press at the time of the challenge which the admirable crichton caused to be posted on the church doors of venice defying all the scholars of italy to encounter him but if i mention one thing i find fault with myself for not putting down fifty others just as interesting and after all there is an official catalogue no doubt of the whole as i do not mean to fill any more pages with the british museum i will just mention the hall of egyptian antiquities on the groundfloor of the edifice though i did not pass through it today they consist of things that would be very ugly and contemptible if they were not so immensely magnified but it is impossible not to acknowledge a certain grandeur resulting from the scale on which those strange old sculptors wrought for instance there is a granite fist of prodigious size at least a yard across and looking as if it were doubled in the face of time defying him to destroy it all the rest of the statue to which it belonged seems to have vanished but this fist will certainly outlast the museum and whatever else it contains unless it be some similar egyptian ponderosity there is a beetle wrought out of immensely hard black stone as big as a hogshead it is satisfactory to see a thing so big and heavy then there are huge stone sarcophagi engraved with hieroglyphics within and without all as good as new though their age is reckoned by thousands of years these great coffins are of vast weight and mass insomuch that when once the accurately fitting lids were shut down there might have seemed little chance of their being lifted again till the resurrection i positively like these coffins they are so faithfully made and so black and stern and polished to such a nicety only to be buried forever for the workmen and the kings who were laid to sleep within could never have dreamed of the british museum there is a deity named pasht who sits in the hall very big very grave carved of black stone and very ludicrous wearing a dogs head i will just mention the rosetta stone with a greek inscription and another in egyptian characters which gave the clew to a whole field of history and shall pretermit all further handling of this unwieldy subject in all the rooms i saw people of the poorer classes some of whom seemed to view the objects intelligently and to take a genuine interest in them a poor man in london has great opportunities of cultivating himself if he will only make the best of them and such an institution as the british museum can hardly fail to attract as the magnet does steel the minds that are likeliest to be benefited by it in its various departments i saw many children there and some ragged boys it deserves to be noticed that some small figures of indian thugs represented as engaged in their profession and handiwork of cajoling and strangling travellers have been removed from the place which they formerly occupied in the part of the museum shown to the general public they are now in the more private room and the reason of their withdrawal is that according to the chaplain of newgate the practice of garroting was suggested to the english thieves by this representation of indian thugs it is edifying after what i have written in the preceding paragraph to find that the only lesson known to have been inculcated here is that of a new mode of outrage december th this morning when it was time to rise there was but a glimmering of daylight and we had candles on the breakfasttable at nearly ten oclock all abroad there was a dense dim fog brooding through the atmosphere insomuch that we could hardly see across the street at eleven oclock i went out into the midst of the fogbank which for the moment seemed a little more interfused with daylight for there seem to be continual changes in the density of this dim medium which varies so much that now you can but just see your hand before you and a moment afterwards you can see the cabs dashing out of the duskiness a score of yards off it is seldom or never moreover an unmitigated gloom but appears to be mixed up with sunshine in different proportions sometimes only one part sun to a thousand of smoke and fog and sometimes sunshine enough to give the whole mass a coppery line this would have been a bright sunny day but for the interference of the fog and before i had been out long i actually saw the sun looking red and rayless much like the millionth magnification of a new halfpenny i was bound towards bennochs for he had written a note to apologize for not visiting us and i had promised to call and see him today i went to marlborough house to look at the english pictures which i care more about seeing here in england than those of foreign artists because the latter will be found more numerously and better on the continent i saw many pictures that pleased me nothing that impressed me very strongly pictorial talent seems to be abundant enough up to a certain point pictorial genius i should judge is among the rarest of gifts to be sure i very likely might not recognize it where it existed and yet it ought to have the power of making itself known even to the uninstructed mind as literary genius does if it exist only for connoisseurs it is a very suspicious matter i looked at all turners pictures and at many of his drawings and must again confess myself wholly unable to understand more than a very few of them even those few are tantalizing at a certain distance you discern what appears to be a grand and beautiful picture which you shall admire and enjoy infinitely if you can get within the range of distinct vision you come nearer and find only blotches of color and dabs of the brush meaning nothing when you look closely and meaning a mystery at the point where the painter intended to station you some landscapes there were indeed full of imaginative beauty and of the better truth etherealized out of the prosaic truth of nature only it was still impossible actually to see it there was a mist over it or it was like a tract of beautiful dreamland seen dimly through sleep and glimmering out of sight if looked upon with wideopen eyes these were the more satisfactory specimens there were many others which i could not comprehend in the remotest degree not even so far as to conjecture whether they purported to represent earth sea or sky in fact i should not have known them to be pictures at all but might have supposed that the artist had been trying his brush on the canvas mixing up all sorts of hues but principally white paint and now and then producing an agreeable harmony of color without particularly intending it now that i have done my best to understand them without an interpreter i mean to buy ruskins pamphlet at my next visit and look at them through his eyes but i do not think that i can be driven out of the idea that a picture ought to have something in common with what the spectator sees in nature marlborough house may be converted i think into a very handsome residence for the young prince of wales the entrance from the courtyard is into a large square central hall the painted ceiling of which is at the whole height of the edifice and has a gallery on one side whence it would be pleasant to look down on a festal scene below the rooms are of fine proportions with vaulted ceilings and with fireplaces and mantelpieces of great beauty adorned with pillars and terminal figures of white and of variegated marble and in the centre of each mantelpiece there is a marble tablet exquisitely sculptured with classical designs done in such high relief that the figures are sometimes almost disengaged from the background one of the subjects was androcles or whatever was his name taking the thorn out of the lions foot i suppose these works are of the era of the first old duke and duchess after all however for some reason or other the house does not at first strike you as a noble and princely one and you have to convince yourself of it by examining it more in detail on leaving marlborough house i stepped for a few moments into the national gallery and looked among other things at the turners and claudes that hung there side by side these pictures i think are quite the most comprehensible of turners productions but i must say i prefer the claudes the latter catches the light that never was on sea or land without taking you quite away from nature for it nevertheless i will not be quite certain that i care for any painter except murillo whose st john i should like to own as far as my own pleasure is concerned i could not say as much for any other picture for i have always found an infinite weariness and disgust resulting from a picture being too frequently before my eyes i had rather see a basilisk for instance than the very best of those old familiar pictures in the boston athenaeum and most of those in the national gallery might soon affect me in the same way from the gallery i almost groped my way towards the city for the fog seemed to grow denser and denser as i advanced and when i reached st pauls the sunny intermixture above spoken of was at its minimum so that the smokecloud grew really black about the dome and pinnacles and the statues of saints looked down dimly from their standpoints on high it was very grand however to see the pillars and porticos and the huge bulk of the edifice heaving up its dome from an obscure foundation into yet more shadowy obscurity and by the time i reached the corner of the churchyard nearest cheapside the whole vast cathedral had utterly vanished leaving not a wrack behind unless those thick dark vapors were the elements of which it had been composed and into which it had again dissolved it is good to think nevertheless and i gladly accept the analogy and the moral that the cathedral was really there and as substantial as ever though those earthly mists had hidden it from mortal eyes i foundin better spirits than when i saw him last but his misfortune has been too real not to affect him long and deeply he was cheerful however and his face shone with almost its old lustre it has still the cheeriest glow that i ever saw in any human countenance i went home by way of holborn and the fog was denser than ever very black indeed more like a distillation of mud than anything else the ghost of mud the spiritualized medium of departed mud through which the dead citizens of london probably tread in the hades whither they are translated so heavy was the gloom that gas was lighted in all the shopwindows and the little charcoalfurnaces of the women and boys roasting chestnuts threw a ruddy misty glow around them and yet i liked it this fog seems an atmosphere proper to huge grimy london as proper to london as that light neither of the sun nor moon is to the new jerusalem on reaching home i found the same fog diffused through the drawingroom though how it could have got in is a mystery since nightfall however the atmosphere is clear again december th here we are still in london at least a month longer than we expected and at the very dreariest and dullest season of the year had i thought of it sooner i might have found interesting people enough to know even when all london is said to be out of town but meditating a stay only of a week or two on our way to rome it did not seem worth while to seek acquaintances i have been out only for one evening and that was at dr s who had been attending all the children in the measles their illness was what detained us he is a homoeopathist and is known in scientific or general literature at all events a sensible and enlightened man with an unenglish freedom of mind on some points for example he is a swedenborgian and a believer in modern spiritualism he showed me some drawings that had been made under the spiritual influence by a miniaturepainter who possesses no imaginative power of his own and is merely a good mechanical and literal copyist but these drawings representing angels and allegorical people were done by an influence which directed the artists hand he not knowing what his next touch would be nor what the final result the sketches certainly did show a high and fine expressiveness if examined in a trustful mood dralso spoke of mr harris the american poet of spiritualism as being the best poet of the day and he produced his works in several volumes and showed me songs and paragraphs of longer poems in support of his opinion they seemed to me to have a certain light and splendor but not to possess much power either passionate or intellectual mr harris is the medium of deceased poets milton and lord byron among the rest and drsaid that lady byron who is a devoted admirer of her husband in spite of their conjugal troubles pronounced some of these posthumous strains to be worthy of his living genius then the doctor spoke of various strange experiences which he himself has had in these spiritual matters for he has witnessed the miraculous performances of home the american medium and he has seen with his own eyes and felt with his own touch those ghostly hands and arms the reality of which has been certified to me by other beholders drtells me that they are cold and that it is a somewhat awful matter to see and feel them i should think so indeed do i believe in these wonders of course for how is it possible to doubt either the solemn word or the sober observation of a learned and sensible man like dr but again do i really believe it of course not for i cannot consent to have heaven and earth this world and the next beaten up together like the white and yolk of an egg merely out of respect to dr s sanity and integrity i would not believe my own sight nor touch of the spiritual hands and it would take deeper and higher strains than those of mr harris to convince me i think i might yield to higher poetry or heavenlier wisdom than mortals in the flesh have ever sung or uttered meanwhile this matter of spiritualism is surely the strangest that ever was heard of and yet i feel unaccountably little interest in it a sluggish disgust and repugnance to meddle with it insomuch that i hardly feel as if it were worth this page or two in my not very eventful journal one or two of the ladies present at dr s little party seemed to be mediums i have made several visits to the picturegalleries since my last date and i think it fair towards my own powers of appreciation to record that i begin to appreciate turners pictures rather better than at first not that i have anything to recant as respects those strange whitegrounded performances in the chambers at the marlborough house but some of his happier productions a large landscape illustrative of childe harold for instance seem to me to have more magic in them than any other pictures i admire too that misty morning landscape in the national gallery and no doubt his very monstrosities are such as only he could have painted and may have an infinite value for those who can appreciate the genius in them the shops in london begin to show some tokens of approaching christmas especially the toyshops and the confectioners the latter ornamenting their windows with a profusion of bonbons and all manner of pygmy figures in sugar the former exhibiting christmastrees hung with rich and gaudy fruit at the butchers shops there is a great display of fat carcasses and an abundance of game at the poulterers we think of going to the crystal palace to spend the festival day and eat our christmas dinner but do what we may we shall have no home feeling or fireside enjoyment i am weary weary of london and of england and can judge now how the old loyalists must have felt condemned to pine out their lives here when the revolution had robbed them of their native country and yet there is still a pleasure in being in this dingy smoky midmost haunt of men and i trudge through fleet street and ludgate street and along cheapside with an enjoyment as great as i ever felt in a woodpath at home and i have come to know these streets as well i believe as i ever knew washington street in boston or even essex street in my stupid old native town for piccadilly or for regent street though more brilliant promenades i do not care nearly so much december th still leading an idle life which however may not be quite thrown away as i see some things and think many thoughts the other day we went to westminster abbey and through the chapels and it being as sunny a day as could well be in london and in december we could judge in some small degree what must have been the splendor of those tombs and monuments when first erected there i presume i was sufficiently minute in describing my first visit to the chapels so i shall only mention the stiff figure of a lady of queen elizabeths court reclining on the point of her elbow under a mural arch through all these dusty years and the old coronationchair with the stone of scone beneath the seat and the woodwork cut and scratched all over with names and initials i continue to go to the picturegalleries i have an idea that the face of murillos st john has a certain mischievous intelligence in it this has impressed me almost from the first it is a boys face very beautiful and very pleasant too but with an expression that one might fairly suspect to be roguish if seen in the face of a living boy about equestrian statues as those of various kings at charing cross and otherwhere about london and of the duke of wellington opposite apsley house and in front of the exchange it strikes me as absurd the idea of putting a man on horseback on a place where one movement of the steed forward or backward or sideways would infallibly break his own and his riders neck the english sculptors generally seem to have been aware of this absurdity and have endeavored to lessen it by making the horse as quiet as a cabhorse on the stand instead of rearing rampant like the bronze group of jackson at washington the statue of wellington at the piccadilly corner of the park has a stately and imposing effect seen from far distances in approaching either through the green park or from the oxford street corner of hyde park january d on thursday we had the pleasure of a call from mr coventry patmore to whom dr wilkinson gave me a letter of introduction and on whom i had called twice at the british museum without finding him we had read his betrothal and angel in the house with unusual pleasure and sympathy and therefore were very glad to make his personal acquaintance he is a man of much more youthful aspect than i had expected a slender person to be an englishman though not remarkably so had he been an american with an intelligent pleasant and sensitive face a man very evidently of refined feelings and cultivated mind he is very simple and agreeable in his manners a little shy yet perfectly frank and easy to meet on real grounds he said that his wife had proposed to come with him and had indeed accompanied him to town but was kept away we were very sorry for this because mr patmore seems to acknowledge her as the real angel in the house although he says she herself ignores all connection with the poem it is well for her to do so and for her husband to feel that the character is her real portrait and both i suppose are right it is a most beautiful and original poem a poem for happy married people to read together and to understand by the light of their own past and present life but i doubt whether the generality of english people are capable of appreciating it i told mr patmore that i thought his popularity in america would be greater than at home and he said that it was already so and he appeared to estimate highly his american fame and also our general gift of quicker and more subtle recognition of genius than the english public we mutually gratified each other by expressing high admiration of one anothers works and mr patmore regretted that in the few days of our further stay here we should not have time to visit him at his home it would really give me pleasure to do so i expressed a hope of seeing him in italy during our residence there and he seemed to think it possible as his friend and our countryman thomas buchanan read had asked him to come thither and be his guest he took his leave shaking hands with all of us because he saw that we were of his own people recognizing him as a true poet he has since given me the new edition of his poems with a kind rote we are now making preparations for our departure which we expect will take place on tuesday and yesterday i went to our ministers to arrange about the passport the very moment i rang at his door it swung open and the porter ushered me with great courtesy into the anteroom not that he knew me or anything about me except that i was an american citizen this is the deference which an american servant of the public finds it expedient to show to his sovereigns thank heaven i am a sovereign again and no longer a servant and really it is very singular how i look down upon our ambassadors and dignitaries of all sorts not excepting the president himself i doubt whether this is altogether a good influence of our mode of government i did not see and in fact declined seeing the minister himself but only his son the secretary of legation and a dr p an american traveller just from the continent he gave a fearful account of the difficulties that beset a person landing with much luggage in italy and especially at civita vecchia the very port at which we intended to debark i have been so long in england that it seems a cold and shivery thing to go anywhere else bennoch came to take tea with us on the th it being his first visit since we came to london and likewise his farewell visit on our leaving for the continent on his departure j and i walked a good way down oxford street and holborn with him and i took leave of him with the kindest wishes for his welfare end of vol ii
