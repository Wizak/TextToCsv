the narrow land by jack vance a pair of nerves joined across the top of erns brain he became conscious aware of darkness and constriction the sensation was uncomfortable he tensed his members thrust at the shell meeting resistance in all directions except one he kicked butted and presently created a rupture the constriction eased somewhat ern squirmed around clawed at the membrane tore it back and was met by a sudden unpleasant exudation the juices of a being not himself it wrenched around reached forth ern recoiled struck back the probing members which seemed ominously strong and massive there was a period of passivity each found the other hateful they were of the same sort yet different presently the two small creatures fought with little nearinaudible squeaks and chitters ern eventually strangled his opponent when he tried to detach himself he found that an adhesion of tissue had occurred that the two were now one ern expanded himself rounded and fused with the defeated individual for a further period ern rested exploring his consciousness the constriction once again became oppressive ern thrust and kicked creating a new rupture and the shell split wide ern struggled forth into soft slime then up into a glare of light an acrid dry void from above came a harsh cry an enormous shape hurtled down ern dodged evaded a pair of clicking black prongs he napped paddled slid down into cool water where he submerged himself others inhabited the water ern saw their dim shapes to all sides some were like himself pale popeyed sprats narrowskulled with wisps of film for crests others were larger with the legs and arms definitely articulated the crests stiffer the skin tough and silvergray ern bestirred himself tested his arms and legs he swam carefully at first then with competence hunger came he ate larvae nodules on the roots of reeds trifles of this and that so ern entered his childhood and gradually became wise in the ways of the waterworld duration could not be measured there was no basis for time no alteration of light and darkness no change except for erns own growth the only notable events of the seashallows were tragedies a waterbaby frolicking too far recklessly offshore might be caught in a current and swept out under the stormcurtain the armored birds from time to time carried away a very young baby basking at the surface most dreadful of all was the ogre who lived in one of the seasloughs a brutish creature with long arms a flat face and four bony ridges over the top of its skull on one occasion ern almost became its victim skulking under the roots of the swampreeds the ogre lunged forth ern felt the swirl of water and darted away the ogres grasp so near that the claws scraped his leg the ogre pursued making idiotic sounds then jerking aside seized one of erns playfellows and settled to the bottom to munch upon its captive after ern grew large enough to defy the predator birds he spent much time on the surface tasting the air and marveling at the largeness of the vistas though he understood nothing of what he saw the sky was a dull gray fog somewhat brighter out over the sea never changing except for an occasional windwhipped cloud or a trail of rain close at hand was the swamp sloughs lowlying islands overgrown with pallid reeds complicated black shrubs of the utmost fragility a few spindly dendrons beyond hung a wall of black murk on the seaward side the horizon was obscured by a lightningshattered wall of cloud and rain the wall of murk and the wall of storm ran parallel delineating the borders of the region between the larger of the waterchildren tended to congregate at the surface there were two sorts the typical individual was slender and lithe with a narrow bony skull a single crest protuberant eyes his temperament was mercurial he tended to undignified wrangling and sudden brisk fights which were over almost as soon as they started the sex differences were definite some were male half as many were female in contrast and much in the minority were the twincrested waterchildren these were more massive with broader skulls less prominent eyes and a more sedate disposition their sexual differentiation was not obvious and they regarded the antics of the singlecrested children with disapproval ern identified himself with this latter group though his crest development was not yet definite and if anything he was even broader and more stocky than the others sexually he was slow in developing but he seemed definitely masculine the oldest of the children single and doublecrested alike knew a few elements of speech passed down the classes from a time and source unknown in due course ern learned the language and thereafter idled away long periods discussing the events of the seashallows the wall of storm with its incessant dazzle of lightning was continually fascinating but the children gave most of their attention to the swamp and rising ground beyond where by virtue of tradition transmitted along with the language they knew their destiny lay among the men occasionally men would be seen probing the shore mud for flatfish or moving among the reeds on mysterious errands at such times the waterchildren impelled by some unknown emotion would instantly submerge themselves all except the most daring of the singlecrested who would float with only their eyes above water to watch the men at their fascinating activities each appearance of the men stimulated discussion among the waterchildren the singlecrested maintained that all would become men and walk the dry land which they declared to be a condition of bliss the doublecrested more skeptical agreed that the children might go ashoreafter all this was the traditionbut what next tradition offered no information on this score and the discussions remained speculative at long last ern saw men close at hand searching the bottom for crustaceans he heard a strong rhythmic splashing and looking up saw three large long figures magnificent creatures they swam with power and grace even the ogre might avoid such as these ern followed at a discreet distance wondering if he dared approach and make himself known it would be pleasant he thought to talk with these men to learn about life on the shore the men paused to inspect a school of playing children pointing here and there while the children halted their play to stare up in wonder now occurred a shocking incident the largest of the doublecrested waterchildren was zim the namegiver a creature by erns reckoning old and wise it was zims prerogative to ordain names for his fellows ern had received his name from zim it now chanced that zim unaware of the men wandered into view the men pointed uttered sharp guttural cries and plunged below the surface zim startled into immobility hesitated an instant then darted away the men pursued harrying him this way and that apparently intent on his capture zim wild with fear swam far offshore out over the gulf where the current took him and carried him away out toward the curtain of storm the men exclaiming in anger plunged landward in foaming strokes of arms and legs in fascinated curiosity ern followed up a large slough finally to a beach of packed mud the men waded ashore strode off among the reeds ern drifted slowly forward beset by a quivering conflict of impulses how he wondered could beings so magnificent hound zim the namegiver to his doom the land was close the footprints of the men were plain on the mud of the beach where did they lead what wonderful new vistas lay beyond the line of reeds ern eased forward to the beach he lowered his feet and tried to walk his legs felt limp and flexible only by dint of great concentration was he able to set one foot before the other deprived of the support of the water his body felt gross and clumsy from the reeds came a screech of amazement erns legs suddenly capable carried him in wobbling leaps down the beach he plunged into the water swam frantically back along the slough behind him came men churning the water ern ducked aside hid behind a clump of rotting reeds the men continued down the slough out over the shallows where they spent a fruitless period ranging back and forth ern remained in his cover the men returned passing no more than the length of their bodies from erns hiding place so close that he could see their glittering eyes and the dark yellow interior of their oral cavities when they gasped for air with their spare frames prowshaped skulls and single crests they resembled neither ern nor zim but rather the singlecrested waterchildren these were not his sort he was not a man perplexed seething with excitement and dissatisfaction ern returned to the shallows but nothing was as before the innocence of the easy old life had departed there was now a portent in the air which soured the pleasant old routines ern found it hard to wrench his attention away from the shore and he considered the singlecrested children his erstwhile playmates with new wariness they suddenly seemed strange different from himself and they in turn watched the doublecrested children with distrust swimming away in startled shoals when ern or one of the others came by ern became morose and dour the old satisfactions were gone there were no compensations twice again the men swam out across the shallows but all the doublecrested children ern among them hid under reeds the men thereupon appeared to lose interest and for a period life went on more or less as before but change was in the wind the shoreline became a preoccupation what lay behind the reed islands between the reed islands and the wall of murk where did the men live in what wonderful surroundings with the most extreme vigilance against the ogre ern swam up the largest of the sloughs to either side were islands overgrown with pale reeds with an occasional black skeletontree or a globe of tangle bush stuff so fragile as to collapse at a touch the slough branched opening into still coves reflecting the gray gloom of the sky and at last narrowed dwindling to a channel of black slime ern dared proceed no farther if someone or something had followed him he was trapped and at this moment a strange yellow creature halted overhead to hover on a thousand tinkling scales spying ern it set up a wild ululation off in the distance ern thought to hear a call of harsh voices men he swung around and swam back the way he had come with the tinklebird careening above ern ducked under the surface swam down the slough atfull speed presently he went to the side cautiously surfaced the yellow bird swung in erratic circles over the point where he had submerged its quavering howl now diminished to a mournful hooting sound ern gratefully returned to the shallows it was now clear to him that if ever he wished to go ashore he must learn to walk to the perplexity of his fellows even those of the doublecrests he began to clamber up through the mud of the near island exercising his legs among the reeds all went passably well and ern presently found himself walking without effort though as yet he dared not try the land behind the islands instead he swam along the coast the stormwall on his right hand the shore on his left on and on he went farther than he had ever ventured before the stormwall was changeless a roll of rain and a thick vapor lanced with lightning the wall of murk was the same dense black at the horizon lightening by imperceptible gradations to become the normal gloom of the sky overhead the narrow land extended endlessly onward ern saw new swamps reed islands shelves of muddy foreshore a spit of sharp rocks at length the shore curved away retreated toward the wall of murk to form a funnelshaped bay into which poured a freezingly cold river ern swam to the shore crawled up on the shingle stood swaying on his still uncertain legs far across the bay new swamps and islands continued to the verge of vision and beyond there was no living creature in sight ern stood alone on the gravel bar a small gray figure swaying on still limber legs peering earnestly this way and that the river curved away and out of sight into the darkness the water of the estuary was bitterly cold the current ran swift ern decided to go no farther he slipped into the sea and returned the way he had come back in the familiar shallows he took up his old routine searching the bottom for crustaceans taunting the ogre floating on the surface with a wary eye for men testing his legs on the island during one of the visits ashore he came upon a most unusual sight a woman depositing eggs in the mud from behind a curtain of reeds ern watched in fascination the woman was not quite so large as the men and lacked the harsh male facial structure though her cranial ridge was no less prominent she wore a shawl of a dark red woven stuff the first garment ern had ever seen and he marveled at the urbanity of the mens way of life the woman was busy for some time when she departed ern went to examine the eggs they had been carefully protected from armored birds by a layer of mud and a neat little tent of plaited reeds the nest contained three clutches each a row of three eggs each egg carefully separated from the next by a wad of mud so here thought ern was the origin of the waterbabies he recalled the circumstances of his own birth evidently he had emerged from just such an egg rearranging mud and tent ern left the eggs as he had found them and returned to the water time passed the men came no more ern wondered that they should abandon an occupation in which they had showed so vigorous an interest but then the whole matter exceeded the limits of his understanding he became prey to restlessness once again in this regard he seemed unique none of his fellows had ever wandered beyond the shallows ern set off along the shore this time swimming with the stormwall to his left he crossed the slough in which lived the ogre who glared up as ern passed and made a threatening gesture ern swam hastily on though now he was of a size larger than that which the ogre preferred to attack the shore on this side of the shallows was more interesting and varied than that to the other he came upon three high islands crowned with a varied vegetationblack skeleton trees stalks with bundles of pink and white foliage clenched in black fingers glossy lamellar pillars the topmost scales billowing out into gray leavesthen the islands were no more and the mainland rose directly from the sea ern swam close to the beach to avoid the currents and presently came to a spit of shingle pushing out into the sea he climbed ashore and surveyed the landscape the ground slanted up under a cover of umbrella trees then rose sharply to become a rocky bluff crested with black and gray vegetation the most notable sight of erns experience ern slid back into the sea swam on the landscape slackened became flat and swampy he swam past a bank of black slime overgrown with squirming yellowgreen fibrils which he took care to avoid some time later he heard a thrashing hissing sound and looking to sea observed an enormous white worm sliding through the water ern floated quietly and the worm slid on past and away ern continued on and on he swam until as before the shore was broken by an estuary leading away into the murk wading up the beach ern looked far and wide across a dismal landscape supporting only tatters of brown lichen the river which flooded the estuary seemed even larger and swifter than the one he had seen previously and carried an occasional chunk of ice a bitter wind blew toward the stormwall creating a field of retreating whitecaps the opposite shore barely visible showed no relief or contrast there was no apparent termination to the narrow land it appeared to reach forever between the walls of storm and gloom ern returned to the shallows not wholly satisfied with what he had learned he had seen marvels unknown to his fellows but what had they taught him nothing his questions remained unanswered changes were taking place they could not be ignored the whole of erns class lived at the surface breathing air infected by some pale dilution of erns curiosity they stared uneasily landward sexual differentiation was evident there were tendencies toward sexual play from which the doublecrested children with undeveloped organs stood contemptuously aloof social as well as physical distinctions developed there began to be an interchange of taunts and derogation occasionally a brief skirmish ern ranged himself with the doublecrested children although on exploring his own scalp he found only indecisive hummocks and hollows which to some extent embarrassed him in spite of the general sense of imminence the coming of the men took the children by surprise in the number of two hundred the men came down the sloughs and swam out to surround the shallows ern and a few others instantly clambered up among the reeds of the island and concealed themselves the other children milled and swam in excited circles the men shouted slapped the water with their arms diving and veering they herded the waterchildien up the slough all the way to the beach of dried mud here they chose and sorted sending the largest up the beach allowing the fingerlings and sprats to return to the shallows taking the doublecrested children with sharp cries of exultation the selection was complete the captive children were marshaled into groups and sent staggering up the trail those with legs still soft were carried ern fascinated by the process watched from a discreet distance when men and children had disappeared he emerged from the water clambered up the beach to look after his departed friends what to do now return to the shallows the old life seemed drab and insipid he dared not present himself to the men they were singlecrested they were harsh and abrupt what remained he looked back and forth between water and land and at last gave his youth a melancholy farewell henceforth he would live ashore he walked a few steps up the path stopped to listen silence he proceeded warily prepared to duck into the undergrowth at a sound the soil underfoot became less sodden the reeds disappeared and aromatic black cycads lined the path above rose slender supple withes with gasfilled leaves halffloating halfsupported ern moved ever more cautiously pausing to listen ever more frequently what if he met the men would they kill him ern hesitated and even looked back along the path the decision had been made he continued forward a sound from somewhere not too far ahead ern dodged off the path flattened himself behind a hummock no one appeared ern moved forward through the cycads and presently through the black fronds he saw the village of the men a marvel of ingenuity and complication nearby stood tall bins containing foodstuffs then at a little distance a row of thatched stalls stacked with poles coils of rope pots of pigment and grease yellow tinklebirds perched on the gables made a constant chuckling clamor the bins and stalls faced an open space surrounding a large platform where a ceremony of obvious import was in progress on the platform stood four men draped in bands of woven leaves and four women wearing dark red shawls and tall hats decorated with tinklebird scales beside the platform in a miserable gray clot huddled the singlecrested children the individuals distinguishable only by an occasional gleam of eye or twitch of pointed crest one by one the children were lifted up to the four men who gave each a careful examination most of the male children were dismissed and sent down into the crowd the rejects about one in every ten were killed by the blow of a stone mallet and propped up to face the wall of storm the girlchildren were sent to the other end of the platform where the four women waited each of the trembling girlchildren was considered in turn about half were discharged from the platform into the custody of a woman and taken to a booth about one in every five was daubed along the skull with white paint and sent to a nearby pen where the doublecrested children were also confined the rest suffered a blow of the mallet the corpses were propped to face the wall of murk above erns head sounded the mindless howl of a tinklebird ern darted back into the brush the bird drifted overhead on clashing scales men ran to either side chased ern back and forth and finally captured him he was dragged to the village thrust triumphantly up on the platform amid calls of surprise and excitement the four priests or whatever their function surrounded ern to make their examination there was a new set of startled outcries the priests stood back in perplexity then after a mumble of discussion signaled to the priestwomen the mallet was brought forwardbut was never raised a man from the crowd jumped up on the platform to argue with the priests they made a second careful study of erns head muttering to each other then one brought a knife another clamped erns head the knife was drawn the length of his cranium first to the left of the central ridge then to the right to produce a pair of nearparallel cuts orange blood trickled down erns face pain made him tense and stiff a woman brought forward a handful of some vile substance which she rubbed into the wounds then all stood away murmuring and speculating ern glared back halfmad with fear and pain he was led to a booth thrust within bars were dropped across the aperture and laced with thongs ern watched the remainder of the ceremony the corpses were dismembered boiled and eaten the whitedaubed girlchildren were marshaled into a group with all those doublecrested children with whom ern had previously identified himself why he wondered had he not been included in this group why had he first been threatened with the mallet then wounded with a knife the situation was incomprehensible the girls and the twocrested children were marched away through the brush the other girls with no more ado became members of the community the male children underwent a much more formal instruction each man took one of the boys under his sponsorship and subjected him to a rigorous discipline there were lessons in deportment knottying weaponry language dancing the various outcries ern received minimal attention he was fed irregularly as occasion seemed to warrant the period of his confinement could not be defined the changeless gray sky providing no chronometric reference and indeed the concept of time as a succession of definite interims was foreign to erns mind he escaped apathy only by attending the instruction in adjoining booths where singlecrested boys were taught language and deportment ern learned the language long before those under instruction he and his doublecrested fellows had used the rudiments of this language in the longgone halcyon past the twin wounds along erns skull eventually healed leaving parallel weals of scartissue the black feathery combs of maturity were likewise sprouting covering his entire scalp with down none of his erstwhile comrades paid him any heed they had become indoctrinated in the habits of the village the old life of the shallows had receded in their memories watching them stride past his prison ern found them increasingly apart from himself they were lithe slender agile like tall keenfeatured lizards he was heavier with blunter features a broader head his skin was tougher and thicker a darker gray he was now almost as large as the men though by no means so sinewy and quick when need arose they moved with mercurial rapidity once or twice ern in a fury attempted to break the bars of his booth only to be prodded with a pole for his trouble and he therefore desisted from this unprofitable exercise he became fretful and bored the booths to either side were now used only for copulation an activity which ern observed with dispassionate interest the booth at last was opened ern rushed forth hoping to surprise his captors and win free but one man seized him another looped a rope around his body without ceremony he was led from the village the men offered no hint of their intentions jogging along at a halftrot they took ern through the black brush in that direction known as sealeft which was to say with the sea on the left hand the trail veered inland rising over bare hummocks dropping into dank swales brimming with rank black dendrons ahead loomed a great copse of umbrella trees impressively tall each stalk as thick as the body of a man each billowing leaf large enough to envelope a halfdozen booths like that in which ern had been imprisoned someone had been at work a number of the trees had been cut the poles trimmed and neatly stacked the leaves cut into rectangular sheets and draped over ropes the racks supporting the poles had been built with meticulous accuracy and ern wondered who had done such precise work certainly not the men of the village whose construction even ern found haphazard a path led away through the forest a path straight as a string of constant width delineated by parallel lines of white stones a technical achievement far beyond the capacity of the men thought ern the men now became furtive and uneasy ern tried to hang back certain that whatever the men had in mind was not to his advantage but willynilly he was jerked forward the path made an abrupt turn marched up a swale between copses of blackbrown cycads turned out upon a field of soft white moss at the center of which stood a large and splendid village the men pausing in the shadows made contemptuous sounds performed insulting actsprovoked so ern suspected by envy for the village across the meadow surpassed that of his captors as much as that village excelled the environment of the shallows there were eight precisely spaced rows of huts built of sawed planks decorated or given symbolic import by elaborate designs of blue maroon and black at the searight and sealeft ends of the central avenue stood larger constructions with highpeaked roofs shingled like all the others with slabs of biotite notably absent were disorder and refuse this village unlike the village of the singlecrested men was fastidiously neat behind the village rose the great bluff ern had noticed on his exploration of the coast at the edge of the meadow stood a row of six stakes and to the first of these the men tied ern this is the village of the twos declared one of the men folk such as yourself do not mention that we cut your scalp or affairs will go badly they moved back taking cover under a bank of worm plants ern strained at his bonds convinced that no matter what the eventuality it could not be to his benefit the villagers had taken note of ern ten persons set forth across the meadow in front came four splendid twos stepping carefully with an exaggerated strutting gait followed by six young onegirls astoundingly urbane in gowns of wadded umbrella leaf the girls had been disciplined they no longer used their ordinary sinuous motion but walked in a studied simulation of the two attitudes ern stared in fascination the twos appeared to be of his own sort sturdier and heavier than the cleaverheaded ones the pair in the van apparently shared equal authority they comported themselves with canonical dignity and their garmentsfringed shawls of black brown and purple boots of gray membrane with metal clips metal filigree greaves were formalized and elaborate he on the stormward side wore a crest of glittering metal barbs he on the darkward side a double row of tall black plumes the twos at their back seemed of somewhat lesser prestige they wore caps of complicated folds and tucks and carried halberds three times their own length at the rear walked the onegirls carrying parcels ern saw them to be members of his own class part of the group which had been led away after the selection ritual their skin had been stained dark red and yellow they wore dull yellow caps yellow shawls yellow sandals and walked with the mincing delicate rigidity in which they had been schooled the foremost twos halting at either side of ern examined him with portentous gravity the halberdiers fixed him with a minatory stare the girls posed in selfconscious attitudes the twos squinted in puzzlement at the double ridges of scar tissue along his scalp they arrived at a dubious consensus he appears sound if somewhat gross of body and oddly ridged one of the halberdiers propping his weapon against a stake unbound ern who stood tentatively half of a mind to take to his heels the two wearing the crest of metal barbs inquired do you speak yes you must say yes preceptor of the storm dazzle such is the form ern found the admonition puzzling but no more so than the other attributes of the twos his best interests so he decided lay in cautious cooperation the twos while arbitrary and capricious apparently did not intend him harm the girls arranged the parcels beside the stake payment so it seemed to the onemen come then commanded he of the black plumes watch your feet walk correctly do not swing your arms you are a two an important individual you must act appropriately according to the way yes preceptor of the storm dazzle you will address me as preceptor of the dark chill confused and apprehensive ern was marched across the meadow of pale moss the trail demarcated now by lines of black stones bestrewn with black gravel and glistening in the damp exactly bisected the meadow which was lined to either side by tall blackbrown fantrees first walked the preceptors then ern then the halberdiers and finally the six onegirls the trail connected with the central avenue of the village which opened at the center into a square plaza paved with squares of wood to the darkward side of the plaza stood a tall black tower supporting a set of peculiar black objects on the stormward side an identical white tower presented lightning symbols across and set back in a widening of the avenue was a long twostory hall to which ern was conducted and lodged in a cubicle a third pair of twos of rank higher than the halberdiers but lower than the preceptorsthe pedagogue of the storm dazzle and the pedagogue of the dark chilltook ern in charge he was washed anointed with oil and again the weals along his scalp received a puzzled inspection ern began to suspect that the ones had used duplicity that in order to sell him to the twos they had simulated double ridges across his scalp and that after all he was merely a peculiar variety of one it was indeed a fact that his sexual parts resembled those of the onemen rather than the epicene or perhaps atrophied organs of the twos the suspicion made him more uneasy than ever and he was relieved when the pedagogues brought him a cap half of silver scales half of glossy black birdfiber which covered his scalp and a shawl hanging across his chest and belted at the waist which concealed his sex organs as with every other aspect and activity of the twovillage there were niceties of usage in regard to the cap the way requires that in lowceremonial activity you must stand with black toward night and silver toward chaos if a ritual or other urgency impedes reverse your cap this was the simplest and least complicated of the decorums to be observed the pedagogues found much to criticize in erns deportment you are somewhat more crude and gross than the usual cadet remarked the pedagogue of storm dazzle the injury to your head has affected your condition you will be carefully schooled the pedagogue of dark chill told him as of this moment consider yourself a mental void a dozen other young twos including four from erns class were undergoing tutelage as instruction was on an individual basis ern saw little of them he studied diligently and assimilated knowledge with a facility which won him grudging compliments when he seemed proficient in primary methods he was introduced to cosmology and religion we inhabit the narrow land declared the pedagogue of storm dazzle it extends forever how can we assert this with such confidence because we know that the opposing principles of storm and dark chill being divine are infinite therefore the narrow land the region of confrontation likewise is infinite ern ventured a question what exists behind the wall of storm there is no behind stormchaos is and dazzles the dark with his lightnings this is the masculine principle darkchill the female principle is she accepts the rage and fire and quells it we twos partake of each we are at equilibrium and hence excellent ern broached a perplexing topic the twowomen do not produce eggs there are neither twowomen nor twomen we are brought into being by dualdivine intervention when a pair of eggs in a onewomans clutch are put down in juxtaposition through alternation these are always male and female and so yield a double individual neutral and dispassionate symbolized by the paired cranial ridges onemen and onewomen are incomplete forever driven by the urge to couple only fusion yields the true two it was evident to ern that questioning disturbed the pedagogues so he desisted from further interrogation not wishing to call attention to his unusual attributes during instruction he had sensibly increased in size the combs of maturity were growing up over his scalp his sexual organs had developed noticeably both luckily were concealed by cap and shawl in some fashion he was different from other twos and the pedagogues should they discover this fact would feel dismay and confusion at the very least other matters troubled ern namely the impulses aroused within himself by the slave onegirls such tendencies were defined to be ignoble this was no way for a two to act the pedagogues would be horrified to learn of his leanings but if he were not a twowhat was he ern tried to quell his hot blood by extreme diligence he began to study the two technology which like every other aspect of two society was rationalized in terms of formal dogma he learned the methods of collecting bog iron of smelting casting forging hardening and tempering occasionally he wondered how the skills had first been evolved inasmuch as empiricism as a mode of thought was antithetical to the dual way ern thoughtlessly touched upon the subject during a recitation both pedagogues were present the pedagogue of stormdazzle replied somewhat tartly that all knowledge was a dispensation of the two basic principles in any event stated the pedagogue of darkchill the matter is irrelevant what is is and by this token is optimum indeed remarked the pedagogue of stormdazzle the very fact that you have formed this inquiry betrays a disorganized mind more typical of a freak than a two what is a freak asked ern the pedagogue of darkchill made a stern gesture once again your mentality tends to random association and discontent with authority respectfully pedagogue of darkchill i wish only to learn the nature of wrong so that i may know its distinction from right it suffices that you imbue yourself with right with no reference whatever to wrong with this viewpoint ern was forced to be content the pedagogues leaving the chamber glanced back at him ern heard a fragment of their muttered conversation surprising perversity but for the evidence of the cranial ridges in perturbation ern walked back and forth across his cubicle he was different from the other cadets so much was clear at the refectory where the cadets were brought nutriment by onegirls ern covertly scrutinized his fellows while only little less massive than himself they seemed differently proportioned almost cylindrical with features and protrusions less prominent if he were different what kind of person was he a freak what was a freak a masculine two ern was inclined to credit this theory for it explained his interest in the onegirls and he turned to watch them gliding back and forth with trays in spite of their oneness they were undeniably appealing thoughtfully ern returned to his cubicle in due course a onegirl came past ern summoned her into the cubicle and made his wishes known she showed surprise and uneasiness though no great disinclination you are supposed to be neutral what will everyone think nothing whatever if they are unaware of the situation true but is the matter feasible i am one and you are a two the matter may or may not be feasible how will the truth be known unless it is attempted orthodoxy notwithstanding well then as you will a monitor looked into the cubicle to stare dumbfounded what goes on here he looked more closely then tumbled backward into the compound to shout a freak a freak here among us a freak to arms kill the freak ern thrust the girl outside mingle with the others deny everything i now feel that i must leave he ran out upon the central avenue looked up and down the halberdiers informed of emergency were arraying themselves in formally appropriate gear ern took advantage of the delay to run from the village in pursuit came the twos calling threats and ritual abuse the searight path toward the pole forest and the swamp was closed to him ern fled sealeft toward the great bluff dodging among fan trees and banks of wormweed finally hiding under a bank of fungus he gained a respite while the halberdiers raced past emerging from his covert ern stood uncertainly wondering which way to go freak or not the twos had exhibited what seemed an irrational antagonism why had they attacked him he had performed no damage perpetrated no wilful deception the fault lay with the ones in order to deceive the twos they had scarred erns heada situation for which ern could hardly be held accountable bewildered and depressed ern started toward the shore where at least he could find food crossing a peat bog he was sighted by the halberdiers who instantly set up the outcry freakl freak freakl and again ern was forced to run for his life up through a forest of mingled cycads and poletrees toward the great bluff which now loomed ahead a massive stone wall barred his way a construction obviously of great age overgrown with black and brown lichen ern ran staggering and wobbling along the wall with the halberdiers close upon him still screaming freak freak freak a gap appeared in the wall ern jumped through to the opposite side ducked behind a clump of featherbush the halberdiers stopped short in front of the gap their cries stilled and now they seemed to be engaged in controversy ern waited despondently for discovery and death since the bush offered scant concealment one of the halberdiers at last ventured gingerly through the wall only to give a startled grunt and jump back there were receding footsteps then silence ern crawled cautiously from his hiding place and went to peer through the gap the twos had departed peculiar thought ern they must have known he was close at hand he turned ten paces distant the largest man he had yet seen leaned on a sword inspecting him with a brooding gaze the man was almost twice the size of the largest two he wore a dull brown smock of soft leather a pair of shining metal wristbands his skin was a heavy rugose gray tough as horn at the joints of his arms and legs were bony juts ridges and buttresses which gave him the semblance of enormous power his skull was broad heavy harshly indented and ridged his eyes were blazing crystals in deep shrouded sockets along his scalp ran three serrated ridges in addition to his sword he carried slung over his shoulder a peculiar metal device with a long nozzle he advanced a slow step ern swayed back but for some reason beyond his own knowing was dissuaded from taking to his heels the man spoke in a hoarse voice why do they hunt you ern took courage from the fact that the man had not killed him out of hand they called me freak and drove me forth freak the three considered erns scalp you are a two the ones cut my head to make scars then sold me to the twos ern felt the weals on either side and at the center almost as prominent as the scars were the crests of an adult three in number they were growing apace even had he not compromised himself the twos must have found him out on the first occasion he removed his cap he said humbly it appears that i am a freak like yourself the three made a brusque sound come with me they walked back through the grove to a path which slanted up the bluff then swung to the side and entered a valley beside a pond rose a great stone hall flanked by two towers with steep conical roofsin spite of age and dilapidation a structure to stagger erns imagination by a timber portal they entered a courtyard which seemed to ern a place of unparalleled charm at the far end boulders and a great overhanging slab created the effect of a grotto within were trickling water growths of feathery black moss pale cycads a settle padded with woven reed and sphagnum the open area was a swampgarden exhaling the odors of reed watersoaked vegetation resinous wood remarkable thought ern as well as enchanting neither the ones nor the twos contrived except for an immediate purpose the three took ern across the court into a stone chamber also halfopen to the refreshing drizzle carpeted with packed sphagnum under the shelter of the ceiling were the appurtenances of the threes existence crocks and bins a table a cabinet tools and implements the three pointed to a bench sit ern gingerly obeyed you are hungry no how was your imposture discovered ern related the circumstances which led to his exposure the three showed no disapproval which gave ern encouragement i had long suspected that i was something other than a two you are obviously a three said his host unlike the neuter twos threes are notably masculine which explains your inclinations for the onewoman unluckily there are no three females he looked at ern they did not tell how you were born i am the fusion of oneeggs true the onewoman lays eggs of alternate sexin clutches of three the pattern is malefemalemale such is the nature of her organism a sheath forms on the interior of her ovipositor as the eggs emerge a sphincter closes to encapsulate the eggs if she is careless she will fail to separate the eggs and will put down a clutch with two eggs in contact the male breaks into the female shell there is fusion a two is hatched at the rarest of intervals three eggs are so joined one male fuses with the female then so augmented he breaks into the final egg and assimilates the other male the result is a male three ern recalled his first memory i was alone i broke into the malefemale shell we fought at length the three reflected for a lengthy period ern wondered if he had committed an annoyance finally the three said i am named mazar the final now that you are here i can be known as the final no longer i am accustomed to solitude i have become old and severe you may find me poor company if such is the case you are free to pursue existence elsewhere if you choose to stay i will teach you what i know which is perhaps pointless activity since the twos will presently come in a great army to kill us both i will stay said ern as of now i know only the ceremonies of the twos which i may never put to use are there no other threes the twos have killed allall but mazar the final and ern and now ern what of sealeft and searight beyond the rivers along other shores are there no more men who knows the wall of storm confronts the wall of dark the narrow land extendshow far who knows if to infinity then all possibilities must be realized then there are other ones twos and threes if the narrow land terminates at chaos then we may be alone i have traveled searight and sealeft until wide rivers stopped me said ern the narrow land continued without any sign of coming to an end i believe that it must extend to infinity in fact it is hard to conceive of a different situation perhaps perhaps said mazar gruffly come he conducted ern about the hall through workshops and repositories chambers crowded with mementoes trophies and nameless paraphernalia who used these marvelous objects were there many threes at one tune there were many intoned mazar in a voice as hoarse and dreary as the sound of wind it was so long ago that i cannot put words to the thought i am the last why were there so many then and so few now it is a melancholy tale a onetribe lived along the shore with customs different from the ones of the swamp they were a gentle people and they were ruled by a three who had been born by accident he was mena the origin and he caused the women to produce clutches with the eggs purposely joined so that a large number of threes came into being it was a great era we were dissatisfied with the harsh life of the ones the rigid life of the twos we created a new existence we learned the use of iron and steel we built this hall and many more the ones and twos both learned from us and profited why did they war upon you by our freedom we incurred their fear we set out to explore the narrow land we traveled many leagues sealeft and searight an expedition penetrated the darkchill to a wilderness of ice so dark that the explorers walked with torches we built a raft and sent it to drift under the wall of storm there were three ones aboard the raft was tethered with a long cable when we pulled it back the ones had been riven by dazzle and were dead by these acts we infuriated the two preceptors they declared us impious and marshaled the ones of the swamp they massacred the ones of the shore then they made war on the threes ambush poison pitfall they showed no mercy we killed twos there were always more twos but never more threes i could tell long tales of the war how each of my comrades met death of them all i am the last i never go beyond the wall and the twos are not anxious to attack me for they fear my fire gun but enough for now go where you will except beyond the wall where the twos are dangerous there is food in the bins you may rest in the moss reflect upon what you see and when you have questions i will answer mazar went his way ern refreshed himself in the falling water of the grotto ate from the bins then walked upon the gray meadow to consider what he had learned here mazar becoming curious discovered him well then asked mazar and what do you think now i understand many things which have puzzled me said ern also i regret leaving the onegirl who showed a cooperative disposition this varies according to the individual said mazar in the olden times we employed many such as domestics though their mental capacity is not great if there were threewomen would they not produce eggs and eventually threechildren mazar made a brusque gesture there are no threewomen there have never been three women the process allows none to form what if the process were controlled bah the ovulation of onewomen is not susceptible to our control long ago said ern i watched a onewoman preparing her nest she laid in clutches of three if sufficient eggs were collected rearranged and joined in some cases the female principle would dominate this is an unorthodox proposal said mazar and to my knowledge has never been tried it cannot be feasible such women might not be fertile or they might be freaks indeed we are a product of the process ern argued because there are two male eggs to the clutch we are masculine if there were two female and one male or three female why should not the result be female as for fertility we have no knowledge until the matter is put to test the process is unthinkable roared mazar drawing himself erect crests extended i will hear no more dazed by the fury of the old threes response ern stood limp slowly he turned and started to walk searight toward the wall where are you going mazar called after him to the swamps and what will you do there i will find eggs and try to help a threewoman into being mazar glared and ern prepared to flee for his life then mazar said if your scheme is sound all my comrades are dead in vain existence becomes a mockery perhaps nothing will come of the notion said ern if so nothing is different the venture is dangerous grumbled mazar the twos will be alert i will go down to the shore and swim to the swamp they will never notice me in any case i have no better use to which to put my life go then said mazar in his hoarsest voice i am old and without enterprise perhaps our race may yet be regenerated go then take care and return safely you and i are the only threes alive mazar patrolled the wall at times he ventured out into the poleforest listening peering down toward the two village ern had been gone a long time or so it seemed at last faroff alarms the cry of freak freak freak recklessly three crests furiously erect mazar plunged toward the sound ern appeared through the trees haggard streaked with mud carrying a rushbasket in frantic pursuit came two halberdiers and somewhat to the side a band of painted onemen this way roared mazar to the walll he brought forth his firegun the halberdiers in a frenzy ignored the threat ern tottered past him mazar pointed the projector pulled the trigger flame enveloped four of the halberdiers who ran thrashing and flailing through the forest the others halted mazar and ern retreated to the wall passed through the gap the halberdiers excited to rashness leapt after them mazar swung his sword one of the twos lost his head the others retreated in panic keening in horror at so much death ern slumped upon the ground cradling the eggs upon his body how many demanded mazar i found two nests i took three clutches from each each nest is separate and each clutch as well eggs from different nests may not fuse each is separate mazar carried the corpse to the gap in the wall flung it forth then threw the head at the skulking onemen none came to challenge him once more in the hall mazar arranged the eggs on a stone settle he made a sound of satisfaction in each clutch are two round eggs and one oval male and female and we need not guess at the combinations he reflected a moment two males and a female produce the masculine three two females and a male should exert an equal influence in the opposite direction there will necessarily be an excess of male eggs they will yield two masculine threes possibly more if three male eggs are able to fuse he made a thoughtful sound it is a temptation to attempt the fusion of four eggs in this case i would urge caution suggested ern mazar drew back in surprise and displeasure is your wisdom so much more profound than mine ern made a polite gesture of selfeffacement one of the graces learned at the two school i was born on the shallows among the waterbabies our great enemy was the ogre who lived in a slough while i searched for eggs i saw him again he is larger than you and i together his limbs aregross his head is malformed and hung over with red wattles upon his head stand four crests mazar was silent he said at last we are threes best that we produce other threes well then to work the eggs lay in the cool mud three paces from the water of the pond now to wait said mazar to wait and wonder i will help them survive said ern i will bring them food and keep them safe and if they are female there will be two females declared mazar of this am certain i am oldbut well we shall see the masquerade on dicantropus two puzzles dominated the life of jim root the first the pyramid out in the desert tickled and prodded his curiosity while the second the problem of getting along with his wife kept him keyed to a high pitch of anxiety and apprehension at the moment the problem had crowded the mystery of the pyramid into a lost alley of his brain eyeing his wife uneasily root decided that she was in for another of her fits the symptoms were familiara jerking over of the pages of an old magazine her tense back and boltupright posture her pointed silence the compression at the corners of her mouth with no preliminary motion she threw the magazine across the room jumped to her feet she walked to the doorway stood looking out across the plain fingers tapping on the sill root heard her voice low as if not meant for him to hear another day of this and ill lose what littles left of my mind root approached warily if he could be compared to a labrador retriever then his wife was a black panthera woman tall and well covered with sumptuous flesh she had black flowing hair and black flashing eyes she lacquered her fingernails and wore black lounge pajamas even on desiccated deserted inhospitable dicantropus now dear said root take it easy certainly its not as bad as all that she whirled and root was surprised by the intensity in her eyes its not bad you say very well for you to talkyou dont care for anything human to begin with im sick of it do you hear i want to go back to earth i never want to see another planet in my whole life i never want to hear the word archaeology i never want to see a rock or a bone or a microscope she flung a wild gesture around the room that included a number of rocks bones microscopes as well as books specimens in bottles photographic equipment a number of native artifacts root tried to soothe her with logic very few people are privileged to live on an outside planet dear t theyre in their right minds if id known what it was like id never have come out here her voice dropped once more same old dirt every day same stinking natives same vile canned food nobody to talk to root uncertainly picked up and laid down his pipe lie down dear he said with unconvincing confidence take a nap things will look different when you wake up stabbing him with a look she turned and strode out into the bluewhite glare of the sun root followed more slowly bringing barbaras sunhelmet and adjusting his own automatically he cocked an eye up the antenna the reason for the station and his own presence dicantropus being a relay point for ulr messages between clave ii and polaris the antenna stood as usual polished metal tubing four hundred feet high barbara halted by the shore of the lake a brackish pond in the neck of an old volcano one of the few natural bodies of water on the planet root silently joined her handed her her sunhelmet she jammed it on her head walked away root shrugged watched her as she circled the pond to a clump of featherfronded cycads she flung herself down relaxed into a sulky lassitude her back to a big graygreen trunk and seemed intent on the antics of the nativesowlish leathergray little creatures popping back and forth into holes in their mound this was a hillock a quartermile long covered with spinescrub and a rusty black creeper with one exception it was the only eminence as far as the eye could reach horizon to horizon across the baked helpless expanse of the desert the exception was the stepped pyramid the mystery of which irked root it was built of massive granite blocks set without mortar but cut so carefully that hardly a crack could be seen early on his arrival root had climbed all over the pyramid unsuccessfully seeking entrance when finally he brought out his atomite torch to melt a hole in the granite a sudden swarm of natives pushed him back and in the pidgin of dicantropus gave him to understand that entrance was forbidden root desisted with reluctance and had been consumed by curiosity ever since who had built the pyramid in style it resembled the ziggurats of ancient assyria the granite had been set with a skill unknown so far as root could see to the natives but if not the nativeswho a thousand times root had chased the question through his brain were the natives debased relics of a oncecivilized race if so why were there no other ruins and what was the purpose of the pyramid a temple a mausoleum a treasurehouse perhaps it was entered from below by a tunnel as root stood on the shore of the lake looking across the desert the questions flicked automatically through his mind though without their usual pungency at the moment the problem of soothing his wife lay heavy on his mind he debated a few moments whether or not to join her perhaps she had cooled off and might like some company he circled the pond and stood looking down at her glossy black hair i came over here to be alone she said without accent and the indifference chilled him more than an insult i thoughtthat maybe you might like to talk said root im very sorry barbara that youre unhappy still she said nothing sitting with her head pressed back against the tree trunk well go home on the next supply ship root said lets see there should be one three months and three days said barbara flatly root shifted his weight watched her from the corner of his eye this was a new manifestation tears recriminations angerthere had been plenty of these before well try to keep amused till then he said desperately lets think up some games to play maybe badmintonor we could do more swimming barbara snorted in sharp sarcastic laughter with things like that popping up around you she gestured to one of the dicantrops who had lazily paddled close she narrowed her eyes leaned forward whats that hes got around his neck root peered looks like a diamond necklace more than anything else my lord whispered barbara root walked down to the waters edge hey boy the dicantrop turned his great velvety eyes in their sockets come here barbara joined him as the native paddled close lets see what youve got there said root leaning to the necklace why those are beautiful breathed his wife root chewed his lip thoughtfully they certainly look like diamonds the setting might be platinum or indium hey boy where did you get these the dicantrop paddled backward we find where the dicantrop blew froth from his breathholes but it seemed to root as if his eyes had glanced momentarily toward the pyramid you find in big pile of rock no said the native and sank below the surface barbara returned to her seat by the tree frowned at the water root joined her for a moment there was silence then barbara said that pyramid must be full of things like that root made a deprecatory noise in his throat ohi suppose its possible why dont you go out and see id like tobut you know it would make trouble you could go out at night no said root uncomfortably its really not right if they want to keep the thing closed up and secret its their business after all it belongs to them how do you know it does his wife insisted with a hard and sharp directness they didnt build it and probably never put those diamonds there scorn crept into her voice are you afraid yes said root im afraid theres an awful lot of them and only two of us thats one objection but the other most important barbara let herself slump back against the trunk i dont want to hear it root now angry himself said nothing for a minute then thinking of the three months and three days till the arrival of the supply ship he said its no use our being disagreeable it just makes it harder on both of us i made a mistake bringing you out here and im sorry i thought youd enjoy the experience just the two of us alone on a strange planet barbara was not listening to him her mind was elsewhere barbara shh she snapped be still listen he jerked his head up the air vibrated with a far thrummmm root sprang out into the sunlight scanned the sky the sound grew louder there was no question about it a ship was dropping down from space root ran into the station flipped open the communicatorbut there were no signals coming in he returned to the door and watched as the ship sank down to a bumpy rough landing two hundred yards from the station it was a small ship the type rich men sometimes used as private yachts but old and battered it sat in a quiver of hot air its tubes creaking and hissing as they cooled root approached the dogs on the port began to turn the port swung open a man stood in the opening for a moment he teetered on loose legs then fell headlong root springing forward caught him before he struck ground barbara root called his wife approached take his feet well carry him inside hes sick they laid him on the couch and his eyes opened halfway whats the trouble asked root where do you feel sick my legs are like ice husked the man my shoulders ache i cant breathe wait till i look in the book muttered root he pulled out the official spacemans selfhelp guide traced down the symptoms he looked across to the sick man you been anywhere near alphard just came from there panted the man looks like you got a dose of lymas virus a shot of mycosetin should fix you up according to the book he inserted an ampoule into the hypospray pressed the tip to his patients arm pushed the plunger home that should do itaccording to the guide thanks said his patient i feel better already he closed his eyes root stood up glanced at barbara she was scrutinizing the man with a peculiar calculation root looked down again seeing the man for the first time he was young perhaps thirty thin but strong with a tight nervous muscularity his face was lean almost gaunt his skin very bronzed he had short black hair heavy black eyebrows a long jaw a thin high nose root turned away glancing at his wife he foresaw the future with a sick certainty he washed out the hypospray returned the guide to the rack all with a sudden selfconscious awkwardness when he turned around barbara was staring at him with wide thoughtful eyes root slowly left the room a day later marville landry was on his feet and when he had shaved and changed his clothes there was no sign of the illness he was by profession a mining engineer so he revealed to root en route to a contract on thuban xiv the virus had struck swiftly and only by luck had he noticed the proximity of dicantropus on his charts rapidly weakening he had been forced to decelerate so swiftly and land so uncertainly that he feared his fuel was low and indeed when they went out to check they found only enough fuel to throw the ship a hundred feet into the air landry shook his head ruefully and theres a tenmillionmunit contract waiting for me on thuban fourteen said root dismally the supply packets due in three months landry winced three monthsin this hellhole thats murder they returned to the station how do you stand it here barbara heard him we dont ive been on the verge of hysterics every minute the last six months jimshe made a wry grimace toward her husbandhes got his bones and rocks and the antenna hes not too much company maybe i can help out landry offered airily maybe she said with a cool blank glance at root presently she left the room walking more gracefully now with an air of mysterious gaiety dinner that evening was a gala event as soon as the sun took its blue glare past the horizon barbara and landry carried a table down to the lake and there they set it with all the splendor the station could afford with no word to root she pulled the cork on the gallon of brandy he had been nursing for a year and served generous highballs with canned limejuice maraschino cherries and ice for a space with the candles glowing and evoking lambent ghosts in the highballs even root was gay the air was wonderfully cool and the sands of the desert spread white and clean as damask out into the dimness so they feasted on canned fowl and mushrooms and frozen fruit and drank deep of roots brandy and across the pond the natives watched from the dark and presently while root grew sleepy and dull landry became gay and barbara sparkledthe complete hostess charming witty and the dicantropus night tinkled and throbbed with her laughter she and landry toasted each other and exchanged laughing comments at roots expense who now sat slumping stupid halfasleep finally he lurched to his feet and stumbled off to the station on the table by the lake the candles burnt low barbara poured more brandy their voices became murmurs and at last the candles guttered in spite of any human will to hold time in blessed darkness morning came and brought a day of silence and averted eyes then other days and nights succeeded each other and time proceeded as usual and there was now little pretense at the station barbara frankly avoided root and when she had occasion to speak her voice was one of covert amusement landry secure confident aquiline had a trick of sitting back and looking from one to the other as if inwardly chuckling over the whole episode root preserved a studied calm and spoke in a subdued tone which conveyed no meaning other than the sense of his words there were a few minor clashes entering the bathroom one morning root found landry shaving with his razor without heat root took the shaver out of landrys hand for an instant landry stared blankly then wrenched his mouth into the beginnings of a snarl root smiled almost sadly dont get me wrong landry theres a difference between a razor and a woman the razor is mine a human being cant be owned leave my personal property alone landrys eyebrows rose man youre crazy he turned away heats got you the days went past and now they were unchanging as before but unchanging with a new leaden tension words became even fewer and dislike hung like tattered tinsel every motion every line of the body became a detestable sight an evil which the other flaunted deliberately root burrowed almost desperately into his rocks and bones peered through his microscope made a thousand measurements a thousand notes landry and barbara fell into the habit of taking long walks in the evening usually out to the pyramid then slowly back across the quiet cool sand the mystery of the pyramid suddenly fascinated landry and he even questioned root ive no idea said root your guess is as good as mine all i know is that the natives dont want anyone trying to get into it mph said landry gazing across the desert no telling whats inside barbara said one of the natives was wearing a diamond necklace worth thousands i suppose anythings possible said root he had noticed the acquisitive twitch to landrys mouth the hook of the fingers youd better not get any ideas i dont want any trouble with the natives remember that landry landry asked with seeming mildness do you have any authority over that pyramid no said root shortly none whatever its notyours landry sardonically accented the word and root remembered the incident of the shaver no then said landry rising mind your own business he left the room during the day root noticed landry and barbara deep in conversation and he saw landry rummaging through his ship at dinner no single word was spoken as usual when the afterglow had died to a cool blue glimmer barbara and landry strolled off into the desert but tonight root watched after them and he noticed a pack on landrys shoulders and barbara seemed to be carrying a handbag he paced back and forth puffing furiously at his pipe landry was rightit was none of his business if there were profit he wanted none of it and if there were danger it would strike only those who provoked it or would it would he root be automatically involved because of his association with landry and barbara to the dicantrops a man was a man and if one man needed punishment all men did likewise would there be killing root puffed at his pipe chewed the stem blew smoke out in gusts between his teeth in a way he was responsible for barbaras safety he had taken her from a sheltered life on earth he shook his head put down his pipe went to the drawer where he kept his gun it was gone root looked vacantly across the room landry had it no telling how long since hed taken it root went to the kitchen found a meataxe tucked it inside his jumper set out across the desert he made a wide circle in order to approach the pyramid from behind the air was quiet and dark and cool as water in an old well the crisp sand sounded faintly under his feet above him spread the sky and the sprinkle of the thousand stars somewhere up there was the sun and old earth the pyramid loomed suddenly large and now he saw a glow heard the muffled clinking of tools he approached quietly halted several hundred feet out in the darkness stood watching alert to all sounds landrys atomite torch ate at the granite as he cut barbara hooked the detached chunks out into the sand from time to time landry stood back sweating and gasping from radiated heat a foot he cut into the granite two feet three feet and root heard the excited murmur of voices they were through into empty space careless of watching behind them they sidled through the hole they had cut root more wary listened strove to pierce the darkness nothing he sprang forward hastened to the hole peered within the yellow gleam of landrys torch swept past his eyes he crept into the hole pushed his head out into emptiness the air was cold smelled of dust and damp rock landry and barbara stood fifty feet away in the desultory flash of the lamp root saw stone walls and a stone floor the pyramid appeared to be an empty shell why then were the natives so particular he heard landrys voice edged with bitterness not a damn thing not even a mummy for your husband to gloat over root could sense barbara shuddering lets go it gives me the shivers its like a dungeon just a minute we might as well make sure hm he was playing the light on the walls thats peculiar whats peculiar it looks like the stone was sliced with a torch notice how its fused here on the inside root squinted trying to see strange he heard land mutter outside its chipped inside its cut by a torch doesnt look so very old here inside either the air would preserve it suggested barbara dubiously i suppose sostill old places look old theres dust and a kind of dullness this looks raw i dont understand how that could be i dont either theres something funny somewhere root stiffened sound from without shuffle of splay feet in the sandhe started to back out something pushed him he sprawled forward fell the bright eye of landrys torch stared in his direction whats that came a hard voice whos there root looked over his shoulder the light passed over him struck a dozen gray bony forms they stood quietly just inside the hole their eyes like balls of black plush root gained his feet hah cried landry so youre here too not because i want to be returned root grimly landry edged slowly forward keeping his light on the dicantrops he asked root sharply are these lads dangerous root appraised the natives i dont know stay still said one of these in the front rank stay still his voice was a deep croak stay still hell exclaimed landry were leaving theres nothing here i want get out of the way he stepped forward stay still we kill landry paused whats the trouble now interposed root anxiously surely theres no harm in looking theres nothing here that is why we kill nothing here now you know now you look other place when you think this place important then you not look other place we kill new man come he think this place important landry muttered do you get what hes driving at root said slowly i dont know for sure he addressed the dicantrop we dont care about your secrets youve no reason to hide things from us the native jerked his head then why do you come here you look for secrets barbaras voice came from behind what is your secret diamonds the native jerked his head again amusement anger his emotions unearthly could be matched by no earthly words diamonds are nothingrocks id like a carload landry muttered under his breath now look here said root persuasively you let us out and we wont pry into any of your secrets it was wrong of us to break in and im sorry it happened well repair the damage the dicantrop made a faint sputtering sound you do not understand you tell other menpyramid is nothing then other men look all around for other thing they bother look look look all this no good you die everything go like before theres too much talk said landry viciously and i dont like the sound of it lets get out of here he pulled out roots gun come on he snapped at root lets move to the natives get out of the way or ill do some killing myself a rustle of movement from the natives a thin excited whimper weve got to rush them shouted landry if they get outside they can knock us over as we leave lets go he sprang forward and root was close behind landry used the gun as a club and root used his fists and the dicantrops rattled like cornstalks against the walls landry erupted through the hole root pushed barbara through and kicking back at the natives behind him struggled out into the air landrys momentum had carried him away from the pyramid out into a seething mob of dicantrops root following more slowly pressed his back to the granite he sensed the convulsive movement in the wide darkness the whole colony must be down here he shouted into barbaras ear for a minute he was occupied with the swarming natives keeping barbara behind him as much as possible the first ledge of granite was about shoulder height step on my hands he panted ill shove you up butlandry came barbaras choked wail look at that crowd bit root furiously we cant do anything a sudden rush of small bony forms almost overwhelmed him hurry up whimpering she stepped into his clasped hands he thrust her up on the first ledge shaking off the clawing natives who had leapt on him he jumped scrambled up beside her now run he shouted in her ear and she fled down the ledge from the darkness came a violent cry root root for gods saketheyve got me down another hoarse yell rising to a scream of agony then silence hurry said root they came to the far corner of the pyramid jump down panted root down to the ground landry moaned barbara teetering at the edge get down snarled root he thrust her down to the white sand and seizing her hand ran across the desert back toward the station a minute or so later with pursuit left behind he slowed to a trot we should go back cried barbara are you going to leave him to those devils root was silent a moment then choosing his words he said i told him to stay away from the place anything that happens to him is his own fault and whatever it is its already happened theres nothing we can do now a dark hulk shouldered against the skylandrys ship lets get in here said root well be safer than in the station he helped her into the ship clamped tight the port phew he shook his head never thought it would come to this he climbed into the pilots seat looked out across the desert barbara huddled somewhere behind him sobbing softly an hour passed during which they said no word then without warning a fiery orange ball rose from the hill across the pond drifted toward the station root blinked jerked upright in his seat he scrambled for the ships machinegun yanked at the triggerwithout result when at last he found and threw off the safety the orange ball hung over the station and root held his fire the ball brushed against the antennaa tremendous explosion spattered to every corner of vision it seared roots eyes threw him to the deck rocked the ship left him dazed and halfconscious barbara lay moaning root hauled himself to his feet a seared pit a tangle of metal showed where the station had stood root dazedly slumped into the seat started the fuel pump plunged home the catalyzers the boat quivered bumped a few feet along the ground the tubes sputtered wheezed root looked at the fuel gauge looked again the needle pointed to zero a fact which root had known but forgotten he cursed his own stupidity their presence in the ship might have gone ignored if he had not called attention to it up from the hill floated another orange ball root jumped for the machine gun sent out a burst of explosive pellets again the roar and the blast and the whole top of the hill was blown off revealing what appeared to be a smooth strata of black rock root looked over his shoulder to barbara this is it whawhat do you mean we cant get away sooner or later his voice trailed off he reached up twisted a dial labelled emergency the ships ulr unit hummed root said into the mesh dicantropus stationwere being attacked by natives send help at once root sank back into the seat a tape would repeat his message endlessly until cut off barbara staggered to the seat beside root what were those orange balls thats what ive been wonderingsome sort of bomb but there were no more of them and presently the horizon began to glare the hill became a silhouette on the electric sky and over their heads the transmitter pulsed an endless message into space how long before we get help whispered barbara too long said root staring off toward the hill they must be afraid of the machine guni cant understand what else theyre waiting for maybe good light they can her voice stopped she stared root stared held by unbeliefamazement the hill across the pond was breaking open crumbling root sat drinking brandy with the captain of the supply ship method which had come to then assistance and the captain was shaking his head ive seen lots of strange things around this cluster but this masquerade beats everything root said its strange in one way in another its as cold and straightforward as abc they played it as well as they could and it was pretty darned good if it hadnt been for that scoundrel landry theyd have fooled us forever the captain banged his glass on the desk stared at root but why root said slowly they liked dicantropus its a hellhole a desert to us but it was heaven to them they liked the heat the dryness but they didnt want a lot of offworld creatures prying into their businessas we surely would have if wed seen through the masquerade it must have been an awful shock when the first earth ship set down here and that pyramid now thats a strange thing they were good psychologists these dicantrops as good as you could expect an offworld race to be if youll read a report of the first landing youll find no mention of the pyramid why because it wasnt here landry thought it looked new he was right it was new it was a fraud a decoyjust strange enough to distract our attention as long as that pyramid sat out there with me focusing all my mental energy on it they were safeand how they must have laughed as soon as landry broke in and discovered the fraud then it was all over that might have been their miscalculation mused root assume that they knew nothing of crime of antisocial action if everybody did what he was told to do their privacy was safe forever root laughed maybe they didnt know human beings so well after all the captain refilled the glasses and they drank in silence wonder where they came from he said at last root shrugged i suppose well never know some other hot dry planet thats sure maybe they were refugees or some peculiar religious sect or maybe they were a colony hard to say agreed the captain sagely different race different psychology thats what we run into all the time thank god they werent vindictive said root half to himself no doubt they could have killed us any one of a dozen ways after id sent out that emergency call and they had to leave it all ties in admitted the captain root sipped the brandy nodded once that ulr signal went out their isolation was done for no matter whether we were dead or not thered be earthmen swarming around the station pushing into their tunnelsand right there went their secret and he and the captain silently inspected the hole across the pond where the tremendous spaceship had lain buried under the spinescrub and rusty black creeper and once that spaceship was laid bare root continued thered be a hullabaloo from here to fomalhaut a tremendous mass like that wed have to know everythingtheir spacedrive their history everything about them if what they wanted was privacy that would be a thing of the past if they were a colony from another star they had to protect their secrets the same way we protect ours barbara was standing by the ruins of the station poking at the tangle with a stick she turned and root saw that she held his pipe it was charred and battered but still recognizable she slowly handed it to him well said root she answered in a quiet withdrawn voice now that im leaving i think ill miss dicantropus she turned to him jim what id stay on another year if youd like no said root i dont like it here myself she said still in the low tone thenyou dont forgive me for being foolish root raised his eyebrows certainly i do i never blamed you in the first place youre human indisputably human thenwhy are you actinglike moses root shrugged whether you believe me or not she said with an averted gaze i never he interrupted with a gesture what does it matter suppose you didyou had plenty of reason to i wouldnt hold it against you you wouldin your heart root said nothing i wanted to hurt you i was slowly going crazyand yon didnt seem to care one way or another toldhim i wasntyour property root smiled his sad smile im human too he made a casual gesture toward the hole where the dicantrop spaceship had lain if you still want diamonds go down that hole with a bucket therere diamonds big as grapefruit its an old volcanic neck its the granddaddy of all diamond mines ive got a claim staked out around it well be using diamonds for billiard balls as soon as we get some machinery out here they turned slowly back to the method threes quite a crowd on dicantropus said root thoughtfully on earth where therere three billion we can have a little privacy where hesperut falls my servants will not allow me to kill myself i have sought selfextinction by every method from throatcutting to the intricate routines of yoga but so far they have thwarted my most ingenious efforts i grow ever more annoyed what is more personal more truly ones own than a mans own life it is his basic possession to retain or relinquish as he sees fit if they continue to frustrate me someone other than myself will suffer i guarantee this my name is henry revere my appearance is not remarkable my intelligence is hardly noteworthy and my emotions run evenly i live in a house of synthetic shell decorated with wood and jade and surrounded by a pleasant garden the view to one side is the ocean to the other a valley sprinkled with houses similar to my own i am by no means a prisoner although my servants supervise me with the most minute care their first concern is to prevent my suicide just as mine is to achieve it it is a game in which they have all the advantagesa detailed knowledge of my psychology corridors behind the walls from which they can observe me and a host of technical devices they are men of my own race in fact of my own blood but they are immeasurably more subtle than i my latest attempt was clever enoughalthough i had tried it before without success i bit deeply into my tongue and thought to infect the cut with a pinch of garden loam the servants either noticed me placing the soil in my mouth or observed the tension of my jaw they acted without warning i stood on the terrace hoping the soreness in my mouth might go undetected then without conscious hiatus i found myself reclining on a pallet the dirt removed the wound healed they had used a thoughtdamping ray to anaesthetize me and their sure medical techniques aided by my almost invulnerable constitution defeated the scheme as usual i concealed my annoyance and went to my study this is a room i have designed to my own taste as far as possible from the complex curvilinear style which expresses the spirit of the age almost immediately the person in charge of the household entered the room i call him dr jones because i cannot pronounce his name he is taller than i slender and fineboned his features are small beautifully shaped except for his chin which to my mind is too sharp and long although i understand that such a chin is a contemporary criterion of beauty his eyes are very large slightly protuberant his skin is clean of hair by reason both of the racial tendency toward hairlessness and the depilation which every baby undergoes upon birth dr jones clothes are vastly fanciful he wears a body mantle of green film and a dozen varicolored disks which spin slowly around his body like an axis the symbolism of these disks with their various colors patterns and directions of spin are discussed in a chapter of my history of manso i will not be discursive here the disks serve also as gravity deflectors and are used commonly in personal flight dr jones made me a polite salute and seated himself upon an invisible cushion of antigravity he spoke in the contemporary speech which i could understand well enough but whose nasal trills gutturals sibilants and indescribable friccatives i could never articulate well henry revere how goes it he asked in my pidginspeech i made a noncommittal reply i understand said dr jones that once again you undertook to deprive us of your company i nodded as usual i failed i said dr jones smiled slightly the race had evolved away from laughter which as i understand originated in the cavemans bellow of relief at the successful clubbing of an adversary you are selfcentered dr jones told me you consider only your own pleasure my life is my own if i want to end it you do great wrong in stopping me dr jones shook his head but you are not your own property you are the ward of the race how much better if you accepted this fact i cant agree i told him it is necessary that you so adjust yourself he studied me ruminatively you are something over ninetysix thousand years old in my tenure at this house you have attempted suicide no less than a hundred times no method has been either too crude or too painstaking he paused to watch me but i said nothing he spoke no more than the truth and for this reason i was allowed no object sharp enough to cut long enough to strangle noxious enough to poison heavy enough to crusheven if i could have escaped surveillance long enough to use any deadly weapon i was ninetysix thousand two hundred and thirtytwo years old and life long ago had lost that freshness and anticipation which makes it enjoyable i found existence not so much unpleasant as a bore events repeated themselves with a deadening familiarity it was like watching a rather dull drama for the thousandth time the boredom becomes almost tangible and nothing seems more desirable than oblivion ninetysix thousand two hundred and two years ago as a student of biochemistry i had offered myself as a guinea pig for certain tests involving glands and connective tissue an incalculable error had distorted the experiment with my immortality as the perverse result to this day i appear not an hour older than my age at the time of the experiment when i was so terribly young needless to say i suffered tragedy as my parents my friends my wife and finally my children grew old and died while i remained a young man so it has been i have seen untold generations come and go faces flit before me like snowflakes as i sit here nations have risen and fallen empires extended collapsed forgotten heroes have lived and died seas drained deserts irrigated glaciers melted mountains leveled almost a hundred thousand years i have persisted for the most part effacing myself studying humanity my great work has been the history of man although i have lived unchanging across the years the race evolved men and women grew taller and more slender every century saw features more refined brains larger more flexible as a result i henry revere homo sapiens of the twentieth century today am a freakish survival somewhat more advanced than the neanderthal but essentially a precursor to the true man of today i am a living fossil a curio among curios a public ward a creature denied the option oclife or death this was what dr jones had come to explain to me as if i were a retarded child he was kindly but unusually emphatic presently he departed and i was left to myself in whatever privacy the scrutiny of half a dozen pairs of eyes allows it is harder to kill ones self than one might imagine i have considered the matter carefully examining every object within my control for lethal potentialities but my servants are preternaturally careful nothing in this house could so much as bruise me and when i leave the house as i am privileged to do gravity deflectors allow me no profit from high places and in this exquisitely organized civilization there are no dangerous vehicles or heavy machinery in which i could mangle myself in the final analysis i am flung upon my own resources i have an idea tonight i shall take a firm grasp on my head and try to break my neck dr jones came as always and inspected me with his usual reproach henry revere you trouble us all with your discontent why cant you reconcile yourself to life as you have always known it because i am bored i have experienced everything there is no more possibility of novelty or surprise i feel so sure of events that i could predict the future he was rather more serious than usual you are our guest you must realize that our only concern is to ensure your safety but i dont want safety quite the reverse dr jones ignored me you must make up your mind to cooperate otherwise he paused significantly we will be forced into a course of action that will detract from the dignity of us all nothing could detract any further from my dignity i replied bitterly i am hardly better than an animal in a zoo that is neither your fault nor ours we all must fulfill our existences to the optimum today your function is to serve as vinculum with the past he departed i was left to my thoughts the threats had been veiled but were all too clear i was to desist from further attempts upon my life or suffer additional restraint i went out on the terrace and stood looking across the ocean where the sun was setting into a bed of golden clouds i was beset by a dejection so vast that i felt stifled completely weary of a world to which i had become alien i was yet denied freedom to take my leave everywhere i looked were avenues to death the deep ocean the heights of the palisade the glitter of energy in the city death was a privilege a bounty a prize and it was denied to me i returned to my study and leafed through some old maps the house was silentas if i were alone i knew differently silent feet moved behind the walls which were transparent to the eyes above these feet but opaque to mine gauzy webs of artificial nerve tissue watched me from various parts of the room i had only to make a sudden gesture to bring an anaesthetic beam snapping at me i sighed slumped into my chair i saw with the utmost clarity that never could i kill myself by my own instrumentality must i then submit to an intolerable existence i sat looking bleakly at the nacreous wall behind which eyes noted my every act no i would never submit i must seek some means outside myself a force of destruction to strike without warning a lightning bolt an avalanche an earthquake such natural cataclysms however were completely beyond my power to ordain or even predict i considered radioactivity if by some pretext i could expose myself to a sufficient number of roentgens i sat back in my chair suddenly excited in the early days atomic wastes were sometimes buried sometimes blended with concrete and dropped into the ocean if only i were able tobut no dr jones would hardly allow me to dig in the desert or dive in the ocean even if the radioactivity were not yet vitiated some other disaster must be found in which i could serve the role of a casualty if for instance i had foreknowledge of some great meteor and where it would strike the idea awoke an almost forgotten association i sat up in my chair then conscious that knowledgeable minds speculated upon my every expression i once again slumped forlornly behind the passive mask of my face my mind was racing recalling ancient events the time was too far past the circumstances obscured but details could be found in my great history of man i must by all means avoid suspicion i yawned feigned acute ennui then with an air of surly petulance i secured the box of numbered rods which was my index i dropped one of them into the viewer focused on the moleculewide items of information someone might be observing me i rambled here and there consulting articles and essays totally unrelated to my idea the origin and greatest development of the dithyramb the kalmuk tyrants new camelot ad oestheotics the caves of phrygia the exploration of mars the launching of the satellites i undertook no more than a glance at this last it would not be wise to show any more than a flicker of interest but what i read corroborated the inkling which had tickled the back of my mind the date was during the twentieth century during what would have been my normal lifetime the article read in part today hesperus last of the unmanned satellites was launched into orbit around earth this great machine will swing above the equator at a height of a thousand miles where atmospheric resistance is so scant as to be negligible not quite negligible of course it is estimated that in something less than a hundred thousand years hesperus will lose enough momentum to return to earth let us hope that no citizen of that future age suffers injury when hesperus falls i grunted and muttered a fatuous sentiment let us hope that one person at the very least suffers injury injury enough to erase him from life i continued to glance through the monumental work which had occupied so much of my time i listened to aquaclave music from the old polypacific empire read a few pages from the revolt of the manitobans then yawning and simulating hunger i called for my evening meal tomorrow i must locate more exact information and brush up on orbital mathematics the hesperus will drop into the pacific ocean at latitude x longitude at hours minutes seconds after standard noon on january of next year it will strike with a velocity of approximately one thousand miles an hour and i hope to be on hand to absorb a certain percentage of its inertia i have been occupied seven months establishing these figures considering the necessary precautions the dissimulation the delicacy of the calculations seven months is a short time to accomplish as much as i have i see no reason why my calculations should not be accurate the basic data were recorded to the necessary refinement and there have been no variables or fluctuations to cause error i have considered light pressure hysteresis meteoric dust i have reckoned the calendar reforms which have occurred over the years i have allowed for any possible einsteinian gambade or bolbinski perturbation what is there left to disturb the hesperus its orbit lies in the equatorial plane south of spaceship channels to all intents and purposes it has been forgotten the last mention of the hesperus occurs about eleven thousand years after it was launched i find a note to the effect that its orbital position and velocity were in exact accordance with theoretical values i believe i can be certain that the hesperus will fall on schedule the most cheerful aspect to the entire affair is that no one is aware of the impending disaster but myself the date is january to every side long blue swells are rolling rippled with catspaws above are blue skies and dazzling white clouds the yacht slides quietly southwest in the general direction of the marquesas islands dr jones had no enthusiasm for this cruise at first he tried to dissuade me from what he considered a whim but i insisted reminding him that i was theoretically a free man and he made no further difficulty the yacht is graceful swift and seems as fragile as a moth but when we cut through the long swells there is no shudder or vibrationonly a gentle elastic heave if i had hoped to lose myself overboard i would have suffered disappointment i am shepherded as carefully as in my own house but for the first time in many years i am relaxed and happy dr jones notices and approves the weather is beautifulthe water so blue the sun so bright the air so fresh that i almost feel a qualm at leaving this life still now is my chance and i must seize it i regret that dr jones and the crew must die with me stillwhat do they lose very little a few short years this is the risk they assume when they guard me if i could allow them survival i would do sobut there is no such possibility i have requested and have been granted nominal command of the yacht that is to say i plot the course i set the speed dr jones looks on with indulgent amusement pleased that i interest myself in matters outside myself january tomorrow is my last day of life we passed through a series of rain squalls this morning but the horizon ahead is clear i expect good weather tomorrow i have throttled down to deadslow as we are only a few hundred miles from our destination january i am tense active charged with vitality an awareness every part of me tingles on this day of my death it is good to be alive and why because of anticipation eagerness hope i am trying to mask my euphoria dr jones is extreme sensitive i would not care to start his mind working at this late date the time is noon i keep my appointment with hesperus in two hours and twentytwo minutes the yacht is coasting easily over the water our position as recorded by a pinpoint of light on the chart is only a few miles from our final position at this present rate we will arrive in about two hours and fifteen minutes then i will halt the yacht and wait the yacht is motionless on the ocean our position is exactly at latitude x longitude the degree of error represents no more than a yard or two this graceful yacht with the unpronounceable name sits directly on the bulls eye there is only five minutes to wait dr jones comes into the cabin he inspects me curiously you seem very keyed up henry revere yes i feel keyed up stimulated this cruise is affording me much pleasure excellent he walks to the chart glances at it why are we halted i took it into my mind to drift quietly are you impatient time passesminutes seconds i watch the chronometer dr jones follows my glance he frowns in sudden recollection goes to the telescreen excuse me something i would like to watch you might be interested the screen depicts an arid waste the kalahari desert dr jones tells me watch i glance at the chronometer ten secondsthey tick off fivefourthreetwoone a great whistling sound a roar a crash an explosion it comes from the telescreen the yacht rides on a calm sea there went hesperus said dr jones right on schedule he looks at me where i have sagged against a bulkhead his eyes narrow he looks at the chronometer at the chart at the telescreen back to me ah i understand you now all of us you would have killed yes i mutter all of us aha you savage i pay him no heed where could i have miscalculated i considered everything loss of entropic mass lunar attractionsi know the orbit of hesperus as i know my hand how did it shift and so far i dr jones eyes shine with a baleful light you know the orbit of hesperus then yes i considered every aspect and you believe it shifted it must have it was launched into an equatorial orbit it falls into the kalahari there are two bodies to be considered two hesperus and earth earth is constant unchangeable i say this last word slowly as the terrible knowledge comes and dr jones for the first time in my memory laughs an unpleasant harsh sound constantunchangeable except for libration of the poles hesperus is the constant earth shifts below yes what a fool i am an insensate murdering fool i see you cannot be trusted i charge him i strike him once in the face before the anaesthetic beam hits me the worldthinker through the open window came sounds of the citythe swish of passing air traffic the clank of the pedestrian belt on the ramp below hoarse undertones from the lower levels cardale sat by the window studying a sheet of paper which displayed a photograph and a few lines of type fugitive isabel mayage height feet inches medium physique hair black eyes blue distinguishing characteristics none cardale shifted his eyes to the photograph and studied the pretty face with incongruously angry eyes a placard across her chest read e cardale returned to the printed words sentenced to serve three years at the nevada womens camp in the first six months of incarceration isabel may accumulated months additional punitive confinement caution is urged in her apprehension the face cardale reflected was defiant reckless outraged but neither coarse nor stupida face in fact illuminated by intelligence and sensitivity not the face of a criminal thought cardale he pressed a button the telescreen plumbed into sharp life lunar observatory said cardale the screen twitched to a view across an austere office with moonscape outside the window a man in a rosepink smock looked into the screen hello cardale whats the word on may weve got a line on her quite a nuisance which you wont want to hear about one matter please in the future keep freighters in another sector when you want a fugitive tracked we had six red herrings to cope with but you picked up may definitely keep her in your sights ill send someone out to take over cardale clicked off the screen he ruminated a moment then summoned the image of his secretary get me detering at central intelligence the polychrome whirl of color rose and fell to reveal deterings ruddy face cardale if its service you want i want a mixed squad men and women in a fast ship to pick up a fugitive her name is isabel may shes fractious unruly incorrigiblebut i dont want her hurt allow me to continue what i started to say cardale if you want service you are out of luck theres literally no one in the office but me then come yourself to pick up a reckless woman and get my hair pulled and my face slapped no thanks one moment theres a man waiting outside my office on a disciplinary charge i can either have him courtmartialed or i can send him over to you whats his offense insubordination arrogance disregard of orders hes a loner he does as he pleases and to hell with the rule book what about results he gets resultsof a sort his own kind of results he may be the man to bring back isabel may whats his name lanarck he wont use his rank which is captain he seems something of a free spirit well send him over lanarck arrived almost immediately the secretary ushered him into cardales office sit down please my name is cardale youre lanarck right quite right cardale inspected his visitor with open curiosity lanarcks reputation thought cardale was belied by his appearance he was neither tall nor heavy and carried himself unobtrusively his features deeply darkened by the hard waves of space were regular and dominated by a cold directness of the gray eyes and a bold jutting nose lanarcks voice was pleasant and soft major detering assigned me to you for orders sir he recommended you highly said cardale i have a ticklish job on hand look at this he passed over the sheet with the photograph of isabel may lanarck scrutinized it without comment and handed it back this girl was imprisoned six months ago for assault with a deadly weapon she escaped the day before yesterday into spacewhich is more or less trivial in itself but she carries with her a quantity of important information which must be retrieved for the economic wellbeing of earth this may seem to you an extravagant statement but accept it from me as a fact lanarck said in a patient voice mr cardale i find that i work most efficiently when i am equipped with facts give me details of the case if you feel that the matter is too sensitive for my handling i will retire and you may bring in operatives better qualified cardale said crossly the girls father is a highlevel mathematician at work for the exchequer by his instruction an elaborate method of security to regulate transfer of funds was evolved as an emergency precaution he devised an override system consisting of several words in a specific sequence a criminal could go to the telephone call the exchequer use these words and direct by voice alone the transfer of a billion dollars to his personal account or a hundred billion why not cancel the override and install another because of arthur mays devilish subtlety the override is hidden in the computer it is buried totally inaccessible that it might be protected from someone ordering the computer to revealuate the override the only way the override can be voided is to use the override first and issue appropriate orders go on arthur may knew the override he agreed to transfer the knowledge to the chancellor and then submit to a hypnotic process which would remove the knowledge from his brain now occurred a rather sordid matter in regard to mays remuneration and in my mind he was absolutely in the right i know the feeling said lanarck ive had my own troubles with the scoundrels the only good bursar is a dead bursar in any event there follows an incredible tale of wrangling proposals estimates schemes counterproposals counterschemes and conniving all of which caused arthur may a mental breakdown and he forgot the override but he had anticipated something of the sort and he left a memorandum with his daughter isabel may when the authorities came for her father she refused to let them in she performed violent acts she was confined in a penal institution from which she escaped regardless of rights and wrongs she must be captured more or less gently and brought backwith the override you will surely understand the implications of the situation it is a complicated business said lanarck but i will go after the girl and with luck i will bring her back six hours later lanarck arrived at lunar observatory the iniris expanded the boat lurched through inside the dome lanarck undamped the port and stepped out the master astronomer approached behind came the mechanics one of whom bore an instrument which they welded to the hull of lanarcks spaceboat its a detector cell the astronomer explained right now its holding a line on the ship youre to follow when the indicator holds to the neutral zone youre on her track and where does this ship seem to be headed the astronomer shrugged nowhere in tellurian space shes way past fomalhaut and lining straight out lanarck stood silent this was hostile space isabel may was entering in another day or so she would be slicing the fringe of the clantlalan system where the space patrol of that dark and inimical empire without warning destroyed all approaching vessels furthar it opened on a region of black stars inhabited by nondescript peoples little better than pirates still farther beyond lay unexplored and consequently dangerous regions the mechanics were finished lanarck climbed back into the boat the outiris opened he drove his craft through down the runway and off into space a slow week followed in which distance was annihilated earth empire fell far astern a small cluster of stars to one side the clantlalan system grew ever brighter and as lanarck passed by the clantlalan spacespheres tried to close with him he threw in the emergency bank of generators and whisked the warboat far ahead someday lanarck knew he would slip down past the guard ships to the home planet by the twin red suns to discover what secret was held so dear but now he kept the detector centered in the dial and day by day the incoming signals from his quarry grew stronger they passed through the outlawridden belt of dark stars and into a region of space unknown but for tales let slip by drunken clantlalan renegadesreports of planets covered with mighty ruins legends of an asteroid littered with a thousand wrecked spaceships other tales were even more incredible a dragon who tore spaceships open in its jaws purportedly wandered through this region and it was said that alone on a desolate planet a godlike being created worlds at his pleasure the signals in the detector cell presently grew so strong that lanarck slackened speed for fear that overshooting his quarry the cell would lose its thread of radiation now isabel may began to swing out toward the starsystems which drifted past like fireflies as if she sought a landmark always the signals in the detector cell grew stronger a yellow star waxed bright ahead lanarck knew that the ship of isabel may was close at hand into that yellow stars system he followed her and lined out the trail toward the single planet presently as the planet globed out before him the signals ceased entirely the high clear atmosphere braked the motion of lanarcks spaceboat he found below a dun sunbaked landscape through the telescope the surface appeared to be uniformly stony and flat clouds of dust indicated the presence of high winds he had no trouble finding isabel mays ship in the field of his telescope lay a cubical white building the only landmark visible from horizon to horizon beside the building sat isabel mays silver spaceboat lanarck swooped to a landing half expecting a bolt from her needlebeam the port of the spaceboat hung open but she did not show herself as he came down on his crashkeel close by the air he found was breathable buckling on his needlebeam he stepped out on the stony ground the hot gale tore at him buffeting his face whipping tears from his eyes windflung pebbles bounding along the ground stung his legs light from the sun burned his shoulders lanarck inspected the terrain to discover no sign of life either from the white building or from isabel mays spaceboat the ground stretched away bare and sundrenched far into the dusty distances lanarck looked to the lonely white structure she must be within here was the end of the chase which had brought him across the galaxy lanarck circled the building on the leeward side he found a low dark archway from within came the heavy smell of life an odor half animal half reptile he approached the entrance with his needlebeam ready he called out isabel may he listened the wind whistled by the corner of the building little stones clicked past blowing down the endless sundazzled waste there was no other sound a sonorous voice entered his brain the one you seek is gone lanarck stood stockstill you may come within earthman we are not enemies the archway loomed dark before him step by step he entered after the glare of the white sun the dimness of the room was like a moonless night lanarck blinked slowly objects about him assumed form two enormous eyes peered through the gloom behind appeared a tremendous domelike bulk thought surged into lanarcks brain you are unnecessarily truculent here will be no occasion for violence lanarck relaxed feeling slightly at a loss telepathy was not often practiced upon earth the creatures messages came like a paradoxically silent voice but he had no knowledge how to transmit his own messages he hazarded the experiment where is isabel may in a place inaccessible to you how did she go her spaceboat is outside and she landed but a halfhour ago i sent her away keeping his needlebeam ready lanarck searched the building the girl was nowhere to be found seized by a sudden fearful thought he ran to the entrance and looked out the two spaceboats were as he had left them he shoved the needlebeam back into the holster and turned to the leviathan in whom he sensed benign amusement well thenwho are you and where is isabel may i am laoome came the reply laoome the onetime third of narfilhet laoome the worldthinker the final sage of the fifth universe as for the girl i have placed her at her own request upon a pleasant but inaccessible world of my own creation lanarck stood perplexed look laoome said space quivered in front of lanarcks eyes a dark aperture appeared in midair looking through lanarck saw hanging apparently but a yard before his eyes a lambent spherea miniature world as he watched it expanded like a toy balloon its horizons vanished past the confines of the opening continents and oceans assumed shape flecked with cloudwisps polar ice caps glinted bluewhite in the light of an unseen sun yet all the time the world seemed to be but a yard distant a plain appeared rimmed by black flinty mountains the color of the plain a ruddy ocher he saw presently was due to a forest carpet of rustcolored foliage the expansion ceased the worldthinker spoke that which you see before you is matter as real and tangible as yourself i have indeed created it through my mind until i dissolve it in the same manner it exists reach out and touch it lanarck did so it was actually only a yard from his face and the red forest crushed like dry moss under his fingertips you destroyed a village commented laoome and caused the world to expand once more at a breathtaking rate until the perspectives were as if lanarck hung a hundred feet above the surface he was looking into the devastation which his touch had wrought a moment before the trees far larger than he had supposed with boles thirty or forty feet through lay tossed and shattered visible were the ruins of rude huts from which issued calls and screams of pain thinly audible to lanarck bodies of men and women lay crushed others tore frantically at the wreckage lanarck stared in disbelief theres life men without life a world is uninteresting a lump of rock men like yourself i often use they have a large capacity for emotion and initiative a flexibility to the varied environments which i introduce lanarck gazed at the tips of his fingers then back to to the shattered village are they really alive certainly and you would find should you converse with one of them that they possess a sense of history a racial heritage of folklore and a culture welladapted to their environment but how can one brain conceive the detail of a world the leaves of each tree the features of each man that would be tedious laoome agreed my mind only broadly conceives introduces the determinate roots into the hypostatic equations detail then evolves automatically you allowed me to destroy hundreds of thesemen curious feelers searched his brain lanarck sensed laoomes amusement the idea is repugnant in a moment i shall dissolve the entire world still if it pleases you i can restore it as it was see immediately the forest was unmarred the village whole again secure and peaceful in a small clearing awareness came to lanarck of a curious rigidity in the rapport he had established with the worldthinker looking about he saw that the great eyes had glazed that the tremendous black body was twitching and jerking now laoomes dreamplanet was changing lanarck leaned forward in fascination the noble red trees had become gray rotten stalks and were swaying drunkenly others slumped and folded like columns of putty on the ground balls of black slime rolled about with vicious energy pursuing the villagers who in terror fled anywhere everywhere from the heavens came a rain of blazing pellets the villagers were killed but the black slimethings seemed only agonized blindly they lashed about burrowed furiously into the heaving ground to escape the impacts more suddenly than it had been created the world vanished lanarck tore his gaze from the spot where the world had been he looked about and found laoome as before dont be alarmed the thoughts came quietly the seizure is over it occurs only seldom and why it should be i do not know i imagine that my brain under the pressure of exact thought lapses into these reflexive spasms for the sake of relaxation this was a mild attack the world on which i am concentrating is usually totally destroyed the flow of soundless words stopped abruptly moments passed then thoughts gushed once more into lanarcks brain let me show you another planetone of the most interesting i have ever conceived for almost a million earth years it has been developing in my mind the space before lanarcks eyes quivered out in imaginary void hung another planet as before it expand until the features of the terrain assumed an earthly perspective hardly a mile in diameter the world was divided around the equator by a belt of sandy desert at one end glimmered a lake at the other grew a jungle of lush vegetation from this jungle now as lanarck watched crept a semihuman shape a travesty upon man its face was long chinless and furtive with eyes beady and quick the legs were unnaturally long the shoulders and arms were undeveloped it slunk to the edge of the desert paused a moment looking carefully in both directions then began a mad dash through the sand to the lake beyond halfway across a terrible roar was heard over the the horizon bounded a dragonlike monster with fearsome speed it pursued the fleeing manthing who outdistanced it and gainied the edge of the desert by two hundred feet when the dragon came to the limits of the sandy area it halted abd bellowed an eerie mournful note which sent shivers down lanarcks spine casually now the manthing loped to the lake threw himself flat and drank deeply an experiment in evolution came laoomes thought a million years ago those creatures were men like yourself this world is oddly designed at one end is food at the other drink in order to survive the men must cross the desert every day or so the dragon is prevented from leaving the desert by actinic boundaries hence if the men can cross the desert they are safe you have witnessed how admirably they have adapted to the environment the women are particularly fleet for they have adjusted to the handicap of caring for their young sooner or later of course age overtakes them and their speed gradually decreases until finally they are caught and devoured a curious religion and set of taboos have evolved here i am worshipped as the primary god of life and shillal as they call the dragon is the deity of death he of course is the basic concern of their lives and colors all their thoughts they are close to elementals these folk food drink and death are intertwined for them into almost one concept they can build no weapons of metal against shillal for their world is not endowed with the raw materials once a hundred thousand years ago one of the chiefs contrived a gigantic catapult to hurl a sharppointed tree trunk at shillal unluckily the fibers of the drawcord snapped and the chief was killed by the recoil the priests interpreted this as a sign and look there shillal catches a weary old woman sodden with water attempting to return to the jungle lanarck witnessed the beasts great gulping to continue laoome went on a taboo was created and no further weapons were ever built but why have you forced upon these folk a million years of wretched existence asked lanarck laoome gave an untranslatable mental shrug i am just and indeed benevolent he said these men worship me as a god upon a certain hillock which they hold sacred they bring their sick and wounded there if the whim takes me i restore them to health so far as their existence is concerned they relish the span of their lives as much as you do yours yet in creating these worlds you are responsible for the happiness of the inhabitants if you were truly benevolent why should you permit disease and terror to exist laoome again gave his mental shrug i might say that i use this universe of our own as a model perhaps there is another laoome dreaming out the worlds we ourselves live on when man dies of sickness bacteria live dragon lives by eating man when man eats plants and animals die lanarck was silent studiously preventing his thoughts from rising to the surface of his mind i take it that isabel may is upon neither of these planets that is correct i ask that you make it possible for me to communicate with her but i put her upon a world expressly to assure her safety from such molestation i believe that she would profit by hearing me very well said laoome in justice i should accord to you the same opportunity that i did her you may proceed to this world remember however the risk is your own exactly as it is for isabel may if you perish upon markawel you are as thoroughly dead as you might be upon earth i do not play destiny to influence either one of your lives there was a hiatus in laoomes thoughts a whirl of ideas too rapid for lanarck to grasp at last laoomes eyes focused upon him again an instant of faintness as lanarck felt knowledge forced into his brain as laoome silently regarded him it occurred to lanarack that laoomes body a great dome of black flesh was singularly illadapted to life on the planet where he dwelt you are right came the thoughts of laoome from beyond unknown to you i came banished from the dead planet narfilhet in whose fathomless black waters i swam this was long ago but even now i may not return laoome lapsed once more into introspection lanarck moved restlessly outside the wind tore past the building laoome continued silent dreaming perhaps of the dark oceans of ancient narfilhet lanafck impatiently launched a thought how do i reach markawel and how do i return laoome fetched himself back to the present his eyes settled upon a point beside lanarck the aperture which led into his various imaginary spaces was now wrenched open the third time a little distance off in the void a spaceboat drifted lanarcks eyes narrowed with sudden interest thats a gmy own ship he exclaimed no not yours one like it yours is still outside the craft drew nearer gradually floated within reach climb in said laoome at present isabel may is in the city which lies at the apex of the triangular continent but how do i get back aim your ship when you leave markawel at the brightest star visible you will then break through the mental dimensions into this universe lanarck reached his arm into the imaginary universe and pulled the imagined spaceboat close to the aperture he opened the port and gingerly stepped in as laoomes parting thoughts reached him should you fall into danger i can not modify the natural course of events on the other hand i will not intentionally place dangers in your way if such befall you it will be due solely to circumstance lanarck slammed shut the port half expecting the ship to dissolve under his feet but the ship was solid enough he looked back the gap into his own universe had disappeared leaving in its place a brilliant blue star he found himself in space below glimmered the disk of markawel much like other planets he had approached from the void he tugged at the throttle threw the nose hard over and down let the abstracts take care for themselves the boat dropped down at markawel it seemed a pleasant world a hot white sun hung off in space blue oceans covered a large part of the surface among the scattered land masses he found the triangular continent it was not large there were mountains with greenforested slopes and a central plateau a not unearthlike scene and lanarck did not feel the alien aura which surrounded most extraterrestrial planets sighting through his telescope lanarck found the city sprawling and white at the mouth of a wide river he sent his ship streaking down through the upper atmosphere then slowed and leveled off thirty miles to sea barely skimming the sparkling blue waves he flew toward the city a few miles to the left an island raised basalt cliffs against the ocean in his line of sight there heaved up on the crest of a swell a floating black object after an instant it disappeared into the trough a ramshackle raft upon it a girl with tawny golden hair desperately battled seathings which sought to climb aboard lanarck dropped the ship into the water beside the raft the wash threw the raft up and over and down on the girl lanarck slipped through the port and dived into clear green water he glimpsed only subhuman figures paddling downward barely discernible bobbing to the surface he swam to the raft ducked under grasped the girls limp form pulled her into the air for a moment he clung to the raft to catch his breath while holding the girls head clear of the water he sensed the return of the creatures from below dark forms rose in the shadow cast by the raft and a clammy longfingered hand wound around his ankle he kicked and felt his foot thud into something like a face more dark forms came up from the depths lanarck measured the distance to his spaceboat forty feet too far he crawled onto the raft and pulled the girl after him leaning far out he recovered the paddle and prepared to smash the first seathing to push above water but instead they swam in tireless circles twenty feet below the blade of the paddle had broken lanarck could not move the unwieldly bulk of the raft the breeze meanwhile was easing the spaceboat even farther away lanarck exerted himself another fifteen minutes pushing against the water with the splintered paddle but the gap increased he cast down the paddle in disgust and turned to the girl who sitting crosslegged regarded him thoughtfully for no apparent reason lanarck was reminded of laoome in the dimness of his white building on the windy world all this he thought looking from cleareyed girl to heaving sunlit sea to highlands of the continent ahead was an idea in laoomes brain he looked back at the girl her bright wheatcolored hair frothed around her head in ringlets producing thought lanarck a most pleasant effect she returned his gaze for a moment then with jaunty grace stood up she spoke to lanarck who found to his amazement that he understood her then remembering laoomes manipulation of his brain extracting ideas altering instilling new concepts he was not so amazed thank you for your help she said but now we are both in the same plight lanarck said nothing he knelt and began to remove his boots what will you do swim he answered the new language seemed altogether natural the bottompeople would pull you under before you went twenty feet she pointed into the water which teemed with circling dark shapes lanarck knew she spoke the truth you are of earth also she asked inspecting him carefully yes who are you and what do you know of earth i am jiro from the city yonder which is gahadion earfh is the home of isabel may who came in a ship such as yours isabel may arrived but an hour ago how could you know about her an hour replied the girl she has been here three months this last a little bitterly lanarck reflected that laoome controlled time in his universes as arbitrarily as he did space how did you come to be here on this raft she grimaced toward the island the priests came for me they live on the island and take people from the mainland they took me but last night i escaped lanarck looked from the island to the city on the mainland why do not gahadion authorities control the priests her lips rounded to an o they are sacred to the great god laoome and so inviolate lanarck wondered what unique evolutionary process laoome had in progress here few persons thus taken return to the mainland she went on those who win free and also escape the bottompeople usually live in the wilderness if they return to gahadion they are molested by fanatics and sometimes recaptured by the priests lanarck was silent after all it concerned him little how these people fared they were beings of fantasy inhabiting an imaginary planet and yet when he looked at jiro detachment became easier to contemplate than to achieve and isabel may is in gahadion tiros lips tightened no she lives on the island she is the thriceadept the high priestess lanarck was surprised why did they make her high priestess a month after she arrived the hierarch learning of the woman whose hair was the color of night even as yours tried to take her to drefteli the sacred isle as a slave she killed him with her weapon then when the lightnings of laoome did not consume her it was known that laoome approved and so she was made high priestess in place of the riven hierarch the philosophy so lanarck reflected would have sounded naive on earth where the gods were more covert in their supervision of human affairs is isabel may a friend of yoursor your lover asked jiro softly hardly then what do you want with her ive come to take her back to earth he looked dubiously across the everwidening gap between the raft and his spaceboat that at least was my intention you shall see her soon said jiro she pointed to a long black galley approaching from the island the ordained ones i am once more a slave not yet said lanarck feeling for the bulk of his needlebeam the galley thrust by the force of twenty long oars lunged toward them on the afterdeck stood a young woman her black hair blowing in the wind as her features became distinct lanarck recognized the face of cardales photograph now serene and confident isabel may looking from the silent two on the raft to the wallowing spaceboat a quartermile distant seemed to laugh the galley manned by tall goldenhaired men drew alongside so earth intelligence pays me a visit she spoke in english how you found me i cannot guess she looked curiously at lanarcks somber visage how i followed your trail and then explained the situation to laoome just what is the situation id like to work out some kind of compromise to please everyone i dont care whether i please anyone or not understandable the two studied each other isabel may suddenly asked what is your name lanarck just lanarck no rank no first name lanarck is enough just as you like i hardly know what to do with you im not vindictive and i dont want to handicap your career but ferrying you to your spaceboat would be rather quixotic im comfortable here and i havent the slightest intention of turning my property over to you lanarck reached for his needlebeam she watched him without emotion wet needlebeams dont work well this one is the exception lanarck blasted the figurehead from the galley isabel mays expression changed suddenly i see that im wrong how did you do it a personal device replied lanarck no i have to request that you take me to my spaceboat isabel may stared at him a moment and in those blue eyes lanarck detected something familiar where had he seen eyes with that expression on fan the pleasure planet in the magic groves of hycithil during the raids on the slave pens of starlen in earths own macropolis tran she turned and muttered to her boatswain a bronzed giant his golden hair bound back by a copper band he bowed and moved away very well said isabel may come aboard jiro and lanarck clambered over the carven gunwale the galley swept ahead foaming up white in its wake isabel may turned her attention to jiro who sat looking disconsolately toward the island drefteli you make friends quickly isabel told lanarck shes very beautiful what are you planning for her shes one of your escaped slaves i dont have any plans this place belongs to laoome he makes all plans im interested only in getting you out if you dont want to come back to earth give me the document which you brought with you and stay here as long as you like sorry the document stays with me i dont carry it on my person so please dont try to search me that sounds quite definite said lanarck do you know whats in the document more or less its like a blank check on the wealth of the world thats a good description as i understand this sorry affair you became angry at the treatment accorded your father thats a very quiet understatement would money help soothe your anger i dont want money i want revenge i want to grind faces into the mud i want to kick people and make their lives miserable still dont dismiss money its nice to be rich you have your life ahead of you i dont imagine you want to spend it here inside laoomes head very true so name a figure i cant measure anger and grief in dollars why not a million ten million a hundred million stop there i cant count any higher thats your figure what good will money do me theyll take me back to nevada no ill give you my personal guarantee of this meaningless i know nothing about you youll learn during the trip back to earth isabel may said lanarck you are persuasive if the truth be known im homesick she turned away and stood looking over the ocean lanarck stood watching her she was undeniably attractive and he found it difficult to take his eyes from her but as he settled on the bench beside jiro he felt a surge of a different stronger feeling it irritated him and he tried to put it aside wallowing in the swells the spaceboat lay dead ahead the galley scudded through the water at a great rate and the oarsmen did not slacken speed as they approached lanarcks eyes narrowed he jumped upright shouting orders the galley unswerving plowed into the spaceboat grinding it under the metalshod keel water gushed in through the open port the spaceboat shuddered and sank a dark shadow plummeting into green depths too bad remarked isabel on the other hand this puts us more on an equal footing you have a needlebeam i have a spaceboat lanarck silently seated himself after a moment he spoke where is your own needlebeam i blew it up trying to recharge it from the spaceboat generators and where is your spaceboat isabel laughed at this do you expect me to tell you why not i wouldnt maroon you here nevertheless i dont think ill tell you lanarck turned to jiro where is isabel mays space boat isabel spoke in a haughty voice as high priestess to a mighty laoome i command you to be silent jiro looked from one to the other she made up her mind it is on the plaza of the malachite temple in gahadion isabel was silent laoome plays tricks she said at las jiro has taken a fancy to you youre obviously interested in her laoome will not interfere said lanarck she laughed bitterly thats what he told meand look im high priestess he also told me he wouldnt let anyone come to markawel from the outside to molest me but you are here my intention is not to molest you said lanarck curtly we can as easily be friends as enemies i dont care to be a friend of yours and as an enemy you are no serious problem now isabel called as the tall boatswain came near the boatswain whirled on lanarck lanarck twisted squirmed heaved and the goldenhaired boatswain sprawled back into the bilge where he lay dazed a soft hand brushed lanarcks thigh he looked around smoothing his lank black hair and found isabel may smiling into his face his needlebeam dangled from her fingers jiro arose from the bench before isabel could react jiro had pushed a hand into her face and with the other seized the needlebeam she pointed the weapon at isabel sit down said jiro weeping with rage isabel fell back upon the bench jiro her young face flushed and happy backed over to the thwart needlebeam leveled lanarck stood still i will take charge now said jiro youisabel tell your men to row toward gahadion sullenly isabel gave the order the long black galley turned its bow toward the city this may be sacrilege jiro observed to lanarck but then i was already in trouble for escaping from drefteli what do you plan in this new capacity of yours lanarck inquired moving closer first to try this weapon on whomever thinks he can take it away from me lanarck eased back secondlybut youll see soon enough whitetiered gahadion rapidly drew closer across the water isabel sulked on the bench lanarck had little choice but to let matters move on their own momentum he relaxed against a thwart watching jiro from the corner of his eye she stood erect behind the bench where isabel sat her clear eyes looking over the leaping sparkles of the ocean breeze whipped her hair behind and pressed the tunic against her slim body lanarck heaved a deep sad sigh this girl with the wheatcolored hair was unreal she would vanish into oblivion as soon as laoome lost interest in the world markawel she was less than a shadow less than a mirage less than a dream lanarck looked over at isabel the earth girl who glared at him with sullen eyes she was real enough they moved up the river and toward the white docks of gahadion lanarck rose to his feet he looked over the city surveyed the folk on the dock who were clad in white red and blue tunics then turned to jiro ill have to take the weapon now stand back or ill lanarck took the weapon from her limp grasp isabel watched in sour amusement a dull throbbing sound like the pulse of a tremendous heart came down from the heavens lanarck cocked his head listening he scanned the sky at the horizon appeared a strange cloud like a band of whitegleaming metal swelling in rhythm to the celestial throbbing it lengthened with miraculous speed until in all directions the horizon was encircled the throb became a vast booming the air itself seemed heavy ominous a terrible idea struck lanarck he turned and yelled to the awestruck oarsmen who were trailing their oars in the river quicklyget to the docks they jerked at their oars frantic yet the galley moved no faster the water of the river had become oily smooth almost syrupy the boat inched close to the dock lanarck was grimly aware of the terrified isabel on one side of him jiro on the other what is happening whispered isabel lanarck watched the sky the cloudband of bright metal quivered and split into another which wobbled bouncing just above i hope im wrong said lanarck but i suspect that laoome is going mad look at our shadows he turned to look at the sun which jerked like a dying insect vibrating through aimless arcs his worst fears were realized it cant be cried isabel what will happen nothing good the galley lurched against a pier lanarck helped isabel and jiro up to the dock then followed masses of tall goldenhaired people milled in panic along the avenue lead me to the spaceboat lanarck had to shout to make himself heard over the tumult of the city his mind froze at a shocking thought what would happen to jiro he pushed the thought down isabel pulled at him urgently come hurry taking jiros hand he ran off after isabel toward the blackporticoed temple at the far end of the avenue a constriction twisted the air down came a rain of warm red globules small crimson jellyfish which stung naked flesh like nettles the din from the city reached hysterical pitch the red plasms increased to become a cloud of pink slime now oozing ankledeep on the ground isabel tripped and fell headlong in the perilous mess she struggled until lanarck helped her to her feet they continued toward the temple lanarck supporting both girls and keeping an uneasy eye on the structures to either side the rain of red things ceased but the streets flowed with ooze the sky shifted colorbut what color it had no place in any spectrum the color only a mad god could conceive the red slime curdled and fell apart like quicksilver to jell in an instant to millions upon millions of bright blue manikins three inches high they ran hopped scuttled the streets were a quaking blue carpet of blankfaced little homunculi they clung to lanarcks garments they ran up his legs like mice he trod them under heedless of their squeals the sun jerking in small spasmodic motions slowed lost its glare became oblate it developed striations and as the stricken population of gahadion quieted in awe the sun changed to a segmented white slug as long as five suns as wide as one it writhed its head about and stared down through the strangecolored sky at markawel in a delirium the gahadionites careened along the wide avenues lanarck and the two girls almost were trod under as they fought past a cross street in a small square beside a marble fountain the three found refuge lanarck had reached a state of detachment a conviction that this experience was a nightmare a blue manthing pulled itself into his hair it was singing in a small clear baritone lanarck set it upon the ground his mind grew calmer this was no nightmare this was reality however the word could be interpreted haste the surge of people had passed the way was relatively open lets go he pulled at the two girls who had been watching the slug which hung across the sky as they started off there came the metamorphosis lanarck had been expecting and dreading the matter of gahadion and all markavvel altered into unnatural substances the buildings of white marble became putty slumped beneath their own weight the malachite temple an airy dome on green malachite pillars sagged and slid to a sodden lump lanarck urged the gasping girls to greater speed the gahadionites no longer ran there was no destination they stood staring up frozen in horror by the glittering slug in the sky a voice screamed laoome laoome other voices took up the cry laoome laoome if laoome heard he gave no sign lanarck kept an anxious eye on these folk dreading lest they also as dreamcreatures alter to shocking halfthings for should they change so would jiro why take her to the spaceboat she could not exist outside the mind of laoome but how could he let her go the face of markavvel was changing black pyramids sprouted through the ground and lengthening tremendously darted upward to become black spikes miles high lanarck saw the spaceboat still sound and whole a product of more durable mindstuff perhaps than markavvel itself tremendous processes were transpiring beneath his feet as if the core of the planet itself were degenerating another hundred yards to the spaceboat faster he panted to the girls all the while they ran he watched the folk of gahadion like a cold wind blowing on his brain he knew that the change had come he almost slowed his steps for despair the gahadionites themselves knew they staggered in unbelieving surprise regarding their hands feeling their faces too late unreasonably lanarck had hoped that once in space away from markavvel jiro might retain her identity but too late a blight had befallen the gahadionites they clawed their shriveling faces tottered and fell their shrunken legs unable to support them in anguish lanarck felt one of the hands he was holding become hard and wrinkled as her legs withered he felt her sag he paused and turned to look sadly upon what had been jiro the ground beneath his feet lurched around him twisted dying gahadionites above dropping through the weird sky came the slug black spikes towered tremendously over his head lanarck heeded none of these before him stood jiro a jiro gasping and reeling in exhaustion but a jiro sound and golden still dying on the marble pavement was the shriveled dreamthing he had known as isabel may taking lires hand he turned and made for the spaceboat hauling back the port he pushed jiro inside even as he touched the hull he realized that the spaceboat was changing also the cold metal had acquired a palpitant life of its own lanarck slammed shut the port and heedless of fracturing cold thrusttubes gushed power astern off careened the spaceboat dodging through the forest of glittering black spines now hundreds of miles tall swerving a thousand miles to escape the great slug falling inexorably to the surface of markavvel as the ship darted free into space lanarck looked back to see the slug sprawled across half a hemisphere it writhed impaled on the tall black spikes lanarck drove the spaceboat at full speed toward the landmark star blue and luminous it shone the only steadfast object in the heavens all else poured in turbulent streams through black space motes eddying in a pool of ink lanarck looked briefly toward jiro and spoke just when i decided that nothing else could surprise me isabel may died while you jiro the gahadionite are alive i am isabel may you knew already i knew yes because it was the only possibility he put his hand against the hull the impersonal metallic feel had altered to a warm vitality now if we escape from this mess itll be a miracle changes came quickly the controls atrophied the ports grew dull and opaque like cartilage engines and fittings became voluted organs the walls were pink moist flesh pulsing regularly from outside came a sound like the snapping of pinions about their feet swirled dark liquid lanarck pale shook his head isabel pressed close to him were in the stomach ofsomething isabel made no answer a sound like a cork popped from a bottle a gush of gray light lanarck had guided the spaceboat aright it had continued into the sane universe and its own destruction the two earth creatures found themselves stumbling on the floor of laoomes dwelling at first they could not comprehend their deliverance safety seemed but another shifting of scenes lanarck regained his equilibrium he helped isabel to feet together they surveyed laoome who was still in midst of his spasm rippling tremors ran along his hide the saucer eyes were blank and glazed lets go whispered isabel lanarck silently took her arm they stepped out on the glaring windwhipped plain there stood the two spaceboats just as before lanarck guided isabel to his craft opened the port and motioned her inside im going back for one moment lanarck locked the powerarm just to guard against any new surprises isabel said nothing walking around to the spaceboat in which isabel may had arrived lanarck similarly locked the mechanism then he crossed to the white concrete structure isabel listened but the moaning of the wind drowned all other sounds the chatter of a needlebeam she could not be sure lanarck emerged from the building he climbed into boat and slammed the port they sat in silence as the thrust tubes warmed nor did they speak as he threw over the powerarm and the boat slanted off into the sky not until they were far off in space did either of themspeak lanarck looked toward isabel how did you know laoome through my father twenty years ago he did laoome some trifling favorkilled a lizard which had been annoyi laoome or something of the sort and thats why laoome shielded you from me by creating the dream isabel yes he told me you were coming down looking for me he arranged that you should meet a purported isabel may that i might assess you without your knowledge why dont you look more like the photograph i was furious id been crying i was practically gnashing my teeth i certainly hope i dont look like that how about your hair its bleached did the other isabel know your identity i dont think so no i know she didnt laoome equip her with my brain and all its memories she actually was i lanarck nodded here was the source of the inklings recognition he said thoughtfully she was very perceptive she said that you and i were well attracted to each other i wonder if she was right i wonder there will be time to consider the subject one last point the documents with the override isabel laughed cheerfully there arent any documents no documents none do you care to search me where are the documents document in the singular a slip of paper i tore it up what was on the paper the override im the only person alive who knows it dont you think i should keep the secret to myself lanarck reflected a moment id like to know that kind of knowledge is always useful where is the hundred million dollars you promised me its back on earth when we get there you can use the override isabel laughed youre a most practical man what happened to laoome laoome is dead how i destroyed him i thought of what we just went through his dreamcreatureswere they real they seemed real to me and to themselves is a person responsible for what happens during a nightmare i dont know i obeyed my instincts or conscience whatever its called and killed him isabel may took his hand my instincts tell me that i can trust you the override is a couplet tom tom the pipers son stole a pig and away he run lanarck reported to cardale i am happy to inform you that the affair is satisfactorily concluded cardale regarded him skeptically what do you mean by that the override is safe indeed safe where i thought it best to consult with you before carrying the override on my person that is perhaps overdiscreet what of isabel may is she in custody in order to get the override i had to make broad but reasonable concessions including a full pardon retraction of all charges against her and official apologies as well as retributive payments for false arrest and general damages she wants an official document certifying these concessions if you will prepare the document i will transmit it and the affair will be terminated cardale said in a cool voice who authorized you to make such farreaching concessions lanarck spoke indifferently do you want the override of course then do as i suggest youre even more arrogant than detering led me to expect the results speak for themselves sir how do i know that she wont use the override you can now call it up and change it so im given to understand how do i know that she hasnt used it already to the hilt i mentioned compensatory payments the adjustment has been made cardale ran his fingers through his hair how much damages the amount is of no great consequence if isabel may had chosen to make intemperate demands they would only partially balance the damage she has suffered so you say cardale could not decide whether to bluster to threaten or to throw his hands in the air at last he leaned back in his chair ill have the document ready tomorrow and you can bring in the override very well mr cardale id still like to know unofficially if you like just how much she took in settlement we requisitioned a hundred and one million seven hundred and sixtytwo dollars into a set of personal accounts cardale stared i thought you said that shed made an intemperate settlement it seemed as easy to ask for a large sum as a small no doubt even easier its a strange figure why seven hundred and sixtytwo dollars that sir is money owing to me for which the bursar refuses to issue a voucher it represents expenses in a previous case bribes liquor and the services of a prostitute if you want the details and why the million extra that represents a contingency fund for my own convenience so that i wont be harassed in the future in a quiet and modest sense it also reflects my annoyance with the bursar lanarck rose to his feet ill see you tomorrow at the same time sir until tomorrow lanarck green magic howard fair looking over the relics of his great uncle gerald mclntyre found a large ledger entitled workbook journal open at peril fair read the journal with interest although his own work went far beyond ideas treated only gingerly by gerald mclntyre the existence of disciplines concentric fo the elementary magics must now be admitted without further controversy wrote mclntyre guided by a set of analogies from the white and black magics i have delineated the basic extension of purple magic as well as its corollary dynamic nomism fair read on remarking the careful charts the projections and expansions the transportations and transformations by which gerald mclntyre had conceived his systemology so swiftly had the technical arts advanced that mclntyres expositions highly controversial sixty years before now seemed pedantic and overly rigorous whereas benign creatures angels white sprites merrihews sandestinsare typical of the white cycle whereas demons magners trolls and warlocks are evinced by black magic so do the purple and green cycles sponsor their own particulars but these are neither good nor evil bearing rather the same relation to the black and white provinces that these latter do to our own basic realm fair reread the passage the green cycle had gerald mclntyre wandered into regions overlooked by modern workers he reviewed the journal in the light of this suspicion and discovered additional hints and references especially provocative was a bit of scribbled marginalia more concerning my latest researches i may not state having been promised an infinite reward for this forbearance the passage was dated a day before gerald mclntyres death which had occurred on march the first day of spring mclntyre had enjoyed very little of his infinite reward whatever had been its nature fair returned to a consideration of the journal which in a sentence or two had opened a chink on an entire new panorama mclntyre provided no further illumination and fair set out to make a fuller investigation his first steps were routine he performed two divinations searched the standard indexes concordances handbooks and formularies evoked a demon whom he had previously found knowledgeable all without success he found no direct reference to cycles beyond the purple the demon refused even to speculate fair was by no means discouraged if anything the intensity of his interest increased he reread the journal with particular care to the justification for purple magic reasoning that mclntyre groping for a lore beyond the purple might well have used the methods which had yielded results before applying stains and ultraviolet light to the pages fair made legible a number of notes mclntyre had jotted down then erased fair was immensely stimulated the notes assured him that he was on the right track and further indicated a number of blind alleys which fair profited by avoiding he applied himself so successfully that before the week was out he had evoked a sprite of the green cycle it appeared in the semblance of a man with green glass eyes and a thatch of young eucalyptus leaves in the place of hair it greeted fair with cool courtesy would not seat itself and ignored fairs proffer of coffee after wandering around the apartment inspecting fairs books and curios with an air of negligent amusement it agreed to respond to fairs questions fair asked permission to use his taperecorder which the sprite allowed and fair set the apparatus in motion what realms of magic lie beyond the green asked fair i cant give you an exact answer replied the sprite because i dont know there are at least two more corresponding to the colors we call rawn and pallow and very likely others fair arranged the microphone where it would directly intercept the voice of the sprite what he asked is the green cycle like what is physical semblance the sprite paused to consider glistening motherofpearl films wandered across its face reflecting the tinge of its thoughts im rather severely restricted by your use of word physical and semblance involves a subjective interpretation which changes with the rise and fall of the seconds by all means fair said hastily describe it in your words wellwe have four different regions two of which floresce from the basic skeleton of the universe and subsede the others the first of these is compressed and ishthiated but is notable for its wide pools of mottle which we sometimes use for deranging stations weve transplated mosses from earths devonian and a few icefires from perdition they climb among the rods which we call devilhairhe went on for several minutes but the meaning almost entirely escaped fair and it seemed as if the question by which he had hoped to break the ice might run away with the the entire interview he introduced another idea can we freely manipulate the physical extensions earth the sprite seemed amused you refer so i assume to the various aspects of space tune mass energy thought and recollections exactly the sprite raised its green cornsilk eyebrows i might sensibly ask can you break an egg by striking it with a club the response is on a similar level of seriousness fair had expected a certain amount of condescension and impatience and was not abashed how may i learn that techniques in the usual manner through diligent study ah indeedbut where could i study who would teach me the sprite made an easy gesture and whorls of smoke trailed from his fingers to spin through the air i could arrange the matter but since i bear you no particular animosity ill do nothing of the sort and now i must gone where do you go fair asked in wonder and longing may i go with you the sprite swirling a drape of bright green dust over its shoulders shook his head you would be less than comfortable other men have explored the worlds of magic true your uncle gerald mclntyre for instance my uncle gerald learned green magic to the limit of his capabilities he found no pleasure in learning you would do well to profit by his experience and modify your ambitions the sprite turned and walked away fair watched it depart the sprite receded in space and direction but never reached the wall of fairs room at a distance which might have been fifty yards the sprite glanced back as if to make sure that fair was not following then stepped off at another angle and disappeared fairs first impulse was to take heed and limit his explorations he was an adept in white magic and had mastered the black art occasionally he evoked a demon to liven a social gathering which otherwise threatened to become dull but he had by no means illuminated every mystery of purple magic which is the realm of incarnate symbols howard fair might have turned away from the green cycle except for three factors first was his physical appearance he stood rather under medium height with a swarthy face sparse black hair a gnarled nose a small heavy mouth he felt no great sensitivity about his appearance but realized that it might be improved in his minds eye he pictured the personified ideal of himself he was taller by six inches his nose thin and keen his skin cleared of its muddy undertone a striking figure but still recognizable as howard fair he wanted the love of women but he wanted it without the interposition of his craft many times he had brought beautiful girls to his bed lips wet and eyes shining but purple magic had seduced them rather than howard fair and he took limited satisfaction in such conquests here was the first factor which drew howard fan back to the green lore the second was his yearning for extended perhaps eternal life the third was simple thirst for knowledge the fact of gerald mclntyres death or dissolution or disappearancewhatever had happened to himwas naturally a matter of concern if he had won to a goal so precious why had he died so quickly was the infinite reward miraculous so exquisite that the mind failed under its session fair could not restrain himself and by degrees returned to a study of green magic rather than again invoke the sprite whose air of indulgent contempt he had found exasperating he decided to seek knowledge by an indirect method employing the most advanced concepts of technical and cabalistil science he obtained a portable television transmitter which he loaded into his panel truck along with a receiver on a monday night in early may he drove to an abandoned graveyard far out in the wooded hills and there by the laight of the wandering moon he buried the television camera in graveyard clay until only the television camera protruded from the soil with a sharp alder twig he scratched on the ground a monstrous outline the television lens served for one eye a beer bottle pushed neckfirst into the soil the other during the middle hours while the moon died behind wisps of pale cloud he carved a word on the dark forehead then recited the activating incantation the ground rumbled and moaned the golem heaved up to blot out the stars the glass eyes stared down at fair secure in his pentagon speak called out fair enteresthes akmai adonai bidemigir elohim pa rahulli enteresthes hvoi speak return me to earth return my clay to the quiet clay from whence you roused me first you must serve the golem stumbled forward to crush fair but was halted by the pang of protective magic serve you i will if serve you i must fair stepped boldly forth from the pentagon strung forty yards of green ribbon down the road in the shape of a narrow v go forth into the realm of green magic he told the monster the ribbons reach forty miles walk to the end turn about return and then fall back return to the earth from which you rose the golem turned shuffled into the v of green ribbon shaking off clods of mold jarring the ground with its ponderous tread fair watched the squat shape dwindle recede yet never reach the angle of the magic v he returned to his panel truck tuned the receiver to the golems eye and surveyed the fantastic vistas of the green realm two elementals of the green realm met on a silver spun landscape they were jaadian and misthemar and they fell to discussing the earthen monster which had stalked forty miles through the region known as cil which then turning in its tracks had retraced its steps gradually increasing its pace until at the end it moved in a shambling rush leaving a trail of clods on the fragile mothwing mosaics events events events misthemar fretted they crowd the chute of time till the bounds bulge or then again the course is as lean and spare as a stretched tendon but in regard to this incursion he paused for a period of reflection and silver clouds moved over his head and under his feet jaadian remarked you are aware that i conversed with howard fair he is so obsessed to escape the squalor of his world that he acts with recklessness the man gerald mclntyre was his uncle mused misthemar mclntyre besought we yielded as perhaps now we must yield to howard fair jaadian uneasily opened his hand shook off a spray of emerald fire events press both in and out i find myself unable to act in this regard i likewise do not care to be the agent of tragedy a meaning came fluttering up from below a disturbance among the spiral towers a caterpillar of glass and metal has come clanking it has thrust electric eyes into the portinone and broke open the egg of innocence howard fair is the fault jaadian and misthemar consulted each other with wry disinclination very well both of us will go such a duty needs two souls in support they impinged upon earth and found howard fair in a wall booth at a cocktail bar he looked up at the two strangers and one of them asked may we join you fair examined the two men both wore conservative suits rand carried cashmere topcoats over their arms fair noticed that the left thumbnail of each man glistened green fair rose politely to his feet will you sit down the green sprites hung up their overcoats and slid into the booth fair looked from one to the other he addressed jaadian arent you he whom i interviewed several weeks ago jaadian assented you have not accepted my advice fair shrugged you asked me to remain ignorant to accept my stupidity and ineptitude and why should you not asked jaadian gently you are a primitive in a primitive realm nevertheless not one man in a thousand can match your achievements fair agreed smiling faintly but knowledge creates a craving for further knowledge where is the harm in knowledge mithemar the more mercurial of the sprites spoke angrily where is the harm consider your earthen monster it befouled forty miles of delicacy the record of ten million years consider your caterpillar it trampled our pillars of carved milk our dreaming towers damaged the nerveskeins which extrude and waft us our meanings im dreadfully sorry said fair i meant no destruction the sprites nodded but your apology conveys no guarantee of restraint fair toyed with his glass a waiter approached the table addressed the two sprites something for you two gentlemen jaadian ordered a glass of charged water as did misthemar fair called for another highball what do you hope to gain from this activity inquired misthemar destructive forays teach you nothing fair agreed i have learned little but i have seen miraculous sights i am more than ever anxious to learn the green sprites glumly watched the bubbles rising in their glasses jaadian at last drew a deep sigh perhaps we can obviate toil on your part and disturbance on ours explicitly what gains or advantages do you hope to derive from green magic fair smiling leaned back into the red imitationleather cushions i want many things extended lifemobility in timecomprehensive memoryaugmented perception with vision across the whole spectrum i want physical charm and magnetism the semblance of youth muscular endurance then there are qualities more or less speculative such as jaadian interrupted these qualities and characteristics we will confer upon you in return you will undertake never again to disturb the green realm you will evade centuries of toil we will be spared the nuisance of your presence and the inevitable tragedy tragedy inquired fair in wonder why tragedy jaadian spoke in a deep reverberating voice you are a man of earth your goals are not our goals green magic makes you aware of our goals fair thoughtfully sipped his highball i cant see that this is a disadvantage i am willing to submit to the discipline of instruction surely a knowledge of green magic will not change me into a different entity no and this is the basic tragedy misthemar spoke in exasperation we are forbidden to harm lesser creatures and so you are fortunate for to dissolve you into air would end all the annoyance fair laughed i apologize again for making such a nuisance of myself but surely you understand how important this is to me jaadian asked hopefully then you agree to our offer fair shook his head how could i live forever young capable of extended learning but limited to knowledge which i already see bounds to i would be bored restless miserable that well may be said jaadian but not so bored restless and miserable as if you were learned in green magic fair drew himself erect i must learn green magic it is an opportunity which only a person both torpid and stupid could refuse jaadian sighed in your place i would make the same response the sprites rose to their feet come then we will teach you dont say we didnt warn you said misthemar time passed sunset waned and twilight darkened a man walked up the stairs entered howard fairs apartment he was tall unobtrusively muscular his face was sensitive keen humorous his left thumbnail glistened green time is a function of vital processes the people of earth had perceived the motion of their clocks on this understanding two hours had elapsed since howard fair had followed the green sprites from the bar howard fair had perceived other criteria for him the interval had been seven hundred years during which he had lived in the green realm learning to the utmost capacity of his brain he had occupied two years training his senses to the new conditions gradually he learned to walk in the six basic threedimensional directions and accustomed himself to the fourthdimensional shortcuts by easy stages the blinds over his eyes were removed so that the dazzling overhuman intricacy of the landscape never completely confounded him another year was spent training him to the use of a code languagean intermediate step between the vocalizations of earth and the meaning patterns of the green realm where a hundred symbolflakes might be displayed in a single swirl of import during this time howard fairs eyes and brain were altered to allow him the use of the many new colors without which the meaningflakes could not be recognized these were preliminary steps for forty years he studied the flakes of which there were almost a million another forty years was given to elementary permutations and shifts and another forty to parallels attenuation diminishments and extensions and during this time he was introduced to flake patterns and certain of the more obvious displays now he was able to study without recourse to the code language and his progress becasme more marked another twenty years found him able to recognize more complicated meanings and he was introduced to a more varied program he floated over the field of mothwing mosaics which still showed the footprints of the golem he sweated in embarrassment the extent of his wicked willfulness now clear to him so passed the years howard fair learned as much green magic as his brain could encompass he explored much of the green realm finding so much beauty that he feared his brain might burst he tasted he heard he felt he sensed and each one of his senses was a hundred times more discriminating than before nourishment came in a thousand different forms from pink eggs which burst into a hot sweet gas suffusing his entire body from passing through a rain of stinging metal crystals from simple contemplation of the proper symbol homesickness for earth waxed and waned sometimes it was insupportable and he was ready to forsake all he had learned and abandon his hopes for the future at other times the magnificence of the green realm permeated him and the thought of departure seemed like the threat of death itself by stages so gradual he never realized them he learned green magic but the new faculty gave him no pride between his crude ineptitudes and the poetic elegance of the sprites remained a tremendous gapand he felt his innate inferiority much more keenly than he ever had in his old state worse his most earnest efforts failed to improve his technique and sometimes observing the singing joy of an improvised manifestation by one of the sprites and contrasting it to his own labored constructions he felt futility and shame the longer he remained in the green realm the stronger grew the sense of his own maladroitness and he began to long for the easy environment of earth where each of his acts would not shout aloud of vulgarity and crassness at times he would watch the sprites at play among the pearlpetals or twining like quick flashes of music through the forest of pink spirals the contrast between their verve and his brutish fumbling could not be borne and he would turn away his selfrespect dwindled with each passing hour and instead of pride in his learning he felt a sullen ache for what he was not and could never become the first few hundred years he worked with the enthusiasm of ignorance for the next few he was buoyed by hope during the last part of his time only dogged obstinacy kept him plodding through what now he knew for infantile exercises in one terrible bittersweet spasm he gave up he found jaadian weaving tinkling fragments of various magics into a warp of shining long splines with grave courtesy jaadian gave fair his attention and fair laboriously set forth his meaning jaadian returned a message i recognize your discomfort and extend my sympathy it is best that you now return to your native home he put aside his weaving and conveyed fair down through the requisite vortices along the way they passed misthemar no nicker of meaning was expressed or exchanged but howard fair thought to feel a tinge of faintly malicious amusement howard fair sat in his apartment his perceptions augmented and sharpened by his sojourn in the green realm took note of the surroundings only two hours before by the clocks of earth he had found them both restful and stimulating now they were neither his books superstition spuriousness earnest nonsense his private journals and workbooks a pathetic scrawl of infantilisms gravity tugged at his feet held him rigid the shoddy construction of the house which heretofore he never had noticed oppressed him everywhere he looked he saw slipshod disorder primitive filth the thought of the food he must now eat revolted him he went out on his little balcony which overlooked the street the air was impregnated with organic smells across the street he could look into windows where his fellow humans lived in stupid squalor fair smiled sadly he had tried to prepare himself for these reactions but now was surprised by their intensity he returned into his apartment he must accustom himself to the old environment and after all there were compensations the most desirable commodities of the world were now his to enjoy howard fair plunged into the enjoyment of these pleasures he forced himself to drink quantities of expensive wines brandies liqueurs even though they offended his palate hunger overcame his nausea he forced himself to the consumption of what he thought of as fried animal tissue the hypertrophied sexual organs of plants he experimented with erotic sensations but found that beautiful women no longer seemed different from the plain ones and that he could barely steel himself to the untidy contacts he bought libraries of erudite books glanced through them with contempt he tried to amuse himself with his old magics they seemed ridiculous he forced himself to enjoy these pleasures for a month then he fled the city and established a crystal bubble on a crag in the andes to nourish himself he contrived a thick liquid which while by no means as exhilarating as the substances of the green realm was innocent of organic contamination after a certain degree of improvisation and makeshift he arranged his life to its minimum discomfort the view was one of austere grandeur not even the condors came to disturb him he sat back to ponder the chain of events which had started with his discovery of gerald mclntyres workbook he frowned gerald mclntyre he jumped to his feet looked far over the crags he found gerald mclntyre at a wayside service station in the heart of the south dakota prairie mclntyre was sitting in an old wooden chair tilted back against the peeling yellow paint of the service station a straw hat shading his eyes from the sun he was a magnetically handsome man blond of hair brown of skin with blue eyes whose gaze stung like the touch of icicle his left thumbnail glistened green fair greeted him casually the two men surveyed each other with wry curiosity i see you have adapted yourself said howard fair mclntyre shrugged as well as possible i try to maintain a balance between solitude and the pressure of humanity he looked into the bright blue sky where crows flapped and called for many years i lived in isolation i began to detest the sound of my own breathing along the highway came a glittering automobile rococo as a hybrid goldfish with the perceptions now available to them fair and mclntyre could see the driver to be redfaced and truculent his companion a peevish woman in expensive clothes there are other advantages to residence here said mclntyre for instance i am able to enrich the lives of passersby with trifles of novel adventure he made a small gesture two dozen crows swooped down and flew beside the automobile they settled on the fenders strutted back and forth along the hood fouled the windshield the automobile squealed to a halt the driver jumped out put the birds to flight he threw an ineffectual rock waved his arms in outrage returned to his car proceeded a paltry affair said mclntyre with a sigh the truth of the matter is that i am bored he pursed his mouth and blew forth three bright puffs of smoke first red then yellow then blazing blue i have arrived at the estate of foolishness as you can see fair surveyed his greatuncle with a trace of uneasiness mclntyre laughed no more pranks i predict however that you will presently share my malaise i share it already said fair sometimes i wish i could abandon all my magic and return to my former innocence i have toyed with the idea mclntyre replied thoughtfully in fact i have made all the necessary arrangements it is really a simple matter he led fair to a small room behind the station although the door was open the interior showed a thick darkness mclntyre standing well back surveyed the darkness with a quizzical curl to his lip you need only enter all your magic all your recollections of the green realm will depart you will be no wiser than the next man you meet and with your knowledge will go your boredom your melancholy your dissatisfaction fair contemplated the dark doorway a single step would resolve his discomfort he glanced at mclntyre the two surveyed each other with sardonic amusement they returned to the front of the building sometimes i stand by the door and look into the darkness said mclntyre then i am reminded how dearly i cherish my boredom and what a precious commodity is so much misery fair made himself ready for departure i thank you for this new wisdom what a hundred more years in the green realm would not have taught me and nowfor a time at leasti go back to my crag in the andes mclntyre tilted his chair against the wall of the service station and ifor a time at leastwill wait for the next passerby goodbye then uncle gerald goodbye howard the ten books they were as alone as it is possible for living man to be in the black gulf between the stars far astern shone the suns of the home worldsahead the outer stars and galaxies in a fainter ghostly glimmer the cabin was quiet betty welstead sat watching her husband at the assay table her emotions tuned to his when the centrifuge scale indicated heavy metal and welstead leaned forward she leaned forward too in unconscious sympathy when he burnt scrapings in the spectroscope and read lead from the brightest pattern and chewed at his lips betty released her pentup breath fell back in her seat ralph welstead stood up a man of medium height rugged toughlookingwith hair and skin and eyes the same tawny color he brushed the whole clutter of rock and ore into the waste chute and betty followed him with her eyes welstead said sourly wed be millionaires if that asteroid had been inside the solar system out here unless its pure platinum or uranium its not worth mining betty broached a subject which for two months had been on the top of her mind perhaps we should start to swing back in welstead frowned stepped up into the observation dome betty watched after him anxiously she understood very well that the instinct of the explorer as much as the quest for minerals had brought them out so far welstead stepped back down into the cabin theres a star aheadhe put a finger into the threedimensional chart this one right here eridanus two thousand nine hundred and thirtytwo lets make a quick checkand then well head back in betty nodded suddenly happy suits me she jumped up and together they went to the screen he aimed the catchall vortex dialed the hurrying blur to stability and the star pulsed out like a whitehot coin a single planet made up the entourage looks about earthsize said welstead interest in his voice and bettys heart sank a trifle he tuned the circuit finer turned up the magnification and the planet leapt at them look at that atmosphere thick he swiveled across the jointed arm holding the thermocouple and together they bent over the dial nineteen degrees centigrade about earthnorm lets look at that atmosphere you know dear we might have something tremendous here earthsize earth temperature his voice fell off in a mutter as he peered through the spectroscope flipping screen after screen past the pattern from the planet he stood up cast betty a swift exultant glance then squinted in sudden reflection better make sure before we get too excited betty felt no excitement she watched without words as welstead thumbed through the catalogue whee yelled welstead suddenly a small boy no listing its ours and bettys heart melted at the news delay months of delay while welstead explored the planet charted its oceans and continents classified its life at the same time a spark of her husbands enthusiasm caught fire in her brain and interest began to edge aside her gloom well name it welstead he said or noelizabeth for you a planet of your own some day therell be cities and millions of people and every time they write a letter or throw a shovelful of dirt or a ship landstheyll use your name no dear she said dont be ridiculous well call it welsteadfor us both they felt an involuntary pang of disappointment later on when they found the planet already inhabited and by men yet their reception astonished them as much as the has discovery of the planet and its people curiosity even hostilily might have been expected they had been in no hurry to land preferring to fall in an orbit just above the atmosphere the better to study the planet and its inhabitants it looked to be a cheerful world there were a thousand kinds of forest jungle savannah sunny rivers coursed green fields a thousand lakes and three oceans glowed blue to the far north and far south snowfields glittered dazzled such cities as they foundthe world seemed sparsely settledmerged indistinguishably with the countryside they were wide low cities very different from the clanging hives of earth and lay under the greenery like carvings in alabaster or miraculous snowflakes betty in whose nature ran a strong streak of the romantic was entranced they look like cities of paradisecities in a dream welstead said reflectively theyre evidently not backward see that cluster of long gray buildings off to the side those are factories betty voiced a doubt which had been gradually forming into words do you think they mightresent our landing if theyve gone to the trouble of creating a secret well call it utopia they might not want to be discovered welstead turned his head gazed at her eye to eye do you want to land he asked soberly why yes if you do if you dont think its dangerous i dont know whether its dangerous or not a people as enlightened as those cities would seem to indicate would hardly maltreat strangers betty searched the face of the planet i think it would be safe welstead laughed im game weve got to die sometime why not out here he jumped up to the controls nosed the ship down well land right in their laps right in the middle of that big city down there betty looked at him questioningly no sense sneaking down out in the wilds said welstead if were landing well land with a flourish and if they shoot us for our insolence call it fate they bellied down into a park in the very center of the city from the observation dome welstead glimpsed hurrying knots of people go to the port betty open it just a crack and show yourself ill stay at the controls one false move one dead cat heaved at us and well be back in space so fast they wont remember we arrived thousands of men and women of all ages had surrounded the ship all shouting all agitated by strong emotion theyre throwing flowers betty gasped she opened the port and stood in the doorway and the people below shouted chanted wept feeling rather ridiculous betty waved smiled she turned to look back up at welstead i dont know what weve done to deserve all this but were heroes maybe they think were somebody else welstead craned his neck through the observation dome they look healthynormal theyre beautiful said betty all of them the throng opened a small group of elderly men and women approached the leader a whitehaired man tall lean with much the same face as michelangelos jehovah stood forth welcome he called resonantly welcome from the people of haven betty stared and welstead clambered down from the controls the words were strangely pronounced the grammar was archaicbut it was the language of earth the whitehaired man spoke on without calculation as if delivering a speech of great familiarity we have waited two hundred and seventyone years for your coming for the deliverance you will bring us deliverance welstead considered the word dont see much to deliver emn from he muttered aside to betty the suns shining they look wellfeda lot more enthusiastic than i do deliver em from what betty was climbing down to the ground and welstead followed thanks for the welcome said welstead trying not to sound like a visiting politician were glad to be here its a wonderful experience coming unexpectedly on a world like this the whitehaired man bowed gravely naturally you must be curiousas curious as we are about the civilized universe but for the present just one question for the ears of our world how goes it with earth welstead rubbed his chin acutely conscious of the thousands of eyes the utter silence earth he said goes about as usual theres the same seasons the same rain sunshine frost and wind and the people of haven breathed in his words as devoutly as if they were the purest poetry earth is still the center of the cluster and theres more people living on earth than ever before more noise more nuisance wars new governments how far does science reach welstead considered wars none to speak ofnot since the hieratic league broke up the government still governs uses lots of statistical machinery theres still graft robbery inefficiency if thats what you mean sciencethats a big subject we know a lot but we dont know a lot more the way its always been everything considered its the same earth its always beensome good a lot of bad he paused and the pent breath of the listeners went in a great sigh the whitehaired man nodded again serious soberthough evidently infected with the excitement that fixed his fellows no more for the present youll be tired and theres much time for talk may i offer you the hospitality of my house welstead looked uncertainly at betty instinct urged him not to leave his ship or if youd prefer to remain aboard suggested the man of haven no said welstead well be delighted if harm were intended as emphatically did not seem likely their presence aboard the ship would not prevent it he craned his neck looked here and there for the officialdom that would be bumptiously present on earth is there anyone we should report to any law well be breaking by parking our ship here the whitehaired man laughed what a question i am alexander clay mayor of this city mytilene and guide of haven by my authority and by common will you are free of anything the planet can offer you your ship will not be molested he led them to a wide low car and betty was uncomfortably conscious of her blue shorts rumpled and untidy by comparison with the manycolored tunics of the women in the crowd welstead was interested in the car as providing a gauge of havens technics built of shiny gray metal it hung a foot above the ground without the intervention of wheels he gave clay a startled look antigravity your fortunes made clay shook his head indulgently magnetic fields antipathetic to the metal in the road is it not a commonplace on earth no said welstead the theory of course is wellknown but there is too much opposition too many roads to dig up we still use wheels clay said reflectively the force of tradition the continuity which generates the culture of races the stream we have been so long lost from welstead shot him a sidelong glance clay was entirely serious the car had been sliding down the road at rather high speed through vistas of wonderful quiet and beauty every direction showed a new and separate enchantment a glade surrounded by great trees a small home of natural wood a cluster of public buildings around a plaza a terrace checkered with trees and lined with manycolored shops occasionally there were touches of drama such as the pylon at the end of a wide avenue it rose two hundred feet into the air a structure of concrete bronze and black metal and it bore the heroic figure of a man grasping vainly for a star welstead craned his neck like a tourist magnificent clay assented without enthusiasm i suppose its not discreditable of course to you fresh from the worlds of civilization he left the sentence unfinished excuse me while i call my home he bent his head to a telephone betty said in welsteads ear this is a city every planner on earth would sell his soul to build welstead grunted remember halleck he muttered he was a city planner he wanted to tear down a square mile of slums in lanchester eighteen stories high on the average nothing but airless threeroom apartments first the real estate lobby tore into him called him a chaoticist a rumor circulated among his friends that he was morally degenerate the poor devils that lived there tried to lynch him because theyd be evicted the old faithfuls read him out of the party because they pulled the votes of the district the slums are still there and hallecks selling farm implements on arcturus five betty looked off through the trees maybe haven will turn out to be an object lesson for the rest of the cluster welstead shrugged maybe maybe not peace and seclusion are not something you can show to a million people because it isnt peace and seclusion anymore betty sat up straighter in her seat the only way to convince the unbelievers is by showing them setting them an example do you think that if the lanchester slumdwellers saw this city theyd go back to their three room apartments without wanting to do something about it if they saw this city said welstead theyd never leave haven by hook or crook stowaway or workaway theyd emigrate include me in the first wave said betty indignantly the car turned into a leafy tunnel crossed a carpet of bright green turf stopped by a house built of dark massive wood four high gables in a row overlooked a terrace where a stream followed its natural bed the house looked spacious comfortablerather like the best country villas of earth and the garden planets without the sense of contrived effect the strain the staging my home said clay he slid back a door of waxed blond wood ushered them into an entry carpeted with golden rattan walled with a fabric the color of the forest outside a bench of glowing dark wood crossed a wall under a framed painting from no apparent source light flooded the room like water in a tank one moment said clay with a trace of embarrassment my home is poor and makeshift enough without exposing it to your eyes at its worst he was clearly sincere this was no conventional deprecation he started away paused and said to his halfcomprehending guests i must apologize for our backwardness but we have no facilities for housing notable guests no great inns or embassies or statehouses such as must add to the dignity of life on earth i can only offer you the hospitality of my home welstead and betty both protested we dont deserve as much after all were only a pair of flybynight prospectors clay smiled and they could see that he had been put more at his ease youre the link between haven and civilizationthe most important visitors weve ever had excuse me he departed betty went to the picture on the wall a simple landscapethe slope of a hill a few trees a distant range of mountains welstead with small artistic sensibility looked around for the source of the lightwithout success he joined betty beside the picture she said halfbreathlessly this is aim afraid to say ita masterpiece welstead squinted trying to understand the basis of his wifes awe and wonderment indeed the picture focused his eyes drew them in and around the frame infused him with a pleasant exhilaration a warmth and serenity clay returning noticed their interest what do you think of it he asked i think itsexceedingly well done said betty at a loss for words which would convey her admiration without sounding fulsome clay shook his head ruefully turned away you need not praise an inconsequentiality out of courtesy mrs welstead we know our deficiencies your eyes have seen the giottos the rembrandts the cezannes this must seem a poor thing betty began to remonstrate but halted words evidently would not convince clayor perhaps a convention of his society prompted him to belittle the works of his people and it might be discourteous to argue too vehemently your quarters are being prepared clay told them ive also ordered fresh clothing for you both as i see yours are stained with travel betty blushed smoothed the legs of her blue shorts welstead sheepishly brushed at his faded blouse he reached in his pocket pulled out a bit of gravel from an asteroid i prospected a few weeks ago he twisted it around in his fingers nothing but granite with garnet inclusions clay took the bit of rock inspected it with a peculiar reverence may i keep this why of course clay laid the bit of stone on a silver plate you will not understand what this small stone symbolizes to us of haven interstellar travelour goal our dream for two hundred and seventyone years the recurrence of the period two hundred and seventyone years welstead calculated that put them back into the era of the great excursives when the overunder spacedrive had first come into use when men drove pellmell through the galaxy like bees through a field of flowers and human culture flared through space like a supernova clay led them through a large room simple in effect rich in detail welsteads vision was not analytical enough to catch every particular at first he sensed overall tones of tan brown mellow blue watery green in the wood fabric glass potterythe colors combined to marvelous effect with the waxy umber gleam of natural wood at the end of the room a case held ten large books bound in black leather and these by some indefinable emphasis seemed to bear the significance of an icon they passed through a passage open along one side into a garden filled with flowers low trees tame birds clay showed them into a long apartment streaming with sunlight your bath is through the door said clay fresh clothes are laid out on the bed when you are rested i shall be in the main hall please be at leisure the house is yours they were alone betty sighed happily sank down on the bed isnt it wonderful dear its queer said welstead standing in the middle of the room whats queer mainly why these people apparently gifted and efficient act so humble so selfdeprecating they look confident they are confident yet as soon as the word earth is mentioned its like saying alakland to an exiled lak theres nothing like it betty shrugged began to remove her clothes theres probably some very simple explanation right now im tired of speculating im for that bath water water water tons of it they found clay in the long hall with his pleasantfaced wife his four youngest children whom he gravely introduced welstead and betty seated themselves on a divan and clay poured them small china cups of pale yellowgreen wine then settled back in his own seat first ill explain our world of haven to youor have you surmised our plight welstead said i guess a colony was planted here and forgottenlost clay smiled sadly our beginnings were rather more dramatic two hundred and seventyone years ago the passenger packed etruria enroute to rigel went out of control according to the story handed down to us the busbars fused inside the drivebox if the case were opened the fields would collapse if it were not the ship would fly until there was no more energy welstead said that was a common accident in the old days usually the engineer cut away the thrustblocks on one side of the hull then the ship flew in circles until help arrived clay made a wry sad grimace no one on the etruria thought of that the ship left the known universe and finally passed close to a plante that seemed capable of sustaining life the sixtythree aboard took to the lifeboats and so landed on haven thirtyfour men twentyfive women four childrenranging in age from dorothy pell eight to vladimir hocha seventyfour with representatives of every human race were the descendants of the sixtythree three hundred million of us fast work said betty with admiration large families returned clay i have nine children sixteen grandchildren from the start our guiding principle has been to keep the culture of earth intact for our descendants to teach them what we knew of human tradition so that when rescue cameas it must finallythen our children or our childrens children could return to earth not as savages but as citizens and our invaluable source has been the ten books the only books brought down from the etruria we could not have been favored with books more inspiring clays gaze went to the black bound books at the end of the room and his voice lowered a trifle the encyclopedia of human achievement the original edition was in ten little plastrol volumes none of them larger than your handbut in them was such a treasury of human glory that never could we forget our ancestry or rest in our efforts to achieve somewhere near the level of the great masters all the works of the human race we set as our standardsmusic art literatureall were described in the encyclopedia described you say mused welstead there were no illustrations asked betty no said clay there was small compass for pictures in the original edition howeverhe went to the case selected a volume at randomthe words left little to the imagination for example on the music of bachwhen bach arrived on the scene the toccata was tentative indecisivea recreation a tour de force where the musician might display his virtuosity in bach the toccata becomes a medium of the noblest plasticity the theme he suggests by casual fingering of the keyboard unrelated runs then comes a glorious burst into harmonythe original runs glow like prisms assume stature gradually topple together into a miraculous pyramid of sound and on beethovena god among men his music is the voice of the world the pageant of all imagined splendor the sounds he invokes are natural forces of the same order as sunsets storms at sea the view from mountain crags and on leon bismarck beiderbeckehis trumpet pours out such a torrent of ecstasy such triumph such overriding joys that the heart of man freezes in anguish at not being wholly part of it clay closed the book replaced it such is our heritage we have tried to keep alive however poorly the stream of our original culture i would say that you have succeeded welstead remarked dryly betty sighed a long slow suspiration clay shook his head you cant judge until youve seen more of haven were comfortable enough though our manner of living must seem unimpressive in comparison with the great cities the magnificent palaces of earth no not at all said betty but clay made a polite gesture dont feel obliged to flatter us as ive said were aware of our deficiencies our music for instanceit is pleasant sometimes exciting sometimes profound but never does it reach the heights of poignancy that the encyclopedia describes our art is technically good but we despair of emulating seurat who outlumens light or braque the patterns of the mind in patterns of color on the patterns of life or cezannethe planes which under the guise of natural objects march merge meet in accord with remorseless logic which wheel around and impel the mind to admit the absolute justice of the composition betty glanced at her husband apprehensive lest he speak what she knew must be on his mind to her relief he kept silent squinting thoughtfully at clay for her part betty resolved to maintain a noncommittal attitude no clay said heavily we do the best we can and in some fields weve naturally achieved more than in others to begin with we had the benefit of all human experience in our memories the paths were charted out for uswe knew the mistakes to avoid weve never had wars or compulsion weve never permitted unreined authority still weve tried to reward those who are willing to accept responsibility our criminalsvery few noware treated for mental disorder on the first and second offense sterilized on the third executed on the fourthour basic law being cooperation and contribution to the society though there is infinite latitude in how this contribution shall be made we do not make society a juggernaut a man may live as integrally or as singularly as he wishes so long as he complies with the basic law clay paused looking from welstead to betty now do you understand our way of living more or less said welstead in the outline at least you seem to have made a great deal of progress technically clay considered from one aspect yes from another no we had the lifeboat tools we had the technical skills and most important we knew what we were trying to do our main goal naturally has been the conquest of space weve gone up in rockets but they can take us nowhere save around the sun and back our scientists are close on the secret of the spacedrive but certain practical difficulties are holding them up welstead laughed spacedrive can never be discovered by rational effort thats a philosophical question which has been threshed back and forth for hundreds of years reasonthe abstract ideais a function of ordinary time and space the spacedrive has no qualities in common with these ideas and for this reason human thought can never consciously solve the problem of the overdrive experiment trial and error can do it thinking about it is useless hm said clay thats a new concept but now your presence makes it beside the point for you will be the link back to our homeland betty could see words trembling on her husbands tongue she clenched her hands willedwilledwilled perhaps the effort had some effect because welstead merely said well do anything we can to help all of mytilene they visited and nearby tiryns dicte and ilium they saw industrial centers atomic power generators farms schools they attended a session of the council of guides both making brief speeches and they spoke to the people of haven by television every news organ on the planet carried their words they heard music from a green hillside the orchestra playing from under tremendous smoke black trees they saw the art of haven in public galleries in homes and in common use they read some of the literature studied the range of the planets science which was roughly equivalent to that of earth and they marveled continually how so few people in so little time could accomplish so much they visited the laboratories where three hundred scientists and engineers strove to force magnetic gravitic and vortigial fields into the fusion that made startostar flight possible and the scientists watched in breathless tension as welstead inspected the apparatus he saw at a single glance the source of their difficulty he had read of the same experiments on earth three hundred years ago and of the fantastic accident that had led romanforteski and gladheim to enclose the generatrix in a dodecahedron of quartz only by such a freakor by his informationwould these scientists of haven solve the mystery of spacedrive and welstead walked thoughtfully from the laboratory with the disappointed glances of the technicians following him out and betty had glanced after him in wonder and the rest of the day there had been a strain between them that night as they lay in the darkness rigid wakeful each could feel the pressure of the others thoughts betty finally broke the silence in a voice so blunt that there was no mistaking her feeling ralph what why did you act as you did in the laboratory careful muttered welstead maybe the room is wired for sound betty laughed scornfully this isnt earth these people are trusting honest it was welsteads turn to laugha short cheerless laugh and thats the reason im ignorant when it comes to spacedrive betty stiffened what do you mean i mean that these people are too damn good to ruin betty relaxed sighed spoke slowly as if she knew she was in for a long pull howruin welstead snorted its perfectly plain youve been to their homes youve read their poetry listened to their music x of course these people live every second of their lives withwell call it exaltation a devotion to creation like nothing ive ever seen before welstead said somberly theyre living in the grandest illusion ever imagined and theyre riding for an awful fall theyre like a man on a glorious wine drunk betty stared through the dark are you crazy theyre living in exaltation now said welstead but what a bump when the bubble breaks but why should it break cried betty why cant betty said welstead with a cold sardonic voice have you ever seen a public park on earth after a holiday betty said hotly yesits dreadful because the people of earth have no feeling of community right said welstead and these people have theyre knit very tightly by a compulsion that made them achieve in two hundredodd years what took seven thousand on earth theyre all facing in the same direction geared to the same drive once that drive is gone how do you expect theyll hold on to their standards betty was silent human beings said welstead dreamily are at their best when the goings toughest theyre either at their best or else theyre nothing the goings been tough herethese people have come through give them a cheap living tourist moneythen what but thats not all in fact its only half the story these people here he stated with emphasis are living in a dream theyre the victims of the ten books they take every word literally and theyve worked their hearts out trying to come somewhere near what they expect the standards to be their own stuff doesnt do half the things to them that the ten books says good art ought to do whoever wrote those ten books must have been a copywriter for an advertising agency welstead laughed shakespeare wrote good playssure i concede it but ive never seen fires flickering along the words gusty winds rushing through the pages sibelius i suppose was a great composerim no expert on these thingsbut whoever listened and became part of finlands ice mosssmelling earth hoarsebreathing forest the way the ten books said everyone did betty said he was merely trying to express vividly the essence of the artists and musicians nothing wrong in that said welstead on earth were conditioned to call everything in print a lie at least we allow for several hundred percent overstatement these people out here arent immunized theyve taken every word at its face value the ten books is their bible theyre trying to equal accomplishments which never existed betty raised herself up on an elbow said in a voice of hushed triumph and theyve succeeded ralph theyve succeeded theyve met the challenge theyve equaled or beaten anything earth has ever produced ralph im proud to belong to the same race same species welstead corrected dryly these people are a mixed race theyre all races whats the difference betty snapped youre just quibbling you know what i mean well enough were on a sidetrack said welstead wearily the question is not the people of haven and their accomplishments of course theyre wonderfulnow but how do you think contact with earth will affect them do you think theyll continue producing when the challenge is gone when they find the earth is a rookerynagging quarrelingfull of mediocre hacks and cheap mischief where the artists draw nothing but nude women and the musicians make their living reeling out sound sound soundany kind of soundfor television soundtrack where are all their dreams then talk about disappointment staleness mark my words half the population would be suicides and the other half would turn to prostitution and cheating the tourists its a tough proposition i say leave them with their dreams let them think were the worst sort of villains i say get off the planet get back where we belong betty said in a troubled voice sooner or later somebody else will find them maybemaybe not well report the region barren which it is except for haven betty said in a small voice ralph i couldnt do it i couldnt violate their trust not even to keep them trusting betty said wildly dont you think thered be an equal deflation if we sneaked away and left them were the climax to their entire two hundred and seventyone years think of the listlessness after we left theyre working on their spacedrive said welstead chances are a million to one against their stumbling on it they dont know that theyve got a flicker of a field and they think all they have to do is adjust the power feed get better insulation they dont have the mardi gras lamp that gladheim snatched up when the lead tank melted ralph said betty your words are all very logical your arguments stay togetherbut theyre not satisfying emotionally i dont have the feeling of tightness pish said welstead lets not go spiritual and said betty softly lets not try to play god either there was a long silence ralph said betty what isnt there some way some way to do what why should it be our responsibility i dont know whose else it is were the instruments but its their lives betty said welstead wearily heres one time we cant pass the buck were the people who in the last resort say yes or no were the only people that see on both sides of the fence its an awful decision to makebut say no there was no more talking and after an unmeasured period they fell asleep three nights later welstead stopped betty as she began to undress for bed she gave him a dark wideeyed stare throw whatever youre taking into a bag were leaving bettys body was rigid and tense slowly relaxing as she took a step toward him ralph what and she could find no softness no indecision in his topaz eyes ralphits dangerous for us to go if they caught us theyd execute usfor utter depravity and she said in a murmur looking away i suppose theyd be justified too its a chance well have to take just what we said the day we decided to land weve got to die sometime get your gear and lets take off we should leave a note ralph something he pointed to an envelope there it is thanking them for their hospitality i told them we were criminals and couldnt risk returning to earth its thin but its the best i could do a hint of fire returned to bettys voice dont worry theyll believe it sullenly she tucked a few trinkets into a pouch its a long way to the ship you know she warned him well take clays car ive watched him and i know how to drive it she jerked in a small bitter spasm of laughter were even car thieves got to be said welstead stonily he went to the door listened the utter silence of honest sleep held the rest of the house he returned to where betty stood waiting watching him coldly with an air of dissociation this way said welstead out through the terrace they passed out into the moonless night of haven and the only sound was the glassy tinkle of the little stream that ran in its natural bed through the terrace welstead took bettys hand easy now dont walk into that bamboo he clutched and they froze to a halt through a window had come a sounda gaspand then the relieved mutter a person makes on waking from a bad dream slowly like glass melting under heat the two came to life stole across the terrace out upon the turf beside the house they circled the vegetable garden and the loom of the car bulked before them get in whispered welstead ill push till were down around the bend betty climbed into the seat and her foot scraped against the metal welstead stiffened listened pierced the darkness like an eagle quiet from the house the quiet of relaxation of trust he pushed at the car and it floated easily across the ground resisting his hand only through inertia it jerked to a sudden halt and welstead froze in his tracks again a burglar alarm of some sort no there were no thieves on havenexcept two recentlylanded people from earth a trap the anchor whispered betty of coursewelstead almost groaned with relief every car had an anchor to prevent the wind from blowing it away he found it hooked it into place on the cars frame and now the car floated without hindrance down the leafy tunnel that was clays driveway around a bend he ran to the door jumped in pressed his foot on the power pedal and the car slid away with the easy grace of a canoe out on the main road he switched on the lights and they rushed off through the night and we still use wheels on earth said welstead if we only had a tenth of the guts these people have cars passed them from the other direction the lights glowed briefly into their faces and they cringed low behind the windscreen they came to the park where their ship lay if anyone stops us welstead said in bettys ear weve just driven down to get some personal effects after all were not prisoners but he circled the ship warily before stopping beside it and then he waited a few seconds straining his eyes through the darkness but there was no sound no light no sign of any guard or human presence welstead jumped from the car fast now run over climb inside ill be right behind you they dashed through the dark up the rungs welded to the hull and the cold steel felt like a caress to welsteads hot hands into the cabin he thudded the port shut slammed home the dogs welstead vaulted to the controls powered the reactors dangerous businessbut once clear of the atmosphere they could take time to let them warm properly the ship rose the darkness and lights of mytilene fell below welstead sighed suddenly tired but warm and relaxed up upand the planet became a ball and eridanus two thousand nine hundred and thirtytwo peered around the edge and suddenly without any noticeable sense of boundary passed they were out in space welstead sighed lord what a relief i never knew how good empty space could look it looks beautiful to me also said alexander clay ive never seen it before welstead whirled jumped to his feet clay came forward from the reaction chamber watching with a peculiar expression welstead took to be deadly fury betty stood by the bulkhead looking from one to the other her face blank as a mirror welstead came slowly down from the controls well youve caught us in the act i suppose you think were treating you pretty rough maybe we are but my conscience is clear and were not going back looks like you asked for a ride and youre going to get one if necessary he paused meaningfully then howd you get aboard and after an instant of narroweyed speculation and why why tonight clay shook his head slowly ralphyou dont give us any credit for ordinary intelligence let alone ordinary courage what do you mean i mean that i understand your motivesand i admire you for them although i think youve been bullheaded putting them into action without discussing it with the people most directly concerned welstead lowered his head stared with hard eyes its basically my responsibility i dont like it but im not afraid of it it does you credit said clay mildly on haven were used to sharing responsibility not diluting it you understand but putting a dozena hundreda thousand minds on a problem that might be too much for one you dont appreciate us ralph you think were soft spiritless no said welstead not exactly our civilization is built on adaptability on growth on flexibility continued clay we you dont understand just what youd have to adapt to said welstead harshly its nothing nice its graft scheming sharpshooters tourists by the million wholl leave your planet the way a platoon of invading soldiers leaves the first pretty girl they find therell be problems said clay his voice took on power but thats what we want ralphproblems were hungry for them for the problems of ordinary human existence we want to get back into the stream of life and if it means grunting and sweating we want it were flesh and blood just like you are we dont want nirvanawe want to test our strength we want to fight along with the rest of decent humanity dont you fight what you think is unjust welstead slowly shook his head not any more its too big for me i tried when i was young then i gave up maybe thats why betty and i roam around the outer edges no said betty thats not it at all ralph and you know it you explore because you like exploring you like the rough and tumble of human contact just as much as anyone else rough and rumble said clay savoring the words thats what we need on haven they had it in the old days they gave themselves to it beating the new world into submission its ours now another hundred years of nowhere to go and wed be drugged lethargic decadent welstead was silent the thing to remember ralph said clay is that were part of humanity if theres good going fine but if there are problems we want to help lick them you said youd given up because it was too big for you do you think it would be too big for a whole planet three hundred million hard honest brains welstead stared his imagination kindled i dont see how clay smiled i dont either its a problem for three hundred million minds thinking about it that way it doesnt seem so big if it takes three hundred brains three days to figure out a dodecahedron of quartz welstead jerked looked accusingly at his wife betty she shook her head i told clay about our conversation our argument we discussed it all around i told him everythingand i told him id give a signal whenever we started to leave but i never mentioned spacedrive if they discovered it they did it by themselves welstead turned slowly back to clay discovered it butthats impossible clay said nothings impossible you yourself gave me the hint when you told me human reason was useless because the spacedrive worked out of a different environment so we concentrated not on the drive itself but on the environment the first results came at us in terms of twelve directions hence the dodecahedron just a hunch an experiment and it worked welstead sighed im licked i give in clay the headache is yours youve made it yours what do you want to do go back to haven clay smiled almost with affection were this far id like to see earth for a month incognito then well come back to haven and make a report to the world and then theres three hundred million of us waiting for the bell in round one roll of the dice the advertisement appeared on a telescreen commercial and a few days later at the side of the newsfax the copy was green on a black background a modest rectangle among the oranges reds yellows the punch was carried in the message jaded bored want adventure try the chateau dlf the oxonian terrace was a pleasant area of quiet in the heart of the citya redflagged rectangle dotted with beach umbrellas tables lazy people a bank of magnolia trees screened off the street and filtered out most of the street noise the leakage a soft sound like surf underlay the conversation and the irregular thudthudthud from the oxonian handball courts roland mario sat in complete relaxation halfslumped head back feet propped on the spunair and glass tablein the same posture as his four companions watching them under halfclosed lids mario pondered the ancient mystery of human personality how could men be identical and yet each completely unique to his left sat breaugh a calculator repairman he had a long bony nose round eyes heavy black eyebrows a man deft with his fingers methodical and patient he had a welsh name and he looked the pure ancient welsh type the small dark men that had preceded caesar preceded the celts next to him sat janniver north europe africa the orient had combined to shape his brain and body an accountant by trade he was a tall spare man with short yellow hair he had a long face with features that first had been carved then kneaded back blunted he was cautious thoughtful a tough opponent on the handball court zaer was the quick one the youngest of the group fairskinned with red cheeks dark curly hair eyes gay as valentines he talked the most laughed the most occasionally lost his temper beside him sat ditmar a sardonic man with keen narrow eyes a high forehead and a dark bronze skin from polynesia the sudan or india or south america he played no handball consumed fewer highballs than the others because of a liver disorder he occupied a wellpaying executive position with one of the television networks and mario himself how did they see him he considered probably a different picture in each of their minds although there were few pretensions or striking features to his exterior he had nondescript pleasant features hair and eyes without distinction skin the average goldenbrown medium height medium weight quietspoken quietly dressed he knew he was wellliked so far as the word had meaning among the five they had been thrown together not so much by congeniality as by the handball court and a common bachelorhood mario became aware of the silence he finished his highball anyone go another round breaugh made a gesture of assent ive got enough said janniver zaer tilted the glass down his throat set it down with a thud at the age of four i promised my father never to turn down a drink ditmar hesitated then said might as well spend my money on liquor as anything else thats all money is good for said breaugh to buy a little fun into your life a lot of money buys a lot of fun said ditmar morosely try and get the money zaer gestured a wide fanciful sweep of the arm be an artist an inventor create something build something theres no future working for wages look at this new crop of schoolboy wonders said breaugh sourly where in the name of getout do they come from spontaneous generation by the action of sunlight on slime all of a sudden nothing but unsung geniuses everywhere you look de satz coleyatomicians honn versovitch lekky brule richardsadministrators gandelip new cardosafinanciers dozens of them none over twentythree twentyfour all of ern come up like meteors dont forget pete zaer said zaer hes another one but he hasnt meteored yet give him another year well muttered ditmar maybe its a good thing somebodys got to do our thinking for us were fed were clothed were educated we work at soft jobs and good liquors cheap thats all life means for ninetynine out of a hundred if theyd only take the hangover out of the liquor sighed zaer liquors a release from living said janniver somberly drunkenness is about the only adventure left drunkenness and death yes said breaugh you can always show contempt for life by dying zaer laughed whiskey or cyanide make mine whisky fresh highballs appeared they shook dice for the tag mario lost signed the check after a moment breaugh said its true though drunkenness and death the unpredictables the only two places left to gounless you can afford twenty million dollars for a planetary rocket and even then theres only dead rock after you get there ditmar said you overlooked a third possibility whats that the chateau dlf all sat quiet then all five shifted in their chairs settling back or straightening themselves just what is the chateau dlf asked mario where is it asked zaer the advertisement said try the chateau dlf but it said nothing about how or where janniver grunted probably a new nightclub mario shook his head doubtfully the advertisement gave a different impression its not a night club said ditmar all eyes swung to him no i dont know what it is i know where it is but only because theres been rumors a couple months now what kind of rumors ohnothing definite just hints to the effect that if you want adventure if youve got money to pay for it if youre willing to take a chance if you have no responsibilities you cant abandon ififif said breaugh with a grin the chateau dlf ditmar nodded thats it exactly is it dangerous asked zaer if all they do is string a tightwire across a snakepit turn a tiger loose at you and you can either walk tightrope or fight tiger id rather sit here and drink highballs and figure how to beat janniver in the tournament ditmar shrugged i dont know breaugh frowned it could be a dopeden a new kind of bordello there no such thing said zaer its a haunted house with real ghosts if were going to include fantasy said ditmar a time machine if said breaugh there was a short ruminative silence its rather peculiar said mario ditmar says thereve been rumors a couple months now and last week an advertisement whats peculiar about it asked janniver thats the sequence in almost any new enterprise breaugh said quickly thats the key wordenterprise the chateau dlf is not a natural phenomenon its a mancreated object idea processwhatever it is the motive behind it is a human motiveprobably money what else asked zaer whimsically breaugh raised his black eyebrows high oh you never know now it cant be a criminal enterprise otherwise the acp would be swarming all over it ditmar leaned back swung breaugh a halfmocking look the agency of crime prevention cant move unless theres an offense unless someone signs a complaint if theres no overt offense no complaint the law cant move breaugh made an impatient gesture very true but thats a side issue to the idea i was trying to develop ditmar grinned sorry go on what are the motives which prompt men to new enterprises first money which in a sense comprises includes all of the other motives too but for the sake of clarity call this first the desire for money an end in itself second theres the will for power subdivide that last into say the crusading instinct and call it a desire for unlimited sexual opportunity power over women then third curiosity the desire to know fourth the enterprise for its own sake as a diversion like a millionaires race horses fifth philanthropy any more covers it said zaer possibly the urge for security such as the egyptian pyramids suggested janniver i think thats the fundamental motive behind the first category the lust for money artistic spirit creativeness oh farfetched i should say exhibitionism ditmar put forward equally farfetched i disagree a theatrical performance is based solely and exclusively from the standpoint of the actors upon their mania for exhibitionism breaugh shrugged youre probably right religious movements missions lump that under the will to administer power it sticks out at the edges not far that all good what does it give us anything suggestive the chateau dlf mused janniver it still sounds like an unnecessarily florid moneymaking scheme its not philanthropyat least superficially said mario but probably we could fabricate situations that would cover any of your cases ditmar made an impatient gesture talks useless what good is it not any of us know for sure suppose its a plot to blow up the city breaugh said coolly i appoint you a committee of one ditmar to investigate and report ditmar laughed sourly id be glad to but ive got a better idea lets roll the dice low man applies to the chateau dlf financed by the remaining four breaugh nodded suits me ill roll with you ditmar looked around the table whats it cost asked zaer ditmar shook his head ive no idea probably comes high zaer frowned moved uneasily in his seat set a limit of two thousand dollars per capita good so far as im concerned janniver the tall man with the short yellow hair hesitated yes ill roll ive nothing to lose mario suits me ditmar took up the dice box cupped it with his hand rattled the dice the rules are for poker dice one throw ace high in other words a pair of aces beats a pair of sixes straight comes between three of a kind and a full house that suit everybody who wants to roll first go ahead shoot said mario mildly ditmar shook shook shook turned the dice out five bodies leaned forward five pair of eyes followed the whirling cubes they clattered down the table clanged against a highball glass came to rest looks like three fives said ditmar well thats medium good mario sitting on his left picked up the box tossed the dice in shook threw he granted a two a three a four a five a four pair of fours ouch breaugh threw silently three aces janniver threw two pair deuces and threes zaer a little pale picked up the dice he flashed a glance at mario pair of fours to beat he shook the dice shookthen threw with a sudden flourish clang clatter among the glasses five pairs of eyes looked ace deuce three six deuce pair of deuces zaer threw himself back with a tight grin well im game ill go its suppose to be an adventure of course they dont say whether you come out alive or not you should be delighted said breaugh stuffing tobacco in his pipe after all its our money thats buying you this mysterious thrill zaer made a helpless gesture with both hands where do i go what do i do he looked at ditmar where do i get this treatment i dont know said ditmar ill ask at the studio somebody knows somebody whos been there tomorrow about this time til have the details as much as i can pick up at any rate now came a moment of silence a silence combined of several peculiar qualities each of the five contributed a component but which the wariness which the fear which the quiet satisfaction it was impossible to say breaugh set down his glass well zaer what do you think ready for the tightrope or the tiger better take a pair of brass knuckles or a ringsash said ditmar with a grin zaer glanced around the circle of eyes laughed ruefully the interest you take in me is flattering we want a full report we want you to come out alive zaer said i want to come out alive too whos going to stake me to the smelling salts and adrenalin in case the adventure gets really adventurous oh you look fit enough said breaugh he rose to his feet ive got to feed my cats theres the adventure in my lifetaking care of seven cats quite a futile existence the cats love it he gave a sardonic snort were living a life men have dreamed of living ever since they first dreamed food leisure freedom we dont know when were well off chapter ii changed man zaer was scared he held his arms tight against his body and his grin while wide and ready as ever was a halfnervous grimace twisted off to the side he made no bones about his apprehension and sat in his chair on the terrace like a prizefighter waiting for the gong janniver watched him solemnly drinking beer maybe the idea of the chateau dlf is adventure enough what is adventure asked jesting zaer and did not stay for the answer said breaugh eyes twinkling he loaded his pipe adventure is just another name for having the daylights scared out of you and living to tell about it said zaer wretchedly mario laughed if you never show up again well know it wasnt a true adventure breaugh craned his neck around wheres ditmar hes the man with all the information here he comes said zaer i feel like a prisoner oh the devil said breaugh you dont need to go through with it if you dont want to after all its just a lark no matter of life or death zaer shook his head no ill try her on ditmar pulled up a chair punched the service button ordered beer without preamble he said it costs eight thousand it costs you eight thousand that is theres two levels type a costs ten million type b ten thousand but theyll take eight needless to say none of us can go two and a half million so youre signed up on the type b schedule zaer grimaced dont like the sound of it its like a fun house at the carnival some of em go through the bumps others stand around watching waiting for somebodys dress to blow up and theres the lad who turns the valves throws the switches he has the real fun ditmar said ive already paid the eight thousand so you fellows can write me checks we might as well get that part over now while ive got you all within reach he tucked the checks from mario janniver and breaugh into his wallet thanks he turned to zaer this evening at six oclock go to this address he pushed a card across the table give whoever answers the door this card breaugh and mario on either side of zaer leaned over scrutinized the card along with zaer it read the chateau d if exmoor avenue meadowlands in the corner were scribbled the words zaer by sutlow i had to work like blazes to get it said ditmar it seems theyre keeping it exclusive i had to swear to all kinds of things about you now for heavens sake zaer dont turn out to be an acp agent or im done with sutlow and hes my boss acp zaer raised his eyebrows is itillegal i dont know said ditmar thats what im spending two thousand dollars on you for i hope you have a damn good memory said breaugh with a cool grin becauseif you livei want two thousand dollars worth of vicarious adventure if i die retorted zaer buy yourself a ouija board ill still give you your moneys worth now said ditmar well meet here tuesdays and fridays at threeright fellowshe glanced around the facesuntil you show up zaer rose okay tuesdays and fridays at three be seeing you he waved a hand that took in them all and stumbling slightly walked away poor kid said breaugh hes scared stiff tuesday passed friday passed another tuesday another friday and tuesday came again mario ditmar breaugh janniver reached their table at three oclock and with subdued greetings took their seats five minutes ten minutes passed conversation trickled to a halt janniver sat square to the table big arms resting beside his beer occasionally scratching at his short yellow hair or rubbing his blunt nose breaugh slouched back in the seat looked sightlessly out through the passing crowds ditmar smoked passively and mario twirled and balanced a bit of paper he had rolled into a cylinder at threefifteen janniver cleared his throat i guess he went crazy breaugh grunted ditmar smiled a trifle mario lit a cigarette scowled janniver said i saw him today six eyes swung to him where i wasnt going to mention it said janniver unless he failed to show up today hes living at the atlanticempire a suite on the twentieth floor i bribed the clerk and found that hes been there over a week breaugh said with a wrinkled forehead eyes black and suspicious how did you happen to see him there i went to check their books its on my route on my way out i saw zaer in the lobby big as life did he see you janniver shrugged woodenly possibly im not sure he seemed rather wrapped up in a woman an expensivelooking woman humph said ditmar looks like zaers got our moneys worth all right breaugh rose lets go call on him find out why he hasnt been to see us he turned to janniver is he registered under his own name janniver nodded his long heavy head as big as life breaugh started away halted looked from face to face you fellows coming yes said mario he rose so did ditmar and janniver the atlanticempire hotel was massive and elegant equipped with every known device for the feeding bathing comforting amusing flattering relaxing stimulating assuaging of the men and women able to afford the price at the entry a whitecoated flunky took the wraps of the most casual visitor brushed him offered the woman corsages from an iced case the hall into the lobby was as hushed as the nave of a cathedral lined with thirtyfoot mirrors a moving carpet took the guest into the lobby a great hall in the gloriana style of fifty years before an arcade of small shops lined one wall hereif the guest cared little for expensehe could buy wrought copper gold tantalum gowns in glowing fabrics of scarlet purple indigo objets from ancient tibet and the products of novacraft cabochons of green jovian opals sold by the milligram blue balticons from mars fire diamonds brought from twenty miles under the surface of the earth marathesti cherries preserved in organdy liqueur perfumes pressed from arctic moss white marmorea blooms like the ghosts of beautiful women another entire wall was a single glass panel the side of the hotels main swimming pool underwater shone bluegreen and there was the splash the shining wet gold of swimming bodies the furniture of the lobby was in shades of the same bluegreen and gold with intimacy provided by screens of vines covered with red black and white blossoms a golden light suffused the air heightened the illusion of an enchanted world where people moved in a highkeyed milieu of expensive clothes fabulous jewelry elegant wit careful lovemaking breaugh looked about with a twisted mouth horrible parasites posing and twittering and debauching each other while the rest of the world works oh come now said ditmar dont be so allfired intense theyre the only ones left who are having any fun i doubt it said breaugh theyre as defeated and futile as anyone else theres no more place for them to go than there is for us have you heard of the empyrean tower ohvaguely some tremendous building out in meadowlands thats right a tower three miles high somebodys having fun with that project designing it seeing it go up up up theres four billion people in the world said breaugh only one empyrean tower what kind of a world would it be without extremes asked ditmar a place like the inside of a filing cabinet breathe the air here its rich smells of civilization tradition mario glanced in surprise at ditmar the saturnine wry ditmar whom he would have considered the first to sneer at the foibles of the elite janniver said mildly i enjoy coming here myself in a way its an adventure a look into a different world breaugh snorted only a millionaire can do anything more than look the mass standard of living rises continuously reflected mario and almost at the same rate the number of millionaires drops whether we like it or not the extremes are coming closer together in fact theyve almost met and life daily becomes more like a bowl of rich nourishing mushwithout salt said ditmar by all means abolish poverty but lets keep our millionaires oh well we came here to find zaer not to argue sociology i suppose we might as well all go together they crossed the lobby the desk clerk a handsome silverhaired man with a grave face bowed is mr zaer in ditmar asked ill call his suite sir a moment later no sir he doesnt answer shall i page him no said ditmar well look around a bit about an hour ago i believe he crossed the lobby toward the mauna hiva you might try there thanks the mauna hiva was a circular room at its center rose a great mound of weathered rock overgrown with palms ferns a tangle of exotic plants three coconut palms slanted across the island and the whole was lit with a soft watery white light below was a bar built of waxed tropical woods and beyond at the periphery of the illumination a ring of tables they found zaer quickly he sat with a darkhaired woman in the sheath of emerald silk on the table in front of them moved a number of small glowing manycolored shapessparkling flashing intense as patterns cut from butterfly wings it was a ballet projected in threedimensional miniature tiny figures leaped danced posed to entrancing music in a magnificent setting of broken marble columns and appian cypress trees after a moment the four stood back watching in dour amusement breaugh nudged mario by heaven he acts like hes been doing it all his life ditmar advanced to the table the girl turned her long opaque eyes up at him zaer glanced up blankly hello there zaer said ditmar a sarcastic smile wreathing his lips have you forgotten your old pals of the oxonian terrace zaer stared blankly im sorry i suppose you dont know us asked breaugh looking down his long crooked nose zaer pushed a hand through his mop of curly black hair im afraid you have the advantage of me gentlemen humph said breaugh lets get this straight youre pete zaer are you not yes i am janniver interposed perhaps youd prefer to speak with us alone zaer blinked not at all go ahead say it ever heard of the chateau dlf inquired breaugh acidly and eight thousand dollars added ditmar a joint investment shall we say zaer frowned in what mario could have sworn to be honest bewilderment you believe that i owe you eight thousand dollars either that or eight thousand dollars worth of information zaer shrugged eight thousand dollars he reached into his breast pocket pulled out a billfold counted one two three four five six seven eight there you are gentlemen whatever its for im sure i dont know maybe i was drunk he handed eight thousanddollar bills to the rigid ditmar anyway now youre satisfied and i hope youll be good enough to leave he gestured to the tiny figures swaying posturing to the rapturous music weve already missed the devotional dance the main reason we tuned it on zaer said mario haltingly the gay youthful eyes swung to him yespolitely is this all the report we get after all we acted in good faith zaer stared back coldly you have eight thousand dollars i dont know you from adams off ox you claim it i pay it thats pretty good faith on my part breaugh pulled at marios arm lets go chapter iii blind plunge soberly they sat at a table in an unpretentious tavern drinking beer for a while none of the four spoke four silent figures tall strong janniver with the rough features the baltic hah the african fiber the oriental restraint breaugh the nimbleeyed black browed and longnosed ditmar the sardonic autumncolored man with the sick liver mario normal modest pleasant mario spoke first if thats what eight thousand buys at the chateau dlf ill volunteer if said breaugh shortly its not reasonable rumbled janniver among them his emotions were probably the least disturbed his sense of order and fitness the most outraged breaugh struck the table with his fist a light blow but nevertheless vehement its not reasonable it violates logic your logic ditmar pointed out breaugh cocked his head sideways whats yours i havent any i maintain that the chateau dlf is an enterprise said breaugh at the fee they charged i figured it for a moneymaking scheme it looks like im wrong zaer was broke a month ago or almost so we gave him eight thousand dollars he goes to the chateau dlf he comes out takes a suite at the atlanticempire buys an expensive woman shoves money at us by the fistful the only place he could have got it is at the chateau dlf now theres no profit in that kind of business some of them pay ten million dollars said mario softly that could take up some of the slack ditmar drank his beer what now want to shake again no one spoke at last breaugh said frankly im afraid to mario raised his eyebrows what with zaers climb to riches right in front of you odd mused breaugh thats just what he was saying that he was one of the meteoric schoolboy wonders who hadnt meteored yet now hell probably turn out to be an unsung genius the chateau still sounds good if thats what it does for you if sneered breaugh if assented mario mildly ditmar said with a harsh chuckle ive got eight thousand dollars here our mutual property as far as im concerned its all yours if you want to take on zaers assignment breaugh and janniver gave acquiescent shrugs mario toyed with the idea his life was idle useless he dabbled in architecture played handball slept ate a pleasant but meaningless existence he rose to his feet im on my way right now give me the eight thousand before i change my mind here you are said ditmar erin spite of zaers example well expect a report tuesdays and fridays at three on the oxonian terrace mario waved gaily as he pushed out the door into the late afternoon tuesdays and fridays at three be seeing you ditmar shook his head i doubt it breaugh compressed his mouth i doubt it too janniver merely shook his head exmoor avenue began in lanchester in front of the power bank on the fourth level swung north rose briefly to the fifth level where it crossed the continental highway curved back to the west slanted under grimshaw boulevard dropped to the surface in meadowlands mario found exmoor to be a gray block of a building not precisely dilapidated but evidently unloved and uncaredfor a thin indecisive strip of lawn separated it from the road and a walkway led to a small excrescence of a portico with the level afternoon sun shining full on his back mario walked to the portico pressed the button a moment passed then the door slid aside revealing a short hall please come in said the soft voice of a commercial welcomebox mario advanced down the hall aware that radiation was scanning his body for metal or weapons the hall opened into a green and brown reception room furnished with a leather settee a desk a painting of three slim wideeyed nudes against a background of a dark forest a door flicked back a young woman entered mario tightened his mouth it was an adventure to look at the girl she was amazingly beautiful with a beauty that grew more poignant the longer he considered it she was silent smallboned her eyes were cool direct her jaw and chin fine and firm she was beautiful in herself without ornament ruse or adornment beautiful almost in spite of herself as if she regretted the magic of her face mario felt cool detachment in her gaze an impersonal unfriendliness human perversity immediately aroused in his brain a desire to shatter the indifference to arouse passion of one sort or another he smothered the impulse he was here on business your name please her voice was soft with a fine grain to it like precious wood and pitched in a strange key roland mario she wrote on a form age twentynine occupation architect what do you want here this is the chateau dlf yes she waited expectantly im a customer who sent you no one im a friend of pete zaers he was here a couple of weeks ago she nodded wrote he seems to have done pretty well for himself observed mario cheerfully she said nothing until she had finished writing then this is a business operated for profit we are interested in money how much do you have to spend id like to know what you have to sell adventure she said the word without accent or emphasis ah said mario i see out of curiosity how does working here affect you do you find it an adventure or are you bored too she shot him a quick glance we offer two classes of service the first we value at ten million dollars it is cheap at that price but it is the dullest and least stirring of the twothe situation over which you have some control the second we value at ten thousand dollars and this produces the most extreme emotions with the minimum of immediate control on your part mario considered the word immediate he asked have you been through the treatment again the cool flick of a glance would you care to indicate how much you wish to spend i asked you a question said mario you will receive further information inside are you human asked mario do you breathe would you care to indicate how much you have to spend mario shrugged i have eight thousand dollars with me he pursed his lips and ill give you a thousand to stick your tongue out at me she dropped the form into a slot arose follow me please she led him through the door along a hall into a small room bare and stark lit by a single coneshaped floor lamp turned against the ceiling a room painted white gray green a man sat at a desk punching a calculator behind him stood a filing cabinet there was a faint odor in the air like mingled mint gardenias with a hint of an antiseptic medicinal scent the man looked up rose to his feet bowed his head politely he was young blond as beachsand as magnificently handsome as the girl was beautiful mario felt a slight edge form in his brain one at a time they were admirable their beauty seemed natural together the beauty cloyed as if it were something owned and valued highly it seemed selfconscious and vulgar and mario suddenly felt a quiet pride in his own commonplace person the man was taller than mario by several inches his chest was smooth and wide corded with powerful sinew in spite of almost overcareful courtesy he gave an impression of overpowering overriding confidence mr roland mario said the girl she added drily hes got eight thousand dollars the young man nodded gravely reached out his hand my name is mervyn alien he looked at the girl is that all thane thats all for tonight she left cant keep going on eight thousand a night grumbled mervyn alien sit down mr mario mario took a seat the adventure business must have tremendous expenses he observed with a tight grin oh no said alien with wide candid eyes to the contrary the operators have a tremendous avarice we try to average twenty million a day profit occasionally we cant make it pardon me for annoying you with carfare said mario if you dont want it ill keep it alien made a magnanimous gesture as you please mario said the receptionist told me that ten million buys the dullest of your services and ten thousand something fairly wild what do i get for nothing vivisection alien smiled no youre entirely safe with us that is to say you suffer no physical pain you emerge alive but you wont give me any particulars after all i have a fastidious nature what youd consider a good joke might annoy me very much mervyn alien shrugged blandly you havent spent any money yet you can still leave mario rubbed the arms of his chair with the palms of his hand thats rather unfair im interested but also id like to know something of what im getting into alien nodded understandable youre willing to take a chance but youre not a complete fool is that it exactly alien straightened a pencil on his desk first id like to give you a short psychiatric and medical examination you understand and he flashed mario a bright candid glance we dont want any accidents at the chateau dlf go ahead said mario alien slid open the top of his desk handed mario a cap of crinkling plastic in which tiny wires glittered encephalograph pickup please fit it snugly mario grinned call it a liedetector alien smiled briefly a liedetector then mario muttered id like to put it on you alien ignored him pulled out a pad of printed forms adjusted a dial in front of him name roland mario age twentyeight alien stared at the dial frowned looked up questioningly i wanted to see if it worked said mario im twentynine it works said alien shortly occupation architect at least i dabble at it design dog houses and rabbit hutches for my friends although i did the geraf fleeter corporation plant in hanover a year or so ago pretty big job hm where were you born buenos aires ever hold any government jobs civil service police administrative acp no why not red tape disgusting bureaucrats nearest relative my brother arthur mario in callaco coffee business no wife no wife approximate worth wealth possessions real estate ohsixty seventy thousand modestly comfortable enough so that i can loaf all i care to why did you come to the chateau dlf same reason that everybody else comes boredom repressed energy lack of something to fight against alien laughed so you think youll work off some of that energy fighting the chateau dlf mario smiled faintly its a challenge weve got a good thing here alien confided a wonder it hasnt been done before how did you happen to come to the chateau dlf five of us rolled dice a man named pete zaer lost he came but he wouldnt speak to us afterwards alien nodded sagely weve got to ask that our customers keep our secrets if there were no mystery we would have no customers it had better be good said mario after all the buildup and he thought he saw a flicker of humor in aliens eyes its cheap at ten million and quite dear at ten thousand suggested mario alien leaned back in his chair and his beautiful face was cold as a marble mask mario suddenly thought of the girl in the front office the same expression of untouchable distance and height he said i suppose you have the same argument with everyone who comes in identical well where do we go from here are you healthy any organic defects none very well ill waive the physical mario reached up removed the encephalograph pickup now i can lie again alien drummed a moment on the tabletop reached forward tossed the mesh back in the desk scribbled on a sheet of paper tossed it to mario a contract relieving us of responsibility mario read in consideration of services rendered roland mario agreed that the chateau dlf and its principals would not be held responsible for any injuries physical or psychological which he might sustain while on the premises or as a result of his presence on the premises furthermore he waived all rights to prosecute any and all transactions treatments experiments events which occurred on by or to his person were by his permission and express direction mario chewed doubtfully at his lip this sounds pretty tough about all you cant do is kill me correct said alien a very ominous contract perhaps just the talk is adventure enough suggested alien faintly contemptuous mario pursed his lips i like pleasant adventures a nightmare is an adventure and i dont like nightmares who does in other words you wont tell me a thing not a thing if i had any sense said mario id get up and walk out suit yourself what do you do with all the money mervyn alien relaxed in his chair put his hands behind his blond head were building the empyrean tower thats no secret it was news to mario the empyrean towerthe vastest grandest heaviest tallest most noble structure created or even conceived by man a skypiercing staraspiring shaft three miles tall why if i may ask are you building the empyrean tower alien sighed for the same reason youre here at the chateau dlf boredom and dont tell me to take my own treatment have you alien studied him with narrow eyes yes i have you ask lots of questions too many heres the contract sign it or tear it up i cant give you any more time first said mario patiently youll have to give me some idea of what im getting into its not crime said alien lets saywe give you a new outlook on life artificial amnesia asked mario remembering zaer no your memory is intact here it is and alien thrust out the contract sign it or tear it up mario signed i realize im a fool want my eight thousand were in the business for money said alien shortly if you can spare it mario counted out the eight thousanddollar bills there you are alien took the money tapped it on the table inspected mario ruminatively our customers fall pretty uniformly into three groups reckless young men just out of adolescence jaded old men in search of new lands of vice and police snoopers you dont seem to fit mario said with a shrug average the first two im reckless jaded and twentynine alien smiled briefly politely rose to his feet this way please a panel opened behind him revealing a chamber lit with cool strawcolored light green plants waisthigh grew in profusionlargeleafed exotics fragile ferns fantastic spired fungi nodding spearblades the color of aztec jade mario noticed alien drawing a deep breath before entering the room but thought nothing of it he followed gazing right and left in admiration for the small artificial jungles to either side the air was strong with the mintgardeniaantiseptic odorpungent he blinked his eyes watered blurred he halted swaying alien turned around watched with a cool halfsmile as if this were a spectacle he knew well but found constantly amusing vision retreated hearing hummed flagged departed time swam spun chapter iv a new life mario awoke it was a sharp cleancut awakening not the slow wading through a morass of drug he sat on a bench in tanagra square under the big mimosa and the copper peacocks were pecking at bread he held out to them he looked at his hand it was a fat pudgy hand the arm was encased in hard gray fiber no suit he owned was gray the arm was short his legs were short his belly was large he licked his lips they were pulpy thick he was roland mario inside the brain the body was somebody else he sat quite still the peacocks pecked at the bread he threw it away his arm was stiff strangely heavy he had flabby muscles he rose to his feet grunting his body was soft but not flexible he rubbed his hand over his face felt a short lumpy nose long ears heavy cheeks like pans full of cold glue he was bald as the underside of a fish who was the body he blinked felt his mind twisting tugging at its restraint mario fought to steady himself as a man in a teetering canoe tries to hold it steady to prevent capsizing into dark water he leaned against the trunk of the mimosa tree steady steady focus your eyes what had been done to him no doubt could be undone or it would wear off was it a dream an intensely vivid segment of narcotiana adventureha that was a mild word he fumbled into his pockets found a folded sheet of paper he opened it sat down while he read the typescript first there was a heavy warning memorize the following as this paper will disintegrate in approximately five minutes you are embarking on the life you paid for your name is ralston ebery your age is you are married to florence ebery age your home address is seafoam place you have three children luther age ralston jr age clydia age you are a wealthy manufacturer of aircraft the ebery aircar your bank is the african federal the passbook is in your pocket when you sign your name do not consciously guide your hand let the involuntary muscles write the signature ralston ebery if you dislike your present form you may return to the chateau dlf ten thousand dollars will buy you a body of your choice ten million dollars will buy you a young healthy body to your own specifications please do not communicate with the police in the first place they will believe you to be insane in the second place if they successfully hampered the operation of the chateau dlf you would be marooned in the body of ralston ebery a prospect you may or may not enjoy in the third place the body of roland mario will insist on his legal identity with your business opportunities ten million dollars is a sum well within your reach when you have it return to the chateau dlf for a young and healthy body we have fulfilled our bargain with you we have given you adventure with skill and ingenuity you will be able to join the group of men without age eternally young mario read the sheet a second time as he finished it crumbled into dust in his hands he leaned back aware of nausea rising in him like an elevator in a shaft the most hateful of intimacies dwelling in another mans bodyespecially one so gross and untidy he felt a sensation of hunger and with perverse malice decided to let ralston eberys body go hungry ralston ebery the name was vaguely familiar did ralston ebery now possess marios own body possibly not necessarily mario had no conception of the principle involved in the transfer there seemed to be no incision no brain graft now what he could report to the acp but if he could make them believe him there still would be no legal recourse to the best of his knowledge no one at the chateau dlf had performed a criminal act upon him there was not even a good case of battery since he had waived his right to prosecute the newspapers the telescreens suppose unpleasant publicity were able to force the chateau dlf out of business what then mervyn alien could set up a similar business elsewhereand mario would never be allowed to return to his own body he could follow the suggestion of the now disintegrated paper no doubt ralston ebery had powerful political and financial connections as well as great wealth in his own right or had he would it not be more likely that ebery had liquidated as much of his wealth as possible both to pay ten million dollars to the chateau dlf and also to provide his new body with financial backing mario contemplated the use of force there might be some means to compel the return of his body help would be useful should he report to ditmar janniver breaugh indeed he owed them some sort of explanation he rose to his feet mervyn alien would not conceivably leave vulnerable areas in his defenses he must realize that violence revenge would be the first idea in a mind shanghaied into an old sick body there would be precautions against obvious violence of that he was certain the ideas thronged swirled frothed like differentcolored paints stirred in a bucket his head became light a buzzing sounded in his ears a dream when would he awake he gasped panted made feeble struggling motions a patrolman stopped beside him tripped his incidentcamera automatically whats wrong sir taken sick no no said mario im all right just dozed off he rose to his feet stepped on the choreops strip passed the central fountain flagged with aventurine quartz stepped off at the malabar pavilion wandered under the great bay trees out onto kesselyn avenue slowly heavily he plodded through the wholesale florist shops and at pacific let the escalator take him to the third level where he stepped on the fast pedstrip of the grand footway to the concourse his progress had been unconscious automatic as if his body made the turns at its own volition now at the foot of the aetherian block he stepped off the strip breathing a little heavily the body of ralston ebery was spongy in poor condition and mario felt an unholy gloating as he thought of ralston eberys body sweating puffing panting fastingworking off its lard a face suddenly thrust into his a snarling hatebrimmed face teeth showed the pupils of the eyes were like the blacktipped poison darts of the mazumbwe backlands the face was that of a youngold manunlined but grayhaired innocent but wise distorted by the inner thrash and coil of his hate through tight teeth and corded jaw muscles the youngold man snarled you filthy misbegotten dungthief do you hope to live you venom you stench it would soil me to kill you but i shall mario stepped back the man was a stranger im sorry you must be mistaken he said before it dawned that ralston eberys deeds were now accountable to him a hand fell on the youngold mans shoulder beat it arnold said a hard voice be off with you the youngold man fell back maries rescuer turned arounda dapper young man with an agile foxface he nodded respectfully good morning mr ebery sorry that crank bothered you good morning said mario ahwho was he the young man eyed nun curiously why thats letya arnold used to work for us you fired him mario was puzzled why the young man blinked im sure i dont know inefficiency i suppose its not important said mario hurriedly forget it sure of course on your way up to the office yes ii suppose so who was this young man it was a problem he would be called on to face many times he thought they approached the elevators after you said mario there was such an infinity of detail to be learned a thousand personal adjustments the intricate pattern of ralston eberys business was there any business left ebery certainly would have plundered it of every cent he could endow his new body with ebery aircar was a large concern still the extracting of even ten million dollars was bound to make a dent and this young man with the clever face who was he mario decided to try indirectness a vague question now lets seehow long since youve been promoted the young man darted a swift side glance evidently wondering whether ebery was off his feed why ive been assistant office manager for two years mario nodded they stepped into the elevator and the young man was quick to press the button obsequious cur thought mario the door snapped shut and there came the swoop which stomachs of the age had become inured to the elevator halted the doors flung back they stepped out into a busy office filled with clicking machinery clerks banks of telescreens clatter humand sudden silence with every eye on the body of ralston ebery furtive glances studied attentiveness to work exaggerated efficiency mario halted looked the room over it was his by default no one in the world could deny him authority over this concern unless ralston ebery had been too fast too greedy raising his ten million plus if ralston ebery had embezzled or swindled heroland mario in eberys bodywould be punished mario was trapped in eberys past eberys shortcomings would be held against him the hate he had aroused would inflict itself on him he had inherited eberys wife his family his mistress if any a short middleaged man with wide disillusioned eyes the bitter clasp of mouth that told of many hopes lost or abandoned approached morning mr ebery glad youre here several matters for your personal attention mario looked sharply at the man was that overtone in his voice sarcasm in my office said mario the short man turned toward a hallway mario followed come along he said to the assistant office manager gothic letters wrought from silver spelled out ralston eberys name on a door mario put his thumb into the lock the prints meshed the door slid aside mario slowly entered frowning in distaste at the fussy decor ralston ebery had been a lover of the rococo he sat down behind the desk of polished black metal said to the assistant office manager bring me the personnel file on the office staffrecords photographs yes sir the short man hauled a chair forward now mr ebery im sorry to say that i consider youve put the business in an ambiguous position what do you mean asked mario frostily as if he were ebery himself the short man snorted what do i mean i mean that the contracts you sold to atlas airboat were the biggest moneymakers ebery aircar had as you know very well we took a terrible drubbing in that deal the short man jumped to his feet walked up and down frankly mr ebery i dont understand it just a minute said mario let me look at the mail killing time he thumbed through the mail until the assistant office manager returned with a file of cards thank you said mario thats all for now he flicked through them glancing at the pictures this short man had authority he should be somewhere near the top here he waslouis correaos executive adviser information as to salary family age backgroundmore than he could digest at the moment he put the file to one side louis correaos was still pacing up and down fuming correaos paused darted mario a venemous stare illadvised i think youre crazy he shrugged i tell you this because my job means nothing to me the company cant stand the beating youve given it not the way you want it run at any rate you insist on marketing a flying teawagon festooned with ornaments then you sell the only profitable contracts the only features to the ship that make it at all airworthy mario reflected a minute then he said i had my reasons correaos halting in his pacing stared again mario said can you conjecture how i plan to profit from these circumstances correaoss eyes were like poker chips his mouth contracted tightened pursed to an o he was thinking after a moment he said you sold our steel plant to jones and cahill our patent on the ride stabilizer to bluecraft he gazed narrowly askance at mario it sounds like youre doing what you swore youd never do bring out a new model that would fly how do you like the idea asked mario looking wise louis correaos stammered why mr ebery this isfantastic you asking me what i think im your yesman thats what youre paying me for i know it you know it everybody knows it you havent been yessing me today said ebery you told me i was crazy well stammered correaos i didnt see your idea its what id like to have done long ago put in a new transformer pull off all that ormolu use plancheen instead of steel simplify simplify louis said mario make the announcement start the works rolling youre in charge ill back up anything you want done louis correaoss face was a drained mask make your salary anything you want said mario ive got some new projects im going to be busy on i want you to run the business youre the boss can you handle it yes i can do it your own way bring out a new model thatll beat everything in the field ill check on the final setup but until then youre the boss right nowclean up all this detail he pointed to the file of correspondence take it to your office correaos impulsively rushed up shook marios hand ill do the best i can he left the room mario said into the communicator get me the african federal bank hello to the girls face on the screen this is ralston ebery please check on my personal balance after a moment she said its down to twelve hundred dollars mr ebery your last withdrawal almost wiped out your balance thank you said mario he settled the thick body of ralston ebery into the chair and became aware of a great cavernous growling in his abdomen ralston ebery was hungry mario grinned a ghastly sour grin he called food service send up a chopped olive sandwich celery a glass of skim milk chapter v an understanding during the afternoon he became aware of an ordeal he could no longer ignore acquainting himself with ralston eberys family his home life it could not be a happy one no happy husband and father would leave his wife and children at the mercy of a stranger it was the act of hate rather than love a group photograph stood on the deska picture inconspicuously placed as if it were there on sufferance this was his family florence ebery was a frail woman filmy timid overdressed and her face peering out from under a preposterous hat wore the patient perplexed expression of a family pet dressed in doll clothessomehow pathetic luther and ralston jr were stocky young men with set mulish faces clydia a fullcheeked creature with a petulant mouth at three oclock mario finally summoned up his courage called eberys home on the screen had florence ebery put on she said in a thin distant voice yes ralston ill be home this evening dear mario added the last word with conscious effort she wrinkled her nose pursed her lips and her eyes shone as if she were about to cry you dont even tell me where youve been mario said florencefrankly would you say ive been a good husband she blinked defiantly at him ive no complaints ive never complained the pitch of her voice hinted that this perhaps was not literally true probably had reason thought mario no i want the truth florence youve given me all the money i wanted youve humiliated me a thousand tunessnubbed me made me a laughing stock for the children mario said well im sorry florence he could not vow affection he felt sorry for florenceeberys wifebut she was ralston eberys wife not his own one of ralston eberys victims see you this evening he said lamely and switched off he sat back think think think there must be a way out or was this to be his life his end in this corpulent unhealthy body mario laughed suddenly if ten million dollars bought ralston ebery a new bodypresumably his ownthen ten million more of ralston eberys dollars might buy the body back for money spoke a clear loud language to mervyn alien humiliating a nauseous obsequious act a kissing of the foot which kicked you a submission an acquiescencebut it was either this or wear the form of ralston ebery mario stood up walked to the window stepped out on the landing plat signaled down an aircab ten minutes later he stood at exmoor avenue in meadowlands the chateau dlf a gardener clipping the hedges eyed him with distrust he strode up the driveway pressed the button there was as before a short wait the unseen scrutiny of spy cells the sun shone warm on his back to his ears came the shirrrrr of the gardeners clippers the door opened please come in said the soft commercial voice down the hall into the green and brown reception room with the painting of the three stark nudes before the olden forest the girl of fabulous beauty entered mario gazed again into the wide clear eyes which led to some strange brain whose brain mario wondered of man or woman no longer did mario feel the urge to excite her arouse her she was unnatural a thing what do you wish id like to see mr alien on what business ah you know me on what business youre a moneymaking concern are you not yes my business means money please be seated she turned mario watched the slim body in retreat she walked lightly gracefully in low elastic slippers he became aware of eberys body the old goats glands were active enough mario fought down the wincing nausea the girl returned follow me please mervyn alien received him with affability though not going so far as to shake hands hello mr mario i rather expected you sit down hows everything going enjoying yourself not particularly ill agree that youve provided me with a very stimulating adventure and indeednow that i think backnowhere have you made false representations alien smiled a cool brief smile and mario wondered whose brain this beautiful body surrounded your attitude is unusually philosophical said alien most of our customers do not realize that we give them exactly what they pay for the essence of adventure is surprise danger and an outcome dependent upon ones own efforts no question remarked mario that is precisely what you offer but dont mistake me if i pretended friendship i would not be sincere in spite of any rational processes i feel a strong resentment i would kill you without sorroweven though as you will point out i brought the whole matter on myself exactly aside from my own feelings we have a certain community of interests which i wish to exploit you want money i want my own body i came to inquire by what circumstances our desires could both be satisfied aliens face was joyous he laughed delightedly mario you amuse me ive heard many propositions but none quite so formal so elegant yes i want money you want the body you have become accustomed to im sorry to say that your old body is now the property of someone else and i doubt if hed be persuaded to surrender it but i can sell you another body healthy handsome young for our usual fee ten million dollars for thirty million ill give you the widest possible choice a body like mine for instance the empyrean tower is an exceedingly expensive project mario said out of curiosity how is this transfer accomplished i dont notice any scar or any sign of brain graft which in any event is probably impossible mervyn alien nodded it would be tedious splicing several million sets of nerves are you acquainted with the physiology of the brain no said mario its complicated thats about all i know of itor have cared to know alien leaned back relaxed spoke rapidly as if by rote the brain is divided into three parts the medulla oblongata the cerebellumthese two control involuntary motions and reflexesand the cerebrum the seat of memory intelligence personality thinking is done in the brain the same way thinking is done in mechanical brains by the selection of a route through relays or neurons in a blank brain the relative ease of any circuit is the same and the electric potential of each and every cell is the same the process is divided into a series of stepsdiscovered i may add accidentally during a program of research in a completely different field first the patients scalp is imbedded in a cellule of what the original research team called golasma an organic crystal with a large number of peripheral fibers between the golasma cellule and the brain are a number of layershair dermal tissue bone three separate membranes as well as a mesh of blood vessels very complicated the neural cells however are unique in their high electric potential and for practical purposes the intervening cells do not intrude next by a complicated scanning process we duplicate the synapses of the brain in the golasma relating it by a pattern of sensory stimuli to a frame that will be common to all men third the golasma cellules are changed the process is reversed as brain is equipped with bs synapses b with as the total process requires only a few minutes nonsurgical painless harmless a receives bs personality and memories b takes on as slowly mario rubbed his fat chin you mean iiam not roland mario at all that thinking roland marios thoughts is an illusion and not a cell in this body is roland mario not the faintest breath youre alllet me see your name is ralston ebery i believe every last corpuscle of you is ralston ebery you are ralston ebery equipped with roland marios memories but my glandular makeup wont it modify roland marios personality after all a mans actions are not due to his brain alone but to a synthesis of effects very true said alien the effect is progressive you will gradually change become like the ralston ebery before the change and the same with roland marios body the total change will be determined by the environment against heredity ratio in your characters mario smiled i want to get out of this body soon what i see of ebery i dont like bring in ten million dollars said mervyn alien the chateau dlf exists for one purposeto make money mario inspected alien carefully noted the hard clear flesh the beautiful shape of the face skull expression what do you need all that money for why build an empyrean tower in the first place i do it for fun it amuses me i am bored i have explored many bodies many existences this body is my fourteenth ive wielded power i do not care for the sensation the pressure annoys me nor am i at all psychotic i am not even ruthless in my business what one man loses another man gains the balance is even but its robbery protested mario bitterly stealing the years off one mans life to add to anothers alien shrugged the bodies are living the same cumulative length of time the total effect is the same theres no change but the shifting of memory in any event perhaps i am in the jargon of metaphysics a solipsist so far as i can seethrough my eyes through my braini am the only true individual the sole conscious intellect his eye shadowed how else can it be that iihave been chosen from among so many to lead this charmed life of mine pah sneered mario every man amuses himself as best he knows how my current interest is building the empyrean tower his voice took on a deep exalted ring it shall rise three miles into the air there is a banquet hall with a floor of alternate silver and copper strips a quarter mile wide a quarter mile high ringed with eight glass balconies there will be garden terraces like nothing else on earth with fountains waterfalls running brooks one floor will be a fairyland out of the ancient days peopled with beautiful nymphs others will display earth at stages in its history there will be museums conservatories of various musical styles studios workshops laboratories for every known type of research sections given to retail shops there will be beautiful chambers and balconies designed for nothing except to be wandered through sections devoted to thelet us say worship of astarte there will be halls full of toys a hundred restaurants staffed by gourmets a thousand taverns serving liquid dreams halls for seeing hearing resting said mario and after you tire of the empyrean tower mervyn alien flung himself back in the seat ah mario you touch me on a sore point doubtless something will suggest itself if only we could break away from earth could fly past the barren rocks of the planets to other stars other life there would be no need for any chateau dlf mario rubbed his fat jowl eyed alien quizzically did you invent this process yourself i and four others who comprised a research team they are all dead i alone know the technique and your secretary is she one of your changelings no said mervyn alien thane is what she is she lives by hate you think i am her lover no and he smiled faintly not in any way her will is for destruction death a bright thing only on the surface inwardly she is as dark and violent as a drop of hot oil mario had absorbed too many facts too much information he was past speculating well i wont take any more of your time i wanted to find out where i stand now you know i need money this is the easiest way to get it in large quantities that i know of but i also have my big premium offerbank night bingo whatever you wish to call it whats that i need customers the more customers the more money naturally my publicity cannot be too exact so i offer a free shift a free body if you bring in six new customers mario narrowed his eyes sosutlow gets credit for zaer and me alien looked blank whos sutlow you dont know sutlow never heard of him how about ditmar ah hes successful is ditmar ten thousand bought him a body with advanced cirrhosis two more customers and he escapes but perhaps i talk too much i can give you no more time mario good night on his way out mario stopped in the reception room looked down into the face of thane she stared back face like stone eyes like star sapphires mario suddenly felt exalted mystic as if he walked on live thought knew the power of insight youre beautiful but youre cold as the seabed this door will take you out sir your beauty is so new and so fragile a thinga surface only a millimeter thick two strokes of a knife would make you a horrible sight one from which people would look aside as you pass she opened bar mouth closed it rose to her feet said this way out sir mario reached caught sight of ralston eberys fat flaccid fingers grimaced pulled back his hands i could not touch youwith these hands nor with any others she said from the cool distance of her existence he passed her to the door if you see the most beautiful creature that could possibly exist if she has a soul like rock crystal if she challenges you to take her break her and you are lost in a fat hideous porridge of a body her expression shifted a trifle in which direction he could not tell this is the chateau dlf she said and you are a fat hideous porridge he wordlessly departed she slid the door shut mario shrugged but ralston eberys face burnt in a hot glow of humiliation there was no love no thought of love nothing more than the challenge much like the dare of a mountain to the climbers who scale its height plunder the secrets of its slopes master the crest thane cold as the far side of the moon get away said marios brain sharply break clear of the obsession fluff female bodies forget them is not the tangle of enough complexity chapter vi leverage from the door of the chateau dlf mario took an aircab to seafoam placea monster house of pink marble effulgent voluted elaborate as the rest of ralston eberys possessions he thumbed the lockhole the prints meshed with identification patterns the door snapped back mario entered the photograph had prepared him for his family florence ebery greeted him with furtive suspicion the sons were blank passively hostile the daughter seemed to have no emotions whatever other than a constant air of puzzled surprise at dinner mario outraged eberys body by eating nothing but a salad of lettuce carrots and vinegar his family was puzzled are you feeling well ralston inquired his wife very well youre not eating im dieting im going to take the lard off this hideous body eight eyes bulged four sets of knives and forks froze mario went on placidly were going to have some changes around here too much easy living is bad for a person he addressed himself to the two young men both alike with white faces doughy cheeks full lips you lads nowi dont want to be hard on you after all its not your fault you were born ralston eberys sons but do you know what it means to earn a living by sweating for it luther the eldest spoke with dignity we work with the sweat of our brains tell me more about it said mario luthers eyes showed anger i put out more work in one week than you do all year where where why in the glass yard where else there was fire here more than mario had expected ralston jr said in a gruff surly voice were paying you our board and room we dont owe you a red cent if you dont like the arrangements the way they are well leave mario winced he had misjudged eberys sons white faces doughy cheeks did not necessarily mean white doughy spirits better keep his opinions to himself base his conversation on known fact he said mildly sorry i didnt mean to offend you forget the board and room spend it on something useful he glanced skeptically toward clydia eberys daughter she halfsimpered better keep his mouth shut she might turn out to be a twelvehouraday social service worker nevertheless mario found himself oppressed in eberys house though living in eberys body the feel of his clothes his intimate equipment was profoundly disturbing he could not bring himself to use eberys razor or toothbrush attending to the needs of eberys body was most exquisitely distasteful he discovered to his relief that his bedroom was separate from that of florence ebery he arose the next morning very early scarcely after dawn hurriedly left the house breakfasted on orange juice and dry toast at a small restaurant eberys stomach protested the meager rations with angry rumbling eberys legs complained when mario decided to walk the pedestrip instead of calling down an aircab he let himself into the deserted offices of ebery aircar wandered absently back and forth the length of the suite thinking still thinking he let himself into his private office the clutter the rococo junk annoyed him he called up a janitor waved his hand around the room clear out all this fancy stuff take it home keep it if you dont want it throw it away leave me the desk a couple of chairs the rest out he sat back thinking ways means what weapons could he use he drew marks on a sheet of paper how could he attack perhaps the law could assist himsomehow perhaps the acp but what statute did mervyn alien violate there were no precedents the chateau dlf sold adventure if a customer bought a great deal more than he had bargained for he had only himself to blame money money money it could not buy back his own body he needed leverage a weapon pressure to apply he called the public information service requested the file on golasma it was unknown he drew more marks scribbled meaningless patterns where was mervyn alien vulnerable the chateau dlf the empyrean tower once more he dialed into the public information service requested the sequence on the empyrean tower typescript flashed across his screen the empyrean tower will be a multiplefunction building at a site in meadowlands the highest level will be three miles above ground the architects are kubal associates incorporated of lanchester foundation contracts have been let to lourey and lyble mario touched the shift button the screen showed an architects pencil sketcha slender structure pushing through cloud layers into the clear blue sky mario touched the shift button now came detailed information as to the weight cubic volume comparison with the pyramids the chilung gorge dam the skatterholm complex at ronn the hawke pylon the worlds mart at dar es salaam mario pushed at his communicator button no answer still too early impatient now he ordered coffee drank two cups pacing the office nervously at last a voice answered his signal when mr correaos comes in id like to speak to him five minutes later louis correaos knocked at his door morning louis said mario good morning mr ebery said correaos with a tight guarded expression as if expecting the worst mario said louis i want some advice have you ever heard of kubal associates incorporated architects no cant say as i have i dont want to distract you from your work said mario but i want to acquire control of that company quietly secretly even id like you to make some quiet inquiries dont use my name buy up as much voting stock as is being offered go as high as you like but get the stock and dont use my name correaoss face became a humorous mask with a bitter twist to his mouth what am i supposed to use for money mario rubbed the flabby folds around his jaw hm theres no reserve fund no bank balance correaos looked at him queerly you should know mario squinted off to the side true he should know to louis correaos this was ralston ebery sitting before him the arbitrary domineering ralston ebery mario said check on how much we can raise will you louis correaos said just a minute he left the room he returned with a bit of paper ive been figuring up retooling costs well have to borrow its none of my business what you did with the fund mario smiled grimly youd never understand louis and if i told you you wouldnt believe me just forget it its gone the south african agency sent a draft for a little over a million yesterday that wont even touch retooling mario made an impatient gesture well get a loan right now youve got a million see how much of kubal associates you can buy correaos left the room without a word mario muttered to himself thinks im off my nut figures hell humor me all morning mario turned old files through his deskscreen trying to catch the thread of eberys business there was much evidence of eberys hasty plunderingthe cashing of bonds disposal of salable assets transference of the depreciation funds into his personal account but in spite of the pillaging ebery aircar seemed financially sound it held mortgages franchises contracts worth many times what cash ebery had managed to clear tiring of the files he ordered more coffee paced the floor his mind turned to seafoam place he thought of the accusing eyes of florence ebery the hostility of luther and ralston jr and mario wished ralston ebery a place in hell eberys family was no responsibility no concern of his he called florence ebery florence i wont be living at home any more he tried to speak kindly she said thats what i thought mario said hurriedly i think that by and large youd be better off with a divorce i wont contest it you can have as much money as you want she gave him a fathomless silent stare thats what i thought she said again the screen went dead correaos returned shortly after lunch it was warm correaos had walked the pedestrip his face shone with perspiration he flung a carved black plastic folder on the desk baring his teeth in a triumphant smile there it is i dont t know what you want with it but there it is fiftytwo percent of the stock i bought it off of old man kubals nephew and a couple of the associates got em at the right time they were glad to sell they dont like the way the business is going old man kubal gives all his time to the empyrean tower and hes not taking any fee for the work says the honor of the job is enough the nephew doesnt dare to fight it out with old man kubal but he sure was glad to sell out the same with kohn and cheever the associates the empyrean tower job doesnt even pay the office overhead uhm how old is kubal must be about eighty lively old boy full of vinegar honor of the job thought mario rubbish old kubals fee would be a young body aloud he said louis have you ever seen kubal no he hardly shows his face around the office he lines up the jobs the engineering is done in the office louis said mario heres what i want you to do record the stock in your own name give me an undated transfer which we wont record youll legally control the firm call the office get hold of the general manager tell him that youre sending me over im just a friend of yours you owe a favor to tell him that im to be given complete and final authority over any job i decide to work on get it correaos eyed mario as if he expected the fat body to explode into fire anything you like i suppose you know what youre doing mario grinned ruefully i cant think of anything else to do in the meantime bring out your new model youre in charge mario dressed ralston eberys body in modest blue reported to the office of kubal associates an entire floor in the rothenburg building he asked the receptionist for the manager and was shown in to a tall man in the early forties with a delicate lemonish face he had a freckled forehead thin sandy hair and he answered marios questions with sharpness and hostility my name is taussig no im just the office manager kohn ran the draughting room cheever the engineering theyre both out the office is a mess ive been here twelve years mario assured him that there was no intention of stepping in over him no mr taussig youre in charge i speak for the new control you handle the officegeneral routine all the new jobsjust as usual your title is general manager i want to work on the empyrean towerwithout any interference i wont bother you you wont bother me right after the empyrean tower i leave and the entire office is yours taussigs face unwound from around the lines of suspicion theres not much going on except the empyrean tower naturally thats a tremendous job in itself bigger than any one man mario remarked that he did not expect to draw up the entire job on his own bench and taussigs face tightened again at the implied sarcasm no said mario he merely would be the top ranking authority on the job subject only to the wishes of the builder one last thing said mario this talk weve had must be he tilted taussig a sidelong wink strictly confidential youll introduce me as a new employee thats all no word of the new control no word of his being a friend of mine forget it get me taussig agreed with sour dignity i want quiet said mario thoughtfully i want no contact with any of the principals the interviews with the press you handle those conferences with the builder changes modificationsyou attend to them im merely in the background just as you say said taussig chapter vii empyrean tower empyrean tower became as much a part of marios life as his breath his pulse twelve hours a day thirteen fourteen eberys fat body sat slumped at the long desk and eberys eyes burned and watered from poring through estimates details floor plans on the big screen four feet before his eyes flowed the work of twentyfour hundred draughtsmen eight hundred engineers artists decorators craftsmen without number everything subject to his approval but his influence was restrained nominal unnoticed only in a few details did mario interfere and then so carefully so subtly that the changes were unknown the new building techniques the control over material the exact casting of plancheen and allied substances prefabrication effortless transport of massive members made the erection of the empyrean tower magically easy and swift level by level it reached into the air growing like a macrocosmic bean sprout steel concrete plancheen floors and walls magnesium girders outriggers buttresses the new bubble glass for windowsassembled into precise units hoisted dropped into place from freight copters all day and all night the blue glare of the automatic welders burnt the sky and sparks spattered against the stars and every day the aspiring bulk pushed closer to the low clouds then through the low clouds up toward the upper levels sun at one stage rain far below up mile after mile into the regions of air where the wind always swept like cream undisturbed unalloyed with the warm fetor of earth mario was lost in the empyrean tower he knew the range of materials the glitter of a hundred metals the silky gloss of plancheen the color of the semiprecious minerals jade cinnabar malachite agate jet rare porphyries from under the antarctic ranges mario forgot himself forgot the chateau dlf forgot mervyn alien thane louis correaos and ebery aircar except for spasmodic disassociated spells when he tore himself away from the rothenburg building for a few hours and sometimes when he would be most engrossed he would find to his horror that his voice his disposition his mannerisms were not those of roland mario ralston eberys lifelong reflexes and habits were making themselves felt and roland mario felt a greater urgency build build build and nowhere did mario work more carefully than on the th levelthe topmost floor noted on the index as offices and living quarters for mervyn alien with the most intricate detail did mario plan the construction specifying speciallybuilt girders ventilating equipment all custommade to his own dimensions and so months in marios life changed their nature from future to past months during which he became almost accustomed to ralston eberys body on a tuesday night marios personality had been fitted into ralston eberys body wednesday morning he had come to his senses friday he was deep in concentration at the office of ebery aircar in the aetherian block and three oclock passed without his awareness friday evening he thought of the oxonian terrace his rendezvous with janniver breaugh the nameless spirit in the sick body named ditmar and the next tuesday at three mario was sitting at a table on the oxonian terrace twenty feet away sat janniver breaugh ditmar and mario thought back to the day only a few weeks ago when the five sat lackadaisically in the sun four innocents and one man eyeing them hungrily weighing the price their bodies would bring two of those bodies he had won and mario saw them sitting quietly in the warm sunlight talking slowlytwo of them at least peaceful and secure breaugh spoke with the customary cocksure tilt to his dark head janniver was slow and sober an odd chording of racial vibrants and there was ditmar a foreign soul looking sardonically from the lean darkbronze body a sick body that a man paying ten thousand dollars for adventure would consider a poor bargain ditmar had bought adventurean adventure in pain and fear for a moment marios flinty mood loosened enough to admit that his yearning for his old own life in his old body a man might easily forget decency fairness the drowning man strangles a wouldbe rescuer mario sipped beer indecisively should he join the three it could do no harm he was detained by a curious reluctance urgent almost a sense of shame to speak to these men tell them what their money had bought himmario felt the warm stickiness the internal crawling of extreme embarrassment at sudden thought mario scanned the nearby tables zaer he had almost forgotten pete zaer a millionaires mind lived in zaers body would zaers mind bring the millionaires body here mario saw an old man with hollow eyes alone at a nearby table mario stared watched his every move the old man lit a cigarette puffed flicked the matchone of zaers tricks the cigarette between his fingers he lifted his highball drank once twice put the cigarette in his mouth set the glass down zaers mannerism mario rose moved took a seat the old man looked up eagerly then angrily from dry redrimmed eyes the skin was a calcined yellow the mouth was gray zaer had bought even less for his money than mario is your name pete zaer asked mario in disguise the old mans mouth worked the eyes swam how why do you say that mario said look at the table who else is missing roland mario said the old man in a thin rasping voice the red eyes peered you thats right said mario with a sour grin in a week or two maybe therell be three of us maybe four he motioned look at them what are they shaking dice for weve got to stop them rasped zaer they dont know but he did not move nor did mario it was like trying to make himself step naked out upon a busy street something rigid surrounded took hold of marios brain he stood up you wait here he muttered ill try to put a stop to it he ambled across the sundrenched terrace to the table where janniver was rolling dice mario reached his hands down caught up the meaningful cubes janniver looked up with puzzled eyes breaugh bent his straight welsh eyebrows in the start of a temper ditmar frowning leaned back excuse me said mario may i ask what youre rolling for breaugh said a private matter it does not concern you does it concern the chateau dlf six eyes stared yes said breaugh after a second or two of hesitation mario said im a friend of roland marios i have a message from him what is it he said to stay away from the chateau dlf not to waste your money he said not to trust anyone who suggested for you to go there breaugh snorted nobodys suggesting anything to anybody and he says hell get in touch with you soon mario left without formality returned to where he had left zaer the old man with the hot red eyes was gone ralston ebery had many enemies so mario found there were a large number of acquaintances no friends and there was one whitefaced creature that seemed to live only to waylay him hiss vileness that was letya arnold a former employee in the research laboratories mario ignored the first and second meetings and on the third he told the man to keep out of ms way next time ill call the police filthtub gloated arnold you wouldnt dare the publicity would ruin you and you know it you know it mario inspected the man curiously he was clearly ill his breath reeked of internal decay under a loose graybrown jacket his chest was concave his shoulders pushed forward like doorknobs his eyes were a curious shiny black so black that the pupils were indistinguishable from the iris and the eyes looked like big black olives pressed into two bowls of sour milk theres a patrolman now said arnold call him mucknose call him quickly mario turned walked away and arnolds laughter rang against his back mario asked louis correaos about letya arnold why wouldnt i dare have him arrested and correaos turned on him one of his long quizzical stares dont you know mario remembered that correaos thought he was ebery he rubbed his forehead im forgetful louis tell me about letya arnold he worked in the radiation lab figured out some sort of process that saved fuel we naturally had a legal right to the patent correaos smiled sardonically naturally we didnt use the process since you owned stock in world airpower and a big block of lamarr atomics arnold began unauthorized use we took it to court won recovered damages it put arnold into debt and he hasnt been worth anything since mario said with sudden energy let me see that patent louis correaos spoke into the mesh and a minute later a sealed envelope fell out of the slot into the catchall correaos said idly myself i think arnold was either crazy or a fake the idea he had couldnt work like perpetual motion letya arnold had written a short preface to the body of the paper this latter a mass of circuits and symbols unintelligible to mario the preface read efficiency in propulsion is attained by expelling ever smaller masses at ever higher velocities the limit in the first case is the electron expelling it at speeds approaching that of light we find that its mass increases by the wellknown effect this property provides us a perfect propulsive method capable of freeing flight from its dependence upon heavy loads of material to be ejected at relatively slow velocities one electron magnetically repelled at nearlight speeds exerts as much forward recoil as many pounds of conventional fuel mario knew where to find letya arnold the man sat brooding day after day in tanagra square on a bench beside the centennial pavilion mario stopped in front of him a youngold man with a hysterical face arnold looked up arose eagerly almost as if he would assault mario physically mario in a calm voice said arnold pay attention a minute youre right im wrong arnolds face hung slack as a limp bladder attack needs resistance on which to harden itself feebly his fury asserted itself he reeled off his nowfamiliar invective mario listened a minute arnold the process you inventedhave you ever tested it in practice of course you swine naturally of course what do you take me for one of your blowhard callboys it works you say now listen arnold were working on a new theory at ebery aircar were planning to put out value at low cost id like to build your process into the new model if it actually does what you say and id like to have you come back to work for us letya arnold snorted his whole face a gigantic sneer put that propulsion into an airboat pah use a dropforge to kill a flea wheres your head wheres your head its spacedrive thats where were going space it was marios turn to be taken aback space will it work in space he asked weakly work its just the thing you took all my moneyyou the words were like skewers dripping an acrid poison if i had my money now patent or no patent id be out in space id be ducking around alpha centauri sinus vega capella the man was more than halfmad thought mario he said you cant go faster than light letya arnolds voice became calm crafty who said i cant you dont know the things i know swineslut mario said no i dont but all that aside im a changed man arnold i want you to forget any injustice i may have done you i want you back at work for ebery aircar id like you to adapt the drive for public use again arnold sneered and kill everything that happened to be behind you every electron shot from the reactor would be like a meteor thered be blasts of incandescent air impact like a cannonball no nospace thats where the drive must go youre hired if you want to be said mario patiently the laboratorys waiting for you i want you to work on that adaptation there must be some kind of shield noting the taut clamp to arnolds mouth he said hastily if you think you can go faster than light fine build a ship for space and ill test fly it myself but put in your major effort on the adaptation for public use thats all i ask arnold cooler by the minute now exhibited the same kind of sardonic unbelief mario had noticed in correaos blow me but youve changed your tune ebery before it was money money money if it didnt make you money plow it under what happened to you the chateau dlf said mario if you value your sanity dont go there though god knows and he looked at arnolds wasted body you couldnt do much worse for yourself than youve already done if it changes me as much as its changed you im giving it a wide berth blow me but youre almost human im a changed man said mario now go to correaos get an advance go to a doctor on his way to the rothenburg building and kubal associates it came to him to wonder how ebery was using his body in his office he ran down a list of detective agencies settled on brannan investigators called them put them to work chapter vii inventor with a grudge investigator murris slade the detective was a short thickset man with a narrow head two days after mario had called the brannan agency he knocked at marios workroom at kubal associates mario looked through the wicket in the locked door admitted the detective who said without preamble ive found your man good said mario returning to his seat whats he doing slade said in a quiet accentless voice theres no mystery or secrecy involved he seems to have changed his way of living in the last few months i understand he was quite a chap pretty wellliked nothing much to set him apart one of the idle rich now hes a hellraiser a womanchaser and hes been thrown out of every bar in town my poor body thought mario aloud wheres he living hes got an apartment at the atlanticempire fairly plush place its a mystery where he gets his money the atlanticempire seemed to have become a regular rendezvous for chateau dlf alumni thought mario he said i want a weekly report on this man nothing complicatedjust a summary of where he spends his time now ive got another job for you the detective reported on the second job a week later mervyn alien is an alias the man was born lloyd paren in vienna the woman is his sister thane paren originally he was a photographers model something of a playboyup until a few years ago then he came into a great deal of money now as you probably know he runs the chateau dlf i cant get anything on that theres rumors but anybody that knows anything wont talk the rumors are not in accord with parens background which is out in the open no medical or psychosomatic training the woman was originally a music student a specialist in primitive music when paren left vienna she came with him paren lives at exmoor avenuethats the chateau dlf thane paren lives in a little apartment about a block away with an old man no relative neither one seems to have any intimate friends and theres no entertaining no parties not much to go on mario reflected a few moments somberly gazing out the window while munis slade sat impassively waiting for marios instructions at last mario said keep at it get some more on the old man thane paren lives with one day correaos called mario on the telescreen weve got the new model blocked out he was halfplacating halfchallenging daring mario to disapprove of his work i think weve done a good job said correaos you wanted to give it a final check ill be right over said mario the new model had been built by hand at the donnic river plant and flown into lanchester under camouflage correaos managed the showing as if mario were a buyer in whom he was trying to whip up enthusiasm the idea of this modelive tentatively called it the airfarerwas to use materials which were plain and cheap dispense with all unnecessary ornamentwhich in my opinion has been the bane of the ebery aircar weve put the savings into clean engineering lots of room safety notice the lift vanes theyre recessed almost out of reach no drunk is going to walk into them those pulsors theyre high and the deflection jets are out of reach the frame and fuselage are solid cast plancheen first job like this in the business mario listened nodded appreciatively from time to time apparently correaos had done a good job he asked how about whatshisnamearnold has he come up with anything useful correaos bared his teeth clicked his tongue that mans crazy hes a walking corpse all he thinks all he talks are his pestiferous electrons what he calls a blast effect i saw a demonstration and i think hes right we cant use it in a family vehicle whats the jet look like correaos shrugged nothing much a generatorcentaurium powereda miniature synchrotron very simple he feeds a single electron into the tube accelerates it to the nearlight speed and it comes roaring out in a gush as thick as your arm mario frowned try to steer him back onto something useful hes got the brains has he been to a doctor just stapp the insurance doctor stapp says its a wonder hes alive now galloping nephritis or necrosissome such thing correaos spoke without interest his eyes never left his new airfarer he said with more life in his voice look into the interior notice the wide angle of vision also the modulating glare filter look right up into the sun all you want notice the altimeter its got a positive channel indicator that you can set for any given locality then the pressurizer its built in under the rear seatsee itsaves about twenty dollars a unit over the old system instead of upholstery ive had the framework machined smooth and sprayed it with sprinjufloss youve done a good job louis said mario go ahead with it correaos took a deep breath released it shook his head ill be dyeddoubleandthrottled whats the trouble i dont get you at all said correaos staring at mario as if he were a stranger if i didnt know you stem to stern id say you were a different man three months ago if id tried to put something cleanly designed in front of you youd have gone off like one of arnolds electrons youd have called this job a flying breadbox youd have draped angelswings all over the outside streamlined the dashboard fixtures built in two or three louis fifteenth book cases i dont know whatall if you didnt look so healthy id say you were sick mario said with an air of sage deliberation ebery aircar has taken a lot of money out of the public the old ebery managed to keep itself in the air but it cost a lot and looked like a pagoda on wings now well start giving em quality maybe theyll turn it down correaos laughed exultantly if we cant sell ten million of these ill run one up as high as shell go and jump better start selling then i hope you dont have a relapse said correaos and order a lot of fancy fittings no said mario mildly shell go out just as she is so long as i have anything to say about it correaos slapped the hull of the airfarer approvingly turned a quizzical face to mario your wife has been trying to get in touch with you i told her i didnt know where you were youd better call herif you want to stay married she was talking about divorce mario looked off into the distance uncomfortably aware of correaoss scrutiny i told her to go ahead with it its the best thing for everybody concerned fairest for her at any rate correaos shook his head youre a funny fellow ebery a year ago youd have fired me a dozen times over maybe im getting you fat for the slaughter suggested mario maybe said correaos letya arnold and i can go into business making electron elephant guns two hundred thousand artisans swarmed over the tower painting plastering spraying fitting in pipes wires pouring terazzo concrete plancheen installing cabinets a thousand kinds of equipment walls were finished with panels of waxed and polished woods the myriad pools were tiled the gardeners landscaped the hanging parks the great green bowers in the clouds every week mervyn alien conferred with taussig and old man kubal approving modifying altering canceling expanding from recorded copies of the interviews mario worked making the changes alien desired meshing them carefully into his own designs months passed now mervyn alien might not have recognized this man as ralston ebery at the ebery aircar office in the aetherian block his employees were astounded respectful it was a new ralston eberythough to be sure they noticed the old gestures the tricks of speech habits of walking dressing involuntary expressions this new ralston ebery had sloughed away fifty pounds of oil and loose flesh the sun had tinted the white skin to a baby pink the eyes once puffy now shone out of meaty cheeks the leg muscles were tough with much walking the chest was deeper the lungs stronger from the halfhour of swimming every afternoon at four oclock and at last the two hundred thousand artisans packed their tools collected their checks maintenance men came on the job laborers swept scrubbed polished the empyrean tower was completea solidified dream a wonder of the world a building rising like a pine tree supple and massive overbounding the minuscule streets and squares below an edifice not intended for grace yet achieving grace through its secure footing its incalculable tapers setbacks thousand terraces thousand taxiplats million windows the empyrean tower was completed mervyn alien moved in on a quiet midnight and the next day the chateau dlf at exmoor avenue meadowlands was vacant for sale or for lease the chateau dlf was now level empyrean tower and roland mario ached with eagerness anxiety a hot gladness intense to the point of lust he was slowly cleaning off his desk when taussig poked his head into the office well what are you planning to do now mario inspected taussigs curious face any more big jobs nope and not likely to be at least not through old man kubal how come has he retired retired shucks no hes gone crazy schizo mario drummed his fingers on his desk when did all this happen just yesterday seems like finishing the empyrean was too much for him a cop found him in tanagra square talking to himself took him home doesnt know his nephew doesnt know his housekeeper keeps saying his name is bray something like that bray mario rose to his feet his forehead knotting breaugh sounds like senile decay he said abstractedly thats right taussig responded still fixing mario with bright curious eyes so what are you going to do now i quit said mario with an exaggerated sweep of the arm im done im like old man kubal the empyrean towers too much for me ive got senile decay take a good look taussig youll never see me again he closed the door in taussigs slack face he stepped into the elevator dropped to the second level hopped the highspeed strip to his small apartment at melbourne house he thumbed the lock the scanner recognized his prints the door slid back mario entered closed the door he undressed eberys gross body wrapped it in a robe sank with a grunt into a chair beside a big low table the table held a complex model built of wood metal plastic varicolored threads it represented level empyrean towerthe chateau dlf mario knew it by heart every detail of an area a sixth of a mile square was pressed into his brain presently mario dressed again in coveralls of hard gray twill he loaded his pockets with various tools and equipment picked up his handbag he looked at himself in the mirror at the face that was ebery and yet not quite ebery the torpid glaze had left the eyes the lips were no longer puffy the jowls had pulled up his face was a meaty slab thoughtfully mario pulled a cap over his forehead surveyed the effect the man was unrecognizable he attached a natty wisp of mustache ralston ebery no longer existed mario left the apartment he hailed a cab flew out to meadowlands the empyrean tower reared over the city like a fence post standing over a field of cabbages an aircraft beacon scattered red rays from a necktwisting height a million lights from nine hundred levels glowed blended into a rich milky shimmer a city in itself where two million three million men and women might live their lives out if they so wished it was a monument to the boredom of one man a man sated with life the most magnificent edifice ever built and built for the least consequential of motives that ever caused one rock to be set on another the empyrean tower built from the conglomerate resources of the planets richest wealth was a gigantic toy a titillation a fancy but who would know this the st level housed the finest hospital in the world the staff read like the medical associations list of yearly honors level held an early cretaceous swampforest fullscale dinosaurs cropped at archaic vegetation pterodactyls slipped by on invisible guides the air held the savage stench of swamp black ooze rotting mussels carrion level enclosed the first human city eridu of sumer complete with its thirtyfoot brick walls the ziggurat temple to enlil the earth god the palace of the king the mud huts of the peasants level was a mycenaean island lapped by blue salt water a minoan temple in an olive grove crowned the height and a highbeaked galley floated on the water with sunlight sparkling from bronze shields glowing from the purple sail level was a landscape from an imaginary fantastic world created by mysticartist dyer lothaire and level was a private fairyland closed to the public a magic garden inhabited by furtive nymphs there were levels for business offices for dwellings for laboratories the fourth level enclosed the worlds largest stadium levels through housed the university of the world and the initial enrollment was fortytwo thousand was the worlds vastest library a vast art gallery there were showrooms retail stores restaurants quiet taverns theaters telecast studiosa complex of the world society caught pillared up into the air at the whim of mervyn alien humanitys lust for lost youth had paid for it mervyn alien sold a commodity beside which every ounce of gold ever mined every prized possession every ambition and goal were like nothing eternal life replenished youthlove loyalty decency honor found them unfair overstrong antagonists chapter ix eyes in the wall briskly mario alighted from the aircab at the public stage on the nd level the coordination center of the tower among the crowds of visitors tenants employees he was inconspicuous he stepped on a pedestrip to the central shaft stepped off at the express elevator to level he entered one of the little cars the door snapped shut he felt the surge of acceleration and almost at once the nearweightlessness of the slowing the door flicked open he stepped out on level two miles in the air he was in the lobby of the paradise inn beside which the atlanticempire lobby was mean and constricted he moved among exquisitely dressed men and women persons of wealth dignity power mario was inconspicuous he might have been a janitor or a maintenance electrician he walked quietly down a corridor stopped at last by a door marked private he thumbed the lock it opened into a janitors closet but the janitors for the th level all had other storerooms no other thumb would spring this lock in case an officious floormanager forced the door it was merely another janitors closet lost in the confusion but it was a very special closet at the back wall mario pushed at a widely separated pair of studs and the wall fell aside mario entered a dark crevice pushed the wall back into place now he was alonemore alone than if he were in the middle of the sahara out in the desert a passing aircraft might spy him here in the dead spaces alongside the master columns among elevator shafts he was lost from every eye if he died no one would find him in the far far future when the empyrean tower was at last pulled down his skeleton might be exposed until then he had vanished from the knowledge of man he shone his flashlight ahead of him turned to the central spinal cord of elevator shafts tubes like fibers in a tremendous vegetable here he found his private elevator lost among the others like a man in a crowd the mechanics who installed it could not recognize its furtive purpose it was a job from a blueprint part of the days work quickly forgotten to mario it was a link to level the chateau dlf he stepped on the tiny platform the door snapped up he was thrown up a mile the car halted he stepped out he was in the chateau dlfinvisible a ghost unseen unheard power was his he could strike from nothingness unsuspected unimagined master of the master of the chateau dlf he breathed the air exultant thrilling to his power this was the ultimate height of his life he snapped on his torch though there was no need he knew these passages as if he had been born among them the light was a symbol of his absolute authority he had no need for skulking he was in his private retreat secure isolated remote mario halted glanced at the wall at eightfoot intervals circles of fluorescent paint gleamed brightly behind this wall would be the grand foyer to the chateau dlf mario advanced to one of the fluorescent circles these he himself had painted to mark the location of his spy cells these were little dull spots hardly bigger than the head of a pin invisible at three feet mario in the guise of an electrician had installed them himself with a pair at every location for binocular vision from his pouch he brought a pair of goggles clipped a wire to the terminal contacts of the spy cells fitted the goggles over his eyes now he saw the interior of the foyer as clearly as if he were looking through a door it was the height of a receptiona housewarming party at the chateau dlf men old young distinguished or handsome or merely veneered with the glow of success women at once serene and arrogant the style and show of the planet mario saw jewels gold the shine and swing of thousandcolored fabrics and at eyelevel the peculiar whitebronzebrownblack mixture the color of many heads many facescrowdcolor mario recognized some of these people faces and names worldknown artists administrators engineers bonvivants courtesans philosophers all thronging the lobby of the chateau dlf drawn by the ineffable lure of the unknown the exciting the notorious there was mervyn alien wearing black he was as handsome as a primeval sunhero tall confident easy in his manner but humble and carefully graceful combining the offices of proprietor and host thane paren was nowhere in sight mario moved on as at exmoor he found a room drenched with amberwhite light golden crisp as celery where the broadleafed plants grew as ardently as in their native humus the herbarium was empty the plants suspired numbing perfume for their own delectation mario passed on he looked into a room bare and undecorated a workshop a processing plant a number of rubberwheeled tables were docked against a wall each with its frock of white cloth a balcony across the room supported an intricate mesh of machinery black curving arms shiny metal glass below hung a pair of translucent balls the pallid blue color of roquefort cheese mario looked closely these were the golasma cellules no one occupied the chamber except a still form on one of the stretchers the face was partly visible mario suddenly attentive shifted his vantage point he saw a heavy blond head rugged blunt features he moved to another cell he was right it was janniver already drugged ready for the transposition mario gave a long heavy suspiration that shook eberys paunch ditmar had made it zaer mario breaugh and now janniver lured into this room like sheep the judasgoat conducts to the abbatoir mario bared his teeth in a grimace that was not a smile a tide of dark rage rose in his mind he calmed himself the grimace softened into the normal loose lines of eberys face who was blameless after all thane paren no she served mervyn alien the soul in her brothers body he himself roland mario he might have killed mervyn alien he might have halted the work of the chateau dlf by crying loudly enough to the right authorities he had refrained from fear of losing his body pete zaer he might have kept to the spirit of his bargain warned his friends on the oxonian terrace all the other victims who had similarly restrained their rage and sense of obligation to their fellowmen no ditmar was simply a human being as weak and selfish as any other and his sins were those of commission rather than those of omission which characterized the others mario wandered on peering in apartment chamber and hall a blonde girl young and sweet as an appalachian gillyflower swam nude in aliens long greenglass pool then sat on the edge amid a cloud of silver bubbles mario cursed the lascivious responses of eberys body passed on nowhere did he see thane paren he returned to the reception hall the party was breaking up with mervyn alien bowing his guests out men and women flushed with his food and drink all cordial all promising themselves to renew the acquaintance on a later less conspicuous occasion mario watched till the last had leftthe last but one this an incredibly tall thin old man dressed like a fop in pearlgray and white his wrists were like cornstalks his head was all skull he leaned across mervyn aliens shoulder a roguish perfumed old dandy waxed rouged pomaded now alien made a polite inquiry and the old man nodded beamed alien ushered him into a small side room an office painted dark gray and green the old man sat down wrote a check alien dropped it into the telescreen slot and the two waited making small talk the old man seemed to be pressing for information while alien gracefully brushed him aside the television flickered flashed an acknowledgment from the bank alien rose to his feet the old man arose alien took a deep breath they stepped into the herbarium the old man took three steps tottered alien caught him deftly laid him on a concealed rubbertired couch wheeled him forward out into the laboratory where janniver lay aready now mario watched with the most careful of eyes and into a socket in his goggles he plugged another cord leading to a camera in his pouch everything he saw would be recorded permanently there was little to see alien wheeled janniver under one of the wheycolored golasma cellules the old man under another he turned a dial kicked at a pedal flicked a switch stood back the entire balcony lowered the cellules engulfed the two heads pulsed changed shape there was motion on the balcony wheels turning the glow of luminescence the operation appeared selfcontained automatic alien seated himself lit a cigarette yawned five minutes passed the balcony rose the golasma cellules swung on an axis the balcony lowered another five minutes passed the balcony raised alien stepped forward threw off the switches alien gave each body an injection from the same hypodermic rolled the couches into an adjoining room departed without a backward glance toward the swimming pool thought mario let him go at nine oclock in tanagra square a cab dropped off a feeble lackluster old man tall and thin as a slat who immediately sought a bench mario waited till the old man showed signs of awareness watched the dawning alarm the frenzied examination of emaciated hands the realization of fifty stolen years mario approached led the old man to a cab took him to his apartment the morning was a terrible one janniver was asleep exhausted from terror grief hate for his creaking old body mario called the brannan agency asked for murris slade the short heavy man with the narrow head appeared on the screen gazed through the layers of ground glass at mario hello slade said mario theres a job i want done tonight slade looked at him with a steady wary eye does it get me in trouble no whats the job this man youve been watching for me roland mario do you know where to find him hes at the persian terrace having breakfast with the girl he spent the night with her name is laura lingtza shes a dancer at the vedanta epic theater never mind about that get a piece of paper copy what im going to dictate go

alien chateau dlf mario waited a moment till slade looked up from his writing type that out he said hand it to roland mario at about ninethirty tonight chapter x new bodies for old restlessly mario paced the floor pudgy hands clasped behind his back tonight would see the fruit of a years racking toil with brain and imagination tonight with luck he would shed the hateful identity of ralston ebery he thought of louis correaos poor louis and mario shook his head what would happen to louis airfarer and letya arnold would he go back out into tanagra square to lurk and hiss as ralston ebery sauntered pompously past he called the aetherian block got put through to louis correaos hows everything louis going great were all tooled up be producing next week hows arnold correaos screwed up his face ebery youll think im as crazy as arnold but he can fly faster than light what last thursday night he wandered into the office he acted mysterious told me to follow him i went he took me up to his observatoryjust a window at the sky where hes got a little proton magniscope he focused it told me to look i looked saw a diska dull dark disk about as large as a full moon pluto said arnold in about ten minutes therell be a little white flash on the lefthand side how do you know i set off a flare a little over six hours ago the light should be reaching there about now i gave him a queer look but i kept my eye glued on the image and sure enoughthere it was a little spatter of white light now watch he says therell be a red one and hes right theres a red light correaos shook his big sandy head ebery im convinced hes got me believing him mario said in a toneless voice put him on louis if you can find him after a minute or so letya arnolds peaked face peered out of the screen mario said leadenly is this true arnold that youre flying faster than light arnold said peevishly of course its true why shouldnt it be true how did you do it just hooked a couple of electronpushers on to one of your highaltitude aircars nothing else i just turned on the juice the hookup breaks blazing fury out of the universe theres no acceleration no momentum nothing just speed speed speed speed puts the stars within a few days run ive always told you and you said i was crazy his face wrenched gall burnt at his tongue ill never see them ebery and youre to blame im a dead man i saw pluto i wrote my name on the ice and thats how ill be known he vanished from the screen correaos returned hes a goner said correaos gruffly he had a hemorrhage last night therell be just one morehis last mario said in a far voice take care of him louis because tomorrow im afraid maybe things will be different what do you meandifferent ralston eberys disposition might suffer a relapse god forbid mario broke the connection went back to his pacing but now he paced slower and his eyes saw nothing of where he walked mario called a bellboy see that young man in the tan jacket by the cambodian pillar yes sir give him this note yes sir ralston ebery had put loose flesh on marios body pouches hung under the eyes the mouth was loose wet mario sweated in a sudden heat of pure anger the swine debauching a sound body unused to the filth eberys brain would invent ebery read the note looked up and down the lobby mario had already gone ebery following the instructions turned down the corridor toward the airbaths moving slowly indecisively he came to a door marked private which stood ajar he knocked alien are you there whats this all about come in said mario ebery cautiously shoved his head through the door mario yanked him forward slapped a handhypo at eberys neck ebery struggled kicked quivered relaxed mario shut the door get up said mario ebery rose to his feet docile glassyeyed mario took him through the back door up in the elevator up to level the chateau dlf sit down dont move said mario ebery sat like a barnacle mario made a careful reconnaissance this time of night mervyn alien should be through for the day alien was just finishing a transposition mario watched as he pushed the two recumbent forms into the outer waiting room and then he trailed alien to his living quarters watched while he shed his clothes jumped into a silk jerkin ready for relaxation or sport with his flowerpretty blonde girl the coast was clear mario returned to where ebery sat stand up and follow me back down the secret corridors inside the ventilation ducts and now the laboratory was empty mario lifted a hasp pulled back one of the pressedwood wall panels go in he said lie down on that couch ebery obeyed mario wheeled him across the room to the racked puttycolored brainmolds wheeled over another couch for himself he held his mind in a rigid channel letting himself think of nothing but the transposition he set the dials kicked in the foot pedal as alien had done now to climb on the couch push one more button he stood looking at the recumbent figure now was the time act it was easy just climb on the couch reach up push a button but mario stood looking swaying slightly back and forth a slight sound behind him he whirled thane paren watched him with detached amusement she made no move to come forward to flee to shout for help she watched with an expressionquizzical unhuman mario wondered how can beauty be refined to such reckless heights and still be so cold and friendless if she were wounded would she bleed now at this moment would she run give the alarm if she moved he would kill her go ahead said thane whats stopping you i wont interfere mario had known this somehow he turned looked down at his flaccid body he frowned dont like its looks asked thane its not how you remember yourself youre all alike strutting boastful animals no said mario slowly i thought all i lived for was to get back my body now i dont know i dont think i want it im ebery the industrialist hes mario the playboy ah said thane raising her luminous eyebrows you like the money the power mario laughed a faint hurt laugh youve been with those ideas too long theyve gone to your head theres other things the stars to explore the galaxya meadow of magnificent jewels as ebery i can leave for the stars next week as mario i go back to the oxonian terrace play handball she took a step forward are you he said just this last week a physicist burst through whatever the bindings are that are holding things in he made it to pluto in fifteen minutes ebery wouldnt listen to him hes so close to dead right now you couldnt tell the difference ebery would say hes crazy jerk the whole project because theres no evidence other than the word of two men so asked thane what will you do i want my body said mario slowly i hate this pigs carcass worse than i hate death but more than that i want to go to the stars she came forward a little her eyes shone like vega and spica on a warm summer night how could he have ever thought her cold she was quick hot fullbursting with verve passion imagination i want to go too where is this everybody wants to go said a light baritone voice easy on the surface yet full of a furious undercurrent mervyn alien was swiftly crossing the room he swung his great athletes arms loose from the shoulder clenching and unclenching his hands where do you want to go he addressed mario hell is it hell it shall be he rammed his fist forward mario lumbered back then forward again eberys body was not a fighting machine it was pulpy pearshaped and in spite of marios ascetic life the paunch still gurgled swung to and fro like a wet sponge but he fought he fought with a red ferocity that matched aliens strength and speed for a halfminute and then his legs were like columns of pith his arms could not seem to move he saw alien stepping forward swinging a tremendous massive blow that would crush his jaw like a cardboard box jar out shiver his teeth crack alien screamed a wavering falsetto screech sagged fell with a gradual slumping motion thane stood looking at the body holding a pistol thats your brother gasped mario more terrified by thanes expression than by the fight for life with alien its my brothers body my brother died this morning early at sunrise alien had promised he wouldnt let him die that he would give him a body and my brother died this morning she looked down at the hulk when he was young he was so fine now his brain is dead and his body is dead she laid the gun on a table but ive known it would come im sick of it no more now we shall go to the stars you and i if youll take me what do i care if your body is gross your brain is you alien is dead said mario as if in a dream there is no one to interfere the chateau dlf is ours she looked at him doubtfully lip halfcurled so where is the telescreen the room suddenly seemed full of people mario became aware of the fact with surprise he had noticed nothing he had been busy now he was finished sitting anesthetized side by side were four old men staring into space with eyes that later would know the sick anguish of youth and life within reach and lost standing across the room pale nervous quiet stood zaer breaugh janniver and ralston eberys body but the body spoke with the fast rush of thought that was letya arnolds and in letya arnolds wasted body not now conscious dwelt the mind of ralston ebery mario walked in his own body testing the floor with his own feet swinging his arms feeling his face thane paren stood watching him with intent eyes as if she were seeing light form color for the first time as if roland mario were the only thing that life could possibly hold for her no one else was in the room murris slade who had lured bribed threatened frightened those now in the room to the chateau dlf had not come farther than the foyer mario addressed janniver zaer breaugh you three then you will take the responsibility they turned on him their wide amazed eyes still not fully recovered from the relief the joy of their own lives yes yes some of the transpositions are beyond help some are dead or crazy there is no help for them but those whom you can return to their own bodiesto them is your responsibility we break the cursed machine into the smallest pieces possible said breaugh and the chateau dlf is only something for whispering something for old men to dream about mario smiled remember the advertisement jaded bored try the chateau dlf i am no longer jaded no longer bored sighed zaer we got our moneys worth said janniver wryly mario frowned wheres ditmar thane said he has an appointment for ten oclock tomorrow morning he comes for the new body he has earned breaugh said with quiet satisfaction we shall be here to meet him he will be surprised said janniver why not asked zaer after all this is the chateau dlf
