work on my own as a private eye my office is on the west side of los angeles on the fourth floor of a high building there are only two rooms in my office the outer room and the inner room the outer room is the waitingroom there are four chairs in the waitingroom although there are never four people waiting to see me in fact there is usually no one at all waiting to see me in the inner room theres a cheap wooden desk theres a big wooden chair for me to sit on and on the opposite side of the desk theres a low metal chair for my visitors the rest of the furniture in my office consists of a large empty metal cupboard and a low bed in one corner when there is a lot of work i sometimes sleep in the office the notice outside my door says l samuel private detective thats me im quite tall nearly two metres and i weigh eighty kilos a lot of men say that im ugly but women seem to find me attractive ive got brown eyes brown hair and very nice teeth i had a good nose too until someone broke it in a fight last year recently i havent been very busy in fact ive had very little to do however i did have some work last month it all started late one afternoon when i was sitting in my office i had just finished cutting my nails and i was about to clean them suddenly i heard someone walk into the outer room i always leave the door of the outer room open in case anyone wants to come in and see me when i heard the footsteps in the outer room i wasnt very surprised i thought that someone had made a mistake and come into the wrong office it was probably someone looking for the doctor next door but a moment later there was a very quiet knock on the door of the inner room come in i shouted and put away the scissors i had been cutting my nails with the door opened and in walked one of the most beautiful women i had ever seen she was about eighteen years old with blue eyes and long blonde hair she was wearing a smart green coat and had a big brown handbag over her shoulder excuse me said the girl im looking for mr samuel im samuel i said with a quick smile come in and sit down the girl didnt smile back at me no i wont sit down she said well if you wont sit down at least come in and close the door i replied the girl came in walked over and put her handbag on my desk now i said what can i do for you i need help said the girl slowly but i dont know if you will

nervous and was starting to cry no i havent told the police she said i dont want any trouble with the police i just want you to help find my sister she took a small pink handkerchief out of her handbag and dried her eyes all right i said tell me all about your sister her name is elaine garfield said the girl and whats your name i interrupted helen helen garfield she replied my sister disappeared a week ago we had arranged to have dinner together last monday night but she didnt come perhaps your sister didnt come because she doesnt like the food you cook i suggested dont try to be funny i flew all the way from new york to see her last monday she said angrily oh so you dont live in los angeles then i said no she replied quickly i live in new york i flew right across america to see my sister but when i got here i discovered that she had disappeared how do you know she has disappeared i asked perhaps your sister just forgot about the dinner the blonde girl took a deep breath look she said let me finish my story if you dont stop asking questions ill find myself another detective right i said im listening i waited for my sister last monday evening in my hotel said the girl but she didnt come i telephoned her but there was no answer so the next morning i went to the office where she worked at her office they said that she had been to work the day before on the monday they also told me that shed left suddenly in the middle of the afternoon without telling anyone after that i went round to her flat but there was no one there the girl stopped for a minute and then continued mr samuel she said im very worried about my sister its not usual for her to disappear suddenly like this im sure that shes in danger and i want you to find her all right i said it may be easy or it may be difficult but ill find her but first tell me why youve waited six days before coming to me thats none of your business the girl said ok i replied your sisters name is elaine garfield what does she look like oh thats easy helen garfield replied she looks like me were twins now mr samuel how much money do you charge fifty dollars a day i said very well mr samuel said the girl but fifty dollars a day is a lot of money i hope that you will work hard for it oh yes i replied with a smile ill work very hard now give me the address of your sisters flat and the name of the office where she works ill start work at once the blonde girl wrote the addresses on a piece of paper and gave me the paper one more thing i said can you give me your address too that wont be necessary she replied as she picked up her handbag ill come and see you again tomorrow afternoon at five oclock goodbye mr samuel without waiting for an answer the girl turned around and walked out of the office as i watched her walk out of my office i smiled to myself this is better than cleaning my nails i thought then i began my work chapter three the manson building after the blonde girl had left my office i looked at the two addresses which she had written on the piece of paper the first was elaine garfield apartment manson building sunset place the second address was myer and myer attorneys titleinsurance building putting the paper in my pocket i got up and walked towards the door then i stopped and went back to my desk i opened the top lefthand drawer and took out my gun a smith and wesson then i put the gun back in the drawer i decided that it was safer to leave it behind its easy to get shot if youre carrying a gun i ran down the stairs all four floors and out into the street my old grey chrysler was outside so i jumped in and drove off fast towards sunset place the manson building was a tall ugly block of apartments i parked the chrysler outside and walked towards the big glass front doors hey mister a voice said i continued walking hey mister said the voice again you cant leave your car there i stopped and turned around a man in a grey uniform was standing by the chrysler hey mister the man repeated you cant park your car here why not i asked because only people who live in the manson building can park here he replied so i said how do you know that i dont live in the manson building because im the porter the man replied i work in the entrance of the building and let people in and out of the door i know everybody here right i said then please let me in the porter and i walked up to the big glass front doors and he let me in who do you want to see the porter asked miss elaine garfield i said she lives in apartment im sorry the porter replied miss garfield is out when did she go out i asked trying not to look interested mind your own business said the porter im not going to tell you and im not going to let you go up to miss garfields apartment when shes not there why dont you go for a walk i said to the porter and put five dollars in his hand i gave the porter the money to make him go away the porter shook his head no he said i gave the porter five dollars more now go for a long walk i said the porter went out into the street and i went up to apartment miss elaine garfields apartment chapter four a very tidy apartment i rang the bell beside the door of apartment and waited there was no answer i rang again but there was still no answer then i took a small square piece of plastic out of my pocket i looked around i was alone i pushed the piece of plastic into the space between the door and the door frame and moved the plastic up and down in a minute the door opened and i went into the flat i stood still and listened there was silence i switched on the light and looked around it was a modern apartment i was standing in the livingroom through an open door on my left i could see the bedroom which was very neat and tidy i looked in the wardrobe it was almost empty thats funny i thought people who disappear dont usually take most of their clothes with them they only take their clothes if theyve been planning their disappearance for a long time i walked back into the livingroom and searched it carefully but i found nothing to explain elaine garfields disappearance then i went into the kitchen the kitchen was also very clean and tidy there were no dirty plates or cups there was no old milk in the refrigerator everything was in its place well i thought theres only the bathroom left to search now the bathroom too was empty and clean i walked quickly around the flat making sure that i hadnt forgotten anything i wiped everything i had touched with my handkerchief because i didnt want to leave any fingerprints then i switched off the lights and opened the door to leave but i didnt leave there were two men standing outside the door one of them was short and had red hair and a nasty smile the other was quite tall and was wearing a hat pulled down over his face the one with the hat was holding a gun and the gun was pointing at me i tried to close the door but the redhaired man put his foot out to stop the door closing i let go of the door the door opened and both the men came in the one with the hat was in front and he was still carrying the gun hold your hands up in the air said the man with the gun then he turned to the redhaired man see if hes got a gun on him jo jo the redhaired man came over towards me i waited when jo was between me and the man with the gun i jumped i jumped forward and caught jo around the neck i held him in front of me the man with the gun couldnt shoot because he would hit his friend right i said to the man with the gun get out of the way im leaving now and im taking your friend with me holding jo in front of me i walked slowly towards the man with the gun then something went wrong with my plan the man with the gun started to laugh he put the gun back in his pocket and stood laughing why are you laughing i asked im laughing because youre so stupid the man with the gun said and walked up to me stop i said or else ill what will you do asked the man with the gun you cant do anything im the one with the gun as he said this the man leant forward he pulled jo out of my hands and hit me in the face i must say that i wasnt expecting to be hit in the face it hurt it hurt even more when he hit me again and i fell on the floor i lay still on the floor hoping that the two men would go away but they didnt go away instead they picked me up and hit me hard on the head everything went black i lay on the floor i was unconscious chapter five myer and myer i woke up with a terrible pain in my head i was lying on the floor outside the front door of miss elaine garfields apartment i looked around the man with the gun and his redhaired friend had left i was alone and i had a terrible headache i got up slowly and felt my head gently to see if there was any blood there wasnt any blood but my head was still very painful i decided to go back to the office and go to bed there was no sign of the porter at the entrance to the manson building i walked out of the door and across to the old grey chrysler i drove slowly back to the office the telephone was ringing when i arrived at the office i went in quickly and answered it samuel speaking listen samuel replied a voice forget about elaine garfield we hurt you a little in her apartment if you dont forget all about elaine garfield well hurt you a lot more who are you i asked but there was no answer the man had put down the telephone i decided to do what the man had told me i would forget all about elaine garfield for ten hours after a good nights sleep i would look for elaine garfield i would also try to find the man with the gun and his friend jo i lay down on the hard low bed and went straight to sleep i woke up the next morning at eight oclock i felt my head carefully but it did not hurt so much now i left the office and went across the street to the cafe where i usually had breakfast i drank a glass of orange juice ate some fresh toast and drank several cups of coffee i read the morning newspapers there was a lot of news but nothing about miss elaine garfield i looked at my watch left the cafe and walked over to the chrysler by nine oclock i was outside the title insurance building at three minutes past nine i was standing outside the door of myer and myer attorneys at twenty past nine i was still standing outside the door nobody had arrived yet to work at nine thirty the first secretary arrived and at eighteen minutes to ten i was sitting in mr myers office well mr myer i said my names samuel and im a private detective im pleased to meet you mr myer said politely he was about fiftyfive years old with a grey suit grey hair and a grey face does miss elaine garfield work here i asked yes she does mr myer said but she hasnt been to work since last monday why do you want to see elaine her sister has asked me to help find her i replied can you think of anything elaine said or did which could explain her disappearance mr myer scratched his head no

looked straight back at mr myer i dont know if elaine is dead or not i said would you be very sad if she was dead yes of course i would be sad mr myer replied angrily are you trying to suggest that i

thats easy elaine shares a room with suzy graham i got up thank you very much mr myer i said where is suzy grahams office please its along the corridor said mr myer the third door on the left i thanked mr myer again and walked to the door oh mr samuel mr myer said im sorry that i got angry but you understand that i dont want yes i understand i interrupted you dont want dirty private detectives in your nice clean office i walked out of mr myers office and banged the door behind me i walked slowly down the corridor and knocked on the third door on the left come in said a voice so i went into the room are you suzy graham i asked yes said the girl sitting at the desk im suzy i smiled at her suzy was the kind of girl everyone smiled at she was small and slim and had a pair of beautiful brown eyes what can i do to help you suzy asked i smiled again id like to ask you some questions miss graham dont call me miss graham the girl said you can call me suzy well suzy i said i would like to ask you some questions about a friend of yours her name is elaine garfield suzy stopped smiling yes all right she said but i dont want to talk about elaine here in the office right i replied ill tell you what well do well go out and find a cafe ill buy you a cup of coffee and you can tell me about elaine all right suzy cheered up and looked much happier id like to have a cup of coffee she said but mr myer might get angry if i leave the office dont worry about mr myer i said with a big smile mr myer and i are great friends chapter six suzy suzy put on her coat and we left the office together we found a little cafe just opposite the titleinsurance building in the cafe i told suzy why i was asking questions about elaine garfield elaines twin sister helen thinks that elaine has disappeared and she has asked me to find elaine i said helen told me that she came to myer and myer last tuesday she was told that elaine had left work suddenly last monday afternoon is that right suzy nodded at least part of its right she said elaine was at work last monday and she hurried off in the middle of the afternoon suzy stopped for a minute and then she continued but i dont remember seeing elaines sister helen on tuesday in fact i didnt even know that elaine had a sister elaines sister lives in new york i explained now can you remember last monday afternoon did elaine give any reason for leaving suddenly oh yes suzy said elaine said that she wasnt feeling well and was going to lie down did elaine receive any visitors or phone calls last monday afternoon i asked no i dont think so said suzy no wait a minute i think yes elaine did receive a phone call just before she left i smiled i dont suppose that by chance you might have heard any of the telephone conversation certainly not suzy replied i dont listen to other peoples phone calls can you think of any reason why elaine disappeared i asked no suzy replied elaine was always very friendly with everyone and she didnt seem to have any troubles did elaine have any special friends any men or women she talked about a lot i asked no not really suzy replied elaine and i used to be quite friendly and we went out dancing together a lot but recently we havent been out together at all i understand i said though i really didnt understand anything at all can you remember the last time you went out together can you remember the place you went to oh thats easy suzy said quickly we went to the las cabanas club we always went there it was about a month ago we had an argument there and we havent gone out together since what was the argument about i asked it was after midnight suzy explained and i wanted to go home but elaine said she wanted to stay a bit longer she said that she had met a wonderful man and didnt want to leave i said i was going home and i left elaine in the club after that evening one thing led to another what do you mean i asked one thing led to another suzy smiled i often spoke to elaine about the man she had met elaine thought he was wonderful i told her that he was no good at all what did elaine say when you told her that i asked with interest she became very angry replied suzy we havent been out dancing together since then i paid for the coffee youve been very helpful suzy i said and ive only got one more question can you remember the name of the man elaine garfield met at las cabanas benny greep suzy said thats his name benny greep thank you very much indeed suzy i said with a smile youve been a great help not at all suzy said and looked at me with her beautiful big brown eyes if theres anything else i can do for you just ask i looked straight into her eyes what are you doing tonight i asked ill be at home watching television suzy replied my boyfriends a boxer and hes fighting in a match on television tonight goodbye suzy i said and watched her as she walked back across the street to the tideinsurance building her boyfriend was a boxer that was just my luck chapter seven benny greep i looked at my watch it was nearly eleven oclock i went back into the cafe and asked if i could look at the telephone book i turned to l and ran my finger down the outside of the page soon i found the name i was looking for las cabanas i looked more closely the address was las cabanas golden drive telephone i left the cafe and walked over to where i had parked the chrysler it wasnt time for lunch yet so i decided to go and see what las cabanas was like it took me nearly twenty minutes to drive there and another ten minutes to find somewhere to park have you ever seen a night club in the daytime its a very depressing sight at night a nightclub seems wonderful however at a quarter to twelve in the morning it looks old empty and dirty the man i met at las cabanas looked old empty and dirty too i rang the bell for five minutes before he answered the door even then he didnt open the door itself instead he opened a small window in the door what do you want he asked the club doesnt open until ten oclock tonight im looking for someone i said someone called benny greep i dont know anyone called benny greep the man replied and started to shut the window wait a minute i said and pushed five dollars through the window thats better the man said and he opened the door and let me in i followed him across the dance floor the man was a cleaner he picked up a brush and began to clean the floor do you know where i can find benny greep i asked the man again if you come back tonight at ten oclock youll find benny greep here the man said benny plays the drums in the band i gave the man another five dollars where can i find benny now i asked the man picked up a piece of paper from the floor and wrote an address on it i took the paper and left immediately as i drove the grey chrysler away from las cabanas i looked at the address the cleaner had written arvieda street west los angeles arvieda street was an old block of apartments i gave the porter a couple of dollars and he told me which was benny greeps apartment i walked up the narrow dark stairs until i came to the fifth floor i was looking for apartment i knocked on the door of apartment and waited there was no answer so i rang the bell no answer i knocked again hard there was still no answer i pushed against the door and it opened easily i waited there was no sound from the apartment so i went in the light was on and the curtains were drawn the apartment was very small there was one main room which was used as the livingroom diningroom and bedroom the room had two doors one of the doors led into the kitchen and the other into the bathroom the main room was very untidy the table was covered with dirty plates and glasses and there was a full ashtray lying on the floor there was a strange smell in the room i looked into the kitchen the kitchen was also dirty and untidy i walked across to the bathroom and opened the door benny greep was in the bath his left hand was hanging over the side of the bath the hand had neatly cut nails and there was a gold ring on one finger the wrist was covered by a shirtsleeve which was rather dirty i couldnt see the rest of the arm because it was under the water benny greeps head was just out of the water he had a handsome face and quite long black hair his eyes were wide open the only other parts of his body out of the water were his feet but i couldnt see his toes because he still had his shoes and socks on the bath water was red i pulled out the plug in the bath to let the water out when the bath was empty i looked at the dead man more closely he had been dead for several hours he had been shot in the chest and then pushed into the bath i looked on the floor by the bath there was blood there too and i was standing in it i moved back and cleaned the blood off my shoes with some water then i quickly looked round the main room again the dead mans coat was lying on a chair and i felt in the pockets i found a few dollars and a driving licence the driving licence had a photograph of the dead man on it the licence belonged to benny greep and the address in the licence was arvieda street west los angeles the dead man in the bath was definitely benny greep chapter eight arrested for murder i moved around the room and carefully cleaned everything i had touched i didnt want to leave any fingerprints there was nothing in the room to connect benny greep with elaine garfield i picked up the telephone and asked for the police im speaking from apartment arivieda street i said theres a dead man in the bath right said the policeman at the other end of the telephone whats your name i told him dont touch anything the policeman said and stay where you are a police car will he there in a few minutes i put down the phone and sat down to wait three minutes later i heard the police car coming the car stopped outside the building and i could hear heavy feet running up the stairs two policemen walked into the apartment they were both wearing ordinary clothes and looked hot and tired one was about twentyfive years old the other about forty the older policeman came up to me and showed me his police papers wheres the body he asked i pointed to the bathroom both policemen went into the bathroom to have a look the younger one came back first shaking his head all right said the younger policeman why did you do it do what i asked in surprise why did you kill your friend in the bath said the young policeman he wasnt my friend i replied i dont care if he was your friend or not said the policeman tell me why you killed him i didnt kill him i said calmly then what are you doing here asked the older policeman coming in from the bathroom my names lenny samuel i explained im a private detective and i came here to talk to benny greep the door was open and so i came in i looked in the bathroom and i found the dead man in the bath so i telephoned the police the dead man is benny greep why did you want to talk to benny greep the younger policeman asked im sorry i cant answer that i replied who are you working for asked the older policeman im sorry i cant answer that either i said as far as i know benny greeps death doesnt have anything to do with the person im working for tell me who you are working for shouted the younger policeman angrily take it easy said the older policeman to the younger one you stay here until the other police arrive im going to take mr samuel down to the police station i kept quiet and followed the older policeman out of the room and down the stairs outside the building we got into my old chrysler the policeman drove we were soon at the police station where the policeman locked me in a small room i sat down on a hard wooden chair in the locked room and tried to sleep it was no use getting angry or upset at being arrested for murder that is something you have to get used to if you are a private detective it happens all the time but i could not sleep i was thinking about all the things which had happened since i had met helen garfield the day before i couldnt sleep because several things were worrying me but i couldnt remember what those things were chapter nine sergeant murphy while i was in the police station i remembered one of the things which was worrying me how had jo and his tall friend known that i was in elaine garfields apartment the porter at the manson building must have told the two men i decided that i would go and talk to the porter when i left the police station i sat back in the chair and looked at my watch the time was nearly four oclock then i remembered that helen garfield was coming to my office at five oclock i would not be there to meet her but there was something else that was worrying me it wasnt anything important it was quite a small thing but i couldnt remember what it was suddenly the door opened and a policeman came in stand up shouted the policeman follow me i stood up and followed the policeman out of the room and along a corridor the policeman stopped knocked on a door and opened it are you ready to see the private detective asked the policeman as he put his head around the door without waiting for an answer the policeman opened the door wide and pushed me into the room the policeman came into the room and closed the door behind him in the room there was a man sitting behind a desk he was completely bald he had no hair at all he was about fiftyfive years old and his name was sergeant murphy sergeant murphy had spent all his life in the police and he didnt like private detectives sergeant murphy sat looking at me he looked at me for about five minutes without saying anything i was standing in front of his desk looking straight back at him the silence didnt worry me in fact i quite liked it the silence was much nicer than questions about what id been doing in benny greeps apartment what were you doing in benny greeps apartment asked sergeant murphy suddenly i wanted to talk to him i replied why did you kill benny greep shouted sergeant murphy suddenly i didnt kill him i replied and i told sergeant murphy the same story that i had told the policemen in benny greeps apartment i dont believe a word of what youve told me said the sergeant who are you working for im sorry i replied i cant tell you who im working for as far as i know benny greeps death has nothing to do with me or with the person im working for i stopped and looked at the sergeant i knew that what i had just said wasnt true in fact i thought benny greeps death was connected with elaine garfields disappearance but i couldnt tell the police helen garfield had said that she didnt want the police to know about her sisters disappearance sergeant murphy looked me straight in the eyes i hate all private detectives he said slowly and you are the private detective that i hate the most i dont think you are telling me the truth i think you are hiding things from me i think you know more about benny greeps death than you say you do and you are going to tell me all you know now ive already told you all i know i replied quietly sergeant murphys face went red the red colour went up until it covered all of his bald head dont try to play games with me he shouted now get out can i go home now i asked no said sergeant murphy the sergeant told the policeman at the door to take me back to the small room and lock me up again i went with the policemen and didnt argue i dont like arguing with policemen when i was alone in the room again i sat down i tried to remember the other thing that had been worrying me earlier someone had said something important but i could not remember what it was chapter ten the yellow car i looked at my watch it was half past five i was still at the police station id seen sergeant murphy once more during the afternoon it hadnt been a pleasant meeting i hadnt told the sergeant who i was working for and i hadnt told him why id wanted to talk to benny greep half past five i wondered if helen garfield was waiting for me at my office suddenly the door of the room opened and sergeant murphy came in get out he said ive decided to let you go now go before i change my mind i went before sergeant murphy changed his mind as i got my car out of the police garage i wondered why sergeant murphy had let me go as i drove away from the police station i noticed a small yellow car behind me a minute later i looked in the mirror again the small yellow car was still behind me i drove a little faster and then suddenly turned right up a narrow street at the end of the narrow street i turned left and then left again soon i was back on the main road i looked in the mirror the yellow car was still right behind me so that was why sergeant murphy had let me go the sergeant had ordered some policemen to follow me they were going to watch what i did and who i met i drove straight back to the office as i parked the car outside i noticed the yellow car had stopped across the road i ran up the stairs and into my office the door to the outer room was open as usual but the room was empty helen garfield wasnt there but there was a letter on the table on top of the magazines i picked the letter up and read it dear mr samuel i came here at five oclock and waited but you didnt come i must see you urgently meet me at has cabanas at tonight helen garfield i put the letter in my pocket and looked at my watch it was just after six oclock i had five and a half hours before the meeting with helen garfield there was plenty of time to go to the mansion building and talk to the porter i got into the chrysler and drove off towards the mansion building the small yellow car was still following me as i drove i thought about helen garfields letter why does she want to meet me at las cabanas i asked myself in fact how does she know about las cabanas at all she says that she lives in new york i would have to ask miss helen garfield a few questions the next time i saw her but the most important thing now was to get away from the yellow car which was still following me i was going to the building where elaine garfield lived and i didnt want the police to know there were two men in the yellow car i turned right and the yellow car followed i stopped and the yellow car stopped i turned the chrysler around and the yellow car turned around i tried to drive faster than the yellow car but the chrysler was too old and too slow i slowed down and waited until i was near the next traffic lights then just as the lights were changing from green to red i drove across them the yellow car was too late the lights were now red but that didnt stop the car it drove straight past the red light then as i looked angrily in my mirror something happened which made me laugh a policeman on a motorbike drove after the yellow car the policeman made the driver stop because he had driven past the red light i drove away as fast as possible in my mirror i could see the driver inside the car arguing with the policeman on the motorbike it was the funniest sight i had seen for a long time i drove on towards the manson building happy to have escaped i may even have sung a little because i was feeling so good chapter eleven a short visit to the manson building as i was driving happily towards the manson building i had a surprise i looked in the mirror the yellow car was coming up fast behind me i drove as fast as i could but the yellow car got closer and closer just then a dog ran across the road in front of the chrysler i braked hard and the tyres screamed as the chrysler stopped suddenly to avoid the dog then there was the scream of more tyres as the driver of the yellow car tried to stop there was a loud crash and a bang as the small yellow car ran right into the back of my big old grey chrysler the two men in the yellow car werent hurt but their car was badly damaged at the front oil and water were running out onto the road the old chrysler was not damaged at all i got out and walked back to the yellow car you ought to be more careful i said to the driver you were driving very dangerously its lucky for you that my car isnt badly damaged butbut the driver began to say but i did not wait to listen i ran back to the chrysler jumped in and drove on the last i saw of the yellow car was the two men pushing it to the side of the road i was soon at the manson building and i went into the hall to look for the porter i couldnt see him anywhere then i noticed a door with a sign on it saying porter i knocked quietly but there was no answer i opened the door slowly and looked into the room the porter was sitting at his desk asleep his feet were on the desk and he was lying back in his chair i walked quickly and quietly into the room and closed the door i went up to the desk and noticed a piece of paper lying by the telephone there was a telephone number written on the paper las cabanas i said to myself thats the telephone number of the nightclub without waking the porter i left the room i had found out what i wanted to know the two men who had hit me on the head had probably come from las cabanas the porter must have telephoned them when i went up to elaine garfields flat i was now very interested in las cabanas elaine garfield used to go dancing there with suzy benny greep worked there before he was killed helen garfield wanted to meet me there at half past eleven and now the porter and the two men who had hit me on the head were connected with las cabanas i went home washed changed and had a meal at eleven oclock i went out again i was going to las cabanas there were lots of cars parked outside and i had to leave the chrysler quite a long way away from the nightclub as i walked up to the entrance of las cabanas it started to rain heavily i knocked on the door and the little window in the door opened a face looked at me for a minute then the door opened and i went in the club no longer looked empty and dirty soft lights and sweet music had changed the appearance of the club completely i stood and looked around there was a small dance floor on which a few people were dancing the band was small and not very good there was a new drummer instead of benny greep around the dance floor several groups of people were sitting round low tables to the right of the dance floor there were more tables where people were eating there were two doors behind the tables which led into the kitchen i sat down at a table by the dance floor in the darkest part of the room and waited chapter twelve las cabanas exactly at eleven thirty helen garfield came into the nightclub she was looking as beautiful as ever but seemed to be a little worried her blue eyes looked around the room until she saw me then with a little smile she walked up and sat down at the table she sat next to me with her back to the dance floor she was carrying a bag which she put on the floor beside her the smile disappeared from her face where were you this afternoon mr samuel she said sharply im paying you fifty dollars a day in return for that money i want you to do what i tell you now why werent you at your office this afternoon at five oclock i took a deep breath well miss garfield i said its a long story lets have a drink and ill tell you all about it a waiter came over and i ordered some drinks when the waiter had gone the beautiful blonde girl said come on mr samuel tell me ok i said but stop calling me mr samuel call me len all my friends call me len im not a friend of yours mr samuel the blonde girl said in a voice like ice im paying you a lot of money to work for me fifty dollars a day doesnt allow you to be rude to me i replied quietly in the last twenty four hours ive been hit on the head and suspected of murder what do you mean the girl said and leant towards me murder just then the waiter brought the drinks and we sat in silence until he had gone then i told helen garfield about my visit to her sisters apartment in the manson building i told her about the two men who had caught me there helen garfield listened in silence do you like the band miss garfield i asked i didnt come here to talk about the band the blonde girl said angrily the band has got a new drummer tonight i said because i found the old drummer dead in his bath this morning the blonde girl turned around quickly to look at the band she said something to herself which i didnt hear she lifted her right hand and started stroking her hair she looked sad and very worried whatwhat was the drummer the dead mans name helen garfield asked greep i said benny greep i dont suppose that you know benny greep do you helen garfield shook her head no she said i told her what had happened at the police station then i told her about the policemen who had followed me in a yellow car do you think theyre still following you the blonde girl asked quickly and looked around the club i told her how i had got away from the yellow car now miss garfield i continued its time for me to ask you a few questions there are some things about your sisters disappearance which worry me i want to ask you about them all right she said but i dont think i can help you i dont know much about elaines life here i dont know very much about los angeles either i sat back in my chair and looked at her this beautiful blonde girl was paying me fifty dollars a day to find her sister i liked what i saw then very quietly i began to ask helen garfield some questions you dont know los angeles very well i began thats right the girl replied but you were able to find out where elaine worked i continued and you went to myer and myer last tuesday to ask if they knew anything about elaine yes the girl said looking at me closely who did you speak to at myer and myer i asked suzy no the girl said i spoke to mr myer i want to ask you something else i said when i went to elaines flat i noticed something unusual there were very few clothes in the wardrobe it seems your sister planned her disappearance quite carefully she had taken her clothes with her i see the girl said and looked around the nightclub i waited until she looked back at me do you like it here i asked yes she said i like it too i said but theres something else which is worrying me do you mind if i ask you one more question not at all the girl said well i began ive been wondering why you asked me to meet you here at las cabanas helen garfield pushed back her chair and stood up would you please excuse me for a minute she said she picked her bag up from the floor and walked over towards the ladies toilet which was near the entrance would you like another drink i shouted after her yes please she shouted back over her shoulder i ordered two more drinks and sat back in my chair i looked around the nightclub it was almost midnight chapter thirteen helen garfield leaves i sat by the dance floor in las cabanas waiting for helen garfield to come back from the toilet i was waiting for her to answer my question i wanted to know why she had asked me to meet her here i looked around at the people who were dancing on the other side of the dance floor i could see people sitting eating at the tables waiters were carrying food in and out of the two doors leading to the kitchen i looked at my watch again it was five past twelve helen garfield was taking a long time i finished my drink and ordered another one at ten past twelve i got up and walked over towards the entrance there was a man standing by the front door of the nightclub i asked him if he had seen helen the beautiful blonde with blue eyes the man asked yes i said she left nearly a quarter of an hour ago said the man are you sure i asked yes the man replied she asked me to get her a taxi did you hear her give the taxi driver an address i asked quickly the man shook his head no he said im sorry i thanked the man and walked back to my seat why did helen garfield leave without telling me i asked myself perhaps some of the questions that i asked made her angry just then i looked up and saw a man walking across the dance floor towards me i recognised the man he was short with red hair he was looking at me and smiling in a rather unfriendly way it was jo one of the men who had found me in elaine garfields apartment i decided to leave i stood up and started to walk towards the door i didnt want to meet jo again as i walked towards the door i thought that i heard someone shouting excuse me sir said a voice i didnt stop or look around then i heard the voice again excuse me sir you havent paid your bill i had forgotten to pay for the drinks the waiter came running up to me and i quickly took out ten dollars and gave them to the waiter you can keep the change i said as i gave him the moneyну without waiting for a reply i turned and hurried towards the door then i heard the waiters voice again excuse me sir excuse me sir he said i stopped and turned around the waiter came up to me excuse me sir ten dollars is not enough he said the price of your drinks is twelve dollars las cabanas is very expensive i said as i gave the waiter another five dollars now you can keep the change then i stopped thinking about money jo was walking quickly towards me i turned around and ran towards the door as fast as i could i got to the door and was just about to leave las cabanas i was happy because i had escaped then i got a surprise there standing by the door of the nightclub was jos tall friend it was the same man who had hit me on the head in miss garfields apartment the tall man had seen me coming and had moved in front of the door now i couldnt get out chapter fourteen the fight i stopped and looked behind me jo was closer now and the smile on his face looked very unfriendly i was caught i could not go out of the door and jo was right behind me i turned around quickly and ran towards jo before he knew what i was doing i put my arms around him and started dancing he was very surprised and tried to pull away from me but he couldnt fight properly he was afraid that the other people would notice i looked over my shoulder and saw the tall man standing helplessly on the side of the dance floor i pushed jo into the middle of the dance floor where there were lots of other people dancing then i felt something sharp touching my back it was a knife stop trying to be funny samuel said jo angrily stop dancing and go over to the door or else ill push this knife into you we were right in the middle of the dance floor and a long way from the tall man jo was holding a knife against my back some of the other people around us had stopped dancing they were staring in surprise at the sight of two men dancing together i lifted my foot and kicked jos leg as hard as i could he gave a cry of pain and fell to the floor i looked around to see where i could run to jos tall friend was coming through the dancers towards me i turned around and ran off the dance floor i looked back over my shoulder and saw that both jo and his friend were following me i ran between the tables where people were eating the floor was slippery and i fell over as i fell i knocked over a table and the plates of food and glasses fell on top of me i got up quickly and ran out through one of the doors into the kitchen then i stopped and counted to five as jo and his tall friend were coming towards the door i pushed the door closed as hard as i could there was a loud bang as the men ran into the door i smiled and turned round but i did not smile for very long three cooks were coming towards me with big kitchen knives in their hands i looked at the cooks and at the knives they were holding i thought about running towards them and trying to fight them i decided that it would be a stupid idea to try and fight three big men with knives to my left there was a very big saucepan full of boiling soup on the stove i picked it up and threw it at the cooks there were loud cries of pain as the hot soup hit the three men just then the door opened behind me jo and his tall friend stood in the doorway and the tall man was holding a gun there was a loud bang as the gun went off the bang was followed by a scream of pain from one of the cooks because the tall man had shot him in the foot by mistake i quickly picked up a large pile of dirty plates and threw them at jo he saw the plates coming and he tried to move away as he moved he slipped on the floor and fell onto a pile of broken plates without waiting i ran to a door at the back of the kitchen the door was locked and i banged against the door with my shoulder the lock broke easily and i pushed the door open as i ran out into the dark street i could still hear the shouts and cries coming from the club i came to the chrysler and bent over to open the door just then there was a noise behind me i turned around and saw a man with his arm raised then i felt a terrible pain in my head everything went black i fell to the ground unconscious chapter fifteen the police station feeling better now asked a voice i opened my eyes and looked around me i didnt know where i was i was lying on something hard and there was a bright light on my eyes where am i i asked then i realised where i was i recognised the grey walls the hard furniture and the bright electric lights i was in the police station again feeling better now the voice repeated i looked at the policeman who was talking to me yes i said very slowly but my head feels as if it is breaking in half youre lucky to be alive said the policeman a police car found you lying in the middle of the road on golden drive you would have been hit by passing cars and probably killed if the police car hadnt found you i thought for a moment i wasnt sure how much the police knew i didnt want to tell the police anything they did not already know yes i was lucky i said by the way what was a police car doing on golden drive oh said the policeman there was a big fight at a nightclub called las cabanas we had a telephone call to say that there was a madman in the club the madman was breaking up all the furniture a police car was sent to the nightclub but the madman escaped before the police arrived the police car was returning when it found you lying in the middle of the road you were very lucky the car nearly ran right over you i smiled i dont feel very lucky i replied in fact i feel terrible never mind said the policeman can you walk i stood up and walked a few steps my head hurt but otherwise i felt all right yes i said i can walk good the policeman said lets walk along the corridor then and have a talk with a friend of yours we went along the corridor the policeman stopped at a door and knocked there was a shout from inside the room and the policeman opened the door i walked into the room and the policeman followed he shut the door and stood in front of it there was only one desk in the room and behind the desk was a man he was bald it was my old friend sergeant murphy hello sergeant murphy i said trying to smile how are you feeling tonight sergeant murphy didnt smile back at me are you trying to be funny he asked it isnt night its morning youve been unconscious all night oh i said now said sergeant murphy lets begin i want you to tell me why you were lying unconscious in the middle of golden drive at half past twelve last night you were a danger to the traffic i thought that the traffic was a danger to me i replied but the sergeant didnt even smile im waiting for you to tell me what happened said the sergeant nothing much happened i began i spent part of the evening at las cabanas and left just before midnight i walked back to my car just as i was about to get into the car someone hit me over the head thats the last i remember this policeman and i pointed to the one standing by the door told me that i had been found in the middle of the road someone must have put me there sergeant murphy smiled yes he said someone who wanted to kill you put you in the middle of the road someone was hoping that a car would hit you and kill you i smiled back at the sergeant can you think of anyone who would want to kill you the sergeant asked me oh yes i replied hundreds of people would like to kill me including a few policemen chapter sixteen tell me the truth did you leave las cabanas before midnight asked sergeant murphy thats right i replied i left the nightclub just before twelve so you werent at las cabanas when the big fight started just after twelve asked the sergeant big fight i said trying to sound surprised dont sound so surprised said sergeant murphy angrily we received a telephone call from the owner of las cabanas he said that just after midnight last night a tall man with brown hair and brown eyes called lenny samuel attacked two of the people at the club the owner of the club said that you then attacked and injured three cooks then you broke over one hundred plates and a table and ruined food worth several hundred dollars i didnt say anything i could not think of anything to say did you really do all that sergeant murphy asked in a different voice the sergeant sounded both surprised and pleased did you really do all that on your own or did you have men to help you i did it all on my own i said beginning to feel a little proud of myself do you know that you could go to prison for six months for what you did last night the sergeant asked he was laughing as he said it i wasnt laughing i couldnt see anything funny about six months in prison look sergeant murphy said im not stupid i agreed with the sergeant that he was not stupid im not stupid sergeant murphy repeated and i know why you were at las cabanas last night benny greep used to work there and you went to find out about his death i agreed with the sergeant again it seemed the best thing to do now sergeant murphy said slowly im interested in las cabanas the club is owned by people who are criminals but we cant prove that they have broken the law im also interested in benny creeps murder now what i suggest is this tell me all you know about las cabanas and benny greep and i will let you go if you tell me all you know you wont go to prison for the fight at the nightclub but i want the truth not the lies you told me yesterday i took a deep breath and started to tell the sergeant what i knew i told him about everything except elaine garfield i wasnt sure how closely elaine garfield was connected with benny creeps death so i told the sergeant that helen garfield from new york had asked me to find out about las cabanas sergeant murphy asked me for helen garfields address in new york and i said i didnt know it then the sergeant asked me where helen garfield was staying in los angeles i said i didnt know i told sergeant murphy all that i knew about benny greep except that the drummer had known elaine garfield then i asked him about the two men in the yellow car who had followed me the sergeant smiled and said that the two men were policemen finally i told him about the fight at las cabanas sergeant murphy listened to everything when i had finished my story he looked at me in silence for a few moments right samuel i hope that youve told me the truth and all the truth if youve been telling me more lies ill make sure that you go to prison for six months because of the fight at las cabanas now you can go i stood up thank you i said with a smile sit down he said and listen you can go but you must promise to tell me anything you find out about las cabanas and about benny greep i promise i said quickly and stood up wait a minute said sergeant murphy ive one more thing to tell you im going to telephone the new york police im going to ask them to find out all they can about helen garfield if the police in new york discover that youve told me lies about helen garfield you will be in very serious trouble i told the sergeant not to worry and thanked him very much i left the police station feeling very happy because sergeant murphy had let me go i called a taxi and went out to golden drive to get the chrysler chapter seventeen telephone calls i drove the chrysler back to the office and walked up the stairs the office looked just the same there were no letters for me i went down to the cafe and had a late breakfast as i drank my coffee i thought about some of the things helen garfield had told me at las cabanas before the fight i decided to check one of the things immediately and walked over to the telephone i opened the telephone book and looked under m until i found the telephone number of myer and myer i picked up the telephone and dialled the number myer and myer good morning said a voice which i recognised can i help you hello suzy i said this is len samuel do you remember me of course i remember you said suzy did your boyfriend win his boxing match on television i asked no suzy replied and anyway hes not my boyfriend any more really i said happily thinking that perhaps i could ask suzy to go for a drink with me yes suzy said the boxer had a fight with my new boyfriend outside my house last night and who won i asked my new boyfriend replied suzy oh i said sadly and what does your new boyfriend do my new boyfriends a weight lifter suzy replied he lifts big weights in competitions i was about to say goodbye then i remembered that i had not telephoned to speak to suzy i wanted to speak to her boss mr myer can i speak to mr myer please suzy i asked right suzy said ill put you through to mr myer goodbye there was a pause and then i heard mr myers voice hello myer speaking good morning mr myer i said in a deep voice i had put my handkerchief over the telephone so that mr myer would not know my voice this is the police i said sergeant murphy speaking i pretended to be sergeant murphy so that mr myer would answer my questions good morning said mr myer what do you want to ask me about its about a girl who works for you i said her name is elaine garfield she has disappeared and we are trying to find her elaines sister helen came to see you last tuesday didnt she no said mr myer elaines sister didnt come to see me last tuesday i didnt know that elaine had a sister until a private detective told me he said that elaines sister was called helen the telephone line was very bad and it was difficult for me to hear what mr myer was saying what did you say i asked i said that elaines sister was called helen replied mr myer the names are very similar arent they thank you very much mr myer i said and put the telephone down mr myer was right the names helen and elaine were very similar elaine garfield had disappeared and so far i was the only person who had met helen garfield i left the cafe and walked back up to my office as i climbed the stairs i could hear my telephone ringing i didnt hurry i walked slowly along the corridor into my office and answered the telephone is that samuel a voice said i recognised the voice at once it was jo yes i said this is len samuel listen samuel jo said we want elaine garfield and we think you know where she is we are coming to your office to see you wait for us dont go out but i i started but it was too late jo had put the telephone down i sat down at my desk sadly now whats going to happen i thought jo and his friend will come to see me theyll ask me if i know where elaine garfield is but i dont know where she is i wonder if they will believe me when i tell them the telephone rang again i picked it up hello i said hello samuel said a familiar voice hello sergeant murphy i replied trying to sound pleased weve just telephoned new york the sergeant said angrily and the new york police were very helpful the new york police told us that there is no such person as helen garfield helen garfield does not exist there is no one living in new york called helen garfield you were lying when you told me that you were working for helen garfield but i started now listen the sergeant interrupted i am sending a police car round to your office i want to see you wait for the police car dont go out the sergeant put down the telephone and i sat back in my chair i was worried what would happen now jo was coming to see me and so was a policeman i tried to think of what i would say to them both i hoped that the policeman and jo would not arrive at the same time chapter eighteen i find elaine garfield the telephone rang again i was afraid to answer it the telephone continued ringing finally i did answer it hello i said is that mr samuel asked a voice it was helen garfield yes miss garfield i replied this is len samuel speaking i must see you said helen garfield well i would like to talk to you too miss garfield i said slowly i think there are a lot of things you and i must talk about right the girl said meet me at the seventh mann cafe in five minutes do you know where the cafe is its about half a mile from your office i know the seventh man i replied but i cant meet you in five minutes because im expecting visitors you must come at once mr samuel she said but i began it was too late helen garfield had put her telephone down i got up from the chair and walked to the door i decided to go and meet helen garfield both jo and sergeant murphy had told me not to go out but i decided i would rather talk to helen garfield than to the policeman or to jo if jo and the policeman came when i was out they could talk to each other i left the building and drove the chrysler down the road i was very lucky because i was able to park right outside the seventh mann i walked into the cafe helen garfield was sitting at a table in the comer i walked over and sat down beside her i asked the waiter for a cup of coffee i drank the coffee without saying anything then i put the cup down and looked at the beautiful blonde girl sitting beside me miss garfield i said you are a very beautiful girl but i think you are a liar i think that everything youve said to me has been lies i dont think youve ever told me the truth the blonde girls face slowly became red she looked straight at me mr samuel she said im paying you a lot of money to work for me i asked you to find my sister i didnt ask you to call me a liar well miss garfield i think i have found elaine garfield would you like me to tell you where she is yes the blonde girl said where is elaine shes here in this cafe i said elaine garfield is sitting next to me you are elaine garfield helen garfield doesnt exist you pretended to be helen garfield but there really never was any such person the police in new york say that helen garfield doesnt exist i went on helen garfield and elaine garfield are the same person you are elaine garfield and you pretended to be helen the blonde girl stood up angrily how much money do you want mr samuel you are no longer working for me she shouted sit down i said quietly the blonde girl did not sit down so i pulled her down beside me now listen miss garfield i said firmly you are going to tell me all about yourself and why you came to see me i want to know all about benny creep and las cabanas i want to know why you disappeared i wont tell you anything she said oh yes you will tell me everything i replied youll tell me everything or else ill take you straight to the police you see the police are looking for me at this moment the police think that i may have killed benny greep i continued the police know that i had a fight at las cabanas last night a red haired man and his tall friend are also chasing me they are the two men who started the fight at las cabanas they will try to kill me if i dont tell them where you are so you see miss garfield i think you had better tell me everything im the only person who can help you the blonde girl sat in silence for a minute then she began to cry all right she said ill tell you everything i am elaine garfield chapter nineteen everything is explained i looked at the blonde girl so you agree that youre really elaine garfield and not helen i said quietly now tell me about benny greep the girl took a deep breath suzy graham and i used to go out dancing together a lot said elaine we often went to las cabanas one night when we were there i met a wonderful man called benny benny was the drummer in the band i liked him very much and went to the nightclub very often to see benny we became very good friends the girl stopped again and took out her handkerchief go on i said quietly i used to go to las cabanas to see benny nearly every night but it was difficult for us to talk to each other the girl continued why was it difficult for you and benny to talk to each other i asked because benny was the drummer in the band of course elaine garfield replied we couldnt talk to each other very much because he was playing with the band most of the evening i understand i said and ordered two more coffees so i spent a lot of time in las cabanas watching benny play the drums the girl said and i also watched everything else which happened in the nightclub what did you see i asked i didnt notice anything unusual at first the girl replied but after a few nights i noticed that the same people always came to the club at the same time which people i asked there was a redhaired man a tall man who never took off his hat and one or two others said elaine garfield yes i said i think i have met two of them they were the men who hit me on the head in the manson building anyway the girl continued one night i asked benny why these men came to the club every night benny told me not to ask questions so i watched the men more carefully afterwards and noticed that they always arrived with bags but when the men left they werent carrying bags what did you do then i asked i asked benny about the men again she said benny said that there were a lot of strange things happening at las cabanas and that it was dangerous to ask questions the waiter brought the coffees and elaine waited until he had gone one night she continued one of the men was sitting at the table next to me he was talking to some other men and he opened the bag that he was carrying i was sitting quite close and i could see into the bag the bag was full of diamonds and jewellery really i said and drank my coffee i told benny about the bag of jewellery later on in the evening continued elaine benny was very excited at the news he told me that he had known for a long time that criminals used las cabanas they used the club as a place to buy and sell stolen things benny and i talked all evening about the bag of jewellery benny said that the jewellery was stolen the men who were selling it were criminals and they had stolen the jewellery well elaine continued benny wanted to steal one of the bags he said that the jewellery was stolen so it didnt matter if we stole it from the criminals i agreed to help him we hoped to sell the bag and to use the money to go away together i see i said and did you help benny to steal the bag of jewellery yes we waited for nearly a week elaine replied then last sunday i had a chance to steal the bag it was at the end of the evening and nearly everyone had left the club i had found out where they hid the bag and i was able to take it and give it to benny benny had big bags in which he carried his drums it was easy for him to hide the bag of jewellery in the drum bag we left the club together with the bag of jewellery we decided to hide the jewellery in my apartment and then sell it later the next day was monday elaine continued and i went to work in the afternoon i had a telephone call from benny benny said that the redhaired man knew that the bag of jewellery had been stolen he was very angry benny told me to stop work and go home he told me to stay at home to make sure that no one came to take the jewels benny was going to continue working at las cabanas then no one would think that he had stolen the jewels and did you stay at home i asked yes i stayed at home for three days elaine replied but i was afraid that the redhaired man would find out where i was living then he would come to get the bag of jewellery so what did you do i asked that was easy she said with a smile i moved into a hotel in the centre of the town and then came to see you but why did you come to see me i asked to make sure that i was safe said elaine i pretended to be my sister and said that i had disappeared i asked you to find me then i knew that i was safe why i asked because you were looking for me elaine continued if the men from las cabanas found me or took me away you would find out and chase them thank you very much for thinking that i am such a good detective i said but why didnt you tell me the truth thats easy said elaine i didnt want to tell you about the jewels chapter twenty im sorry mr samuel go on with your story i said the evening i came to see you at your office said elaine i telephoned benny at las cabanas i told benny what i had done benny told me that the redhaired man knew that we had stolen the jewellery benny told me that there would be no trouble if i brought the jewels back to las cabanas the next night you were stupid to trust the redhaired man i said i know the girl said i was afraid so i asked you to meet me at las cabanas at midnight so you didnt know that benny was dead until i told you at las cabanas i said no elaine said that is why i ran away before midnight i decided not to give them the jewellery because they had killed benny youve still got the jewels then i asked in surprise where are they here elaine said and pointed to a small bag under the table i reached under the table picked up the hag and opened it the bag was full of diamonds and jewellery just then i heard a voice and at the same time elaine screamed give it to me said the voice i looked up quickly and saw jo standing beside me his tall friend was right behind him give me the bag said jo once again how did you know i was here i asked you parked your car right outside said jo with a laugh now give me the bag i passed him the bag as i gave him the bag i jumped to my feet and hit jo hard in the face he tripped and fell heavily onto the floor i moved towards the tall man who was still standing a few feet away i was about to run at him but then i stopped the tall man had taken a gun from his pocket and the gun was pointing straight at me right said the tall man dont move or else ill shoot you jo got up from the floor he still had the bag of jewellery in his hand together jo and his friend with the gun walked towards the door they walked backwards to make sure that elaine and i did not try to get the bag back as the two men reached the door i started to laugh what are you laughing at shouted the man with the gun look behind you i said both men turned around and looked in the doorway of the cafe stood sergeant murphy with two other policemen sergeant murphy jumped on the tall man with the gun and jo ran back into the cafe i stepped forward to stop jo and he ran straight into me we both fell on the floor and the two policemen ran up one of the policemen held jo the other policeman held me they are the criminals i shouted pointing at jo and his friend not me you are all coming down to the police station sergeant murphy said and looked over to elaine garfield you must come too it took a long time to tell sergeant murphy the whole story in the end he believed what elaine and i told him the sergeant warned me not to tell him lies again and agreed to let me go free elaine told sergeant murphy all she knew about las cabanas the sergeant was very pleased to catch jo and his friend with the jewels sergeant murphy agreed to let elaine go free because she helped catch the criminals as we were leaving the police station i asked sergeant murphy how he had found us in the seventh man cafe it was very lucky really said the sergeant we went to your office to see you but you werent there as we were leaving we saw the redhaired man and his friend entering we waited and when they left we followed them to the cafe thank you very much sergeant said elaine and thank you very much mr samuel thats all right i said you are paying me fifty dollars a day im sorry mr samuel elaine said im afraid i cant pay you now that ive given the jewels to the police i dont have any money i smiled and got into the old grey chrysler and drove back to the office i didnt say goodbye when i got back to the office i sat down in my chair its not much fun being a private eye you get hit on the head nearly killed and chased by the police and you dont always get paid the end
