 wamphyri brian lumley book of the necroscope series both of dragosanis legs were broken and lay at weird angles his arms hung slack down the wall to the skirting elbows just off the floor forearms at ninety degrees and hands projecting well beyond the cuffs of his jacket they were hands like claws big powerful and grasping frozen in dragosanis final spasm his face was a rictus of agony made worse by the fact that it was hardly a human face at all and worse still by the gash that split his skull ear to ear but his face dragosanis jaws were long as some great hounds gaping open to display curving needle teeth his skull was misshapen and his ears were pointed where they curved forward and lay flat against his temples his eyes were ruptured red pits above a nose long and wrinkled and flattened to show gaping nostrils like the convoluted snout of some great bat that was how he looked part man part wolf part bat and the thing pinned to his chest was worse by the same author the

pete and all the blokes i met at the house on the borderland in july cheers many and multiform are the dim horrors of earth infesting her ways from the prime they sleep beneath the unturned stone they rise with the tree from its root they move beneath the sea and in subterranean places they dwell in the inmost adyta they emerge betimes from the shutten sepulchre of haughty bronze and the low grave that is sealed with clay there be some that are long known to man and others as yet unknown that abide the terrible latter days of their revealing those which are the most dreadful and the loathliest of all are haply still to be declared but among those that have revealed themselves aforetime and have made manifest their veritable presence there is one which may not openly be named for its exceeding foulness it is that spawn which the hidden dweller in the vaults has begotten upon mortality clark ashton smith they say foul beings of old times still lurk in dark forgotten corners of the world and gates still gape to loose on certain nights shapes pent in hell robert e howard chapter one afternoon of the fourth monday in january the chateau bronnitsy off the serpukhov road not far out of moscow pm middleeuropean time and a telephone in the temporary investigation control room ringing ringing ringing the chateau bronnitsy stood central on open peaty ground in the middle of a densely wooded tract now white under drifted snow a house or mansion of debased heritage and mixed architectural antecedents several recent wings were of modern brick on old stone foundations while others were cheap breeze blocks camouflaged in grey and green paint a oncecourtyard in the u of polyglot wings was now roofed over its roof painted to match the surrounding terrain bedded at their bases in massive steeply gabled end walls twin minarets raised broken bulbous domes high over the landscape their boarded windows glooming like hooded eyes in keeping with the generally rundown aspect of the rest of the place the upper sections of these towers were derelict decayed as rotten fangs from the air the chateau would seem a gaunt old ruin but it was hardly that even though the towers were not the only things in a state of decay outside the roofed courtyard stood a canopied tenton army truck the canvas flaps at its rear thrown back and its exhaust puffing acrid blue smoke into the frosty air a kgb man conspicuous in his uniform of felt hat and dark grey overcoat stared in across the trucks lowered tailgate at its contents and shuddered hands thrust deep in his pockets he turned to a second man dressed in the white smock of a technician and grimaced comrade krakovitch he grunted what the hell are they and what are they doing here felix krakovitch glanced at him shook his head said you wouldnt understand if i told you and if you understood you wouldnt believe like his exboss gregor borowitz krakovitch considered all kgb low lifeforms he would keep information and assistance to the barest minimum within certain limits of prudence and personal safety of course the kgb werent much for forgiving and forgetting the blocky special policeman shrugged lit a stubby brown cigarette and drew deeply on its carboard tube try me anyway he said its cold here but i am warm enough see when i go to report to comrade andropov and i am sure i need not remind you of his politburo status he will want some answers which is why i want answers from you so we will stand out here until zombies said krakovitch abruptly mummies men dead for four hundred years you can tell that from their weapons and for the first time he heard the insistent ringing of the telephone turned towards the door in the corrugated iron facade of the covered courtyard where are you going the kgb man came alive took his hands out of his pockets do you expect me to tell yuri andropov that the the mayhem here was done by dead men he almost choked on the last two words coughed long and loud finally spat on the snow stand there long enough krakovitch said over his shoulder in those exhaust fumes smoking that shredded rope and you might as well climb in the truck with them he stepped through the door let it slam shut behind him zombies the agent wrinkled his nose looked again at the truckload of cadavers he couldnt know it but they were crimean tartars butchered en masse in by russian reinforcements hastening to a ravaged moscow they had died and gone down in blood and mire and bog to lie partpreserved in the peat of a lowlying field and to come up again two nights ago to wage war on the chateau they had won that war the tartars and their young english leader harry keogh for after the fighting only five of the chateaus defenders still lived krakovitch was one of them five out of thirtythree and the only enemy casualty harry keogh himself amazing odds unless one counted the tartars but one could hardly count them for they had been dead before it started these were krakovitchs thoughts as he entered what long ago had been a cobbled courtyard now a large area of plastictiled floor partitioned into airy conservatories small apartments and laboratories where ebranch operatives had studied and practised their esoteric talents in comparative comfort or whatever condition or environment best suited their work fortyeight hours ago the place had been immaculate now it was a shambles where bulletholes patterned the partition walls and the effects of blast and fire could be seen on every hand it was a wonder the place hadnt been burned to the ground completely gutted in a mainly cleared area the socalled investigation control room a table had been erected and supported the ringing telephone krakovitch made his way towards it pausing to drag aside a large piece of utility wall which partly blocked his path underneath lying halfburied in crumbled plaster broken glass and the crushed remains of a wooden chair a human arm and hand lay like a huge grey salted slug its flesh was shrivelled the colour of leather and the bone where it projected in a knob at the shoulder was shiny white it was almost a fossil thered be many more fragments such as this yet to be discovered scattered throughout the chateau but apart from their repulsive looks theyd be harmless now not so on the night of the horror krakovitch had seen portions like this one without heads or brains to guide them crawling fighting killing he shuddered moved the arm aside with his foot went to the telephone hello krakovitch who the unknown caller snapped back krakovitch are you in charge there it was a female voice very efficient i suppose i am yes krakovitch answered what can i do for you for me nothing for the party leader only he can say hes been trying to contact you for the last five minutes krakovitch was tired he hadnt slept since the nightmare doubted if hed ever sleep again he and the other four survivors one of them a raving madman had only come out of the security vault on sunday morning when the air was finished since then the others had made their statements been sent home the chateau bronnitsy was a high security establishment so their stories wouldnt be for general consumption in fact krakovitch being the only genuinely coherent member of the survivors had demanded that the case in toto be sent direct to leonid brezhnev that was standing orders anyway brezhnev was the top man personally and directly responsible for ebranch despite the fact that hed left all of it to gregor borowitz but the branch had been important to the party leader and hed seen everything that came out of it also borowitz must have told him quite a bit about the branchs paranormal work literally espionage so that brezhnev should be at least partqualified to pass judgement on what had happened here or so krakovitch hoped in any case it had to be better than trying to explain it to yuri andropov krakovitch the phone barked at him er yes sir felix krakovitch i was on comrade borowitzs staff felix why tell me your first name you expect me to call you by your first name the voice had a hard edge but it also sounded like its owner was eating something mushy krakovitch had heard several of brezhnevs infrequent speeches this could only be him i no of course not comrade party leader but i listen are you in charge there yes er comrade party forget all that stuff brezhnev rasped i dont need reminding who i am just answers is there no one left who is senior to you no anyone whos your equal four of them but ones a madman eh he went mad when when it happened there was a pause then the voice went on a little less harshly do you know borowitz is dead yes a neighbour found him in his dacha at zhukovka the neighbour was exkgb and got in touch with comrade andropov who sent a man here hes here now i know another name brezhnevs thick gurgling voice continued boris dragosani what of him dead and before krakovitch could check his tongue thank god eh youre glad one of your comrades is dead i yes im glad krakovitch was too tired to answer in any way but truthfully straight from the heart i think he was probably part of it at least i believe he brought it down on us his body is still here also the bodies of our other dead and that of harry keogh a british agent we think and also the tartars brezhnev was quiet now krakovitch sighed the man wasnt a slave to convention after all yes but no longer animate he answered another pause krakovitch er felix did you say ive read the statements of the other three are they true no chance of an error mass hypnotism or delusion or something was it really as bad as that they are true no chance of an error it was as bad as that felix listen take over there i mean you take over i dont want ebranch shut down it has been more than beneficial to our security and borowitz was more valuable to me personally than many of my generals would ever believe so i want the branch rebuilt and it looks like youve got the job krakovitch felt like a swatted fly knocked off his feet lost for words i comrade i mean can you do it krakovitch wasnt crazy it was the chance of a lifetime it will take years but yes ill try to do it good but if you take it on youll have to do more than just try felix let me know what you need and ill see you get it the first thing i want is answers but im the only one who gets those answers you understand this one has to be screwed down it mustnt leak and that reminds me did you say there was someone from the kgb with you right now hes outside in the grounds get him brezhnevs voice was harsh again bring him to the phone let me speak to him at once krakovitch started back across the floor but at that moment the door opened to admit the man in question he squared his shoulders looked at krakovitch in a surly narroweyed manner said we havent finished comrade im afraid we have krakovitch felt shored up buoyant as a cork it must be his fatigue beginning to work on him theres someone on the phone for you eh for me the other pushed by him who is it someone from the office not sure krakovitch lied head office i think the kgb man frowned at him scowled snatched up the phone from the table yanov here what is it im busy down here and his face immediately underwent rapid changes of expression and colour he jerked visibly and almost staggered only the phone seemed to be holding him up yessir oh yes sir yes sir yes yessir no sir i will sir yes sir but i no sir yessir he looked sick held out the phone for krakovitch glad to be rid of it as krakovitch took the instrument from him the agent hissed viciously fool thats the party leader krakovitch let his eyes go big and round made an o with his mouth then he said casually into the mouthpiece krakovitch here and at once held the phone towards the kgb man let him hear brezhnevs voice felix has that prick gone yet it was the special policemans turn to make an o hes going now krakovitch answered he nodded sharply towards the door out and do try to remember what the party leader told you for your own good the kgb operative shook his head dazedly licked his lips headed for the door he was still whitefaced at the door he turned thrust his chin out i he began goodbye comrade krakovitch dismissed him now hes gone he finally confirmed after the door had slammed shut good i dont want them interfering they didnt fool about with gregor and i dont want them fooling with you any problems from them and you get straight back to me yes sir now heres what i want but first tell me have the branch records survived almost everythings intact except for our agents theres damage a lot but records installations the chateau itself in decent order i think manpowers a different story ill tell you what we have left theres myself and three other survivors six more on holiday in various parts three fairly good telepaths on permanent duty in connection with the british american and french embassies and another four or five field agents out in the world with twentyeight dead weve lost almost twothirds of our staff most of the best men are gone yes yes brezhnev was impatient manpower is important thats why i asked about records recruitment thats your first task it will take a long time i know but get on it old gregor once told me that you have special sorts who can spot others with the talent right ive still got one good spotter yes krakovitch answered giving an unconscious nod ill start using him at once and ill commence studying comrade borowitzs records of course good now then see how quickly you can get that place cleaned up those tartar corpses burn em and dont let anyone see them i dont care how thats done but do it then put in a comprehensive works chit for repairs on the chateau ill have it actioned at once in fact ill have a man here on this number or another number hell give you who you can contact at any time for anything thats from right now youll keep him informed and hell keep me informed hell be your only boss except hell deny you nothing see how highly i prize you felix right that should get things started as for the rest felix krakovitch i want to know how this happened are they that far ahead the british the americans the chinese i mean how could one man this harry keogh do so much damage comrade krakovitch answered you mentioned boris dragosani i once watched him work he was a necromancer he sniffed out the secrets of dead men ive seem him do things to corpses that gave me nightmares for months you ask how harry keogh could do so much damage from what little ive so far been able to discover it seems he was capable of almost anything telepathy teleportation even dragosanis own necromancy he was their best but i think keogh was many steps ahead of dragosani its one thing to torture dead men and drain their secrets from their blood and brains and guts but its quite another to call them up out of their graves and make them fight for you teleportation for a moment the party leader was thoughtful then came on impatient you know the more i hear the less im inclined to believe i wouldnt believe except i saw borowitzs results and how else am i to explain a couple of hundred tartar corpses eh but right now ive spent enough time with you on this i have other things to do in five more minutes ill have your gobetween on this line think about it and tell him what you want done anything you need if he can come up with something he will hes had this kind of assignment before well not exactly this kind one last thing yes krakovitchs head was whirling let me make it quite clear i want the answers as soon as possible but there has to be a limit and that limits a year by then the branch will be working at percent efficiency and you and i will know everything and well understand everything you see when we have all the answers felix then well be as smart as the people who did this right that seems logical party leader it is so get to it good luck the phone emitted a continuous buzzing tone krakovitch replaced it carefully in its cradle stared at it for a moment then started for the door in his head he made lists in loose order of precedence of things to be done in the western world such a massive tragedy could never be covered up but here in the ussr it wouldnt be nearly so difficult krakovitch wasnt sure whether that was a good thing or not the dead men had families they would now have to be told some sort of story maybe there had been a castastrophic accident that must be his gobetweens responsibility all ebranch personnel must be recalled at once including the three who knew what had happened here they were in their homes right now but they knew enough to say nothing the bodies of twentyeight ebranch colleagues would have to be gathered up coffined prepared as best as possible for burial and that would have to be done here by the survivors and those returning from leave of absence recruitment must be started at once a second in command must be appointed so that krakovitch could begin a proper complete investigation from scratch that was something he must do himself just as brezhnev had ordered it and he would think of when the first were working but before any of that outside he found the driver of the army truck a young sergeant in uniform whats your name he asked listlessly he must get some sleep soon sergeant gulharov sir he slammed to attention first name sergei sirr sergei call me felix tell me did you ever hear of felix the cat the other shook his head i have a friend who collects old films cartoons crakovitch told him shrugging he has connections anyway theres a funny american cartoon character called felix the cat hes a very wary fellow this felix cats usually are you know in the british army they call bomb disposal officers felix too they have to tread so very warily ah maybe my mother should have called me sergei eh the sergeant scratched his head sir never mind said krakovitch tell me do you carry spare fuel only whats in the tank sir about fifty litres krakovitch nodded right lets get in the cab and ill ell you where to drive he directed him around the chateau to a bunker near the helicopter landing area where they kept the avgas it was very close but better to take the truck to the avgas than bring the avgas to the truck on their way bumping over the rough ground the sergeant asked sir what happened here for the first time krakovitch noticed that his eyes had a glazed look he had helped load his trucks awful cargo never ask that sort of question krakovitch told him in fact as long as youre here which will probably be a long long time dont ask any questions just do as youre told they loaded the cans of avgas just inside the trucks tailgate and drove to a wooded corner of the chateaus the chateau itself that the tank did go and by then the truck was a blazing shell anyway hearing the thunderous roar and feeling something of its concussion they looked back cab and chassis and superstructure had all flown apart bits of blazing debris were falling in the snow a mushroom of smoke shot with flame was uncurling itself high over the trees it was done krakovitch spoke for some time on the telephone to his gobetween an anonymous voice which seemed hardly interested in what he was saying yet precise and cutting as a razor when its owner required more information he finished off by saying oh and ive a new assistant here a sergeant sergei gulharov from the supply and transport barracks in serpukhov im keeping him on can you get him permanently posted to the chateau as of now hes young and strong and ill have plenty of work for him yes ill do that came the cool clear answer hell be your oddjob man you say and my bodyguard said krakovitch eventually im not much physically very well ill check out the chances of getting him on a military close protection course weapons too if hes not up to scratch of course we could take a shortcut and get you a professional no krakovitch was firm no professionals this one will do hes fairly innocent and i like that its refreshing krakovitch said the voice on the other end i need to know this are you a homosexual of course not oh i see no i need him genuinely and he looks about as gay as a shipyard welder ill tell you why i want him right now because im alone here and if you were here youd know what i mean yes im told youve had to weather quite a lot very well leave it with me thank you said krakovitch he broke the connection gulharov was impressed just like that he said you have a lot of power sir it seems that way doesnt it krakovitch smiled tiredly listen im dead on my feet but theres one more thing to do before i can sleep and let me tell you if you think what youve seen so far is unpleasant what youre about to see is far worse come with me he led the way through the chaos of shattered rooms and piled rubble from the coveredin courtyard area into the main original building then up two flights of timehollowed stone stairs into one of the twin towers this was where gregor borowitz had had his office which dragosani had turned into his control room on the night of the horror the stairwell was scarred and blackened with tiny fragments of shrapnel flattened lead bullets and copper cases lying everywhere the stink of cordite was still heavy in the air that would be from blast grenades tossed down here from above when the tower came under attack but none of this had stopped harry keogh and his tartars on the second floor landing the door to a tiny anteroom stood open the room had served as an office for borowitzs secretary yul galenski krakovitch had known him personally a generally timid man a clerk with no extrasensory talent just staff between the open door and the stairwells safety rail face down on the landing lay a corpse in the chateaus duty uniform grey coveralls with a single diagonal yellow stripe across the heart not galenski but the duty officer the corpses face lay quite flat on the floor in a pool of blood flatter than it should that was because there was very little of actual face left just a raw flat mess krakovitch and gulharov stepped carefully over the body entered the little office behind a desk crumpled in one corner galenski sat clutching a rusty curved sword where it stuck out of his chest it had been driven home with such force that he was pinned to the wall his eyes were still open but no longer terrified from some people death steals all emotion mother in heaven gulharov whispered hed never seen anything like this he wasnt even a combat soldier not yet they went through a second door into what had been borowitzs office it was spacious with great bulletproof bay windows looking out and down from the towers curving stone wall toward distant woodland the carpet was burned and stained here and there a massive block of a desk in solid oak stood in one corner receiving light from the windows and protection from the stone wall at its back as for the rest of the room it was a shambles and a nightmare a shattered radio spilled its guts onto the floor walls were pockmarked and the door splintered from the impact of sprayed bullets the body of a young man in western styled clothes lay where it had fallen ripped by machine gun fire almost in two pieces behind the door it was glued to the floor with its own blood this was harry keoghs body nothing much to look at but there was no fear or pain on his white unmarked face as for the nightmare that lay propped against the wall on the other side of the room boris dragosani said krakovitch pointing the thing pinned to his chest is what controlled him i think he stepped carefully across the room to stand gazing down on what was left of dragosani and his parasite creature gulharov was right behind him not wanting to get too close both of dragosanis legs were broken and lay at weird angles his arms hung slack down the wall to the skirting elbows just off the floor forearms at ninety degrees and hands projecting well beyond the cuffs of his jacket they were hands like claws big powerful and grasping frozen in dragosanis final spasm his face was a rictus of agony made worse by the fact that it was hardly a human face at all and worse still by the gash that split his skull ear to ear but his face dragosanis jaws were long as some great hounds gaping open to display curving needle teeth his skull was misshapen and his ears were pointed where they curved forward and lay flat against his temples his eyes were ruptured red pits above a nose long and wrinkled and flattened to show gaping nostrils like the convoluted snout of some great bat that was how he looked part man part wolf part bat and the thing pinned to his chest was worse what what is that gulharov gasped out the question god help me krakovitch shook his head i dont know but it lived in him i mean inside him it only came out at the end the trunk of the thing had the form of a great leech some eighteen inches long but tapering to a tail there were no limbs it seemed to cling to dragosanis chest by suction and was held there by a sharp stake formed of the splintered hardwood stock of a heavyduty machine gun its skin was greygreen corrugated gulharov saw that its head flat and cobralike but eyeless blind lay on the carpet a little apart like like some gigantic tapeworm gulharovs horror was plain on his face something like that krakovitch nodded grimly but intelligent evil and deadly why have we come up here gulharovs adams apple bobbed there are fifty million better places to be krakovitchs face was white pinched he could fully appreciate gulharovs feelings weve come up here because we have to burn this thats why his talent again warning him that both dragosani and his symbiont must be destroyed utterly he looked around saw a tall steel filing cabinet standing against the wall to one side of the door he and gulharov tore out the shelving turning the cabinet into a metal coffin they lowered it onto its back and dragged it across the floor to dragosani you take his shoulders ill take his thighs said krakovitch once weve got him in here we can close the door and slide the cabinet down the steps frankly i dont fancy touching him ill touch him as little as possible this way has to be best they gingerly lifted the corpse strained to get it over the rim of the cabinet lowered it inside gulharov went to close the door and the projecting stake got in the way he grasped the splintered stock in both hands and the mental warning hit krakovitch like a fist in his heart dont touch that he yelled but too late as gulharov wrenched the stake free so the leechthing headless as it was came alive its hideous sluglike body began to lash in a frenzy so that it almost ejected itself from the cabinet at the same time its leathery skin broke open in a dozen places putting out protoplasmic tentacles that writhed and vibrated in a sort of mindless agony these pseudopods whipped out struck the sides of the cabinet and recoiled settled on dragosanis body they passed through clothing and dead flesh and burrowed into him more of them sprouted from the main body they formed barbs hooked themselves into dragosanis flesh one of the tentacles found his chest cavity it thickened rapidly to the diameter of a mans wrist the rest dissolved their barbs released their holds withdrew and followed the main branch into him with a final sucking plop the entire organism drew itself down into dragosanis body his trunk began to heave and throb where it lay in the cabinet while all of this occurred so gulharov had danced away and clambered up onto the desk he was mouthing halfinarticulate obscenities shrieking like a woman and he was pointing at something krakovitch almost numb with shock and horror saw the leechcreatures flat cobra head vibrating on the floor flipping and flopping like a stranded flatfish he gave a cry of loathing began to panic then gripped himself tight and drove the panic out finally he slammed the cabinet door shut and shot the bolt he grabbed a metal drawer from the cabinets scattered guts yelled well help me gulharov got down off the desk he still had the stake was hanging on to it like grim death prodding the flopping head and cursing all the time under his breath finally he juggled the thing into krakovitchs drawer krakovitch slammed a section of shelving down on top of it and gulharov brought a pair of heavy ledgers to put on top of that both cabinet and drawer shuddered and shook for a few seconds more then were still like a pair of ghosts krakovitch and gulharov faced each other both of them panting white as sheets and roundeyed then krakovitch snarled reached out and slapped the others face bodyguard he shouted bloody bodyguard he slapped him again hard bloody hell i im sorry i didnt know what to gulharov was trembling like a leaf looked like he was going to faint krakovitch calmed down he could hardly blame him its all right he said its all right now listen well burn the head up here well do that first right now go quickly fetch avgas staggering a little gulharov went he was back in record time carrying a jerrycan they slid the shelving over the drawer open a crack poured avgas there was no movement from inside the drawer enough said krakovitch any more and therell be one hell of an explosion now then help me drag the cabinet through into the other room in a moment they were back and krakovitch tipped out the drawers of borowitzs desk he found what he was looking for a small ball of string he snapped off a ten foot length soaked it in avgas carefully dangled one end through the crack into the drawer then he laid the string out on the floor in a straight line towards the door and took out gulharovs matches they shielded their eyes as he lit the fuse blue fire raced across the floor leaped into the drawer there was a dull thump and shelving ledgers and all hit the ceiling then fell back to the floor the metal drawer was an inferno in which the flat snakehead danced and skittered but not for long as the drawer began to buckle under the heat and the carpet about it blackened and burst into flames so the thing in the drawer puffed up and split open and quickly became liquescent and then it too burned but krakovitch and gulharov waited a full minute more before they put out the fire krakovitch gave a curt nod well at least we know the thing burns he said it was probably dead anyway but by my books when a things dead it lies still they bumped the cabinet downstairs two flights to the ground floor then out through the battletorn building into the grounds krakovitch stood guard on it while gulharov went back for the avgas when he returned krakovitch said this will be the tricky bit first we pour some of this stuff around the cabinet that way when we open it if whats inside is active we just jump back out of range and toss a match until its quiet and so on gulharov seemed uncertain but he was far more alert now they poured avgas on to and around the cabinet and then gulharov got well back out of it krakovitch slid back the bolt threw the door clangingly open inside dragosani stared into the sky his chest stirred a little but that was all as krakovitch began to pour avgas carefully into the cabinet near dragosanis feet gulharov came forward dont use too much it was the sergeants turn to caution or it will go off like a bomb when the fuel swirled almost an inch deep around dragosanis prone form evaporating furiously the dead mans chest gave another sudden lurch krakovitch stopped pouring stared backed off a little outside the circle of danger gulharov stood with a match ready to strike a slickly shining greygreen tendril sprouted upwards from dragosanis chest its tip formed a knob as big as a fist which in turn formed an eye just seeing that orb krakovitch knew there was no thought behind it no sentience it was vacant staring made no connections and carried no emotions krakovitch doubted if it even saw certainly there was no longer any brain for it to relay its message to the eye melted back into protoflesh was replaced by small jaws which clashed mindlessly then it sank down again out of sight felix get out of there gulharov was nervous krakovitch backed out of the circle gulharov struck a match tossed it in a moment the cabinet was an inferno like the oblong mouth of a jet engine on test the cabinet hurled a pale blue sheet of fire roaring into the cold air a shimmering column of intense heat and then dragosani sat up gulharov clutched krakovitch clung to him oh god oh mother hes alive he croaked no krakovitch denied tearing himself free the thing in him is alive but mindless its all instinct with no brain to govern it it would flee but doesnt know how to or even what its fleeing from if you spear a seacucumber it reacts spills out its guts no mind just reaction look look its melting and indeed it seemed that dragosani was melting smoke curled upward from his blackened shell layers of skin peeled away bursting into flame the fats of his body ran like candle wax and were consumed by the fire the thing inside him felt the heat reacted dragosanis trunk shuddered vibrated convulsed his arms shot out straight then fell to dangle over the sides of the blazing cabinet where all the while they jerked and twitched his clothing was completely burned away by now and as krakovitch and gulharov watched and shuddered so his crisped flesh burst open here and there putting out frantic whipping tendrils that melted and slopped down into the furnace in a very little while he fell back and was still and the two men stood in the snow and watched the fire until it burned itself out it took all of twenty minutes but they stood there anyway pm august the big london hotel within easy walking distance of whitehall contained rather more than its exterior might suggest in fact the entire top floor was given over to a company of international financial entrepreneurs which was the sum total of the hotel managers knowledge about it the company had its own elevator at the rear of the building private stairs even its own fire escape indeed the company owned the top floor which was therefore entirely outside the hotels sphere of control and operation in short the top floor was the headquarters of the most secret of all british secret services namely intesp the british equivalent of that russian organisation housed just outside moscow at the chateau bronnitsy but the hotel was only the headquarters there were also two factories one in dorset and the other in norfolk directlinked to each other and to the hq by telephone radiotelephone and computer such links though topsecurity screened were open to sophisticated abuse of course a clever hacker might get in one day hopefully before that happened the branch would have developed its telepaths to such an extent that all of this technological junk would be unnecessary radio waves travel at a mere miles per second but human thought is instantaneous and carries a far more vivid and finished picture such were alec kyles own thoughts as he sat at his desk and formulated security standing orders for the six special branch officers whose sole task in life was the personal security of an infant boy just one month old a child called harry keogh harry jnr the future head of intesp harry said kyle out loud to no one in particular you can have the job right now if you still want it no came the answer at once startlingly clear in kyles mind not now maybe not ever kyles mouth fell open and he started upright in his swivel chair he knew what this was had known something very much similar at a time some eight months ago it was telepathy yes but it was more than telepathy it was the infant hed just been thinking about the child whose mind housed all that was left of the greatest esp talent in the world harry keogh christ kyle whispered and now he knew what it had been about it being the dream or nightmare hed had last night when hed been covered with leeches as big as kittens whose mouths had fastened on him to drain his blood while he had leaped and gibbered in a glade of stirless trees until hed been too weak to fight any longer then hed fallen on the earth amidst the pine needles and the leeches had clung to him and hed known that he was becoming a leech and that mercifully had scared him wide awake as for the dreams meaning kyle had long since given up trying to read meanings into such precognitive glimpses that was the trouble with them they were usually cryptic rarely selfelucidating but certainly hed known that the dream was one of those dreams and now he guessed that this had something to do with it too harry he breathed the query into the suddenly frigid atmosphere of the room his breath actually plumed in the air in the space of mere seconds the temperature had taken a plunge just like last time something was forming in the middle of the room in front of kyles desk the smoke of his cigarette trembled there and the air seemed to waver he got up crossed quickly to the window and adjusted the blinds the room grew dim and the figure in front of his desk took on more form kyles intercom buzzed urgently and he jumped six inches he leaped to his desk hit the receive button and a breathless voice said alec theres something here it was carl quint a toprank psychic sensitive a spotter kyle pressed the send button held it down i know its with me now but its ok ive been halfexpecting it now he pressed the command button spoke to the entire hq kyle here i dont want to talk to anybody for for as long as it takes no messages no incoming calls and no questions listen in if you like but dont try to interfere ill get back to you he pressed the secure button on his desk computer keyboard and door and window locks audibly snapped shut and now he and harry keogh were completely alone kyle forced himself to relax stared at the ghost of keogh where it confronted him across his desk and he thought an old thought one which had never been far away not since the first day hed come here to work for intesp funny bloody outfit robots and romantics super science and the supernatural telemetry and telepathy computerised probability patterns and precognition gadgets and ghosts no ghost alec keogh answered with a wan immaterial smile thought we went into all of that last time kyle thought about pinching himself but didnt bother hed gone through all of that last time too last time he spoke out loud because that was easier for him but that was eight months ago harry i had started to think wed never hear from you again maybe you wouldnt have said the other his lips moving not at all for believe me ive plenty to keep me occupied but somethings come up kyles awe was ebbing his pulse gradually slowing to its norm he leaned forward in his chair looked the other up and down oh it was keogh all right but not exactly the same as the last time last time kyles first thought had been that the apparition was supernatural not merely paranormal or espengendered but actually supernatural extramundane not of this world just like now the office scanners had failed to detect it it had come and told kyle a fantastic true story and gone without leaving a trace no not quite for hed written down all that had been said even thinking about that his wrist ached but you couldnt photograph the thing couldnt record its voice couldnt harm or interfere with it in any way the entire hq was now listening in on kyles conversation with this this with harry keogh and yet theyd hear only kyles voice but keogh was here at least the central heatings thermostat knew it the heating had just come on turning itself up several notches to compensate for the sudden drop in temperature yes and carl quint knew it too the figure seemed etched in pale blue light insubstantial as a moonbeam less than a puff of smoke incorporeal yet there was a power in it an unbelievable power taking into account the fact that his neonlimned feet werent quite touching the floor keogh must be about fiveten in height if his flesh were real instead of luminous filament he would weigh maybe nine and a half to ten stone everything about him was now vaguely fluorescent as if shining with some faint inner light so kyle couldnt be sure about colouring his hair an untidy mop might be sandy his face slightly freckled he would be twentyone twentytwo years old his eyes were interesting they looked at kyle and yet seemed to look right through him as if he were the apparition and not the other way about they were blue those eyes a startling almost colourless blue neon but more than this there was that in those eyes which said they knew more than any twentytwo year old had any right to know the wisdom of ages seemed locked in them the knowledge of centuries lying just beneath the shimmer of blue haze which covered them apart from that his features would be fine like blue porcelain and seemingly equally fragile his hands slim tapering his shoulders drooped a little his skin in general apart from the freckles pale and unblemished but for those eyes you probably wouldnt look twice at him on the street he was justa young man or had been and now now he was something more harry keoghs body had no real physical existence now but his mind went on and his mind was housed in a new quite literally new body kyle found himself starting to examine that part of the apparition quickly checked himself what was there to examine in any case it could wait wasnt important all that mattered was that keogh was here and that he had something important to say somethings come up kyle repeated the keogh projections statement made it a question what sort of something harry something monstrous right now i can give you only the barest outline i simply dont know enough about it not yet but do you remember what i told you about the russian ebranch and about dragosani i know there was no way you could check it all out but have you looked into it at all do you believe what i told you about dragosani while keogh spoke to him so kyle had stared fascinated at that facet of him which was different that addition to him since the last time hed seen or sensed him for now superimposed over the apparitions abdomen suspended in midair and slowly spinning on its own axis turning in the space that keoghs body occupied there floated a naked male baby or the ghost of one just as insubstantial as keogh himself the child was curled like a foetus floating in some invisible churning fluid like some strange biological exhibit like a hologram but it was a real baby and alive and kyle knew that it too was harry keogh about dragosani kyle came back to earth yes i believe you i have to believe you i checked out as much as i could and it was all exactly as you said and as for borowitzs branch whatever you did there it was devastating they contacted us a week later the russians and asked us if we wanted you i mean my body if we wanted it back yes they contacted us you understand direct it didnt come through diplomatic channels they werent ready to admit that they existed and didnt expect us to admit that we existed therefore you didnt exist but they asked us if we wanted you back anyway with borowitz gone they have a new boss felix krakovitch he said we could have you if wed tell them how how you did what you did to them what exactly youd done to them im sorry harry but we had to deny you tell them we didnt know you actually we didnt know you only i knew you and sir keenan before me but if wed admitted you were one of ours what youd done might be construed as warfare actually it was mayhem said keogh listen alec this cant be like the last time we talked i may not have the time on the metaphysical plane i have comparative freedom in the mobius continuum im a free agent but here in the physical now im a virtual prisoner in little harry right now hes asleep and i can use his subconscious mind as my own but when hes awake his minds his own and like a magnet im drawn back to it the stronger he gets the more his mind learns the less freedom for me eventually ill be forced to leave him entirely for an existence along the mobius way if i get the chance ill explain all of that later but for now we dont know how long hell sleep and so we have to use our time wisely and what i have to say cant wait and it somehow concerns dragosani kyle frowned but dragosanis dead you told me that yourself keoghs face the face of his apparition was grave now do you remember what he was this dragosani he was a necromancer said kyle at once no shadow of doubt in his mind much like you he saw his mistake immediately and could have bitten his tongue unlike me keogh corrected him was i am a necroscope not a necromancer dragosani stole the secrets of the dead like like an insane dentist yanking healthy teeth without an anaesthetic me i talk to the dead and respect them and they respect me but very well i know that was a slip of the tongue i know you didnt mean that so yes he was a necromancer but because of what the old thing in the ground did to him he was more than that he was worse than that of course now kyle remembered you mean he was also a vampire keoghs shimmering image nodded thats exactly what i mean and thats why im here now you see youre the only one in the world who can do anything about it you and your branch and maybe your russian counterparts and when you know what im talking about then youll have to do something about it such was keoghs intensity such the warning in his mental voice that gooseflesh crept on kyles spine do something about what harry about the rest of them the apparition answered you see alec dragosani and thibor ferenczy werent the only ones and god only knows how many more there are vampires kyle thrilled with horror he remembered only too well that story keogh had told him some eight months ago youre sure oh yes in the mobius continuum looking out through the doors of time past and time to come ive seen their scarlet threads i wouldnt have known them might never have come across them but they cross young harrys blue life thread yes and they cross yours too hearing that it was as if the cold blade of a psychic knife lanced into kyles heart harry he said stumblingly youd youd better tell me all you know and then what i must do tell you as much as i can and then well try to decide whats to be done as to how i know what im about to tell you the apparition shrugged im a necroscope remember ive talked to thibor ferenczy himself as i once promised him i would and ive talked to one other a recent victim more of him later but mainly the story is thibors chapter two the old thing in the ground trembled however minutely shuddered slightly strove to return to his immemorial dreaming something was intruding threatening to rouse him up from his dark slumbers but sleep had become a habit which satisfied his every need almost he clung to his loathsome dreams of madness and mayhem the hell of living and the horror of dying and the pleasures of blood blood blood and felt the cold embrace of the clotted earth closing him in weighing him down holding him here in his darkling grave and yet the earth was familiar and no longer held any terrors for him the darkness was like that of a shuttered room or deep vault an impenetrable gloom entirely in keeping the forbidding nature and location of his mausoleum not only set him apart but kept him protected he was safe here damned forever certainly doomed for all time yes barring some major miracle of intervention but safe too and there was much to be said for safety safe from the men mere men most of them who had put him here for in his dreaming the wizened thing had forgotten that those men were long dead and their sons dead and theirs and theirs the old thing in the ground had lived for five hundred years and as long again had lain undead in his unhallowed grave above him in the gloom of a glade beneath stirless snowladen trees the tumbled stones and slabs of his tomb told something of his story but only the thing himself knew all of it his name had been but no the wamphyri have no names as such his hosts name then had been thibor ferenczy and in the beginning thibor had been a man but that had been almost a thousand years ago the thibor part of the thing in the ground existed still but changed mutated mingled and metamorphosed along with its vampire guest the two were one now inseparably fused but in dreams that spanned a millennium still thibor could return to his roots go back to the immensely cruel past in the very beginning he had not been a ferenczy but an ungar though that was of no account now his forefathers were farmers who came from a hungarian princedom across the carpathians to settle on the banks of the dniester where it flowed down to the black sea but settling was hardly the word for it they had had to fight vikings on the river where they came exploring from the black sea the khazars and vassal magyars from the steppes finally the fierce pechenegi tribes in their constant expansion west and northwards thibor had been a young man then when at last the pechenegi wiped out the rude settlement he called home and he alone survived after that hed fled north to kiev never much of a farmer indeed far more suited for war with his massive size which in those days when most men were small made thibor the wallach something of a giant in kiev he sold himself into the service of vladimir i the vlad made him a small voevod or warrior chief and gave him a hundred men go join my boyars in the south he commanded fend off and kill the pechenegi keep em from crossing the ros and by our new christian god ill give you title and banner both thibor of wallachia thibor had gone to him when he was desperate that much was clear in his dream the thing in the ground remembered how hed answered title and banner keep them my lord but only give me one hundred men more and i shall kill you a thousand pechenegi before returning to kiev aye and ill bring you their thumbs to prove it he got his hundred men also like it or not his banner a golden dragon one forepaw raised in warning the dragon of the true christ brought to us by the greeks vlad told him now the dragon watches over christian kiev russia itself and it roars from your banner with the voice of the lord what mark of your own will you put on it on that same morning he had asked this question of halfadozen other fledgling defenders five boyars with their own followers and one band of mercenaries all of them had taken a symbol to fly with the dragon but not thibor im no boyar sire the wallach had told him with a shrug thats not to say my fathers house was not honourable for it was and built by a decent man but in no way royal no lords or princes blood flows in my veins when ive earned myself a mark then ill set it over your dragon im not sure i like you especially wallach the vlad had frowned then uneasy with this great grim man before him your voice sounds out perhaps a trifle loud from a heart as yet untried but and he too had given a shrug very well choose a device for yourself when you return in triumph and thibor bring me those thumbs or ill likely string you up by yours and that day at noon seven polyglot companies of men had set out from kiev reinforcements for the ensieged defensive positions on the ros one year and one month later thibor returned with nearly all of his men plus another eighty recruited from peasants hiding in the foothills and valleys of the southern khorvaty he made no plea for audience but strode into the vlads own church where he was at worship he left his weary men outside and took in with him only one small sack that rattled and approached prince vladimir svyatoslavich at his prayers and waited for him to finish behind him kievs civilian nobles were deathly silent waiting for their prince to see him finally the vlad and his greek monks turned to thibor the sight they saw was fearsome thibor had soil on him from the fields and forests dirt was ingrained in him he bore a freshly healed scar high on his right cheek to the middle of his jaw which made a pale stripe of scar tissue that cut almost to the bone also he had gone away as a peasant and returned something else entirely haughty as a hawk with his nose slightly hooked under bushy eyebrows that very nearly came together in the middle he gazed out of yellow unblinking eyes he wore moustaches and a scraggy twisting black beard also the armour of some pechenegi chief chased in gold and silver and an earring set with a gemstone in the lobe of his left ear he had shaved his head with the exception of black forelocks that hung one to each side in the manner of certain nobles and in all his mien there was no sign that he knew he stood in a holy place or even considered his whereabouts i know you now the vlad hissed thibor the wallach dont you fear the true god dont you tremble before the cross of christ i was praying for our deliverance and you and i have brought it to you thibors voice was deep doleful he tipped out his sack onto the flags the princes retinue and the nobles of kiev where they stood back from him who ruled over them gasped and gaped bones clattered white in a heap at the vlads feet what he choked what thumbs said thibor i had the flesh boiled off them lest their stink offend the pechenegi are driven back trapped between the dniester the bug and the sea your boyar army hems them in hopefully they can deal with them without me and mine for i have heard that the polovtsy are rising like the wind in the east also in turkeyland armies wax for war you have heard you have heard and are you some mighty voevod then do you set yourself up as the ears of vladimir and what do you mean you and yours the two hundred men you marched with are mine at that thibor took a deep breath he paced forward then paused then he bowed low if inelegantly and said of course they are yours prince also the fourscore refugees ive gathered together and turned into warriors all are yours as for being your ears if i have heard falsely then strike me deaf but my work is finished in the south and i thought you had more need of me here soldiers are few in kiev this day and her borders are wide the vlads eyes remained veiled the pechenegi are at bay you say and do you give yourself credit for this in all modesty this and more and youve brought my men back with you without casualty a handful are fallen thibor shrugged but i found eighty to replace them show me they went to the great doors out onto the wide steps of the church there in the square thibors men waited in silence some upon horses but most afoot all armed to the teeth and looking very fierce they were the same sorry bunch the wallach had taken away with him but no longer sorry his standard flew from three tall flagstaffs the golden dragon and upon its back a black bat with of carnelian the vlad nodded your mark he commented perhaps sourly a bat the black bat of the wallachs aye said thibor one of the monks spoke up but atop the dragon thibor grinned at him wolfishly would you have the dragon pissing on my bat the monks took the prince aside while thibor stood waiting he could not hear what was said but hed imagined it often enough in times since these men are utterly loyal to him see how proud they stand beneath his banner the senior monk would have whispered in that sly greek way it could be a nuisance and vlad does it trouble you i have five times their number right here in the city the greek but these men have been tried in battle they are warriors all vlad what are you saying i should fear him ive varyagi blood in me and fear no man greek of course you dont but he sets himself above his station this one can we not find him a task him and a handful of his men and keep the rest of them back here to bolster the citys defences this way in his absence their loyalty will surely swing more rightly to you and vladimir svyatoslavichs eyes narrowing more yet then his nod of approval i have the very thing yes and i believe youre right best to be rid of him these wallachs are a tricky lot far too insular and out loud to the voevod thibor im honouring you tonight at the palace you and five of your best then you can tell me all about your victories but therell be ladies there so see youre washed and leave your armour in your lodgings and tents with a stiff little bow thibor backed off went down the steps to his mount led his men away at his command as they left the square they rattled their weapons and gave a single sharp ringing shout prince vladimir then they were gone into the autumn morning gone into kiev called the city at the edge of the woods despite the disturbance the unknown intrusion the thing in the ground continued to dream night would soon fall and thibor was sensitive to night as a rooster is to the dawn but for now he dreamed that night at the palace a huge place with stone chimneys in every room and wood fires blazing sprinkled with aromatic resins thibor had worn clean but common clothes under a rich red robe taken from some highranking pechenegi his flesh was washed and perfumed tanned like leather and his forelocks freshly greased he was an imposing sight his officers too were spruce though they obviously stood in awe of him still he spoke to them with some familiarity but he was courteous to the ladies attentive to the vlad it was possible that the prince found himself in two minds the wallach would seem to have proved himself a warrior a voevod indeed by rights he should be made a boyar given lands of his own a man will fight even harder if he fights to protect that which is his but there was that sombre something about thibor which the vlad found disquieting so perhaps his greek advisors were right now tell me how you dealt with the pechenegi thibor of wallachia vladimir finally commanded when all were feasting their dishes were several greek sausages wrapped in vine leaves joints roasted in the viking fashion goulashes steaming in huge pots meads and wines came by the gallon all at table stabbed and speared with their knives at smoking meats short bursts of conversation would erupt now and then amidst the general clatter of eating thibors voice though he hardly raised it at all had carried over all of that and gradually the great table had grown quieter the pechenegi come in parties or tribes they are not like a mighty army there is little of unity they have their own chiefs who vie with each other the earthworks and fortifications on the ros at the edge of the wooded steppe have stopped them because they are not united if they came as an army they could cross river and battlements both in a day carrying all away before them but they merely probe around our defences contenting themselves with whatever they can pillage in short sharp forays to east and west this is how they sacked kolomyya on the west flank they crossed the prut by day crept forward in the forests rested overnight and attacked at first light it is their way and so they gradually encroach this is how i saw the situation because the defences are there our soldiers use them we hide behind them the earthworks act as a border we have been content to say south of these works lies the territory of the pechenegi and we must keep him out wherefore the pechenegi barbarian that he is in fact holds us in siege i have sat on the walls of our forts and seen our enemies make camp unafraid smoke from his fires goes up all untroubled because we dont molest him on his ground when i left kiev prince vladimir you said fend off the pechenegi keep him from crossing the ros but i said pursue the fiend and kill him one day i saw a camp of some two hundred they had their women even their children with them they were camped across the river to the west quite apart from the other encampments i split my two hundred in half half went with me across the river in the dusk we stole up on the pechenegi fires they had guards out but most of them were sleeping and we cut their throats in the night without them ever knowing who killed them then we set about the camp but all in silence i had daubed my men in mud any man not daubed was pechenegi in the darkness we slew them flitting from tent to tent we were like great bats in the night and it was very bloody when the camp was awakened half were already dead the rest gave chase we led them back to the ros and them hounding us eager to catch us at the river all of them shouting and screaming their warcries but we shouted and screamed not at all at the river on the pechenegi side my second hundred lay in waiting they were daubed in mud they struck not at their silent muddy brothers but trapped the howling pursuers then we rose up turned in upon the pechenegi slew them to a man and we cut off their thumbs he paused bravo said vladimir the prince faintly another time thibor continued we went to kamenets which was under siege again i had half my men with me the pechenegi about the town saw us gave chase we led them into a steepsided gulley where after we had scrambled through my other half rained down an avalanche upon them i lost many thumbs that time buried under the boulders else i would have brought you back another sackful now there was almost total silence about the table it was not so much the reporting of these deeds that impressed but the stony delivery which lacked all emotion when the pechenegi had raided raped and razed this mans ungar settlement they had turned him into an utterly pitiless killer ive had reports of course svyatoslavich broke the silence if somewhat vague until now and few and far between but this is something to chew on and so my boyars have driven the pechenegi back you say a recent turn of events perhaps they learned something from you eh they learned that standing guard behind high walls achieves nothing said thibor i spoke to them and said summer is at an end the pechenegi far to the south are grown fat and idle from the little work theyve had to do they do not think well come against them they are building permanent settlements winter homes for themselves like the khazars before them they are putting aside the sword in favour of the plough if we strike now theyll fall like grass beneath the scythe then all the boyars banded together crossed the river struck deep into the southern steppes we killed the pechenegi wherever we found them but by then i had heard rumours of a greater peril in the making to the east the polovtsy are rising up they spill over from the great steppes and deserts expand westward soon theyll be at our doors when the khazars fell they left the way open for the pechenegi and after the pechenegi which is why i thought why i dared to think that perhaps the vlad would give me an army and send me east to put down our enemies before they wax too strong for long moments prince vladimir simply sat and stared at him from eyes halflidded then he quietly said youve come a long way in a year and a month wallach and out loud to his guests eat drink talk honour this man we owe him that much but as the feasting continued he got up indicating that thibor should walk with him they went out into the grounds into the cool autumn evening the wood smoke was fragrant under the trees a little way from the palace the prince paused thibor well have to see about this idea of yours this eastward invasion for thats what it would be for im not sure were ready for that its been tried before you know he nodded bitterly the grand prince himself tried it first he tackled the khazars svyatoslav ground them down and the byzantines swept up their pieces and then he had a go at bulgaria and macedonia and while he was at it the nomads laid siege to kiev itself and did he pay for his zeal aye however many sagas are written about him nomads sank him in the river rapids and made his skull into a drinking cup he was hasty you see oh he got rid of the khazars all right but only to let in the damned pechenegi and shall i be hasty too the wallach stood silent for a moment in the dusk youll send me back to the southern steppe then i might and i might not i might stand you down from the fighting entirely make you a boyar give you land and men to look after it for you theres a lot of good land here thibor thibor shook his head then id prefer to return to wallachia im no farmer prince i tried that and the pechenegi came and made a warrior of me since then all my dreams have been red ones dreams of blood the blood of my enemies the enemies of this land and what of my enemies they are the same only show them to me very well said the vlad ill show you one of them do you know the mountains to the west which divide us from the hungarians my fathers were ungars said thibor as for the mountains i was born under them not in the west but in the south in the land of the wallachs beyond the bend in the mountains the prince nodded so you have some experience of mountains and their treachery good but on my side of those peaks beyond galich in that area called the khorvaty after a certain people there lives a boyar who is not my friend i claim him as one who owes allegiance to me but when i called in all my little princelings and boyars he came not when i invite him to kiev he answers not when i express a desire to meet with him he ignores me if he is not my friend then he can only be my enemy he is a dog that comes not to heel a wild dog and his home is a mountain fastness until now ive had neither the time the inclination nor the power to winkle him out but what thibor was astonished his gasp cutting the vlad short im sorry my prince but you no power vladimir svyatoslavich shook his head you dont understand he said of course i have power kiev has power but all so extended as to be almost expended should i recall an army to deal with one unruly princeling and in so doing let the pechenegi come up again should i form up an army from farmers and officials and peasants all unskilled in battle and if i did what then an army could not bring this ferenczy out of his castle if he did not wish to leave it even an army could not destroy him his defences are so strong what they are the mountain passes themselves the gorges the avalanches with a handful of fierce faithful retainers he could hold back any army i muster almost indefinitely oh if i had two thousand men to spare then i might possibly starve him with a siege but at what expense on the other hand what an army cannot achieve might just be possible for one brave and clever and loyal man are you saying you want this ferenczy taken from his castle and brought to you in kiev too late for that thibor he has shown how he respects me how then should i respect him no i want him dead his lands then fall to me his castle on the heights his household and serfs and his death will be an example to others who might think to stand apart then you dont want his thumbs but his head thibors chuckle was throaty without humour i want his head his heart and his standard and i want to burn all three on a bonfire right here in kiev his standard he has a symbol then this ferenczy might i enquire the nature of this blazon by all means said the prince his grey eyes suddenly thoughtful he lowered his voice cast about in the dusk for a moment as if to be doubly sure that no one heard his mark is the horned head of a devil with a forked tongue that drips gouts of blood blood gouts of blood soaking into the black earth the sun had touched the horizon and was burning red there like like a great gout of blood soon the earth would swallow it up the old thing in the ground trembled again its husk of leather and bone slowly cracked open like a desiccated sponge to receive the earths tribute the blood that soaked through leafmould and roots and black centuried soil down to where the thousandyearold thiborcreature lay in his shallow grave subconsciously thibor sensed the seeping blood and knew in the way all dreamers know that it was only part of the dream it would be a different matter when the sun had set and the seepage actually touched him but for now he ignored it returned to that time at the turn of the tenth century when hed been merely human and had gone up into the khorvaty on a mission of murder they had travelled as trappers thibor and his seven as wallachians who followed the carpathian curve on a trek designed to get them deep into the northern forests by the onset of winter in fact they had simply come from kiev through kolomyya and so to the mountains but theyd taken all the paraphernalia of the trapper with them to substantiate their story it had taken them three weeks of steady riding to reach the place in the very lee of the sheer mountains which the current incumbents called moupho aide ferenc yaborov a mouthful they invariably shortened to ferenc which they made to sound like ferengi it meant place of the old one or of the old ferengi and the gypsies spoke of it in lowered tones and with a deal of respect there were maybe a hundred men there some thirty women and as many children half of the men were trappers passing through or prospective settlers uprooted by pechenegi raids on their way to find homes further north many of the latter group had their families with them the remainder were either peasant inhabitants of ferengi yaborov or gypsies come here to winter it out theyd been coming since time immemorial apparently for the old devil who was boyar here was good to them and turned none away indeed in times of hardship hed even been known to supply his wandering occasional tenants with food from his own larder and wine from his cellars thibor asking about food and drink for himself and the others was shown a house of timbers set in a stand of pines it was an inn of sorts with tiny rooms up in the rafters which could only be reached by rope ladders the ladders were drawn up when the boarder wished to sleep down below there were wooden tables and stools and at one end of the large room a bar stocked with small kegs of plum brandy and buckets of sweet ale one wall was built half of stone where burned a fire in the base of a huge chimney on the fire was an iron pot of goulash giving out a heavy paprika reek onions dangled in bunches from nails in the wall close to the fire likewise huge coarseskinned sausages black bread stood in loaves on the tables baked in a stone oven to one side of the fire a man his wife and one scruffy son ran the place gypsies thibor guessed whod chosen to settle here they could have done better he thought feeling cold in the shadows of the looming rocks the mountains whose presence could be felt even indoors it was a gloomy place this frowning and foreboding the wallach had told his men to speak to no one but as they put away their gear ate and drank spoke in muffled tones to each other he himself shared a jug of brandy with his host who are you that gnarled old man asked him do you ask what i have been and where i have been thibor answered thats easier to tell than who i am tell it then if you feel like talking thibor smiled and sipped brandy i was a young boy under the carpatii my father was an ungar who wandered into the borders of the southern steppe to farm him and his brothers and kin and their families ill be brief came the pechenegi all was uprooted our settlement destroyed since then ive wandered fought the barbarian for payment and what little i could find on his body done what i could where and whenever now ill be a trapper ive seen the mountains the steppe the forests farmings a hard life and bloodletting makes a man bitter but in the towns and cities theres money to be had from furs youve roamed a bit yourself ill vow here and there the other shrugged nodded he was swarthy as smokegrimed leather wrinkled as a walnut from extremes of weather lean as a wolf not young by any standards still his hair was shiny black his eyes too and he seemed to have all of his teeth but he moved his limbs carefully and his hands were very crooked id be doing it still if my bones hadnt started to seize up we had a cart of two wheels wrapped in leather which wed break down and carry when the way was rough upon the cart we took our house and goods along with us a big tent with rooms and cooking pots and tools we were we are szgany gypsies and became szgany ferengi when i built this place here he craned his neck and looked up wideeyed at one interior wall of the house it was a look half respectful half fearful there was no window but the wallach knew that the old man stared up at the mountain peaks szgany ferengi thibor repeated you ally yourself to the boyar ferenczy in his castle then the old gypsy lowered his eyes from the unseen heights drew back a little took on a suspicious look thibor quickly poured him more of his own brandy the other remained silent and the wallach shrugged no matter its just that ive heard good things of him he lied my father knew him once indeed the old mans eyes widened thibor nodded one cold winter the ferenczy gave him shelter in his castle my father told me if ever i passed this way i should go up and remind the boyar of that time and thank him on behalf of my father the old man stared at thibor for long moments so youve heard good things of our master have you from your father eh and you were born under the mountains is something strange thibor raised a dark eyebrow the other looked him up and down youre a big man he said grudgingly and strong i can tell also you look fierce a wallach eh whose fathers were ungars well perhaps you are perhaps you are perhaps i am what its said the gypsy whispered drawing closer that the old ferengis true sons always come home to roost in the end they come here seek him out seek out their father would you climb up to see him thibor put on a look of indecision he shrugged i might if i knew the way but these cliffs and passes are treacherous i know the way youve been there thibor tried not to seem too eager the old man nodded oh yes and i could take you but would you go alone the ferengis not one for too many visitors thibor appeared to give it some little thought id want to take two of my friends at least in case the way gets rough huh if these old bones can make it surely yours can just two of them for assistance in the steep places thibors host pursed his lips it would cost you a little something my time and thats understood the wallach stopped him the gypsy scratched his ear what do you know of the old ferengi what have you heard of him thibor saw a chance for knowledge getting information out of people such as these was like drawing the teeth of a bear ive heard he has a great company of men garrisoned with him and that his castle is a fastness impenetrable because of this he swears no fealty pays no taxes on his lands for none may collect it hah the old gypsy laughed out loud thumped the bar poured more brandy a company of men retainers serfs he has none a woman or two perhaps but no men only the wolves guard those passes as for his castle it hugs the cliff one way in for mere men and the same way out unless some unwary fool leans too far from a window as he paused his eyes because suspicious again and did your father tell you that the ferengi had men thibors father had told him nothing of course nor had the vlad for that matter what little he knew was superstitious twaddle hed had from a fellow at court a foolish man who didnt much care for the prince and who in turn was little cared for thibor had no time for ghosts he knew how many men hed killed and not a man of them had come back to haunt him he decided to take a chance hed already learned much of what he wanted to know my father said only that the way was steep and that when he was there many men were camped in and about the castle the old man stared at him slowly nodded it could be it could be the szgany have often wintered with him he came to a decision very well i will take you up if he will see you he laughed at thibors raised eyebrows led him out of the house into the quiet of the afternoon on their way the gypsy took a huge bronze frying pan from its peg a weak sun was poised preparing itself for setting over the grey peaks the mountains brought an early twilight here where already the birds were singing their evening songs we are in time the old man nodded and now we must hope that we are seen he pointed steeply upwards at the looming mountains to where a high jagged black crest etched itself against the grey of the ultimate peaks you see there where the darkness is deepest thibor nodded thats the castle now watch he polished the bottom of the pan on his sleeve then turned it towards the sun catching the weak rays he threw them back into the mountains and traced a line of gold up the crags fainter and fainter the disc of light flickered with distance jumping from scree to flat rock face from fangs to fir clump from trees back to crumbling shale as it climbed ever higher and finally it seemed to thibor that the ray was answered for when at last the gypsy held the pan stiffly in his gnarled hands suddenly that dark angular outcrop hed pointed out seemed to burst into golden fire the lance of light was so sudden so blinding that the wallach threw up his hands before his eyes and peered through the bars of his fingers is that him he gasped is it the boyar himself who answers the old ferengi the gypsy laughed uproariously carefully he propped up the pan on a flat rock and still the beam of light glanced down from on high no not him the suns no friend of his nor any mirror for that matter he laughed again and then explained its a mirror burnished bright one of several which sit above the rear wall of the keep where it meets the cliff now if our signal is seen someone will cover the mirror which merely shoots back our beam and the light will be snuffed out not gradually as by the suns slow descent but all at once like that like a candle snuffed the beam blinked out leaving thibor almost staggering in what seemed a preternatural gloom he steadied himself so it would seem youve established contact he said plainly the boyar has seen that you have something to convey but how will he know what it is he will know said the gypsy he grasped thibors arm stared up into the high passes a glaze came suddenly over the old mans eyes and he swayed thibor held him up and there now he knows the old man whispered the film went from his wide eyes what thibor was puzzled he felt troubled the szgany were queer folk with littleunderstood powers what do you mean when you say and now he will answer yes or no the gypsy cut him off even as he finished speaking there came a single searing beam of light from the high castle which in the next moment died away ah the old gypsy sighed and his answer is yes he will see you when thibor accepted the strangeness of it fought down the eagerness in his voice now we set off at once the mountains are dangerous at night but hell have it no other way are you still game ill not disappoint him now that hes invited me said thibor very well but wrap yourself well wallach it gets cold up there the old man fixed him with a brief bright penetrating stare aye cold as death thibor chose a pair of burly wallachs to accompany him most of his men were out of his old homeland but hed personally stood alongside these two in his war with the pechenegi and he knew they were fierce fighters he wanted real men at his back when he went up against this ferenczy and it could well be that hed need them arvos the old gypsy had said the boyar had no retainers who then had answered the mirror signal no thibor couldnt see a rich man living up there all alone with a mere woman or two fetching and carrying for himself old arvos lied in the event that there was only a handful of men up in the mountains with their master but it was no good speculating thibor would have to wait and see what were the odds if there were many men however then he would say that he came as an envoy of vladimir to invite the boyar to the palace in kiev it would be in connection with the war against the pechenegi either way his course was now set he had a mountain to climb and at the top a man to kill depending on conditions in those days thibor had been in a way naive it had not once crossed his mind that the vlad had sent him on a suicide mission from which he was not expected to return to kiev as for the climb at first the going had been easy and this despite the fact that the way was unmarked the track climbed a saddle between foothills to the base of an unscalable cliff then followed a rising apron of sliding scree to a wide crevice or chimney in the cliff which elevated steeply through a fissure on to a false plateau beneath a second line of even steeper hills these hills were wild and wooded their trees massive and ancient but by now thibor had seen that indeed there was a path of sorts it was as if some giant had taken a scythe and cut a straight line through the trees their wood had doubtless provided much of the villages timber and perhaps some of it had been hauled up into the mountains for use in the construction of the castle that might possibly have been hundreds of years ago and yet no new trees had grown up to bar the way or if they had then someone had uprooted them to keep the path free whichever the climb along the track through the rising woods was fairly easy going and as twilight grew towards night a full moon rose to lend the way its silvery light spying their breath for the climbing the three men and heir guide spoke not at all and thibor was able to turn his mind to what little hed heard of the boyar ferenczy from his foppish court contact the greeks fear him more than vladimir does that loosetongue had informed in greekland theyve long sought all such out and put them down they call such as the ferenczy vrykolax which is the same as the bulgarian obour or mouphour or wampir ive heard of the wampir thibor had answered they have the same myth and the same name for it in my old country a peasant supersition and ill tell you something the men ive killed rot in their graves if indeed they have graves they certainly dont bloat there or if they do its from rotten gasses not the blood of the living nevertheless this ferenczy is said to be just such a creature thibors informant had insisted ive heard the greek priests talking saying how theres no room in any christian land for such as that in greekland they put stakes through their hearts and cut off their heads or better still they break them up entirely and burn all the pieces they believe that even a small part of a wampir can grown whole again in the body of an unwary man the thing is like a leech but on the inside hence the saying that a wampir has two hearts and two souls and that the creature may not die until both facets are destroyed thibor had smiled humourlessly scornfully hed thanked the man saying well wizard or witch or whatever hes lived long enough vladimir the prince wants this ferenczy dead and ive been given the job lived long enough the other had repeated throwing up his hands aye and you dont know how true that is why theres been a ferenczy up in those mountains as long as men remember and the legends have it that its the same ferenczy now you tell me wallach what sort of man is it who watches years pass like hours eh thibor had laughed at that too but now thinking back on it several things connected it seemed the moupho in the name of the village for instance which sounded a lot like mouphour or wampir village of the old ferenczy vampire and what was it arvos the szgany had said the suns no friend of his nor any mirror for that matter werent vampires things of the night afraid of mirrors because they showed no reflection or perhaps a reflection more nearly the reality then the wallach gave a snort of derision at his own imaginings it was this old place that was all working on his imagination these centuried woods and ageless mountains at which point his party came out of the trees and on to the crest of domed hills where the soil was thin as a whisper and only the lichens grew beyond which in a shallow depression a jumbled plain of stony rubble and brittle scree reached perhaps half a mile to the inky shadows of dark cliffs to the north it reached up high that black boundary forming horns and to these horns in the light of the moon old arvos now pointed a crooked finger there he chuckled as at some joke there broods the house of the old ferengi thibor looked and sure enough he saw distant windows lit like eyes in the darkness under the horns and it was for all the world as if some monstrous bat squatted there in the heights or maybe the lord of all great wolves like eyes in a face of stone growled one of thibors wallachs a man all chest and arms with short stumpy legs and not the only eyes watching us whispered the other a thin hunched man who always went with his head aggressively forward whats that you say thibor was at once alert casting about in the darkness then he saw the feral triangular eyes like blobs of gold seeming to hang suspended in the darkness at the edge of the woods five pairs of eyes wolves eyes surely ho thibor shouted he unsheathed his sword stepped forward away dogs of the woods weve nothing for you the eyes blinked sporadically in pairs drew back scattered four lean grey shapes loped off flowing under the moon like liquid lost in the jumble of boulders on the plain of scree but the fifth pair of eyes remained seemed to gain height floated forward out of the darkness without hesitation a man stepped from the shadows as tall as if not taller than thibor himself arvos the gypsy staggered seemed about to faint the moon showed his face a ghastly silverygrey the stranger reached out a hand and gripped his shoulder stared deep into his eyes and slowly the old man straightened up and the trembling went out of him in the manner of the warrior born thibor had placed himself in striking distance his sword was still in his hand but the stranger was only one man thibors men astounded at first perhaps even a little afraid were on the point of drawing their own weapons but he stopped them with a word sheathed his sword if anything this was a simple show of defiance a gesture which in one move showed his strength and possibly his contempt certainly it showed his fearlessness who are you he said you come like a wolf in the night the newcomer was slender almost fragileseeming he was dressed all in black with a heavy black cape draped about his shoulders and falling to below his knees there could be weapons concealed under the cape but he kept his hands in view resting them on his thighs he now ignored old arvos looked at the three wallachs his dark eyes merely fell upon thibors henchmen and moved on but they rested on thibor himself for long moments before he answered i am from the house of the ferenczy my master sent me out to see what manner of men would visit him this night he smiled a thin smile his voice had a soothing effect on the voevod strangely his unblinking eyes also which now reflected moonlight thibor found himself wishing there was more natural light there was that about the features of this one which repulsed him he felt that he gazed upon a misshapen skull and wondered that this didnt disturb him more but he was held as by some mysterious attraction like a moth to the devouring flame yes attracted and repulsed at one and the same time as that idea dawned that he was falling under some strange malaise or enticement he drew himself more upright forced himself to speak you may tell your master im a wallach also that i come to speak of important things of summonses and responsibilities the man in the cape drew closer and the moon shone fully in his face it was a mans face after all and not a skull but there was that which was wolfish about it an almost freakish longness of jaws and ears my master supposed it might be so he said a certain hard edge creeping into his voice but no matter what will be will be and you are but a messenger before you pass this point however which is a boundary my master must be sure that you come of your own free will thibor had regained his selfcontrol no one dragged me up here he snorted but you were sent a strong man may only be sent where he wishes to go the wallach answered and your men were with thibor said the hunched one where he ventures we venture willingly even to see one who sends out wolves to do his bidding thibors second companion the apish one added wolves the stranger frowned and cocked his head on one side quizzically he glanced sharply all about then smiled his amusement my masters dogs you mean dogs thibor was certain hed seen wolves now however the idea seemed ridiculous aye dogs they came out to walk with me for its a fine night but theyre not used to strangers see theyve run off home thibor nodded and eventually he said so youve come to meet us halfway then to walk with us and show us the way not i the other shook his head arvos can do that well enough i came only to greet you and to count your numbers also to ensure that your presence here was not forced which is to say that you came of your own free mind and will i say again thibor growled who could force me there are pressures and there are pressures the other shrugged but i see you are your own man you mentioned our numbers the man in the cape raised his eyebrows they peaked like gables for your accommodation he answered what else and before thibor could reply now i must go on ahead to make preparation id hate to crowd your masters house said thibor quickly bad enough to be an unexpected guest but worse far if others are obliged to vacate their rightful positions to make room for me oh theres room enough the other answered and you were not entirely unexpected as for putting others out my masters house is a castle but it shelters fewer human souls than you have here it was as if hed read thibors mind and answered the question hed found there now he inclined his head towards the old szgany be warned however that the path along the cliff is loose and the way a little perilous be on your guard for rock falls and once more to thibor he said until later then they watched him turn and make off after his masters dogs across the narrow jumbled boulderstrewn plain when hed gone into the shadows thibor grabbed arvos by the neck no retainers he hissed into the old gypsys face no servants what and are you a simple liar or a very great liar the ferenczy could harbour an army up there arvos tried to snatch himself back and found the wallachs grip like iron on his throat a a manservant or two he choked how was was i to know its been many a year thibor released him thrust him away old man he warned if youd see another day just be sure you guide us carefully along this perilous cliff path and so they had crossed the stony depression to the cliff and started up the narrow way carved in its sheer face chapter three the path clung to the black rock of the cliffs like a silver snake under the moon its surface was wide enough to take a small cart no more but in places the rim had fallen away and then the track narrowed to little more than the width of a man and it was in just such narrow spots that the night breeze off the forests picked up to a bluster seeming to tug at and threaten the men who toiled up like insects towards that unknown aerie which was their destination how long is this damned path anyway thibor snarled at the gypsy after maybe half a mile of slow careful climbing the same distance again arvos at once replied but steeper from now on once they brought carts up here im told but that was a hundred years or more ago and the way has not been well kept huh thibors apish aide snorted carts i wouldnt bring goats up here at that the other wallach the hunched one gave a start and pressed more closely to the cliff i wouldnt know about goats he whispered hoarsely but if im not mistaken we have company of sorts the ferenczys dogs thibor looked ahead to where the path vanished round the curve of the cliff silhouetted against the starry void of space humpshouldered wolfshapes stood with muzzles lifted ears pointed and eyes ferally agleam but there were only two of them gasping his shock then a harsh curse thibor looked back into the deepest shadows and saw the other two or rather he saw their triangular moonsilvered eyes arvos he growled gathering his wits reaching for the old gypsy arvos the sudden rumbling might well have been thunder except the air was crisp and dry and what few clouds there were scudded rather than boiled and thunder seldom makes the ground shudder beneath a mans feet thibors thin hunched friend was hindmost bringing up the rear at a point where the path was the merest ledge it required but a step to bring him to safety rock fall he cried hoarsely making to leap forward but as he sprang so the boulders rained down and swept him away it was as quick as that he was there arms straining forward face gaping white in the light of the moon and he was gone he did not cry out clubbed by boulders doubtless hed been unconscious or dead even as he fell when the last pebble and plume of dust had fallen and the rumbling was an echo thibor stepped to the rim and looked down there was nothing to see just darkness and the glint of the moon on distant rocks up and down the trail of wolves there was no sign thibor turned to where the old gypsy shivered and clung to the face of the cliff a rock fall the old man saw the look on his face you cant blame me for a rock fall if hed jumped instead of shouting his warning thibor nodded no he agreed brows black as the night itself i cant blame you for a rock fall but from now on blame doesnt come into it from now on if theres any problem at all from whatever cause or quarter ill just toss you off the cliff that way if im to die ill know that you died first for lets have something clearly understood old man i dont trust the ferenczy i dont trust his dogs and i trust you least of all therell be no further warnings he jerked his thumb up the path lead on arvos of the szgany and nimble about it thibor did not think that his warning would carry much weight even if it weighed on the gypsy it certainly wouldnt weigh on his master in the mountain but neither was the wallach a man to issue idle threats arvos the szgany belonged to the ferenczy no doubt of that and so if more trouble was on the way from that quarter then he would see that it came to arvos first and trouble was coming it waited in the defile where the cliff was split by a deep chasm at the back of which sat the castle of the ferenczy this was the sight they saw thibor and his simian wallach friend and the now sinister gypsy arvos when they reached the cleft back in the dim mists of time the mountains had convulsed split apart passes had been formed through the ranges of which this might have been one except that in this case the opening had not gone all the way through the cliff whose face theyd traversed had led finally to a high crest which reared now a half mile away the crest was split into twin peaks like the ears of a bat or a wolf and there straddling the defile where it narrowed to a fissure clinging to both opposing faces and meeting centrally in a massive arch of masonry there sat the manse of the ferenczy as before two windows were lighted like eyes under the sharp black ears and the fissure below seemed to form a gaping mouth no wonder he runs wolves this one thibors squat companion grunted his words acted like an invocation they came down the cliffhugging track from the castle and not just four off them a flood of them a wall of grey fur studded with yellow jewel eyes and they came at the lope full of purpose a pack cried thibors friend too many to fight off the voevod shouted back out of the corner of his eye he saw arvos start forward towards the oncoming wolves he reached out a leg tripped the old gypsy grab him thibor commanded drawing his sword the squat wallach lifted arvos as easily as he would lift the dead dry branch of a tree swung him out over the abyss and held him there arvos howled his terror the wolves scant paces away came to an uneasy halt their leaders threw up pointed muzzles howled mournfully it was for all the world as if they waited upon some command but from whom arvos stopped his yelling turned his head and gazed wideeyed at the distant castle his gullet bobbed spastically with his gulping the man who held him glanced from the wolves to thibor what now do i drop him the huge wallach shook his head only if they attack he answered you think the ferenczy controls them then but is it possible it seems our quarry has powers said thibor look at the gypsys face arvos gaze had become fixed thibor had seen that look before when the old man used the fryingpan mirror down in the village as if a film of milk had been painted on each eyeball then the gypsy spoke master arvos mouth scarce moved his words were the merest breath vying with the mountain breeze at first but rapidly growing louder master but master i have always been your faithful he paused suddenly as if cut short and his filmed eyes bulged no master nor his voice was now a shriek he clawed at the hands and brawny arms that alone sustained him against gravity shifted his once more clear gaze to the ledge and the wolves where they gathered themselves thibor had almost felt the surge of power emanating from the distant castle had almost tasted the rejection which had surely doomed the szgany to his death the ferenczy was finished with him so why delay it the leading pair of wolves massive beasts crept forward in unison muscles bunching drop him thibor rasped utterly pitiless he urged let him die and then fight for your own life the ledge is narrow side by side weve a chance his companion tried to shake the old man loose but couldnt the gypsy clung like thorns to his arms fought desperately to swing his legs back onto the ledge but already it was too late for both men heedless of their own lives the pair of great grey wolves sprang as one creature as if triggered not at thibor not even looking at him but directly at his squat comrade where he tried to break arvos grip they struck together dead weight against a lurching doublesilhouette and bore the apish wallach arvos and themselves out over the rim and down into darkness it was beyond thibor he gave it only a moments thought the pack leaders had sacrificed themselves in answer to a call he had not heard or had he but in any case theyd died willingly for a cause he could not possibly comprehend he still lived however and he wouldnt sell his life cheaply all of you then he howled at the pack almost in its own tongue come on wholl be first to taste my steel and for long moments not a beast of them moved then then they did move but not forward instead they turned slunk away paused and looked back over lean shoulders cowards thibor raged he took a pace towards them they slunk further away looked back and the wallachs jaw dropped he knew suddenly knew that they werent here to harm him only to ensure that he came on alone for the first time he began to understand something of the true power of the mysterious boyar knew why the vlad wanted him dead and now too he wished he hadnt scoffed so much at the warnings of his court informant of course he could always go back to the village and bring up the rest of his men couldnt he behind him pale tongues lolling a crush of furry bodies crowded the track cut from the face of the cliff thibor took a pace their way they didnt move an inch but their dog grins at once turned to snarls a pace in the other direction and they crept after he had an escort my own free will eh he muttered and looked at the sword in his hand the sword of some warrior varyagi a good viking sword but useless if the pack should decide to attack in a body or if that were decided for them thibor knew it and he suspected that they knew it too he sheathed the weapon found nerve to command lead on then my lads but not too close or ill have your paws for lucky charms and so they took him to the castle in the riven rock in his shallow grave the old thing in the ground shivered again this time from fear however monstrous a man may become in this world when he dreams of his youth the things which frightened him then frighten him anew so it was with the thiborcreature and now his dream was carrying him to the edge of terror itself the sun was down its rim forming the merest red blister on the hills but still its rays lanced across the earth and gleamed fitfully on land where shadows visibly lengthened quickly blotting out the suns golden stains but even when the sun was fully down burning on other lands still thibor might not waken in the sense that men waken for he was one who might dream for many a year between bouts of that black hatred called waking it is not pleasant to be a thing in the ground awake alone immobile undead but the rich blood which soaked the earth would waken him certainly in that instant when it touched him even now the nearness of that warm precious liquid roused passions in him his nostrils gaped for its scent his desiccated heart urged his own ancient blood faster in his veins his vampire core moaned soundlessly in the sleep it shared with him thibors dream however was stronger it was a magnet of the mind luring him to a conclusion he knew and dreaded of old but which he must always experience again and down in the cold earth in the glade of stirless trees where the stones of his mausoleum lay broken and matted with lichens the nightmare thing dreamed on the way widened grew into an avenue of tall dark pines atop a broad levelled rim of agesimpacted scree on thibors left hand beyond the straight boles of the pines smooth black rocks rose vertical through hundreds of feet to an indigo sky strewn with stars on his right the trees massed marched down the no longer sheer v of the gorge and steeply up the other side at the bottom water gushed and gurgled invisible beneath a nightblack canopy the vlad had been right given a handful of men or wolves the ferenczy could easily defend his castle against an army inside the castle itself however things might be different especially if the boyar were indeed a man alone or nearly so finally the ancient pile itself loomed its stonework was massive but pitted rotten on both sides of the defile huge towers rose up eighty feet and more square and very nearly featureless at their broad bases higher up there were arched fortified windows ledges and balconies with deep embrasures and gaping stone spouts projecting from the mouths of carved gargoyle or kraken heads at the top of each tower more embrasures fronted tiled pyramid spires but with gaping holes showing through where repairs were badly needed and over everything a heavy miasma of decay a dank and clinging patina as if the very stone issued a cold and clammy sweat halfway up the inwardfacing walls sprouted flying buttresses almost as massive as the towers themselves which met across the gorge in a single span like a stone bridge some eighty or ninety feet from tower to tower supported by the buttresses a long singlestorey hall with small square windows was constructed of timbers it had a peaked roof of heavy slates hall and roof both were in the same generally poor condition as the towers but for the fact that two of the windows were lit with a flickering illumination the entire pile might seem deserted derelict it was not how thibor imagined the residence of a great boyar should look on the other hand if he were a superstitious man certainly he might believe that demons lived there the ranks of wolves began to thin out as they drew closer to the castles walls moving forward it was not until the wallach stood in the very shadow of those walls that he saw the castles simple defences a trench fifteen feet wide and fifteen deep excavated right down to solid rock the bottom furnished with long pointed stakes set so close to each other that any man falling in must surely be speared then too he saw the door a heavy oak boarded ironbanded affair extended at its top to form a drawbridge and even as he looked so the door was creakingly lowered heavy chains rattling as the trench was bridged in the opening thus revealed stood a cloaked figure holding before him a flaring torch behind the glare of that brand little could be seen of features but a blur all that thibor could make of them was their paleness and a vague awareness of grotesque proportions he had his suspicions however and more than suspicions which were fully borne out on the instant that the figure spoke and so you have come of your own free will thibor had often been accused of being a cold man with a cold emotionless voice it was something he had never denied but if his voice was cold this voice might have issued from the grave itself and where thibor had found the voice soothing in the first instance now it grated on his nerves like the ache of a rotten tooth or cold steel on a living bone it was old hoary as the mountains and possibly entrusted with as many secrets but it was certainly not infirm it held the authority of all dark knowledge my own free will thibor dared to look away from the figure saw that he was quite alone the wolves had melted into the night into the mountains perhaps a single pair of yellow eyes gleamed for a moment under the trees but that was all he turned back to face his host yes of my own free will then you are welcome the boyar fixed his torch in a bracket just inside the doorway bowed a little from the waist stood to one side and thibor crossed the drawbridge made to enter the house of the ferenczy but in the moment before he entered he glanced up saw the legend burned into the ageblackened oak of the arched lintel he couldnt read or write but the cloaked man saw his glance and translated for him it says that this is the house of waldemar ferrenzig there is also a sign which dates it showing that the castle is nearly two hundred years old waldemar was he was my father i am faethor ferrenzig whom my people call the ferenczy there was a fierce pride now in that dark voice and for the first time thibor felt himself unsure he knew nothing of the castle there might easily be many men lying in wait the open door gaped like the maw of some unknown beast i have made preparations said thibors host food and drink and a fire to warm your bones he deliberately turned his back took a second torch from a dark niche in the wall and lit it from the first as flames caught hold so the shadows fled the ferenczy glanced once at his guest unsmiling then led the way inside and the wallach followed they passed quickly through dark corridors of stone anterooms narrow doorways into the heart of the tower then up a spiralling stone stairway to a heavy trapdoor in a floor of stone flags supported by great black timbers the trapdoor stood open and the ferenczy gathered up his cloak before climbing through into a well lighted room thibor followed close behind allowing the other no time to be on his own as he emerged into the room he shivered it would have been so very easy for someone to spear him or lop off his head as he came up through the trapdoor but apart from the piles master the room was empty of men thibor glanced at his host looked all around the room was long broad high overhead a ceiling of timbers was badly gapped flickering firelight showed a slate roof above the ceiling missing tiles permitted a glimpse of stars swimming in smoke from the fire the place was somewhat open to the weather in winter it would be bitterly cold even now it would not be warm if not for the fire the fire was of pine logs roaring in a huge open fireplace with a chimney built at an angle to pass through an exterior wall the logs burned on a cradle of warped iron bars twisted with the heat of many such fires at the fires front six spitted woodcocks were roasting over red ashes sprinkled with herbs the smell of their flesh was mouthwatering close to the fireplace stood a heavy table and two chairs of oak on the table were wooden platters eating knives a stone pitcher of wine or water in the centre of the table the roasted joint of some beast still smoked there was a bowl of dried fruits too and another containing slices of coarse dark bread it was not intended that thibor should starve he glanced again at the wall with the fireplace its base was of stone but higher up it was of timber there was also a square window open to the night he crossed to the window looked out and down on a dizzy scene the ravine dark with closepacked firs and away in the east the vast black forests and now the voevod knew that he was in a room of the castles central span where it crossed the narrow gorge between the towers are you nervous wallach faethor ferenczys soft voice startled him nervous thibor slowly shook his head bemused thats all surprised you are alone here oh and did you expect something else didnt arvos the gypsy tell you i was alone thibor narrowed his eyes he told me several things and now hes dead the other showed not the slightest flicker of surprise nor of remorse death comes to all men he said my two friends theyre also dead thibor hardened his tone of voice the ferenczy merely shrugged the way up is hard its cost many lives over the years but friends did you say then you are fortunate i have no friends thibors hand strayed close to the hilt of his sword i had fancied an entire pack of your friends showed me the way here his host at once stepped close to him less a step than a flowing motion the man moved like liquid a long hand slender but strong rested on the hilt of thibors sword under his own hand touching it was like touching living snakeskin thibors flesh crawled and he jerked his hand away in the same moment the boyar unsheathed his sword again with that flowing liquid motion the wallach stood disarmed astonished you cant eat with this great thing clanging about your legs the ferenczy told him he weighed the sword like a toy in his hands smiled a thin smile ah a warriors weapon and are you a warrior thibor of wallachia a voevod eh ive heard how vladimir svyatoslavich recruits many warlords even from peasants again thibor was caught off guard he hadnt told the ferenczy his name hadnt mentioned the kievan vlad but before he could find words for an answer come said his host youll let your food grow cold sit eat and well talk he tossed thibors sword down on a bench covered with soft pelts across his broad back thibor carried a crossbow he shrugged its strap from his shoulder handed it to the ferenczy in any case the weapon would take too long to load useless at close quarters against a man who moved like this one do you want my knife too faethor ferenczys long jaws gaped and he laughed i desire only to seat you comfortably at my table keep your knife see there are more knives within reach to stab the meat he tossed the crossbow down with the sword thibor stared at him finally nodded he shrugged out of his heavy jacket let it fall in a heap to the floor he took a seat at one end of the table watched the ferenczy arrange all the food within easy reach then his host poured two deep iron goblets of wine from the pitcher before seating himself opposite you wont eat with me thibor was suddenly hungry but he would not take the first bite in the palace in kiev they always waited for the vlad to lead the way faethor ferenczy reached along the top of the table showing an enormous length of arm and deftly sliced off a corner of meat ill take a woodcock when theyre cooked he said but dont wait for me you eat whatever you want he toyed with his food while thibor fell to with some zeal the ferenczy watched him for a little while then said it seems only right that a big man should have a big appetite i too have appetites which this place restricts that is why you interest me thibor we could be brothers do you see i might even be your father aye big men both of us and you a warrior and quite fearless i suspect there are not many such as you in the world and after a short pause and in complete contrast what did the vlad tell you about me before he sent you to bring me to his court thibor had determined not to be taken by surprise a third time he swallowed what was in his mouth and returned gaze for gaze across the table now in the light from the fire and flickering flambeaux in jutting brackets he allowed himself a more detailed inspection of the castles master it would be pointless thibor decided to make any sort of guess at the age of this man he seemed to exude age like some ancient monolith and yet moved with the incredible speed of a striking serpent and the lithe suppleness of a young girl his voice could sound harsh as the elements or soft as a mothers kiss and yet it too seemed hoary beyond measure as for the ferenczys eyes they were deepseated in triangular sockets heavylidded and their true colour was likewise impossible to fathom from a certain angle they were black shiny as wet pebbles while from another they were yellow with gold in their pupils they were educated eyes and full of wisdom yet feral too and brimming with sin then there was the nose faethor ferenczys nose along with his pointed fleshy ears formed the least acceptable part of his face it was more a muzzle than a nose proper yet its length stayed close to the face flattening down towards the upper lip and pushed back from it with large nostrils slanting upwards directly underneath it too close in fact the mans ridgy mouth was wide and red against his otherwise pale coarse flesh when he spoke his lips parted just a little but his teeth what the wallach had seen of them when the ferenczy laughed were big and square and yellow also glimpsed incisors oddly curved and sharp as tiny scythes but thibor couldnt be sure if it was so then the man would seem even more wolflike and so he was an ugly man this faethor ferenczy but thibor had known ugly men aplenty and he had killed plenty of them too the vlad thibor carved more meat took a swig of red wine it was vinegary stuff but no worse than he was used to then he looked again at the ferenczy and shrugged he told me that you live under his protection but swear him no allegiance that you occupy land but concede no taxes that you could muster many men but choose to sit here brooding while other boyars fight off the pechenegi to keep your hide whole for a moment the ferenczys eyes went wide seemed flecked in their corners with blood and his nostrils gaped in an audible grunt his top lip wrinkled and curled back a little and his jagged peaked eyebrows crushed together on his pale high forehead then he sat back seemed to relax grinned and nodded thibor had stopped eating but as the ferenczy brought himself under control so he carried on between mouthfuls he said did you think id flatter you faethor ferenczy perhaps you also thought your trickery would scare me off the castles master frowned wrinkled his nose into ridges my trickery thibor nodded the princes advisors christian monks out of greekland think youre some sort of demon a vampire i believe he thinks so too but me im just a common man a peasant aye and i say youre only a clever trickster you speak to your szgany serfs with mirror signals and youve a trained wolf or two to do your bidding like dogs hah mangy wolves why in kiev theres a man leads great bears around on a leash and he dances with them and what else do you have eh nothing oh you make shrewd guesses and then pretend that your eyes have powers that they see over woods and mountains you cloak yourself in mystery and superstition up here in these dark hills but that only works with the superstitious and who are most superstitious educated men monks and princes thats who they know so much their brains are so bursting with knowledge that theyll believe anything but a common man a warrior he only believes in blood and iron the first to give him strength to wield the second the second to spill the first in a scarlet flood a little surprised at himself thibor paused wiped his mouth the wine had loosened his tongue the ferenczy had sat there as if turned to stone now he rocked back in his chair slapped the table with a long flat hand roared his mirth and thibor saw that indeed his eyeteeth were like those of a great dog what wisdom from a warrior the boyar shouted he pointed a slender finger but you are so right thibor right to be outspoken and i like you for it and im glad you came whatever your mission wasnt i right to say you could be my son indeed i was right a man after my own heart in perhaps more ways than one eh his eyes were red again but thibor made sure that a knife lay close at hand perhaps the ferenczy was mad certainly he looked mad when he laughed like that the fire flared up as a log turned on its side a smell of burning wafted to thibors nostrils the woodcocks both he and his host had forgotten them he decided to be charitable to let the hermit eat before killing him your birds he said or tried to say as he made to get to his feet but the words tangled themselves up on his tongue came out slurred and alien sounding worse he couldnt force himself upright his hands seemed glued to the table top and his feet were heavy as lumps of lead thibor looked down at his straining twitching hands his nearly paralysed body and even his horrified glance was slow filled with an unnatural languor it was as if he were drunk but drunker than hed ever been it would require only the slightest shove he was sure to send him sprawling then his eyes fell upon his goblet the red wine from the pitcher vinegary yes that and worse he was poisoned the ferenczy was watching him closely suddenly he sighed and stood up he seemed even taller now younger stronger he stepped lithe to the fire toppled the spit and steaming birds into the flames they hissed smoked caught fire in a moment then he turned to where thibor sat watching him not a muscle of thibors body would answer his minds desperate commands it was as if he were turned to stone droplets of cold sweat started out upon his brow the ferenczy came closer stood over him thibor looked at him at his long jaws his misshapen skull and ears his crushed snout of a nose an ugly man yes and perhaps more than a man pppoisoned the wallach finally spat it out eh the ferenczy cocked his head looked down on him poisoned no no he denied merely drugged isnt it obvious that if i wanted you dead then youd be dead along with arvos and your friends but such bravery i showed you what i could do and yet you came on or are you simply stubborn stupid maybe ill give you the benefit of the doubt and say that youre brave for ive no time to waste on fools with a great effort of will thibor forced his right hand spastically towards a knife where it lay on the table his host smiled took up the knife handed it to him thibor sat and trembled with the strain of his effort but he could no more take that knife than stand up the entire room was beginning to swim to melt to flow together in a dark irresistible whirlpool the last thing he saw was the ferenczys face more terrible than ever as he leaned over him that bestial animal face jaws open in a gaping laugh and the crimson forked tongue that vibrated like a crippled snake in the cavern of his throat the old thing in the ground sprang awake his nightmare had awakened him and something else for a moment the thiborcreature thrilled with the horror of his dream before remembering where who and what he was and then he thrilled again the second time with ecstasy blood the black soil of his grave was drenched gorged with blood blood touched him seeped like oil through leafmould rootlets and earth and touched him drawn by the instant capillary action of his myriad thirsting fibres it soaked into him filled his desiccated pores and veins his spongy organs and yawning aching alveolate bones blood life filled the vampire set centuriesnumbed nerves leaping brought incredible inhuman senses instantly alert his eyes cracked open closed at once soil darkness he was buried still he lay in his grave as always he opened the sinuses of his gaping nostrils and immediately closed them but not entirely he smelled the soil yes but he also smelled blood and now fully awake he carefully far more minutely began to examine his surroundings he weighed the earth above him probed it with instinct shallow very shallow eighteen inches no more and above that another twelve inches of compact leafmould oh hed been buried deep enough that time but in the centuries between hed wormed his way closer to the surface that had been when he had the strength to do so he exerted himself extended pseudopods up into the soil like crimson worms and snatched them back oh yes the earth was heavily saturated with blood and human blood at that but how could that be could this be could it possibly be the work of dragosani the thing reached out its mind called softly dragosaaaniiii is it you my son have you done this thing brought me this fine tribute dragosaaaniiii his thoughts touched upon minds but clean minds innocent minds human minds which had never known his taint but people here in the cruciform hills what was their purpose here why had they come to his grave and baited the earth with baited the earth the thiborcreature whipped back his thoughts his protoplasmic extrusions his psychic extensions and cringed down into himself terror and hatred filled his every nerve was that the answer had they remembered him after all these years and come to put paid to him at last had they let him lie here undead for half a millennium simply to come and destroy him now had dragosani perhaps spoken of him to someone and that someone recognised the peril in what was buried here senses thrilling the thing lay there his scarcely human body trembling with tension listening feeling smelling tasting using all of his heightened vampire senses except that of sight aye and he could use that too if he dared but for all his fear the one thing he did not sense was danger and he would know the smell of danger as surely as he knew the smell of blood what hour would it be his trembling stilled as he gave the problem of the hour a moments thought hour hah what month would it be what season year decade how long since the boy dragosani that child of thibors every hope and evil aspiration how long since hed visited him here but more importantly was it day now or was it night it was night the vampire could feel it darkness seeped down through the soil like the rich dark blood it accompanied it was night his time and the blood had given him a strength an elasticity a motivation and a mobility almost forgotten through all the centuries hed lain here he put out his thoughts again to touch upon the minds of the people in the glade of stirless trees directly above him where he lay he did not think at them made no effort to communicate merely touched their thoughts with his own a man and a woman only the two of them were they lovers is that what they were doing here but in winter yes it was winter and the ground cold and hard and what of the blood perhaps it was murder the womans mind was full of nightmares she slept or lay unconscious but panic was fresh in her mind and her heart beat fitfully in a fever of fear what had frightened her as for the man he was dying it was his blood the old thing had absorbed which fuelled his vampire system even now but what had happened to these two had he lured her here attacked her and had she in turn cut him open before he could use her thibor tried to explore the dying mans mind a little deeper there was pain too much pain it had closed the mans mind down so that now all was growing numb succumbing to an aching void it was the ultimate void called death which would swallow its victim utterly but pain yes indeed agony the thing in the ground put out extrusions like flexible fleshy antennae to trace the mans seeping life fluid red worms of inhuman flesh extended from his ageswrinkled face hollow chest shrivelled limbs burrowing upward like tubeworms or the siphons of some loathsome mollusc they followed the scarlet trace converging upon its source the mans right leg was broken above the knee sharply fractured bone had sliced open arteries like a knife arteries which even now pumped thin splashes of steaming scarlet on to the cold dead earth but that was a thought which was too much it stirred the true beast in the thiborcreature he was ravening in a moment his great dogs jaws cracked open in the hard earth crusted lips quivered and salivated flaring nostrils gaped like black funnels from its neck the thing sent up a thick snake of surging protoplasm which pushed aside rootlets and pebbles and dirt until it emerged nodding like some vile animated mushroom in the glade of thibors mausoleum he formed a rudimentary eye in its tip expanded its pupil the better to see in the darkness he saw the dying man a large handsome man which might explain the good strong blood its quality and quantity an intelligent man high browed and yet crumpled here on the hard earth with his life leaking out of him down to the last few droplets thibor couldnt save him wouldnt if he could but neither would he let him go to waste a cursory glance of his obscene eye to ensure that the woman was not coming out of her faint and then he sent up a score of tiny red snouts from his gaping face hollow tubes like little pouting mouths to slide into the raw wound and draw on the last of the hot juices which flooded there then all of thibors hellish being surrendered itself to the sheer ecstasy the black joy the unholy rapture of feeding of drawing red sustenance direct from a victims veins it was it was indescribable it was a mans first woman not his first fumbling hurried uncontrolled eruption on to some girls belly or into her pubic hair but the first pumping of salving semen into the hot core of a groaning sated woman it was a mans first kill in battle when his enemys head leaps free or his sword strikes home in heart or throat it was the sharp stinging agony of a douse in some mountain pool the sight of a battlefield where the piled bodies of an army reek and steam the adoration of warriors hoisting high a mans colours in recognition of his victory it was as sweet as all of these things but alas it was over all too quickly the mans heart no longer pumped his blood what little remained was still the great blotches of crimson were hardening and turning leafmould to clotted crusts almost before it had begun the marvellous feast was over perhaps not the thiborthings sight extension turned its eye upon the woman she was pale attractive fineboned she looked like the fine toy lady of some rich boyar full of thin aristocratic blood feverish highlights of colour gave her cheeks a fresh appearance but the rest of her skin was pale as death cold and growing colder exposure would kill her if the old thing in the ground did not the eyestalk extended elongated out of the earth its colour was greygreen mottled but bloodred veins pulsed in it now just beneath the surface of its protoplasmic skin it swayed closer to the woman where she lay poised itself before her face her breath shallow almost gasping filmed the eye over and caused it to draw back in her neck a pulse fluttered like an exhausted bird her breast rose and fell rose and fell the phallic eye swayed close to her throat lidlessly observed the soft pulse of the jugular slowly the eye dissolved away and the red veins in the leprous nodding mushroom shuddered beneath its skin and turned a deeper scarlet a reptilian mouth and jaws formed taking the place of the eye so that the tentacle might well seem a blind smooth mottled snake the jaws yawned open and a forked tongue flickered between many rows of needlesharp fangs saliva trickled from the distended jaws slopped on the scummy earth the head of the awful member drew back formed a deadly s like a cobra about to strike and and the thiborcreature gave himself a great mental shake and froze all his physical parts to instant rigidity in the last possible moment he had realised what he was about to do had recognised the extreme danger of his own naked lust these were not the old times but the new the twentieth century except in ancient crumbling records his tomb here under the trees was forgotten but if he took this womans life what then ah he knew what then search parties would come out looking for them both they would be found sooner or later here in the stirless glade by the crumbling mausoleum someone would remember some old fool would whisper but that place is forbidden and another would say aye for they buried something there long long ago my grandfathers grandfather used to tell tales about the thing buried on those cruciform hills to put fear in his children when they were bad then theyd read the old records and remember the old ways and in broad streaming daylight theyd come cut down the trees uproot the ancient slabs dig in the rotting soil until they found him theyd stake him down again but this time this time this time theyd take his head and burn it theyd burn all of him thibor fought a fearsome battle with himself the vampire in him which had formed the major part of him for nine hundred years was almost beyond reason but thibor himself could still think like a man and his reasoning was sound the vampirethibor was greedy for the moment but the manthibor could see far beyond that and he had already laid his plans plans which hinged on the boy dragosani dragosani was at school in bucharest now a mere lad in his teens but the old thing in the ground had already corrupted him hed taught him the art of necromancy shown him how to divine the secrets only dead things know and dragosani would always return would always come back here in his search for new knowledge because the ancient thing in the putrid earth was the very font of all dark mystery meanwhile a vampire seed or egg the thiborcreatures filthy leechlike clone was growing in him where he lay a single drop of alien fluid which carried the complex code of the new vampire but that was a slow slow process one day dragosani grown to a man would come up here into these hills and the egg would be ready a man would come up here full of monstrous talent seeking the ultimate secrets of the wamphyri but when he went away he would carry a fledgling vampire with him inside him after that he would come again would have to come again by which time thibor would be ready for the final phase of his plan dragosani would come dragosani and thibor would leave together at last the cycle would be complete the wheel turned full circle when again the immemorial vampire would walk the earth this time to conquer it that was how the old thing in the ground had planned it and that was how it would be he would rise up from here and go out again into the world the world would be his but not if he killed this woman here and now no for that would be total madness the very end of him and all his dreams the vampire in him succumbed to common sense reluctantly allowed the twisted but human mind of thibor to take ascendancy bloodlust receded was replaced by curiosity which in turn gave way to dormant agesrepressed urges new feelings entirely human feelings awakened in the old thing in the ground he was neither male nor female now thibor he was of the wamphyri but he had once been a man a lustful man he had known women many women in the five hundred years that his scourge had terrified wallachia bulgaria moldavia russia and the ottoman some had been his willingly but most had not there was no way a woman could be had which was unknown to him no pleasure or pain a woman could offer that he had not been offered or taken by force times without number in the midfifteenth century as a mercenary voevod of vlad tepes the socalled impaler he had crossed the danube with his forces and taken an emissary of the sultan murad the sultans representative his escort of two hundred soldiers and his harem of twelve beauties were taken in the night in the town of isperikh thibor had shown leniency of a sort towards the bulgarian townspeople they were allowed to flee while his troops sacked the town and burned it looting and raping when the inhabitants were slow off the mark but as for the sultans emissary thibor had had him impaled him and his entire two hundred on tall thin stakes in their own fashion hed gleefully commanded his executioners the turkish way they like buggering little lads this lot so let em die happy the way theyve lived but the women of the harem hed had all twelve the same night going from one to the next unstintingly and carrying on all through the following day ah hed been a satyr in those days and now now he was just an old thing in the ground for the moment for a few more years but he could still dream couldnt he he could still remember how it had been indeed perhaps he could do more than just remember the mucus matter of his probe underwent another metamorphosis the snake jaws fangs and tongue melted back into the body of the tentacle whose tip flattened and spread out becoming bluntly spatulate the flat paddle split into five stubby greygreen worms a rudimentary thumb and four fingers and the central digit grew a small eye of its own which fixed itself in moist fascination upon the rise and fall of the unconscious womans breast thibor flexed his hand made it sensitive thickened and elongated the stalk which was its arm with the tiny glistening eye to guide it the trembling gelatinous hand found its way inside the womans jacket under layers of clothing to her flesh she was still warm but the sensitive hand could feel the heat gradually leaking out of her her breasts were soft largenippled more than amply proportioned when thibor had been alive as opposed to undead they had been the sort of breasts he enjoyed his hand fondled then growing rough in its teasing she moaned a little and stirred the merest fraction of an inch beneath the old things hand her heart was beating more strongly now perhaps stimulated by his touch a strong beat yes but desperate panicked she knew she should not be lying here doing nothing and strove to rise up from her faint but her body was not answering her needs her limbs were cooling when her blood also began to cool then shock would kill her now the thiborcreature also panicked a little she must not be allowed to die here in his mind he saw again the searchers finding the bodies of the man and woman saw them peering narroweyed at his crumbling tomb their knowing glances then he saw them digging saw their pointed hardwood stakes their chains of silver their bright axes he saw the very hillside blazing up in a bonfire of felled trees and for a single agonising instant felt his alien flesh melting liquefying into fat and foul ichor where it boiled in the putrid earth no she must not be allowed to die here he must bring her back to consciousness but first his hand left her breasts began to crawl lustfully down across her belly and froze lying here through all the centuries the thiborcreatures senses his awareness had not been dulled but had amplified many times over deprived of all else he had developed a supersensitivity in the many springtimes he had felt the green shoots rising listened to birds mating in distant trees he had smelled the warmth of all the summers had crouched down deep snarling his hatred of stray beams of sunlight where they penetrated the glade to fall glancingly upon his tomb autumns and the brown sere leaves falling against the earth had sometimes sounded like thunder and when the rain came streamlets roared like mighty rivers and now now the tiny insistent almost mechanical beat he heard through his hand where it rested on the womans belly told a story tapped out a code one that other creatures could not possibly detect it told of new life of a being unborn as yet the merest foetus the woman was pregnant ahhhh said thibor if only to himself he stiffened his pseudohand and pressed it harder against the womans flesh a childtobe pure innocence a single instant of intense pleasure solidified into a seed growing here in its dark warm womb evil instinct took over part vampire part human but all evil nightdark logic replaced lust the tentacle elongated more yet and its hand lost substance it grew smaller and slimmer as it proceeded with renewed purpose indeed with an entirely new purpose its destination had been the womans most secret place the core of her female identity not to harm but simply to know and to remember but now there was a new destination down in the ground under powdery leafmould and hard cold earth the vampires jaws cracked open in a blind monstrous smile he must lie here forever or until a time when dragosani should come to free him but here at last might be an opportunity a chance to send at least something of himself out into the world he entered the woman carefully delicately so that even awake she might not have suspected he was there and wrapped curling frondlike fingers about the new life in her womb his very touch was a taint as for an instant of time he weighed the tiny thing that minute blob of almost featureless flesh and felt the thud of its foetal heart and rememberrrr said the old thing in the ground know what you are what i am more than that know where am and when you are ready then seek me out remember meeee the woman moved and moaned again louder this time thibor withdrew from her made his hand heavier more solid he struck her a ringing slap across her pale face she cried out shook herself opened her eyes but too late to see the leprous appendage of the vampire as it was sucked down swiftly into the earth she cried out again cast about with frightened eyes in the gloom saw the still crumpled shape of her husband galvanised she drew breath cried oh god as she flew to him it took only a moment more to accept the unacceptable truth no she cried oh god no horror gave her strength she would not faint again indeed she loathed herself that shed fainted the first time now she must act must do something there was nothing she could do not for him though for the moment that fact hadnt registered she got her arms hooked under his dragged him a few stumbling paces under the trees down the slope then she tripped on a root flew backwards and her husbands corpse came tumbling after her she was brought up short when she collided with the bole of a tree but not him he went sliding lolling and flopping past her a loose bundle of arms and legs he hit a patch of snow crusted over with ice and went tobogganing away out of sight down the hill shooting into steep shadows the crashing of undergrowth came back to her where she got to her feet and gaspingly drew breath and it was all useless her efforts all totally worthless as that fact dawned she filled her lungs filled them to bursting and stumbling blindly after him down the hill under the trees let it all out in a long piercing scream of mental agony and selfreproach the cruciform hills echoed her scream bouncing it to and fro until it fell to earth and was absorbed and down below the old thing heard it and sighed and waited for whatever the future would bring in an office in london on the top floor of a hotel which was rather more than a hotel alec kyle glanced at his watch it was and the keogh apparition wasnt finished yet the story it told was fascinating however morbid and kyle guessed it would also be accurate but how much more of it would there be time must surely be running out now while the spectral thing which was keogh paused and while yet the image of his child host turned on its axis in and through his midsection kyle said but of course we know what happened to thibor dragosani put an end to him finally beheaded and destroyed him there under the motionless trees on the cruciform hills keogh had noticed him looking at his watch youre right he said with a spectral nod thibor ferenczy is dead thats how i was able to speak to him there on those selfsame hills i went there along the mobius route but youre also right that time is running down so while we have time we must use it and ive more to tell you kyle sat back said nothing waited i said there were other vampires keogh continued and there may be but there are certainly creatures which i call halfvampires that is something ill try to explain later i also mentioned a victim a man who has been taken used destroyed by one of these halfvampires he was dead when i spoke to him dead and utterly terrified but not of being dead and now he is undead kyle shook his head tried hard to understand youd better get on tell it your way let it unfold that way ill understand it better just tell me one thing when did you speak to this dead man just a few days ago as you measure time keogh answered without hesitation was on my way back from the past travelling in the mцbius continuum when i saw a blue lifeline crossed and terminated by a line more red than blue i knew a life had been taken and so i stopped and spoke to the victim incidentally my discovery wasnt an accident i had been looking for just such an occurrence in a way i even needed this killing horrible as that may seem but its how i gain knowledge you see its much easier for me to talk to the dead than to the living and in any case i couldnt have saved him but through him i might be able to save others and you say hed been taken by a vampire this man still groping in the dark kyle was horrified recently but where how thats the worst of it alec said keogh he was taken here here in england as for how he was taken let me tell you chapter four yulian had been a late baby late by almost a month though in the circumstances his mother considered herself fortunate that he hadnt been born early or very early and dead now on the spacious back seat of her cousin annes mercedes on their way to yulians christening at a tiny church in harrow georgina bodescu steadied the infant in his portable cot and thought back on those circumstances on that time almost a year before when she and her husband had holidayed in slatina only eighty kilometres from the wild and ominously rearing bastions of the carpatii meridionali the transylvanian alps a year is a long time and she could do it now look back without any longer feeling that she too must die without submitting to slow hot tears and an agony of selfreproach bordering on guilt thats how she had felt for long long months guilty guilty that she lived when ilya was dead and that but for her weakness he too might still be alive guilty that she had fainted at the sight of his blood when she should have run like the wind to fetch help and poor ilya lying there made unconscious by his pain his lifes blood leaking out of him into the dark earth while she lay crumpled in a swoon like like some typically english shrinking violet oh yes she could look back now indeed she had to for they had been ilyas last days which she had been part of she had loved him very very much and did not want to lose grasp of her memory of him if only in looking back she could conjure all the good things without invoking the nightmare then she would be happy but of course she couldnt ilya bodescu a romanian had been teaching slavonic languages in london when georgina first met him a linguist he moved between bucharest where he taught french and english and the european institute in regent street where she had studied bulgarian ilya had only occasionally been her tutor when standing in for a hugebreasted moustachioed matron from pleven at which times his dry wit and dark sparkling eyes had transformed what were otherwise laborious hours of learning into all too short periods of pure pleasure love at first sight not in the light of twelve years hindsight but a rapid enough process by any estimation they had married inside a year ilyas usual term with the institute when the year was up shed gone back to bucharest with him that had been in november of things had not been entirely easy georgina drews parents were fairly welltodo her father in the diplomatic service had had several prestigious postings abroad and her mother too was from a moneyed background an exdeb turned auxiliary nurse during the first world war she had met john drew in a field hospital in france where she nursed his bad leg wound this kept him out of the rest of the fighting until she could return home with him they married in the summer of when georgina had introduced ilya to her parents his reception had been more than a little stiff for years her father severely british had been living down the fact that his wife was of bulgarian stock and now here was his daughter bringing home a damned gypsy it hadnt been that open but georgina had known what her father had thought of it all right her mother hadnt been quite so bad but was too fond of remembering how papa never much trusted the wallachs across the border a distrust which she put forward as one of the reasons hed emigrated to england in the first place in short ilya had not been made to feel at home sadly within the space of eight more years split evenly for georgina and ilya between bucharest and london time had caught up with both of her parents all squabbles were long forgotten by then and georgina had been left fairly well off which was as well in those early years ilya certainly wasnt earning enough from his teaching to keep her in her accustomed style but it was then that ilya had been offered a lucrative position as an interpretertranslator with the foreign office in london for while in life georginas father had once been something of a pain in death his legacy included an excellent introduction to diplomatic circles there was one condition to secure the position ilya must first become a british citizen this was no hardship hed intended it anyway eventually when the right opportunity presented itself but he did have a final terms contract at the institute and one more year to complete in bucharest before he could take up the position that last year in romania had been a sad one because of the knowledge that it was the last but towards the end of his term ilya had been glad the war was eleven years in the past and the air of the reviving cities had not been good for him london had been smog and bucharest fog both were laden with exhaust fumes and for ilya the taint of mouldering books in libraries and classrooms too his health had suffered a little they could have come back to england as soon as hed fulfilled his duties but a doctor in bucharest advised against it stay through the winter hed counselled but not in the city get out into the countryside long walks in the clean fresh air thats what you need evenings by a roaring log fire just taking it easy knowing that the snow lies deep without and that youre all warm within theres a deal of satisfaction in that it makes you glad youre alive it had seemed sound advice ilya wasnt due to start working at the foreign office until the end of may they spent christmas in bucharest with friends then early in the new year they took the train for slatina under the alps in fact the town was on the slopes gentling up to the foothills but the locals always spoke of it as being under the alps there they hired an old barn of a place set back from the highway to pitesti settling in just before the coming of the first real snows of the year by the end of january the snowploughs were out clearing the roads their blue exhaust smoke acrid in the sharp smarting air the townspeople went about their business with a great stamping of feet they were muffled to their ears more like great bundles of clothing than people ilya and georgina roasted chestnuts on their blazing open hearth fire and made plans for the future until now theyd held back from a family for their lives had seemed too unsettled but now now it felt right to start in fact theyd started almost two months earlier but georgina couldnt be sure yet she had her suspicions though days would find them in town when the snow would allow and nights they were here in their rambling hiring reading or making languid love before the fire usually the latter within a month of leaving bucharest ilyas irritating cough had disappeared and much of his former strength had returned with typical romanian zeal he revelled in expending much of it on georgina it had been like a second honeymoon midfebruary and the impossible happened three consecutive days of clear skies and bright sunshine and all of the snow steaming away so that on the morning of the fourth day it looked almost like an early spring another two or three days of fair weather the locals nodded knowingly and then youll see snow like youve never seen it so enjoy what weve got while you can ilya and georgina had determined to do just that over the years and under ilyas tuition georgina had become quite handy on a pair of skis it might be a very long time before they got the chance again down here on the socalled steppe all that remained of the snow were dark grey piles heaped at the roadsides a few kilometres up country towards the alps however there was still plenty to be found ilya hired a car for a couple of days a beatup old volkswagen beetle and skis and by pm on that fateful fourth day they had motored up into the foothills for lunch they stopped at a tiny inn on the northern extreme of lonesti ordering goulash which they washed down with thick coffee followed by a single shot each of sharp slivovitz to clean their mouths then on higher into the hills to a region where the snow still lay thick on the fields and hedgerows and there it was that ilya spied the hump of low grey hills a mile or so to the west and turned off the road on to a track to try to get a little closer finally the track had become rutted under the drifted snow and the snow itself deeper until at last ilya had grunted his annoyance not wanting to get bogged down revving the little cars engine hed bumpily turned it about in its own tracks the better to make an easy getaway when they were through with their sport landlaufen hed declared getting down their skis from the roof rack georgina had groaned crosscountry all the way to those hills theyre white he declared glittery with dust over the hard firm crust perfect maybe half a mile there a slow climb to the top and a controlled enjoyable slalom through the trees then back here just as the twilights coming down on us but its after three now shed protested then wed better get a move on come on itll be good for us good for us georgina sadly repeated now his picture still clear in her mind a year later tall and darkly handsome as he lifted the skis from the beetles roof and tossed them down in the snow whats that anne drew her younger cousin glanced back at her over her shoulder did you say something no georgina smiled wanly shaking her head she was glad for the intrusion of another into her memories but at the same time sorry ilyas face fading hung in the air superimposed over her cousins daydreaming thats all anne frowned turned back to her driving daydreaming she thought yes and georgina had done a lot of that over the last twelve months thered seemed to be something in her something other than little yulian that is which hadnt come out of her when he had grief yes of course but more than that it was as if shed teetered for twelve months on the very edge of a nervous breakdown and that only ilyas continuation in yulian had kept her from toppling as for daydreams sometimes shed seemed so very far away so detached from the real world that it had been difficult to call her back but now with the baby now she had something to cling to an anchor something to live for good for us georgina said again but this time to herself bitterly it hadnt been good for them that last fatal frolic in the snow on the cruciform hills anything but it had been terrible tragic a nightmare shed lived through a thousand times in the year gone by with ten thousand more to come she was sure lulled by the cars warmth and the purr of its motor she slipped back into her memories theyd found an old firebreak in the side of the hill and set out to climb it to the top pausing now and then with their breath pluming shielding their eyes against the white blaze but by the time theyd pantingly reached the crest the sun had been low and the light starting to fade from now on its all downhill ilya had pointed out a brisk slalom through the saplings grown up in the firebreak then a slow glide back to the car ready then here we go and the rest of it had been disaster the saplings hed mentioned were in fact halfgrown trees the snow drifted into the firebreak was far deeper than he might have guessed so that only the tops of the pines looking like saplings stood proud of the powdery white surface halfway down hed skied too close to one such a branch just under the surface showing as the merest tuft of green had tangled his righthand ski hed upended bounced and skittered and jarred another twentyfive yards in a whirling bundle of white anorak sticks and skis flailing arms and legs before grabbing another sapling and bringing his careening descent to a halt georgina well to his rear and skiing a little more timidly saw it all her heart seemed to fly into her mouth and she cried out then formed a snowplough of her skis and drew up alongside her husband where he sprawled shed stepped out of her clamps at once dug her skis in so that she couldnt lose them gone down on her knees beside him ilya held his sides as he laughed and laughed the tears of laughter rolling down his cheeks and freezing there clown shed thumped his chest then oh you clown you very nearly frightened the life out of me he had laughed all the louder grabbing her wrists holding her still then hed looked at his skis and stopped laughing the right ski was broken hanging by a splinter where it had cracked across its width some six inches in front of the clamp ah he had exclaimed then frownling and hed sat up in the snow and looked all about georgina had known then that it was serious she could see it in his eyes the way they narrowed you go back to the car hed told her but carefully mind you dont be like me and go banging your skis up start the car and get the heater going its not much more than a mile so by the time i get back youll have that old beetle good and warm for me no point both of us freezing no shed refused pointblank we go back together i georgina hed spoken quietly which meant that he was getting angry look if we go back together it means well both get back wet tired and very very cold now thats ok for me and i deserve it but you dont my way youll soon be warm and ill be warm a lot sooner also night is coming on you get back to the car now in the twilight and youll be able to put on the lights as a marker you can beep the horn now and then to let me know youre safe and warm and to give me an incentive you see she had seen but his arguments hadnt swayed her if we stick together at least well be together what if i did fall down and get stuck eh youd get back to the car and i wouldnt be there what then ilya id be frightened on my own for myself and for you for a second his eyes had narrowed more yet but then hed nodded youre right of course and again hed looked all about then taking off his skis very well this is what well do look down there the firebreak had continued for maybe another half kilometre running steeply downhill to both sides fullgrown trees some of them hoary with age stood thick and dark with the snow drifted in banks under them where they bordered the firebreak they stood so close that overhead their branches often interlocked they hadnt been cut for five hundred years those trees beneath them the snow was mostly patchy kept from the earth by the thick fir canopy which it covered like a mantle the cars over there said ilya pointing east around the curve of the hill and behind the trees well cut through the trees downhill to the track then follow our own skitracks back to the car cutting off the corner will save us maybe half a kilometre and it will be a lot easier than walking in deep snow easier for me anyway once were back on the track you can go on skis a gentle glide and when the cars in sight then you can go on ahead and get her going but well have to get a move on it will be gloomy now under those trees and in another halfhour the sun will be down we wont want to be in the wood too long after that then hed hoisted georginas skis to his shoulder and theyd left the firebreak for the shelter and the silence of the trees at first theyd made good headway so good in fact that she had almost stopped worrying but there was that about the hillside which oppressed a quiet too intense a sense of ages passing or passed like a few ticks of some vast clock and of something waiting watching so that she only desired to get down off the hill and back out into the open she supposed that ilya felt it too this strange genius loci for he had said very little and even his breathing was quiet as they made their way diagonally down through the trees moving from bole to black bole avoiding the more precipitous places as much as possible then they had reached a place where leaning stumps of stone the bedrock itself stuck up through the soil and leafmould following which they had to negotiate an almost sheer face of crumbling rock down to a levelled area and as he helped her down so they had noticed the handiwork of man there under the dark trees they stood upon lichenclad stone flags in front ofa mausoleum thats what the tumbled ruins had looked like anyway but here georgina had nervously clutched ilyas arm this could hardly be considered a holy place or hallowed ground not by any stretch of the imagination it seemed that unseen presences moved here lending their motion to the musty air without disturbing the festoons of cobwebs and dangling fingers of dead twigs that hung down from higher areas of gloom it was a cold place but lacking the normal invigorating cold of winter where the sun had only rarely broken through in how many centuries hewn from the raw stone of the hillside itself the tomb had long since caved in most of its roof of massive slabs lay in a tangle of broken masonry where the flags of the floor were cracked and arched upwards from the achingly slow groping of great roots a broken stone joist leaning now against the thickly matted ruin of a side wall had once formed the lintel above the tombs wide entrance it bore a vague motif or coat of arms hard to make out in the gloom ilya who had always had a fascination for antiquities of all sorts had gone to kneel beside the great sloping slab and gouge dirt from its carved legend well now his voice had sounded hushed and what are we to make of this eh georgina had shuddered i dont want to make anything of it this is an entirely horrid place come away lets go on but look there are heraldic markings here at least i suppose thats what they are this one at the bottom is a dragon yes with one forepaw raised see and above it i cant quite make it out because the sun is setting shed cried its getting gloomier by the moment but she had gone to peer over his shoulder anyway the dragon had been quite clearly worked a proudlooking creature chipped from the stone and thats a bat georgina had said at once a bat in flight over the dragons back ilya had hurriedly cleaned away more dirt and lichen from the old chiselled grooves and a third carved symbol had come to light but the great lintel which had seemed firmly enough bedded had suddenly shifted started to topple as the rotting wall gave way pushing georgina back ilya had thrown himself off balance trying to scramble backwards himself hed somehow got his leg sticking straight out in front of him directly under the toppling lintel still sprawling there as the slab fell his cry of agony and the nervegrating crunch as his leg broke and jagged bone sheared through his flesh came simultaneous with georginas scream then perhaps mercifully he had lost consciousness she had leaped to free him from the lintel only to discover that while it had broken his leg it had not trapped him the lower part of his leg flopped uselessly and fell at an odd angle when she touched it but miraculously it was not pinned then georgina had seen and felt the break the splintered bone projecting through red flesh and cloth and the repetitive spurt of blood against her hands and jacket and that until the moment of her awakening had been the last that georgina saw felt or heard or rather she had seen one other thing and then forgotten it at once as she slumped to the ground the thing she saw had remained forgotten or more properly suppressed it was the third symbol carved above the dragon and the bat which had seemed to leer at her even as the blackness closed in georgy were there annes voice broke the spell georgina reclining in the back of the car eyes almost closed in her suddenly pale face gave a start and sat upright she had been on the verge of remembering something about the place where ilya died something she hadnt wanted to remember now she gulped air gratefully forced a smile there already she managed to get the words out i i must have been miles away anne pulled the big car into the car park behind the church braking to a gentle halt then she turned to look at her passenger are you sure youre all right georgina nodded yes im fine maybe a little tired thats all come on help me with the carrycot the church was of old stone all stained glass and gothic arches with a cemetery to one side where the headstones were leaning and crusted with greygreen lichens georgina couldnt bear lichens especially when they covered old legends gouged in leaning slabs she looked the other way as she hurried by the graveyard and turned left around the buttressed corner of the church towards its entrance anne almost dragged along on the other handle of the carrycot had to break into a trot to keep up goodness she protested youd think we were late or something and in fact they were almost waiting on the steps in front of the church there stood annes fianc george lake they had lived together for three years and only just set a date and they were to be yulians godparents there had been several christenings this morning the most recent party of beaming parents godparents and relatives was just leaving the mother radiant as she held her child in its christeninggown george skipped by them came hurrying down the steps took the carrycot and said i sat through the entire service four christenings all that mumbling and muttering and splashing and screaming but i thought it was only right that one of us be here from start to finish but the old vicar lord hes a boring old fart god forgive me george and anne might well have been brother and sister even twins toss opposites attracting out the window thought georgina they were both fiveninish a bit plump if not actually fat both blondes grey eyed softspoken a few weeks separated their birthdates george was a sagittarius and anne a capricorn typically he would sometimes put his foot in it she had sufficient of her signs stability to pull him out of it that was annes interpretation of their relationship she being a lifelong advocate of astrology leaving georginas hands free to tidy herself up a little they now took the carrycot between them and made to enter the church the twin doors were of oak under a gothic arch one standing half open outwards on to the landing at the head of the steps a wind came up from nowhere blew yesterdays confetti up in mad swirls and slammed the door resoundingly in their faces earlier there had been the odd ray of sunshine filtering through wispy grey clouds but now the clouds seemed to mass the sun was switched off like a light and it grew noticeably darker not cold enough for snow said george turning his eyes apprehensively up to the sky my guess is its going to chuck it down chuck it or bucket anne was still reeling from the doors slamming her expression puzzled fuck it said george irreverently lets get in a moment more and the door was shoved open from inside by the vicar he was lean getting on a bit in years close to bald his one advantage was of great height so that he could look down on them all he had little eyes made huge by thicklensed spectacles and a veined beak of a nose that seemed to turn his head as if it were a weathercock his thinness gave the impression of a mantis but at the same time he managed to look owlish a bird of pray thought george and grinned to himself but at the same time he noted that the old vicars handshake was warm and full of comfort however trembly and that his smile was a beam of pure goodness nor was he lacking in his own brand of dry wit so glad you could make it he smiled and nodded over yulian in his carrycot the baby was awake his round eyes moving to and fro the vicar chucked him under his chubby chin said young man its always a good idea to be early for ones christening punctual for ones wedding and as late as one can get for ones funeral then he peered frowningly at the door the freak gust of wind had disappeared taking its confetti with it what happened here the old man lifted his eyebrows thats odd i had thought the bolt was home but in any case it takes a wind of some power to slam shut a door heavy as this one perhaps were in for a storm at the foot of the door a bolt dragged squealingly along the groove it had worn in old stone flags and thudded down into its bolthole as the vicar gave the door a final push there he wiped his hands nodded his satisfaction not such a boring old fart after all all three thought the identical thought as he led them inside and up to the font in his time the old clergyman had baptised georgina hed married her too and was aware that she was now a widow this was the church her parents had attended for most of their declining years the church her father had attended as a boy and young man there was no need for long preliminaries and so he began at once as george and anne put the cot down and as georgina took up yulian in her arms he began to intone hath this child been already baptised or no no georgina shook her head dearly beloved the vicar began in earnest foreasmuch as all men are conceived and born in sin sin thought georgina the old mans words flowing over her yulian wasnt conceived in sin this had ever been a part of the service that got her back up sin indeed conceived in joy and love and sweetest sweet pleasure yes unless pleasure were to be construed as sin she looked down at yulian in her arms he was alert staring at the vicar as he mumbled over his book it was a funny expression on the babys face not quite vacant not exactly a drool somehow intense they had all kinds of looks babies that thou wilt mercifully look upon this child wash him sanctify him with the holy ghost that he being the holy ghost ghosts had stirred under those stirless trees on the cruciform hills but in no way holy ones unholy ones thunder rumbled distantly and the high stained glass windows brightened momentarily from a far flash of lightning before falling into deeper gloom a light burned over the font however sufficient for the vicars eyes behind their thick lenses he shivered visibly as he read his lines for suddenly the temperature had seemed to fall dramatically the old man paused for a moment looked up and blinked his eyes went from the faces of the three adults to the baby paused there for a moment blinked rapidly he looked at the light over the font then at the high windows for all his shivering sweat gleamed on his brow and upper lip i i he said are you all right george was concerned he took the vicars arm a cold the old man tried to smile only succeeding in looking sick his lips seemed to stick to his teeth which were false and rather loose and he was immediately apologetic im sorry but this is not really surprising a draughty place you know but dont worry i wont let you down well get this finished it just came on so quickly thats all the sick smile twitched from his face after this said anne you should spend whats left of the weekend in bed i believe i will my dear fumblingly the vicar went back to his text georgina said nothing she felt the strangeness something was unreal out of focus did churches frown this one was frowning it had been hostile from the moment theyd arrived thats what was wrong with the vicar he could feel it too but he didnt know what it was but how do i know what it is georgina wondered have i felt it before they brought young children to christ that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them georgina felt the church groaning around her trying to expel her no trying to expel yulian she looked at the baby and he looked back his face broke into that unsmile which small babies smile but his eyes were fixed steady unblinking even as she stared at him she saw those darling eyes swivel in their sockets to gaze full upon the old vicar nothing wrong with that it was just that it had looked so deliberate yulian is ordinary georgina denied what she was thinking shed had this feeling before and denied it and now she must do it again he is ordinary it was her not the baby she was blaming him for ilya it was the only explanation she glanced at george and anne and they smiled back reassuringly didnt they feel the cold the strangeness they obviously thought she was concerned about the vicar the service other than that they felt nothing oh maybe they felt how draughty the place was but that was all georgina felt more than the cold and so did the vicar he was skipping lines now hurrying through the service almost mechanically about as human as some gaunt robot penguin he avoided looking at them especially yulian maybe he could feel the infants eyes on him unwaveringly dearly beloved the old man was chanting at anne and george now the godparents ye have brought this child here to be baptised have to stop it georginas thoughts were growing wilder she started to panic have to before it but before what happens to release him of his sins to sanctify him with outside much closer now thunder rumbled accompanied by lightning that lit up the westfacing windows and sent kaleidoscopic beams of bright colours lancing through the interior the group about the font was first gold then green finally crimson yulian was blood in georginas arms his eyes were blood where they stared at the vicar at the back of the church under the pulpit almost unnoticed all of this time a funereal man had been sweeping up his broom scraping on the stone flags now for no apparent reason he threw the broom down tore off his apron and rolled it up almost ran from the church he could be heard grumbling to himself angry about something another flash of lightning turned him blue green finally white as an undeveloped photograph as he reached the door and plunged out of sight eccentric the vicar seeming a little more in control of himself frowned after him blinked at his abrupt disappearance he cleans the church because he has a feel for it so he tells me er can we get on george had apparently had enough of interruptions of course of course the old man peered again at his book skipped several more lines er promise that you are his sureties that he will renounce the devil and all his works and constantly believe yulian had also had enough he began to kick gathered air for a howling session his face puffed up and started to turn a little blue which would normally mean that frustration and anger were coming to the boil just beneath the surface georgina couldnt keep back a great sigh of relief at that what was yulian but a helpless baby after all the carnal desires of the flesh was crucified dead and buried that he went down into hell and also did rise again the third day that he just a baby thought georgina with ilyas blood and mine and and the quick and the dead the church was thunder dark the storm almost directly overhead resurrection of the flesh and everlasting life after death georgina gave a start as anne and george answered in unison all this we steadfastly believe wilt he then be baptised in this faith george and anne again that is his desire but yulian denied it he gave a howl to raise the rafters jerked and kicked with an astonishing strength where his mother cradled him the old clergyman sensed trouble brewing not the real trouble but trouble anyway and decided not to prolong things he took the baby from georginas arms yulians white christeninggown was a haze of almost neon light himself a pink pulsation in its folds above the babys howling the old vicar said to george and anne name this child yulian they answered simply yulian he nodded i baptise thee in the name of he paused stared at the baby his right hand practised accustomed of its own accord had dipped into the font lifted water poised dripping yulian continued to howl anne and george and georgina heard his crying only that no longer touching her child georgina felt suddenly free unburdened separate from what was coming it was not her doing she was merely an observer this priest must bear the brunt of his own ritual she too heard only yulians crying but she felt the approach of something enormous to the vicar the infants howling had taken on a new note it was no longer the cry of a child but a beast his jaw dropped and he looked up blinking rapidly as he peered from face to face george and anne smiling if a little uncomfortably and georgina looking small and wan and then he looked again at yulian the baby was issuing grunts animal grunts of rage its crying was only a cover like perfume masking the stink of ordure underneath was the bass croaking of utter horror automatically his hand trembling like a leaf in a gale the old man splashed a little water on the infants fevered brow traced a cross there with his finger the water might well have been acid no the thunderous croaking formed a denial put no cross on me you treacherous christian dog what the vicar suspected hed gone insane his eyes bulged behind the thick lenses of his spectacles the others heard nothing except the babys crying which now ceased on the instant old man and infant stared at each other in a deafening silence what the vicar asked again his voice a whisper before his eyes the skin of the babys brow puffed up in twin mounds like huge boils accelerated to instantaneous eruption the fine skin split and blunt goat horns came through curving as they emerged yulians jaws elongated into a dogs muzzle which cracked open to reveal a red cave of white knives and a vipers flickering tongue the breath of the thing was a stench an open tomb its eyes pits of sulphur burned on the vicars face like fire jesus said the old man oh my god what are you and he dropped the child or would have but george had seen the glazing of his eyes the slackening of his body the bloods rapid draining from his face as the old man crumpled george stepped forward took yulian from him anne also quick off the mark had caught the old man and managed to lower him a little less than gently to the floor but georgina was also reeling like the other two she had seen smelled heard nothing but she was yulians mother she had felt something coming and she knew that it had been here as she too fainted so there came a thunderbolt that struck the steeple and a cannonade of thunder that rolled on and on then there was only silence and light gradually returning and dust shaken down in rivulets from rafters high overhead and george and anne white as ghosts gaping at each other in the churchs lightening gloom and yulian angelic in his godfathers arms georgina was a year making her recovery yulian spent the time with his godparents at the end of which they had their own child to fuss over and care for his mother spent it in a somewhat select sanatorium no one was much surprised her breakdown so long delayed had finally arrived with a vengeance george and anne and others of georginas friends visited her regularly but no one mentioned the abortive christening or the death of the vicar that had been a stroke or some such the old mans health had been waning hed lasted only a few hours after his collapse in the church george had gone with him in an ambulance to the hospital had been with him when he died the old man had come to in the final moments before he passed forever from this world his eyes had focussed on georges face widened filled with memory disbelief its all right george had comforted him patting the hand which grasped his forearm with a feverish strength take it easy youre in good hands good hands good hands my god the old man had been quite lucid i dreamed i dreamed there was a christening you were there it was almost an accusation george smiled there was supposed to be a christening hed answered but dont worry you can finish it when youre up and about again it was real the old man tried to sit up it was real george and a nurse supported him in his bed lowered him as he collapsed again on to his pillows then he caved in his face contorted and he seemed to crumple into himself the nurse rushed from the room shouting for a doctor still convulsing the vicar beckoned george closer with a twitching finger his face was fluttering had turned the colour of lead george put his ear to the old mans whispering lips heard christen it no no you mustnt first first have it exorcised and those were the last words he ever spoke george mentioned it to no one obviously the old boys mind had been going too a week after the christening yulian developed a rash of tiny white blisters on his forehead they eventually dried up and flaked away leaving barely visible marks exactly like freckles chapter five he was a funny little thing anne lake laughed shook her head and set her blonde hair flying in the breeze from the cars halfopen window do you remember when we had him that year it was late in the summer of and they were driving down to stay with georgina and yulian for a week the last time theyd seen them was two years ago george had thought the boy was strange then and hed said so on several occasions not to georgina and certainly not to yulian himself of course not but to anne in private now he said so again funny little thing he cocked an eyebrow thats one way of putting it i suppose weird would be a better way and from what i remember of him last time we came down he hasnt changed what was a weird baby is now a weird young man oh george thats ridiculous all babies are different from each other yulian was well more different thats all listen said george that child wasnt two months old when he came to us and he had teeth teeth like little needles sharp as hell and i remember georgina saying he was born with them thats why she couldnt breastfeed him george said anne warningly a little sharply reminding him that helen sat in the back of the car she was their daughter a beautiful occasionally precocious girl of sixteen helen sighed very deliberately and audibly and said oh mother i know what breasts are for apart from being natural attractions for the opposite sex that is why must you put them on your taboo list taboob list george grinned george said anne again more forcefully nineteen seventyseven helen scoffed but youd never know it not in this family i mean feeding your babys natural isnt it more natural than letting your breasts be groped in the back row of some grubby fleapit cinema helen anne halfturned in her seat her lips compressing to a thin line its been a long time george glanced at his wife semiruefully what has she snapped since i was groped in a fleapit cinema he said anne snorted her exasperation she gets it from you she accused youve always treated her like an adult because she is an adult very nearly he answered you can only guide them so far anne my love and after that theyre on their own helens healthy intelligent happy goodlooking and she doesnt smoke pot shes worn a bra for nearly four years and every month she george taboo said helen giggling anyway georges irritation was showing now we werent talking about helen but yulian helen i submit is normal her cousin or cousin once removed or whateveris not give me a forinstance anne argued an example not normal you say well then is he abnormal subnormal wheres his defect whenever yulian crops up helen joined in from the back you two always end up arguing is he really worth it your mothers a very loyal person george told her over one shoulder georgina is her cousin and yulian is georginas son which means theyre untouchable your mother wont face simple facts thats all shes the same with all her friends she wont hear a word against them very laudable but i call a spade a spade i find and have always found yulian a bit much as i said before weird you mean helen pressed a bit ninebob notish helen her mother protested yet again i get that one from you helen stopped her dead in her tracks you always talk about gays as ninebobbers i never talk about about homosexuals anne was furious and certainly not to you about them ive heard daddy in conversation with you about one or two of his manfriends say that soandso is gay as a defrocked vicar said helen matteroffactly and youve replied what soandso ninebobbish really anne rounded on her and might well have lashed out physically if she could have reached her redfaced she cried then in future well have to lock you in your bloody room before we dare have an adult conversation you horrid girl perhaps you better had helen was equally quick to rise before i also start to swear all right all rightr george quietened them points taken all round but were on holiday remember i mean its probably my fault but yulians a sore point with me thats all and i cant even explain why but he usually keeps out of the way most of the time were there and i cant help it but i hope its the same this time for my peace of mind anyway hes simply not my type of lad as for him being howsyourfather i cant say but he did get kicked out of that boarding school and he did not anne had to have her say kicked out indeed he got his qualifications a year early left a year before the rest i mean to say do qualifications does being intelligent above the average certify someone as a raving homosexual heaven forbid clever miss knowitall here has a couple of second class a levels which apparently make her nearomniscient in which case yulian has to be close to godlike george what qualifications do you have i fail to see what that has to do with it he answered the way i hear it more gays come out of the universities than ever came out of all the secondary moderns put together and george i was an apprentice he sighed as you well know trade qualifications ive got them all and then i was a journeyman an architect earning money for my boss until i got into business for myself and anyway what academic qualifications she was determined george drove the car said nothing wound down his window a little and breathed warm air after a while the same as you darling none whatsoever anne was triumphant why yulians cleverer than all of us put together on paper anyway i say give him time and hell show us all a thing or two oh i admit hes quiet comes and goes like a ghost seems less active and enthusiastic about life than a boy his age should be but give him a break for gods sake look at his disadvantages he never knew his father was brought up by georgina entirely on her own and shes never been altogether with it since ilya died has lived in that gloomy old mansion of a place for twelve years of his young life little wonder hes a bit well reticent she seemed to have won the day they said nothing to dispute her logic had apparently lost all interest in the argument anne searched her mind for a new topic found nothing relaxed in her seat reticent helen turned her own thoughts over in her head yulian reticent did her mother mean backward of course not her argument had been all against that shy retiring yes thats what she must have meant well and he must seem shy if one didnt know better helen knew better from that time two years ago and as for queer hardly she would greatly doubt it anyway she smiled secretly better to let them go on thinking it though at least while they thought he was a woofter they wouldnt worry about her being in his company but no yulian wasnt entirely gay ac dc maybe two years ago yes it had taken helen ages to get him to talk to her she remembered the circumstances clearly it had been a beautiful saturday their second day of a tenday spell her parents and aunt georgina gone off to salcombe for a days sea and sunbathing yulian and helen were left in charge of the house he with his alsatian pup to play with and she to explore the gardens the great barn the crumbling old stables and the dark dense copse yulian wasnt into bathing indeed he hated the sun and sea and helen would have preferred anything rather than spend time with her parents walk with me shed pressed yulian finding him alone with the gangling pup in the dim cool library he had shook his head pale in the shade of this one room which the sun never seemed to reach hed lounged awkwardly on a settee fondling the pups floppy ears with one hand and holding a book in the other why not you could show me the grounds he had glanced at the pup he gets tired if he walks too far hes still not quite steady on his legs and i burn easily in the sun i really dont much care for the sun and anyway im reading youre not much fun to be with she had told him deliberately pouting and shed asked is there still straw in the hayloft over the barn hayloft yulian had looked surprised his long not unhandsome face had formed a soft oval against the dark velvet of the back of the settee i havent been up there in years what are you reading anyway she sat down beside him reached for the book held loosely in his longfingered softlooking hand he drew back kept the book from her not for little girls he said his expression unchanging frustrated she tossed her hair glanced all about the large room and it was large that room partitioned in the middle just like a public library with floor to ceiling shelves and booklined alcoves all round the walls it smelled of old books dusty and musty no it reeked of them so that you almost feared to breathe in case your lungs got filled with words and inks and desiccated glue and paper fibres there was a shallow cupboard in one corner of the room and its door stood open tracks in the threadbare carpet showed where yulian had dragged a stepladder to a certain section of the shelving the books on the top shelf were almost hidden in gloom where old cobwebs were gathering dust but unlike the neat rows of books in the lower shelves they were piled haphazardly lying in a jumble as if recently disturbed oh she stood up im a little girl am i and what does that make you were only a year apart you know she went to the stepladder started to climb yulians adams apple bobbed he tossed his book aside came easily to his feet you leave that top shelf alone he said unemotionally coming to the foot of the ladder she ignored him looked at the titles read out loud coates human magnetism or how to hypnotise huh mumbojumbo lycan er lycanthropy eh and the erotic beardsleyf she clapped her hands delightedly what dirty pictures yulian she took the book from the shelf opened it oh she said rather more quietly the black and white drawing on the page where the book had opened was rather more bestial than erotic put it down yulian hissed from below helen put down the beardsley read off more titles vampirism ugh sexual powers of satyrs and nymphomaniacs sadism and sexual aberration and parasitic creatures how diverse and not dusty at all these old books do you read them a lot yulian he gave the ladder a shake and insisted come down from there his voice was very low almost menacing it was guttural deeper than shed heard it before almost a mans voice and not a youths at all then she looked down at him yulian stood below her his face turned up at a sharp angle just below the level of her knees his eyes were like holes punched in a paper face with pupils shiny as black marbles she stared hard at him but their eyes didnt meet because he wasnt looking at her face why i do believe she told him then teasingly that youre quite naughty really yulian what with these books and everything she had worn her short dress because of the heat and now she was glad he looked away touched his brow turned aside you you wanted to see the barn his voice was soft again can we she was down the ladder in a flash i love old barns but your mother said it wasnt safe i think its safe enough he answered georgina worries about everything he had called his mother georgina since he was a little boy she didnt seem to mind they went through the rambling house to the front yulian excusing himself for a moment to go to his room he came back wearing dark spectacles and a floppy widebrimmed hat now you look like some pallid mexican brigand helen told him leading the way and with the black alsatian pup tumbling at their heels they made their way to the barn in fact it was a very simple outbuilding of stone with a platform of planks across the high beams to form a hayloft next door were the stables completely rundown just a derelict old huddle of buildings until five or six years ago the bodescus had let a local farmer winter his ponies on the grounds and hed stored hay for them in the barn why on earth do you need such a big place to live helen asked as they entered the barn through a squealing door into shade and dusty sunbeams and the scurry of mice im sorry he said after a moment his thoughts elsewhere this place the whole place and that high stone wall all the way round it how much land does it enclose that fell three acres just over three and a half he answered a great rambling house old stables barns an overgrown paddock even a shady copse to walk through in the autumn when the colours are growing old i mean why do two ordinary people need so much space just to live in ordinary he looked at her curiously his eyes moistly gleaming behind dark lenses and do you consider yourself ordinary of course well i dont i think youre quite extraordinary so am i and so is georgina all of us for different reasons he sounded very sincere almost aggressive as if defying her to contradict him but then he shrugged anyway its not a question of why we need it its ours thats all but how did you get it i mean you couldnt have bought it there must be so many other well easier places to live yulian crossed the paved floor between piles of old slates and rusty brokendown implements to the foot of the open wooden stairs hayloft he said turning his dark eyes on her she couldnt see those eyes but she could feel them sometimes his movements were so fluid it almost seemed as if he were sleepwalking they were like that now as he climbed the stairs slowly step by deliberate step there is still straw he said voice languid as a deep pool she watched him until he passed out of sight there was a leanness about him a hunger her father thought he was soft girlish but helen guessed otherwise she saw him as an intelligent animal as a wolf sort of furtive but unobtrusive and always there on the edge of things just waiting for his chance she suddenly felt stifled and took three deep deliberate gulps of air before following him going carefully up the wooden steps she said now i remember it was your greatgrandfathers wasnt it the house i mean she emerged into the hayloft three great bales of hay blanched with age stood dusty and withered in a pyramid one end of the loft stood open where projecting gables spared it from the elements thin hot beams of sunlight came slanting in from chinks in the tiles trapping dustmotes like flies in amber forming yellow spotlights on the floorboards yulian took out a pocket knife sliced deftly at the binding of the uppermost bale it fell to pieces like an ancient book and he dragged great deep armfuls down onto the boards a bed for a gypsy thought helen or a wanton she threw herself down was conscious that her dress rode up above her knickers where she lay face down she did nothing to adjust it instead she spread her legs a little wriggled her backside and contrived to make the movement seem perfectly unconscious which it was not yulian stood still for long moments and she could feel his eyes on her but she simply cupped her chin in her hands and stared out of the open end of the loft from here you could see the perimeter wall the curving drive the copse yulians shadow eclipsed several discs of sunlight and she held her breath the straw stirred and she knew he was right behind her like a wolf in the forest his floppy hat fell in the straw on her left his sunglasses plopped down into the hat he got down beside her on her right his arm falling casually across her waist casually yes and light as a feather but she could feel it like a bar of iron he lay not quite so far forward propping his jaw in his right hand looking at her his arm lying across her like that must feel very awkward he was taking most of its weight and she could feel it beginning to tremble but he didnt seem to mind but of course he wouldnt would he greatgrandfathers yes he finally answered her question he lived and died here the place came down to georginas mother her husband my grandfather didnt like it and so they rented it out and lived in london when they died it fell to georgina but by then it was on a lifelease to the old colonel who lived here eventually it was his turn to go and then georgina came down to sell it she brought me with her i wasnt quite five i think but i liked the place and said so i said we should live here and georgina thought it a good idea you really are remarkable she said i cant remember anything about when i was five his arm had slid diagonally across her now so that his fingers barely touched her thigh just below the curve of her bottom helen could feel an almost electric tingle in those fingers they held no such charge she knew but thats how it felt i remember everything almost from the moment i was born he told her his voice so even it was very nearly hypnotic maybe it was hypnotic sometimes i even think i remember things from before my birth well that might explain why youre so extraordinary she told him but what is it makes me different your innocence he at once replied his voice a purr and your desire not to be his hand caressed her rump now the merest touch of electric fingers tracing the curve of her buttocks to and fro to and fro helen sighed put a piece of straw between her teeth slowly turned over on to her back her dress rode up even more she didnt look at yulian but gazed wideeyed at the sloping rows of tiles overhead as she turned so he lifted his hand a fraction but didnt take it away my desire not to be not to be innocent what makes you think that and she thought because its so obvious when he answered yulians voice was a mans again she hadnt noticed the slow transition but now she did thick and dark that voice as he said ive read it all girls of your age desire not to be innocent his hand fell on her belly lingered over her navel slipped down and crept under the band of her knickers she stopped him there trapping his hand with her own no yulian you cant cant the word came in a gulp choking why because youre right i am innocent but also because its the wrong time time he was trembling again she pushed him away sighed abruptly and said oh yulian im bleeding bleed he rolled away from her snatched himself to his feet startled she stared at him standing there he shivered as if in a fever bleeding yes she said its perfectly natural you know there was no pallor in his face now it was red with blood burning like a drunkards face with his eyes narrow slits dark as knife slashes bleeding this time he managed to choke the word out whole he reached out his arms towards her hands hooked like claws and for a moment she thought he would attack her she could see his nostrils flaring a nervous tic tugging the corner of his mouth for the first time she felt afraid felt something of his strangeness yes she whispered it happens every month his eyes opened up a little their pupils seemed flecked with scarlet a trick of the light ah ah bleeding he said as though only just understanding her meaning oh yes then he reeled turned away went a little unsteadily down the steps and was gone then helen had heard the puppys wild yelp of joy and its whining and barking fading as it followed yulian back to the house and finally she started to breathe again yulian shed called after him then your sunglasses your hat but if he heard he didnt bother to answer she wasnt able to find him for the rest of the day but then she hadnt really looked for him and because she had her pride and also because he had failed to seek her out she hadnt much bothered with him for the rest of their holiday perhaps it had been for the best for she had been innocent after all she wouldnt have known what to do not two years ago but when she thought of him she still remembered his hand burning on her flesh and now going back to devon with the countryside speeding by outside the car she found herself wondering if there was still straw in the hayloft george too had his secret thoughts about yulian anne could say what she liked but she couldnt change that he was weird that lad and weird in several directions it wasnt only the creepingjesus aspect that irritated george though certainly the youths furtive ways were annoying enough but he was sick too not mental maybe not even sick in his body just generally sick to look at him sometimes to catch him unawares with a sideglance was to look at a cockroach surprised by a switchedon light or a jellyfish steaming away stranded on the beach when the tide goes out you could almost sense something seething in him but if it wasnt mental or physical and yet encompassed both then what the hell was it hard to explain maybe it was both mind and body and soul too except george wasnt much of a one for believing in souls he didnt disbelieve but he would like evidence hed probably be praying when he died just in case but until then as for what anne had said about yulian at school well it was true as far as it went he had taken all of his exams early and passed every one of them but that wasnt why hed left early george had a draughtsman ian jones working for him in his london office and jones had a young son in the same school anne would hear none of it of course not but the stories had been wild yulian had seduced a male teacher a halfwaygone gay hed somehow switched on once over the top the fellow had apparently turned into a raver trying to roger every male thing that moved hed blamed yulian that was one thing and then in his art classes yulian had painted pictures which caused a very gentle lady teacher to attack him physically shed also stormed his bedspace and burned his art folios out nature rambling yulian had been found wandering on his own his face and hands smeared with filth and entrails dangling from one hand hed carried the remains of a stray kitten its carcass was still warm hed said a man had done it but this was out on the moors miles from anywhere that wasnt all it seemed he walked in his sleep and had apparently scared the living shit out of the younger boys until the school had had to put a nightguard on their dorms but by then the head had spoken at length with georgina and shed agreed he could leave it was that or expulsion for the sake of the good name of the school and thered been other things lesser things but that had been the gist of it these were some of the reasons why george didnt like yulian but of course there was one other thing it was something very nearly as old as yulian himself but it had fixed itself in georges mind indelibly the sight of an old man clutching his sheets to his chest as he died and his last whispered words christen it no no you mustnt first have it exorcised anne could be strident if she had to be but she was good through and through she would never say a thing to hurt anyone even though she might think certain things to herself if only to herself she had to admit that shed thought things about yulian now lying back a little in her seat and stretching feeling the cooling draught from the halfopen window she thought them again funny things something about a big green frog and something about the pain shed get now and then in her left nipple the frog thing was hard to focus on rather she didnt like to focus on it personally she couldnt hurt a fly of course a child a mere fiveyear old wouldnt realise what he was doing would he the trouble was that as long as shed know yulian hed always seemed to know exactly what he was doing even as a baby she had called him a funny little thing but in fact george was right yulian had been more than just funny for one thing he never cried no not quite true he had cried when hungry at least when he was very small and he had cried in direct sunlight photophobia apparently right from infancy oh yes and hed cried at least one other time at his christening though that had seemed more rage or outrage than crying proper as far as anne knew he never had been properly christened she let her thoughts take hold carrying her back yulian had just started to walk to toddle anyway when helen came along that was a month or so before poor georgina had been well enough to go home and take him back anne remembered that time well shed been heavy with milk fat as butter and happier than at any other time in her life and rosy what a picture of health shed been one day when helen was just six weeks old while she was feeding her yulian had come toddling like a little robot looking for that extra ounce of affection of which helen had robbed him jealousy even then yes for he was no longer all important on impulse feeling a pang of pity for the poor mite shed picked him up bared her other breast to him her left breast and fed him even remembering it the twinge of pain in her nipple came back like a wasp sting to bother her oh she said stirring where she had fallen halfasleep you all right george was quick to inquire wind your window down a little more get some fresh air the steady purr of the cars engine brought her back to the present cramp she lied pins and needles can we stop somewhere the next cafe of course he answered there should be one any time now anne slumped returned halfreluctantly to her memories feeding yulian yes shed sat down with both babies nodded off while they fed helen on the right yulian on the left it had been strange a sort of languor had come over her a lethargy she hadnt the will to resist but then when the pain came shed come quickly awake helen had been crying and yulian had been bloody shed stared at the toddler in something close to shock those peculiar black eyes of his fixed unwaveringly on her face and his red mouth fixed like a lamprey on her breast her milk and blood had run down the swollen curve of her breast and his face had been smeared and glistening red with it so that hed looked like a darkeyed gorging leech when shed cleaned herself up and cleaned up yulian too shed seen how hed bitten through the skin around her nipple his teeth had left tiny punctures the bites had taken a long time to heal but their sting had never quite gone away then there had been the frog episode anne didnt really want to dwell on that but it formed a persistent picture in her mind one she couldnt wipe clear it had happened after georgina had sold up in london on the last day before she and yulian had left the city and gone down to devon to live in the old manor house george had built a pond in the garden of their greenford home when helen was one since when with a minimum of help the pond had stocked itself now there were lilies a clump of rushes an ornamental shrub bending over the water like a japanese picture and a large species of green frog there were water snails too and at the edges a little green scum anne called it scum anyway midsummer and there would normally be dragonflies but that year theyd only seen one or two and theyd been small ones of their sort she had been in the garden with the children watching yulian where he played with a soft rubber ball or perhaps played is the wrong word for yulian had difficulty playing like other children he seemed to have a philosophy a ball is a ball a rubber sphere drop it and it bounces toss it against a wall and it returns other than that it has no practical use it cannot be considered a source of lasting interest others might argue the point but that summed up yulians feelings on the subject anne really didnt know why shed bought the ball for him he never really played with anything he had bounced it however twice and hed tossed it against the garden wall once but on the rebound it had rolled to the edge of the pond yulian had followed it with eyes half scornful until suddenly his interest had quickened at the edge of the pond something leaped a large frog shiny green poising itself where it landed with two legs in the water and two on dry land and the fiveyear old child froze becoming still as a cat in the first seconds that it senses prey it was helen who ran to retrieve the ball then skipped away with it up the garden but yulian had eyes only for the frog at that point george had called out from inside the house something about the kebabs burning they were to be the main course in a farewell meal for georgina george was supposed to be doing chef anne had rushed to save the day along the crazypaving under the arch of roses on their trellis to the paved patio area at the rear of the house it had taken a minute two at the outside to lift the steaming meat from the grill onto a plate on the outdoor table then georgina had come drifting downstairs in that slow getthereeventually fashion of hers and george had appeared from the kitchen with his herbs sorry darling hed apologised timing is everything and im out of practice but ive got it all together now and alls well except that all had not been well hearing helens cry of alarm from the lower garden anne had breathlessly retraced her steps at first as she reached the pond anne hadnt quite known what she was seeing she thought yulian must have fallen face down in the green scum then her eyes focussed and the picture firmed and however much shed tried to forget it it had remained firm to this day the tiny white mosaic tiles at the edge of the pond slimed with blood and guts and yulian slimed too his face and hands sticky with goo crosslegged by the pond like a buddha yulian the frog like a torn green plastic bag in his inexpert hands slopping its contents and that child of of innocence studying its innards smelling it listening to it apparently astonished by its complexity then his mother had come wafting up from behind saying oh dear oh dear was it a live thing oh i see it was he does that sometimes opens things up curiosity to see how they work and anne aghast snatching up the whining helen and turning her face away gasping but georgina thats not some old alarmclock its a frog is it is it oh dear poor thing shed fluttered her hands but its a phase hes going through thats all hell grow out of it and anne remembered thinking god certainly hope so devon said george triumphantly jogging her elbow startling her did you see the sign the county boundary and look theres your cafe cream teas fudge clotted cream well top the car up have a bite to eat and then were on the last leg peace and quiet for a whole week lord how i can use it arriving at the house and turning off the paignton road into its grounds the party in the car found georgina and yulian waiting for them on the gravel drive at first they very nearly failed to notice georgina for she was overshadowed by her son as george stopped the car helens jaw fell open a little anne simply stared george himself thought yulian yes of course it is but whats he been doing right getting out of the car finally anne spoke echoing georges thoughts yulian my but what a couple of years have done for you he held her briefly taller by inches then turned to helen where she got out of the back seat and stretched im not the only one who has grown he said his voice was that dark one helen had heard on a previous occasion apparently his natural voice now he held her at arms length stared at her with those unfathomable eyes hes handsome as the devil she thought or perhaps handsome was the wrong word for it attractive yes almost unnaturally so his long straight chin not quite lanternjaw high brow straight flatfish nose and especially his eyes all combined to form a face which might seem quite odd on anyone elses shoulders but coupled with that voice and with yulians mind behind it the effect was quite devastating he looked somehow foreign almost alien his dark hair flowing naturally back and forming something of a mane at the back of his neck made him seem even more wolfish than shed remembered that was it wolfish and he was getting tall as a tree youre still slim anyway she finally found something to say however uninspired but whats aunt georgina been feeding you he smiled and turned to george nodded and held out his hand george did you have a good journey weve worried a little the roads get so crowded down here in the summer george george groaned inwardly first names just like with mummy hey still it was better than being shied away from the drive was fine george forced a smile checking yulian out but unobtrusively the youth topped him by a good three inches add his hair to that and he looked taller still seventeen and already he was a big man bigboned anyway but give him another stone in weight and hed be like a barn door also his handshake was iron hardly limpwristed no matter the length of his fingers george was suddenly very much aware of his own thinning hair his small paunch and slightly stodgy appearance but at least i can go out in the sun he thought yulians pallor was one thing that never changed even here he stood in the shade of the old house like part of its shadow but if the last two years had improved yulian theyd not been so kind to his mother georgina anne had meanwhile turned to her cousin hugging her beneath the hug she had felt how frail she was how trembly the loss of her husband almost eighteen years before was still taking its toll and and looking so well liar george couldnt help thinking well she looks like something clockwork thats about wound itself down it was true georgina seemed like an automaton she spoke and moved as if programmed anne george helen so good to see you all again so glad you accepted yulians invitation but come in come in you can guess what weve got for you of course a cream tea naturally she led the way floating light as air and went inside yulian paused at the door turned and said yes do come in feel free enter freely and make yourselves at home the way he said it somehow ritualistically made his welcome sound quite odd as george at the rear made to pass him yulian added can i bring in your luggage for you why thanks said george here ill give you a hand not necessary yulian smiled just give me the keys he opened the boot and took out their cases as if they were empty and weighed nothing it wasnt just show george could see that yulian was very strong following him inside the house and feeling just a shade useless george paused on hearing a low growl of warning which came from an open cloakroom in an alcove to one side of the entrance hall in there in the deepest shadows behind a dark oak coatstand something black as sin moved and yellow eyes glared george looked harder said what in and the growling came louder yulian halfway down the corridor towards the stairs turned and looked back oh dont let him intimidate you george his bark is worse than his bite i assure you and in a harsher tone of command come boy out into the light where we can see you a black alsatian almost full grown came slinking into view baring its teeth at george as it slid by him the dog went straight to yulian stood waiting george noticed that it didnt wag its tail its all right old friend the youth murmured you make yourself scarce at which the vicious looking creature moved on into the house good lord said george thank goodness hes well trained whats his name vlad yulian answered at once turning away cases and all its romanian i believe means prince or something or it did in the old times yulian wasnt much visible for the next two or three days the fact did not especially bother george if anything he was relieved anne merely thought it odd that he wasnt around helen felt he was avoiding her and was annoyed about it but she didnt let it show what does he do with himself all day anne asked georgina for the sake of something to say when they were alone together one morning georginas eyes seemed constantly dull but only mention yulian and theyd take on a startled almost shocked brightness anne mentioned him now and sure enough there was that look oh he has his interests she at once tried to change the subject words tumbling out of her were thinking about having the old stables down there are extensive vaults under the grounds old cellars wine cellars my grandfather used and yulian thinks the stables will crash right through to them one day if we have them down well sell the stone its good stone and should fetch a decent price vaults i didnt know that you say yulian goes down there to check their condition he worries about maintenance could collapse make the house unsafe just old corridors almost like tunnels and vaults opening off them full of nitre spiders rotten old wine racks nothing of interest seeing the sudden buildup of her frenzy anne got up crossed to georgina laid a hand on her frail shoulder the older woman reacted as if shed been slapped jerked away from anne her eyes suddenly focussed anne she said her voice a shivering whisper dont ask about that place below and never go down there its not not safe down there the lakes had come down from london on the third thursday in august the weather was very hot and showed no sign of letting up on the monday anne and helen drove off to buy straw sunhats for themselves in paignton a few miles away georgina was having her noontime snooze and yulian was nowhere to be found george remembered anne mentioning the vaults under the house wine cellars according to georgina with nothing better to do he went out walked round the house to the back came face to face with a sort of shed built of old stone hed noticed it before had long since concluded that it must be an old disused outdoor loo and until now had had nothing more to do with it it had a tiled sloping roof and a door facing away from the house shrubbery grew rank untended all about the door was sagging on rotten hinges but george managed to drag it ajar and squeezing inside he knew at once that this must be an entrance to the alleged cellars narrow stone steps went down steeply on both sides of a ramp perfectly suited for the rolling of barrels you could find covered delivery points like this in the yard of any old pub he went carefully down the steps to a door at the bottom began to push it squealingly open vald was in there his muzzle came through the first three inches of gap even as george pushed on the door the snarl of rage preceded it by the merest fraction of a second and snarl and snout both were the only warning george got shocked he snatched back his hands and only just in time the alsatians teeth snapped on the door jamb where his fingers had been tearing off long splinters of wood heart hammering george leaned on the door closed it hed seen the dogs eyes and they had looked quite hateful but why would vlad be down there in the first place george could only suppose that yulian had put him there to keep him out of the way while guests were around a wise move for obviously vlads bark was not as bad as his bite maybe yulian was down there with him well they were a duo george could well do without feeling shaken he left the grounds and walked half a mile down the road to a pub at the crossroads on the way surrounded by fields and lanes birdsong and the normal entirely pleasant hum of insects in the hedgerows his nerves slowly recovered the sun was hot and by the time he reached his destination he was ready for a drink the pub was ancient thatched all oak beams and horsebrasses with a gently ticking grandfather clock and a massive white cat overhanging its own chair after vlad george could stand cats well enough he ordered a lager perched himself on a barstool there were others in the bar a fashionable young couple seated well away from george at a corner table close to smallpaned windows who doubtless owned the little sports job hed seen parked in the yard local youths in another corner playing dominoes and two oldtimers deep in conversation over their pints at a table close by it was the muttered lowered tones of this latter pair which attracted him sipping his icecold lager and after the bartender had moved on to other tasks george thought he heard the word harkley and his ears pricked up harkley house was georginas place oh ar that un up there hey a funny un im told course there aint a jot o proof but shed bin seen wi im right enough an clean off sharkham point she went down brixham way terrible a local tragedy obviously thought george the point was a headland of cliffs projecting into the sea he glanced at the two oldtimers nodded and had his nod returned turned back to his drink but their conversation stayed with him one of them was thin ferretfaced the other red and portly the latter doing the storytelling now he continued carryin o course pregnant were she the thin one gasped it were is you reckon i reckons nuthin the first denied no proof like i said an anyway she were a rum un but so young tis a pity a pitys right the thin one agreed but ter jump like that what made er do it dyou think i mean unwed an carryin these days aint nuthin out of the corner of his eye george saw them lean closer their voices fell lower still and he strained to hear what was said i reckon said the portly one that nature told er it werent right you know ow a ewell cast a puggled lamb suthin like that poor lass it werent right you say they opened er up then oh ar they did that tide were out an she knew it she werent goin in the water that one she were goin down on the rocks makin sure she were now ere strictly tween you an me my girl marys at the hospital as you know she says that when they brung er in she were dead as mutton but they sounded er belly and it were still kickin after a moments pause the child well what else you old fool so they opened er up orrible it were but theres none but a handful knows of it so this stops right ere well doctor took one look at it an put a needle in it he just finished it there and then an into a plastic bag it went an down to the hospital furnace an that was that deformed the thin one nodded ive heard o such well this one werent so much deformed as as not much formed at all the florid one informed it were owd my mary put it like some kind of massive tumour in er a terrible sort of fleshy lump and fibrous but it were sposed to ave been a child for there was afterbirth and all but for sure it were better off dead my mary said as ow there was eyes where there shouldnt be an things like teeth an ow it mewled suthin terrible when the light fell on it george had finished his lager the last of it with a gulp the door of the pub was flung open and a party of young people came in another moment and one of them had found a jukebox in some hidden alcove rock music washed over everything the barman came back pulled pints for all he was worth george left headed back down the road halfway back his car pulled up and anne shouted get in the back she wore a straw hat with a wide black band contrasting perfectly with her summer dress helen sitting beside her wore one with a red band hows that anne laughed as george plumped down in the back seat and slammed the door mother and daughter tilted their heads coquettishly showed off their hats just like a couple of village girls out for a drive eh around here george answered darkly village girls need to watch what theyre doing but he didnt explain his meaning and in any case he wouldnt have mentioned harkley in the same breath as the story hed overheard in the pub he took it that hed simply misinterpreted the first few words however that may be the unpleasantness of the thing stayed with him for the rest of the day the next morning tuesday george was up late anne had offered him breakfast in bed but hed declined gone back to sleep he got up at ten to a quiet house made himself a small breakfast that turned out quite tasteless then in the livingroom he found annes note darling yulian and helen are out walking vlad i think ill drive georgina into town and buy her something well be back for lunch anne george sighed his frustration chewed his bottom lip angrily this morning hed meant to have a quick look at the cellars just out of curiosity yulian could have perhaps shown him around down there as for the rest of the day hed planned on driving the girls to the beach at salcombe a day by the sea might fetch georgina out of herself the salty air would be good for helen too whod been looking a bit peaky just like anne to get cabhappy with the car the minute they were out of london ah well maybe thered still be time for the beach this afternoon but what to do with himself this morning a walk into old paignton to the harbour perhaps it would be a fair bit of a walk but he could always drop in somewhere for a pint along the way and later if he was tired or pushed for time hed simply come back by taxi george did exactly that he took his binoculars with him and spent a little time gazing at neardistant brixham across the bay returned to harkley by taxi at about and paid the driver off at the gate hed enjoyed both the long walk and his glass of cold beer enormously and it seemed hed timed the entire expedition just perfectly for lunch then wandering up the drive where the curving gravel path came closest to the copse a densely grown stand of beech birch and alder with one mighty cedar towering slightly apart there he came across his car its front doors standing open and the keys still in the ignition george stared at the car in mild surprise turned in a slow circle and glanced all about the copse had an overgrown crazypaving path winding through its heart and a onceelegant white threebar fence running round it like a wood in a book of fairy tales the fence was leaning now and very much offwhite with rank growth sprung up on both sides george looked in that direction but could see no one tall grasses and brambles the tops of fenceposts trees and maybe something big and black moving furtively in the undergrowth vlad it could well be that anne helen georgina and yulian were all walking together in the copse certainly it would be leafy and cool under the canopy of the trees but if it was only yulian and the dog in there or the bloody dog on his own suddenly it came to george that he feared one as much as the other yes feared them yulian wasnt like any other person he knew and vlad wasnt like any other dog there was something wrong with both of them and in the middle of a quiet hot summer day george shivered then he got a grip of himself frightened of a queer freakish youth and a threequarters grown dog ridiculous he gave a loud hallooo and got no answer irritated now his previously pleasant mood rapidly waning he hurried to the house inside no one he went through the old place slamming doors finally climbed the stairs to his and annes bedroom where the hell was everyone and why had anne left his car there like that was he to spend the entire day on his bloody own from his bedroom window he could see most of the grounds at the front of the house right to the gate the barn and huddled stables interfered with the view of the copse but georges attention was suddenly riveted by a splash of colour showing in the tall grass this side of the fence where it circled the copse it caught his attention and held it he moved a fraction tried to see beyond the projecting gables of the old barn it wouldnt come into focus then he remembered his binoculars still hanging round his neck he quickly put them to his eyes adjusted them still the gables intervened and hed got the range wrong the splash of colour was still there a dress but a fleshpink tone was moving against it moving insistently with viciously impatient hands george finally got the range right brought the picture close the splash of summer colours was a dress yes and the fleshcoloured tone was flesh naked flesh george scanned the scene disbelievingly they were in the grass he couldnt see helen not her face anyway for she was face down backside in the air and yulian mounting her frantic in his rage his passion his hands gripping her waist george began to tremble and he couldnt stop it helen was a willing party to this had to be well and hed said she was an adult but god there must be limits and there she was face down in the grass naked as a baby georges baby girl with her straw hat and her dress tossed aside and her pink flesh open to this this slime george no longer feared yulian if he ever had but hated him the weirdlooking bastard would look a sight weirder when he was finished with him he snatched his binoculars from his neck tossed them down on the bed turned towards the door and his muscles locked rigid georges jaw fell open something he had seen some monstrous thing burned on his minds eye with hands numb to the bone he took up the binoculars fixed them again on the couple in the long grass yulian had finished lay sprawled alongside his partner but george let the glasses slide right over them to the hat and disarrayed dress the straw hat had a wide black band it was annes hat and now that fact had dawned he saw that it was also annes dress the binoculars slipped from georges fingers he staggered almost fell flopped down heavily on his bed on their bed his and annes willing party had to be the words kept repeating in his whirling head he couldnt believe what hed seen but he had to believe and she was a willing party had to be how long he sat there in a daze he couldnt tell five minutes ten but finally he came out of it he came out of it shook himself knew what he must do all those stories from yulians school they must be true the bastard was a pervert but anne what of anne could she be drunk or drugged that was it yulian must have given her something george stood up he was cold now cold as ice his blood boiled but his mind was a white snowfield with the track he must take clearly delineated he looked at his hands and felt the strength of both god and the devil flowing in them he would tear out the black soulless eyes of that swine he would eat his rotten heart he staggered downstairs through the empty house reeled drunkenly murderously towards the copse and he found annes hat and dress exactly where hed seen them but no anne no yulian blood pounded in georges temples hate like acid corroded his mind peeling away every layer of rationality still reeling he scrambled his way through low brambles to the gravel drive glared his loathing at the house then something told him to look behind back there at the gates vlad stood watching then started forward uncertainly something of sanity returned george hated yulian now intended to kill him if he could but he still feared the dog thered always been something about dogs and especially this one he ran back towards the house and coming round a screen of bushes saw yulian striding through the shrubbery towards the rear of the building towards the entrance to the cellars yulian george tried to yell but the word came out as a gasping croak he didnt try again why warn the perverted little sod behind him vlad put on a little speed began to lope at the corner of the house george paused for a moment gulped air desperately he was out of condition then he saw a rusty old mattock leaning against the wall and snatched it up a glance over his shoulder told him that vlad was coming his strides stretching now ears flat to his head george wasted no more time but plunged through the low shrubbery to the entrance to the vaults and there stood yulian at the open door he heard george coming turned his head and cast a startled glance his way ah george he smiled a sickly smile i was just wondering if perhaps youd like to see the cellars then he saw georges expression the mattock in his whiteknuckled hands the cellars george choked almost entirely deranged with hatred yes i fucking would he swung his picklike weapon yulian put up an arm to shield his face turned away the sharper rustier blade of the heavy tool took him in the back of his right shoulder crunched through the lower part of the scapula and buried itself to the haft in his body thrown forward yulian went toppling down the central ramp the mattock still sticking in him as he fell he said ah ah in no way a scream more an expression of surprise shock george followed arms reaching lips drawn back from his teeth he pursued yulian and vlad pursued him yulian lay face down at the bottom of the steps beside the open door to the vaults he moaned moved awkwardly george slammed a foot down in the middle of his back levered the mattock out of him ah ah again yulian gave his peculiar sighing cry george lifted the mattock and heard vlads rumbling growl close behind he turned swung the mattock in a deadly arc the dog was stopped in midflight as the mattock smacked flatly against the side of its head it crumpled to the concrete floor groaned like a man george panted hoarsely lifted his weapon again but there was no sign of consciousness in the animal its sides heaved but it lay still tongue protruding out like a light and now there was only yulian george turned saw yulian staggering into the vaults unknown darkness unbelievable with his injury still the bastard kept going george followed kept yulians stumbling figure visible in the gloom the cellars were extensive rooms and alcoves and midnight corridors but george didnt let his quarry out of sight for a single moment then a light george peered through an arched entrance into a dimly illumined room a single dusty bulb shaded hung from a vaulted ceiling of stone blocks george had momentarily lost sight of yulian in the darkness surrounding the cone of light but then the youth staggered between him and the light source and george picked him up again and advanced yulian saw him swung an arm wildly at the light in an attempt to put it out of commission injured he missed his aim setting the lamp and shade dancing and swinging on their flex then by that wildly gyrating light george saw the rest of the room in intermittent flashes of light and darkness he picked out the details of the hell hed walked into light and in one corner a glimpse of piled wooden racks and cobwebbed shelving darkness and yulian an even darker shape that crouched uncertainly in the centre of the room light and along one wall georgina seated in an old cane chair her eyes bulging but vacant and her mouth and flaring nostrils wide as yawning caverns darkness and a movement close by so that george put up the mattock to defend himself insane light and to his right a huge copper vat six feet across and seated on copper legs with helen slumped in a dining chair on one side her back to the nitrestreaked wall and anne naked likewise positioned on the other side their inner arms dangling inside the rim of the bowl and something in the bowl itself seeming to move restlessly throwing up ropes of doughy matter flickering darkness out of which came yulians laughter the clotted sick laughter of someone warped irreparably then light again which found georges eyes fixed on the great vat or more properly on the women and the picture searing itself indelibly into his brain helens clothing ripped down the front and pulled back and the girl lolling there like a slut with her legs sprawled open everything displayed anne likewise but both of them grimacing their faces working hideously showing alternating joy and total horror their arms in the vat and the nameless slime crawling on their arms to their shoulders pulsating from its unknown source merciful darkness and the thought in georges tottering mind god its feeding on them and its feeding itself to them and yulian so close now that he could hear his rasping breathing light again as the lamp settled to a jerky jitterbug and the mattock wrenched from georges nerveless fingers and hurled away and george finally face to visage with the man hed intended to kill who now he discovered to be hardly a man at all but something out of his very worst nightmares fingers of rubber with the strength of steel gripped his shoulder and propelled him effortlessly irresistibly towards the vat george the nightmare gurgled almost conversationally i want you to meet something chapter six alec kyles knuckles were white where his hands gripped the rim of his desk god in heaven harry he cried staring aghast at the keogh apparition where bands of soft light flowed through it from the windows blinds are you trying to scare the shit out of me before we even get started im telling it as i know it thats what you asked me to do isnt it keogh was unrepentant remember alec youre getting it secondhand i got it straight from them from the dead the horses mouth as it were and believe me ive watered it down for you kyle gulped shook his head got a grip of himself then something keogh had said got through to him you got it from them suddenly i have this feeling you dont just mean thibor ferenczy and george lake no ive spoken to the reverend pollock too from yulians christening oh yes kyle wiped his brow i see that now of course alec keoghs soft voice was sharper now we have to hurry harrys beginning to stir and not only the real child three hundred and fifty miles away in hartlepool but also its ethereal image where it languidly turned superimposed over and within keoghs midriff it too was stirring slowly stretching from its foetal position its baby mouth opening in a yawn the keogh manifestation began to waver like smoke like the heat haze over a summer road before you go kyle was desperate where do i start he was answered by the faint but very definite wail of a waking infant keoghs eyes opened wide he tried to take a pace forward towards kyle but the blue shimmer was breaking down like a television image going wrong in another moment it snapped into a single vertical line like a tube of electric blue light shortened to a point of blinding blue fire at eyelevel and blinked out but coming to kyle as from a million miles away get in touch with krakovitch tell him what you know some of it anyway youre going to need his help the russians but harry goodbye alec ill get back to you and the room was completely still felt somehow empty the central heating made a loud click as it switched itself off kyle sat there a long time sweating a little breathing deeply then he noticed the lights blinking on his desk communications heard the gentle almost timid rapping on his office door alec a voice queried from outside it was carl quints voice it its gone now but i suppose you know that are you all right in there kyle took a deep breath pressed the command button its finished for now he told the breathless waiting hq youd all better come in and see me theres time for an ogroup before we knock it on the head for the day therell be things youre wanting to know and things we have to talk about he released the button said to himself and i do mean things the russian response was immediate faster than kyle might ever have believed he didnt know that leonid brezhnev would soon be wanting all the answers and that felix krakovitch had only four months left of his years borrowed time they were to meet on the first friday in september these two heads of espionage on neutral ground the venue was genoa italy a seedy bar called frankies franchise lost in a labyrinth of alleys down in the guts of the city less than two hundred yards from the waterfront kyle and quint got into genoas surprisingly ramshackle christopher columbus airport on thursday evefling their minder from british intelligence was there twelve hours earlier theyd made no reservations but had no problems getting adjoining rooms at the hotel genovese where they freshened up and had a meal before retiring to the bar the bar was quiet almost subdued where halfadozen italians two german businessmen and an american tourist and his wife sat at small tables or at the bar with their drinks one of the italians who sat apart on his own wasnt italian at all he was russian kgb but kyle and quint had no way of knowing that he had no esp talent or quint would have spotted him at once they didnt spot him taking photographs of them with a tiny camera either but the russian had not gone entirely undetected earlier hed been seen entering the hotel and booking a room kyle and quint were in a corner of the bar on their third vecchia romagnas and talking in lowered tones about their business with krakovitch tomorrow when the bar telephone tinkled for me kyle said at once starting upright on his barstool his talent always had that effect on him it startled him like a mild electric shock the bartender answered the phone looked up signor he began kyle said kyle holding out his hand the bartender smiled nodded handed him the phone kyle he said again into the mouthpiece brown here said a soft voice mr kyle try not to act surprised or anything and dont look up or go all furtive one of the people in the bar with you is a russian i wont describe him because then youd act differently and hed notice it but ive been on to london and put him through our computer hes dressed eyetie but hes definitely kgb name of theo dolgikh hes a top field agent for andropov just thought youd like to know there wasnt supposed to be any of this stuff was there no said kyle there wasnt tuttut said brown i should be a bit sharp with your man when you meet him tomorrow if i were you it really isnt good enough and just for your peace of mind if anything were to happen to you which i consider unlikely be sure dolgikhs a goner too ok thats very reassuring said kyle grimly he gave the phone back to the barman problems quint raised an eyebrow finish your drink and well talk about it in our rooms said kyle just act naturally i think were on candid camera he forced a smile swallowed his brandy at a gulp stood up quint followed suit they left the bar unhurriedly and went up to their rooms in kyles room they checked for electronic bugs this was as much a job for their psychic sensitivity as for their five mundane senses but the room was clean kyle told quint about the call in the bar quint was an extremely wiry man of about thirtyfive prematurely balding softspoken but often aggressive and very quick thinking not a very auspicious start he growled still i suppose we should have expected it this is what your commonorgarden secret agent comes up against all the time im told well its not on kyle was angry this was supposed to be a meeting of minds not muscle do you know which one of them it was quint was practical about it i think i can remember all of their faces id know any one of them again if we should bump into him forget it said kyle brown doesnt want a confrontation hes geared to get nasty though if things go wrong for us charmed im sure said quint my reaction exactly kyle agreed then they checked quints room for bugs and finding nothing called it a day kyle took a shower got into bed it was uncomfortably warm so he pushed his blankets on to the floor the air was humid oppressive it felt like rain and if a storm blew up it would probably be a dandy kyle knew genoa in the autumn also knew that it has some of the worst storms imaginable he left his bedside light burning settled down to sleep a door unlocked stood between the two rooms quint was right next door probably asleep by now the citys traffic was giving it hell out beyond the louvered window shutters london was a tomb by comparison tombs hardly seemed a fitting subject to go to sleep on but kyle closed his eyes he felt sleep pulling him down soft as a womans arms and he felt something else pulling him awake his lamp was still on its shade forming a pool of yellow light on the mahogany bedside table but there was now a second source of illumination and it was blue kyle snatched himself back from sleep sat bolt upright in his bed it was harry keogh of course carl quint came bounding through the joining door dressed only in his pyjama bottoms he pulled up short backed off a pace oh my god he said his mouth hanging open the keogh apparition man sleeping child and all turned through ninety degrees to face him dont be alarmed said keogh can you see him kyle wasnt quite awake yet lord yes quint breathed nodding and hear him too but even if i couldnt id still know he was here a psychic sensitive said keogh well that helps kyle swung his legs out of bed switched off the lamp keogh stood out so much better in the darkness like a hologram of infinitely fine neon wires carl quint kyle said his skin prickling with the sheer weirdness of this thing hed never get used to meet harry keogh quint stumblingly found a chair close to kyles bed and flopped into it kyle was wide awake now fully in control he realised how insubstantial it must sound how hollow and commonplace when he asked harry what are you doing here and quint almost laughed however hysterically when the apparition answered ive been talking to thibor ferenczy using my time to my best advantage for theres precious little of it to waste every waking hour makes harry jar stronger and me less able to resist him its his body and im being subsumed even absorbed his little brain is filling up with its own stuff squeezing me out or maybe compacting me pretty soon ill have to leave him and then i dont know if ill ever be corporeal again so on the way back from thibor i thought id drop in on you kyle could almost feel quints nearhysteria he glanced warningly at him in the light of the soft blue glow youve been talking to the old thing in the ground he repeated but why harry what is it you want from him hes one of them a vampire or he was the dead arent much bothered with him hes a pariah among the dead in me he has well if not a friend at least someone to talk to so we trade i converse with him and he tells me things i want to know but nothings easy with thibor ferenczy even dead he has a devious mind he knows that the longer he strings it out the sooner ill be back he used the same tactics with dragosani remember oh yes kyle nodded and i also remember what happened to dragosani you should be careful harry thibors dead alec keogh reminded him he can do no more harm but what he left behind might what he left behind you mean yulian bodescu ive got men watching the place in devon until im ready for him when were sure of his patterns when weve assessed everything youve told us then well move in i didnt exactly mean yulian though certainly hes part of it but are you telling me youve put espers on the job keogh seemed alarmed do they know what they might have to deal with if theyre marked are they fully in the picture yes they are fully and theyre equipped but if we can well learn a little more about them before we act for all that youve told us still we know so very little and do you know about george lake kyle felt his scalp tingle quint too and this time it was quint who answered we know hes no longer in his grave in the cemetery in blagdon if thats what you mean the doctors diagnosed a heart attack and his wife and the bodescus were there at his burial so much weve checked out but weve also been there and had a look for ourselves and george lake wasnt where he should be we figure hes back at the house with the others the keogh manifestation nodded thats what i meant so now hes undead and that will have told yulian bodescu exactly what he is or maybe not exactly but by now he must be pretty sure hes a vampire in fact hes only a halfvampire george on the other hand hes the real thing he has been dead so whats in him will have taken complete control what kyle was bemused i dont let me tell you the rest of thibors story keogh cut in see what you make of that kyle could only nod his agreement i suppose you know what youre doing harry the room was already colder kyle gave a blanket to quint wrapped another about himself ok harry he said the stage is all yours the last thing thibor remembered seeing was the ferenczys bestial animal face his jaws open in a gaping laugh displaying a crimson forked tongue shuddering like a speared snake in its alien passion he remembered that and the fact that hed been drugged then hed gone down in an irresistible whirlpool down down to black lightness depths from which his resurgence had been slow and fraught with nightmares he had dreamed of yelloweyed wolves of a blasphemous banner device in the form of a devils head with its forked tongue much like the ferenczys own except that on the banner it had dripped gouts of blood of a black castle built over a mountain gorge and of its master who was something other than human and now because he knew that he had dreamed he also knew he must be waking up and the thought came to him how much was dream and how much reality thibor felt a subterranean cold cramps in all his limbs a throbbing in his temples like a reverberating gong in some great sounding cavern he felt the manacles on his wrists and ankles the cold slimy stone at his back where he slumped the drip of seeping moisture from somewhere overhead where it hissed past his ear and splashed in the hollow of his collarbone chained naked in some black vault in the castle of the ferenczy and no need now to ask how much of it had been dream all of it was real thibor came snarling to life strained with a giants strength against the chains that held him powerless ignored the thunder in his head and the lancing pains in his limbs and body to roar in the darkness like a wounded bull ferenczy you dog ferenczy treacherous misshapen misbegotten the wallach warlord stopped shouting listened to the echoes of his curses dying away and to something else from somewhere up above he had heard his bellowing answered by the slam of a door heard unhurried footsteps descending towards him and with his cold skin prickling and his nostrils flaring from rage and terror both he hung in his chains and waited the darkness was very nearly utter streaks of nitre alone glowed with a chemical phosphorescence on the walls but as thibor held his breath and the hollow footsteps came closer so too came a flickering illumination it issued in an unevenly penetrating yellow glow from an arched stone doorway in what must otherwise be a solid wall of rock and while thibor watched with bated breath so the shadows of his cell were thrown back more yet as the light grew stronger and the footsteps louder then a sputtering lantern was thrust in through the archway and behind it was the ferenczy himself crouching a little to avoid the wedge of the keystone behind the lantern his eyes were red fires in the shadows of his face he held the lantern high nodded grimly at what he saw thibor had thought he was alone but now he saw that he was not in the flare of yellow lamplight he discovered that there were others here with him but dead or alive one of them seemed alive at least thibor narrowed his eyes as the glare from the ferenczys lantern brightened lighting up the entire dungeon three other prisoners were with him here yes and dead or alive it wasnt hard to guess who theyd be as to how or why the castles master had brought them here that was anybodys guess they were of course thibors wallach companions and also old arvos of the szgany of the three it seemed to be the stumpy wallach whod survived the one who was all chest and arms he lay crumpled on the floor where stone flags had been laid aside to reveal black soil underneath his body seemed badly broken but still his barrel chest rose and fell with some regularity and one of his arms twitched a little the lucky one said the ferenczy his voice deep as a pit or perhaps unlucky depending on ones point of view he was alive when my children took me to him thibor rattled his chains was man hes alive now cant you see him moving see he breathes oh yes the ferenczy moved closer in that soundless sinuous way of his and the blood surges in his veins and the brain in his broken head functions and thinks frightened thoughts but i tell you he is not alive nor is he truly dead he is undead he chuckled as at some obscene joke alive undead is there a difference thibor yanked viciously on his chains how he would love to wrap them round the others neck and squeeze till his eyes popped out the difference is immortality his tormentor thrust his face closer yet alive he was mortal undead he lives forever or until he destroys himself or some accident does the job for him ah but to live forever eh thibor the wallach how sweet is life eh but would you believe it can be boring too no of course not for you have not known the ennui of the centuries women i have had such women and food his voice took on a slyness ah gobbets youve not yet dreamed of and yet for these last hundred nay two hundred years all of these things have bored me bored with life are you thibor ground his teeth put every last effort into wrenching his chains staples from the sweating stone it was useless only set me free and ill put an end to your uh boredom the ferenczy laughed like a baying hound you will but you already have my son by coming here for you see i have waited for one just such as you bored aye that i have been and indeed you are the cure but its a cure well apply my way youd slay me eh do you really think so oh ive my share of fighting to come but not with you what i should fight with my own son never no ill go forth and fight and kill like none before me and ill lust and love like twenty men and none shall say me nay and ill do it all to the ends of the earth to such excess that my name shall live forever or be stricken forever from mans history for what else can i do with passions such as mine a creature such as i am condemned to life you speak in riddles thibor spat on the floor youre a madman crazed by your lonely life up here with nothing but wolves for company i cant see why the viad fears you one madman on his own but i can see why hed want you dead you are loathsome a blemish on mankind misshapen splittongued insane deaths the best thing for you or locked up where natural men wont have to look at you the ferenczy drew back a little almost as if he were surprised at thibors vehemence he hung his lantern from a bracket seated himself on a stone bench natural men did you say do you talk to me of nature ah but theres more in nature than meets the eye my son indeed there is and you think that im unnatural eh well the wamphyri are rare be sure but so is the sabretooth why i havent seen a mountain cat with teeth like scythes in three hundred years perhaps they are no more perhaps men have hunted them down to the last aye and it may be that one day the wamphyri shall be no more but if that day should ever come believe me it shall not be the fault of faethor ferenczy no and it shall not be yours more riddles meaningless mouthings madness thibor spat the words out he was helpless and he knew it if this monstrous being wished him dead then he was as good as dead and it was no use to reason with a madman where is the reason in a madman better to insult him face to face enrage him and get it over with it would be no pleasant thing to hang here and rot and watch maggots crawling in the flesh of men hed called his comrades are you finished the ferenczy asked in his deepest voice best to be done now with all hurtful ranting for ive much to tell you much to show you great knowledge and even greater skills to impart im weary of this place you see but it needs a keeper when i go out into the world someone must stay here to keep this place for me someone strong as i myself it is my place and these are my mountains my lands one day i may wish to return when i do then i shall find a ferenczy here which is why i call you my son here and now i adopt you thibor of wallachia henceforth you are thibor ferenczy i give you my name and i give you my banner the devils head oh i know these honours tower above you i know you do not yet have my strength but i shall give it to you i shall bestow upon you the greatest honour a magnificent mystery and when you are become wamphyri then your name thibor growled i dont want your name i spit on your name he shook his head wildly as for your device ive a banner of my own ah the creature stood up flowed closer and what are your signs a bat of the wallachian plain thibor answered astride the christian dragon the ferenczys bottom jaw fell open but that is most propitious a bat you say excellent and riding the dragon of the christians better still and now a third device let shaitan himself surmount both i dont need your bloodspewing devil thibor shook his head and scowled the ferenczy smiled a slow sinister smile oh but you will you will then he laughed out loud aye and i shall avail myself of your symbols when i go out across the world i shall fly devil bat and dragon all three there see how i honour you henceforth we carry the same banner thibor narrowed his eyes faethor ferenczy you play with me as a cat plays with a mouse why you call me your son offer me your name your sigils yet here i hang in chains with one friend dead and another dying at my feet say it now you are a madman and im your next victim isnt it so the other shook his wolfish head so little faith he rumbled almost sadly but we shall see we shall see now tell me what do you know of the wamphyri nothing or very little a legend a myth freakish men who hide in remote places and spring out on peasants and small children to frighten them occasionally dangerous murderers vampires who suck blood in the night and swear it gives them strength viesczy to the russian peasant obour to the bulgar vrykoulakas in greekland they are names which demented men attach to themselves but there is something common to them in all tongues they are liars and madmen you do not believe you have looked upon me seen the wolves which i command the terror i excite in the hearts of the viad and his priests but you do not believe ive said it before and ill say it again thibor gave his chains a last frustrated jerk the men ive killed have all stayed dead no i do not believe the other gazed at his prisoner with burning eyes that is the difference between us he said for the men i kill if it pleases me to kill them in a certain way do not stay dead they become undead he stood up stepped flowingly close his upper lip curled back at one side displayed a downward curving fang like a needlesharp tusk thibor looked away avoided the mans breath which was like poison and suddenly the wallach felt weak hungry thirsty he was sure he could sleep for a week how long have i been here he asked four days the ferenczy began to pace to and fro four nights gone you climbed the narrow way your friends were unfortunate you remember i fed you gave you wine alas you found my wine a little strong then while you er rested my familiar creatures took me to the fallen ones where they lay faithful old arvos he was dead likewise your scrawny wallach comrade broken by sharp boulders my children wanted them for themselves but i had another use for them and so had them dragged here this one he nudged the blocky wallach with a booted foot he lived he had fallen on arvos he was a little broken but alive i could see he wouldnt last till morning and i needed him if only to prove a point and so like the myth the legend i fed upon him i drank from him and in return gave him something back i took of his blood and gave a little of mine he died three days and nights are passed by that which i gave him worked in him and a certain joining has occurred also a healing his broken parts are being mended he will soon rise up as one of the wamphyri to be counted in the narrow ranks of the elite but ever in thrall to me he is undead the ferenczy paused madman thibor accused again but with something less of conviction for the ferenczy had spoken of these nightmares so easily with no obvious effort at contrivance he could not be what he claimed to be no of course not but certainly he might believe that he was the ferenczy if he heard thibors renewed accusation of madness ignored or refused to acknowledge it unnatural you called me he said which is to claim that you yourself know something of nature am i correct do you understand life the nature of living growing things my fathers were farmers aye thibor grunted ive seen things grow good then youll know that there are certain principles and that sometimes they seem illogical now let me test you how say you if a man has a tree of favourite apples and he fears the tree might die how may he reproduce it and retain the flavour of the fruit riddles indulge me pray thibor shrugged two ways by seed and by cutting plant an apple and it will grow into a tree but for the true original taste take cuttings and nurture them it is obvious what are cuttings but continuations of the old tree obvious the ferenczy raised his eyebrows to you perhaps but it would seem obvious to me and to most men who are not farmers that the seed should give the true taste for what is the seed but the egg of the tree eh still you are of course correct the cutting gives the true taste as for a tree grown from seed why it is spawned of the pollens of trees other than the original how then may its fruit be the same obvious to a treegrower where does all this lead thibor was surer than ever of the ferenczys madness in the wamphyri the castles master gazed full upon him nature requires no outside intervention no foreign pollens even the trees require a mate with which to reproduce but the wamphyri do not all we require is a host host thibor frowned felt a sudden tremor in his great legs the dampness of the walls stiffening more cramps into his limbs now tell me faethor went on what do you know of fishing eh fishing i was a farmers son and now im a warrior what would i know of fishing faethor continued without answering him in the bulgars and in turkeyland fishermen fished in the greek sea for years without number they suffered a plague of starfish in such quantities that they ruined the fishing and their great weight broke the nets and the policy of the fishermen was this they would cut up and kill any starfish they hauled in and hurl it back to feed the fish alas the true fish does not eat starfish and worse from every piece of starfish a new one grows complete and naturally every year there were more then some wise fisherman divined the truth and they began to keep their unwanted catches bringing them ashore burning them and scattering their ashes in the olive groves lo and behold the plague dwindled away the fish came back the olives grew black and juicy a nervous tic jumped in thibors shoulder the strain of hanging so long in chains of course now you tell me he answered what starfish have to do with you and i with you nothing not yet but with the wamphyri why nature has granted us the same boon how may you cut down an enemy if each lopped portion sprouts a new body eh faethor grinned through the yellow bone mesh of his teeth and how may any mere man kill a vampire now see why i like you so well my son for who but a hero would come up here to destroy the indestructible in the eye of thibors memory he heard again the words of a certain contact in the kievan vlads court they put stakes through their hearts and cut off their heads better still they break them up entirely and burn all the pieces even a small part of a vampire may grow whole again in the body of an unwary man like a leech but on the inside in the bed of the forest faethor broke into his morbid thoughts grow many vines they seek the light and climb great trees to reach the fresh free air some foolish vines as it were may even grow so thickly as to kill their trees and bring them crashing down and so destroy themselves youve seen that im sure but others simply use the great trunks of their hosts they share the earth and the air and the light between them they live out their lives together indeed some vines are beneficial to their host trees ah but then comes the drought the trees wither blacken crumble and the forest is no more but down in the fertile earth the vines live on waiting aye and when more trees grow in fifty an hundred years back come the vines to climb again towards the light who is the stronger the tree for his girth and sturdy branches or the slender insubstantial vine for his patience if patience is a virtue thibor of wallachia then the wamphyri are virtuous as all the ages trees fishes vines thibor shook his head you rave faethor ferenczy all of these things ive told you the other was undeterred you will understand eventually but before you can begin to understand first you must believe in me in what i am ill never thibor began only to be cut short oh but you will the ferenczy hissed his awful tongue lashing in the cave of his mouth now listen i have willed my egg i have brought it on and it is forming even now each of the wamphyri has but one egg one seed in a lifetime one chance to recreate the true fruit one opportunity to carve his changeling nature into the living being of another you are the host i have chosen for my egg your egg thibor wrinkled his nose scowled drew back as far as his chains would allow your seed you are beyond help faethor alas said the other lip curling and great nostrils flaring but you are the one who is beyond help his cloak billowed as he flowed towards the broken body of old arvos he hoisted the gypsys corpse upright in one hand like a bundle of rags perched it head stiffly lolling in a niche in the stone wall we have no sex as such he said glaring across the cell at thibor only the sex of our hosts ah but we multiply their zest an hundred times we have no lust except theirs which we double and redouble we may and do drive them to excesses in all of their passions but we heal their wounds too when the excess is too great for human flesh and blood to endure and with long long years even centuries so man and vampire grow into one creature they become inseparable except under extreme duress i who was a man have now reached just such a maturity so shall you in perhaps a thousand years once more futilely thibor tugged at his chains impossible to break or even strain them he could put a thumb through each link about the wamphyri faethor continued just as there are in the common world widely differing sorts of the same basic creature owl and gull and sparrow fox and hound and wolf so are there varying wamphyri states and conditions for example we talked about taking cuttings from an apple tree yes it might be easier if you think of it that way he stooped dragged the unconscious twitching body of the squat wallach away from the area of torn up flags tossed old arvos corpse down upon the black soil then he tore open the old mans ragged shirt and glanced up from where he knelt into thibors mystified eyes is there sufficient light my son can you see i see a madman clearly enough thibor gave a brusque nod the ferenczy returned his nod and again he smiled his hideous smile the ivory of his teeth gleaming in lantern light then see this he hissed kneeling beside old arvos crumpled form he extended a forefinger towards the gypsys naked chest thibor watched faethors forearm stuck out free of his robe whatever the ferenczy was up to there could be no trickery no sleight of hand here faethors nails were long and sharply pointed at the end of his even slender fingers thibor saw the quick of the pointing finger turn red and start to drip blood the pink nail cracked open like the brittle shell of a nut flapped loosely like a trapdoor on a finger bloating and pulsating blue and greygreen veins stood out in that member writhing under the skin the raw tip visibly lengthened extending itself towards the dead gypsys cold grey flesh the pulsating digit was no longer a finger as such it was a pseudopod of unflesh a throbbing rod of living matter a stiff snake shorn of its skin now twice now three times its former length it vibrated down at an angle to within inches of its target which appeared to be the dead mans heart and all of this thibor watched with bulging eyes bated breath and gaping mouth and until this moment thibor had not really known fear but now he did thibor the wallach warlord of however small and ragged an army humourless merciless killer of the pechenegi utterly fearless thibor until now until now hed not met a creature he feared in the hunt wild boar in the forests which had wounded men so badly as to kill them were piglets to him in the challenge let any man only dare hurl down the gauntlet thibor would fight him any way he chose all knew it and none chose and in battle he led from the front stood at the head of the charge could only ever be found in the thick of the fighting fear it was a word without meaning fear of what when he had ridden out to battle hed known each day might be his last that had not deterred him so black was his hatred of the invaders of all enemies that it simply engulfed fear and put it down no creature or man or threat of any device of men had ever unmanned him since oh before he could remember since he was a child if ever hed been one but faethor ferenczy was something other than all of these torture could only maim and must kill in the end and theres no pain after death but what the ferenczy threatened seemed an eternity of hell mere moments ago it had been a strange fantasy the dreams of a madman but now unable to tear his eyes away thibor groaned and grew pale at the sight of that which followed a cutting aye faethors voice was low trembling with dark passions to be nurtured in flesh already tainted and falling into decay the lowest form of wamphyri existence it will come to nothing so long as it has no living host but it will live devour grow strong and hide when there is nothing left of arvos it will hide in the earth and wait like the vine waiting for a tree the cutoff leg of a starfish which does not die but waits to grow a new body except this thing i make waits to inhabit one mindless unthinking it will be a thing of the most primitive instincts but it can nevertheless outlast the ages until some unwary man finds it and it finds him his incredible bloody throbbing forefinger touched arvos flesh and leprous white rootlets sprang forth slid like worms in earth into the gypsys chest small flaps of fretted skin were laid back the pseudopod developed tiny glistening teeth of its own it began to gnaw its way inside thibor would have looked away but he could not faethors finger broke off with a soft tearing sound and quickly burrowed its way out of sight within the corpse faethor held up his hand the severed member was shrinking back into him pseudoflesh melting into his flesh the cancerous colours went out of it it assumed a more normal shape the old fingernail fell to the floor and right in front of thibors eyes a new pink shell began to form well then my hero son who came here to kill me faethor slowly stood up and held out his hand toward thibors bloodless face and could you have killed this thibor drew back his face head and body tried to cringe into the very stone to avoid that pointing finger but faethor only laughed what you think that i would but no no not you my son oh i could be sure and forever youd be in thrall to me but that is the second state of the wamphyri and unworthy of you no for i hold you in the highest esteem why you shall have my very egg thibor tried to find words but his throat lacked moisture was dry as a desert faethor laughed again and drew back that threatening hand of his he turned away and stepped to where the squat wallach lay humped on the stone flags gurglingly breathing face down in a dusty corner he is in that second state thibors tormentor explained i took from him and gave him something back flesh of my flesh is in him now healing him changing him his tears and broken bones will mend and he will live for as long as i will it but he will always be slave to me to do my bidding obey my every command you see he is vampire but without vampire mind the mind comes only from the egg and he is not grown from seed but is merely a cutting when he wakes which will be soon then you will understand understand thibor found his voice however cracked but how can i understand why should i want to understand you are a monster i understand that arvos is dead and yet you you did that to him why nothing can live in him now but maggots faethor shook his head no his flesh is like fertile soil or the fertile sea think of the starfish you will grow another another you inside him thibor was very nearly gibbering now it will consume him faethor answered but another me no i have mind it will not have mind arvos cannot be a host for his mind is dead do you see he is food nothing more when it grows it will not be like me only like what you saw he held up his pale newly formed index finger and the other thibor managed to nod in the direction of the man that which had been a man snoring and gasping in the corner when i took him he was alive said faethor his mind was alive what i gave him is now growing in his body and in his mind oh he died but only to make way for the life of the wamphyri which is not life but undeath he will not return to true life but to undeath madness thibor moaned as for this one the ferenczy stepped into shadows on the far side of the cell where the light did not quite reach the legs and one arm of thibors second wallach comrade protruded from the darkness until faethor dragged all of him into view this one will be food for both of them until the mindless one hides himself away and the other takes up his duties as your servant here my servant thibor was bewildered here do you hear nothing i say faethors turn to scowl for more than two hundred years i have cared for myself protected myself stayed alone and lonely in a world expanding changing full of new wonders this i have done for my seed which now is ready to be passed on passed down to you you will stay behind and keep this place these lands this legend of the ferenczy alive but i shall go out amongst men and revel there are wars to be won honours to be earned history is in the making aye and there are women to be spoiled honours you thibor had regained something of his former nerve i doubt it and for a creature alone and lonely you seem to know a great deal of what is passing in the world faethor smiled his ghastliest smile another secret art of the wamphyri he chuckled obscenely in his throat one of several beguilement is another which you saw at work between myself and arvos binding his mind to mine so that we could talk to each other over great distances and then there is the art of the necromancer necromancy thibor had heard of that the eastern barbarians had their magicians who could open the bellies of dead men to read their lives secrets in their smoking guts necromancy faethor nodded seeing the look in thibors eyes aye i shall teach it to you soon it has allowed me to confirm my choice of yourself as a future vessel of the wamphyri for who would know better of you and your deeds your strengths and weaknesses your travels and adventures than a former colleague eh he stooped and effortlessly flopped the body of the thin wallach over onto its back and thibor saw what had been done no wolf pack had done this for nothing was eaten the thin hunched wallach an aggressive man in life who had always gone with his chin thrust forward seemed even thinner now his trunk had been laid open from groin to gullet with all of his pipes and organs loose and flopping and the heart in particular hanging by a thread literally torn out thibors sword had gutted men as thoroughly as this and it had meant nothing but by the ferenczys own account this man had already been dead and his enormous wound was not the work of a sword thibor shuddered turned his eyes away from the mutilated corpse and inadvertently found faethors hands the monsters nails were sharp as knives worse his teeth were like chisels why the word left thibors lips as a whisper ive told you why faethor was growing impatient i wanted to know about you in life he was your friend you were in his blood his lungs his heart in death he was loyal too for he would not give up his secrets easily see how loose are his innards ah how i teased them to wrest their secrets from him all the strength went out of thibors legs and he fell in his chains like a man crucified if im to die kill me now he gasped have done with this faethor flowed close closer stood not an arms length away the first state of being the prime condition of the wamphyri does not require death you may think that you are dying when first the seed puts out its rootlets into your brain and sends them groping along the marrow of your spine but you will not die after that he shrugged the transition may be laboriously slow or lightning swift one can never tell but of one thing be sure it will happen thibors blood surged one last time in his veins he could still die a man then if youll not give me a clean death ill give myself one he gritted his teeth and wrenched on his manacles until the blood flowed freely from his wrists and still he jerked on the irons deepening his wounds faethors long drawnout hisssss stopped him he looked up from his grisly work of selfdestruction into into the pit the abyss itself hideous face working yet more hideously features literally writhing in a torment of passion the ferenczy was so close as to be the merest breath away his long jaws opened and a scarlet snake flickered in the darkness behind teeth which had turned to daggers in his mouth you dare show me your blood the hot blood of youth the blood which is the life his throat convulsed in a sudden spasm and thibor thought he was going to be ill but he was not instead he clutched at his throat gurgled chokingly staggered a little when he had regained control he said ah thibor but now ready or not you have brought on that which cannot be reversed it is my time and yours the time of the egg the seed see see he opened his great jaws until his mouth was a cavern and his forked flickering tongue bent backwards like a hook into his throat and like a hook it caught something and dragged it into view gasping again thibor drew down into himself he saw the vampire seed there in the fork of faethors tongue a translucent silvergrey droplet shining like a pearl trembling in the final seconds before before its seeding no thibor hoarsely denied the horror but it would not be denied he looked in faethors eyes for some hint of what was coming but that was a terrible mistake beguilement and hypnotism were the ferenczys greatest accomplishment the vampires eyes were yellow as gold huge and growing bigger moment by moment ah my son those eyes seemed to say come a kiss for your father then the pearly droplet turned scarlet and faethors mouth fastened on thibors own which stood open in a scream that might last forever harry keoghs pause had lasted for several seconds but still kyle and quint sat there wrapped in their blankets and the horror of his story that is the most kyle started almost simultaneously quint said ive never in my life heard we have to stop there keogh broke in on both of them something of urgency in his telepathic voice my son is about to be difficult hes going to wake up for his feed two minds in one body quint mused still awed by what hed heard i mean im talking about you harry in a way youre not unlike dont say it keogh cut him off a second time theres no way im like that not even remotely but listen i have to hurry do you have anything to tell me kyle got a grip of his rioting thoughts forced himself back to earth to the present were meeting krakovitch tomorrow he said but im annoyed this was supposed to be exclusive entirely an interbranch exchange a bit of esp dйtente as it were but theres at least one kgb goon in on it too how do you know weve a minder on the job but hes strictly in the background their man comes close up the keogh apparition seemed puzzled that wouldnt have happened in borowitzs time he hated them and frankly i cant see it happening now theres no meeting ground between andropovs sort of mindcontrol and ours and when i say ours i include the russian outfit dont let it develop into a shouting match alec you have to work with krakovitch offer your assistance kyle frowned to do what he has ground to clear you know at least one of the sites you can help him to do it ground to clear kyle got up off his bed hugging his blanket to him he stepped towards the manifestation harry we still have our own ground to clear in england while im out here in italy yulian bodescu is still freewheeling over there im anxious about it i keep getting this urge to turn my lot loose on him and no keogh was alarmed not until we know everything there is to know you darent risk it right now hes at the centre of a very small nest but if he wanted to he could spread this thing like a plague kyle knew he was right very well he said but cant stay the other broke in the pull is too strong hes waking gathering his faculties and he seems to include me as one of them his neonetched image began to shimmer its blue glow pulsing harry what ground were you talking about anyway the old thing in the ground keogh came and went like a distorted radio signal the hologram child superimposed over his midriff was visibly stirring stretching kyle thought weve had this conversation before you said we know at least one of the sites sites you mean thibors tomb but hes dead surely the cruciform hills starfish vines creepers in the earth hiding kyle drew air in a gasp hes still there keogh nodded changed his mind and shook his head he tried to speak his outline wavered and collapsed he disappeared in a scattering of brilliant blue motes for a moment kyle thought his mind still remained but it was only carl quint whispering no not thibor hes not there not him but what he left behind chapter seven pm the first friday in september in genoa alec kyle and carl quint were hurrying through rain slick cobbled alleys toward their rendezvous with felix krakovitch at a dive called frankies franchise but seven hundred miles away in devon england the time was pm on a sultry indian summer evening at harkley house yulian bodescu lay naked on his back on the bed in his spacious garret room and considered the events of the last few days in many ways they had been very satisfactory days but they had been fraught with danger too he had not known the extent of his influence before for the people at school and later georgina had all been weak and hardly provided suitable yardsticks the lakes had been the true test and yulian had sailed through that with very little difficulty george lake had been the only real obstacle but even that had been an accidental encounter when yulian wasnt quite ready for him the youth smiled a slow smile and gently touched his shoulder there was a dull ache there now but that was all and where was uncle george now he was down in the vaults with his wife anne thats where down where he belonged with viad standing guard on the door not that yulian believed that to be absolutely necessary it was a precaution thats all as for the other that had left its vat gone into hiding in the earth where the cellars were darkest then there was yulians mother georgina she was in her room lost in selfpity in her permanent state of terror as she had been for the last year since the time he did it to her if she hadnt cut her hand that time it might never have happened but she had and then shown him the blood something had happened to him then the same thing that happened every time he saw blood but on this occasion it had been different he had been unable to control it when he had bandaged her hand hed deliberately let something something of himself get into the wound georgina hadnt seen it but yuiian had he had made it she had been ill for a long time and when she recovered well she had never really recovered not fully and yulian had known that it had grown in her and that he was its master she had known it too which was what terrified her his mother yes actually yulian had never considered her his mother at all he had come out of her he knew that but hed always felt that he was more the son of a father but not a father in the ordinary sense of the word the son of of something else which was why this evening he had asked her about ilya bodescu and about the way he died and where he died and to make sure he got the entire story in every last detail this time hed hypnotised her into the deepest possible trance and as georgina had told him how it had been so his mind had been lured east across oceans and mountains and plains over fields and cities and rivers to a place which had always existed in the innermost eye of his mind a place of hills and woods and and yes that was it a place of low wooded hills in the shape of a cross the cruciform hills a place he would have to visit very soon he would have to for thats where the answer lay he was in thrall to that place as much as the rest of them in the house were in thrall to him which was to say totally and the strength of its seduction was just as great it was a strength he had not realised until george had come back back from his grave in blagdon cemetery back from the dead at first that had been a shock then an allconsuming curiosity finally a revelation for it had told yulian what he was not who he was but what and certainly he was more than merely the son of ilya and georgina bodescu yulian knew that he was not entirely human that a large part of him was utterly inhuman and the knowledge thrilled him he could hypnotise people to do his will whatever he desired he could produce new life of a sort out of himself he could change living beings people into creatures like himself oh they did not have his strength his weird talents but that was all to the good the change made them his slaves made him their absolute master more he was a necromancer he could open up dead bodies and learn the secrets of their lives he knew how to prowl like a cat swim like a fish savage like a dog the thought had occurred to him that given wings he might even fly like a bat like a vampire bat beside him on a bedside table lay a hardback book titled the vampire in fact and fiction now he reached out a slender hand to touch its cover trace the figure of a bat in flight impressed into the black binding cloth absorbing certainly but the title was a lie as were the contents much of the alleged fiction was fact and some of the supposed fact was fiction sunlight for instance it didnt kill it might if he should ever be foolish enough to stretch himself out in a sheltered cove in midsummer for more than a minute or two it must be some sort of chemical reaction he thought photophobia was common enough even among ordinary men mushrooms grow bestunder a covering of straw through foggy late september nights and hed read somewhere that in cyprus one can find the selfsame edible species except they never break the surface they push up the parched earth until cracks appear which tell the locals where to find them they didnt much care for sunlight mushrooms but it wouldnt kill them no yulian was wary of the sun but not afraid of it it was a question of being careful thats all as for sleeping through the day in a coffin full of native soil sheer fallacy he did occasionally sleep during the day but that was because he often spent much of the night deep in thought or prowling the estate he preferred night true because then in the darkness or in the moonlight he felt closer to his source closer to understanding the true nature of his being then there was the vampires lust for blood false at least in yulians case oh the sight of blood aroused him did things to him internally worked him into a passion but drinking it from a victims veins was hardly the delight described in the various fictions he did like rare meat however and plenty of it and had never been much of a one for greens on the other hand the thing yulian had grown in the vat in the cellar that had thrived on blood on blood flesh anything animate or exanimate on flesh or the red juice of flesh alive or dead it didnt need to eat yulian knew but it would if it could it would have absorbed george too if he hadnt been there to stop it the other yulian shuddered deliciously it knew him for its master but that was its sum total of knowledge he had grown it from himself and remembered how that had come about just after hed been expelled from school the first of what he had always supposed to be his adult teeth had come loose it was a back tooth and painful but he wouldnt see a dentist working and worrying at it one night hed broken the thread and hed examined the tooth closely finding it curious that this was part of himself which had been shed white bone and a thread of gristle the red root hed put it in a saucer on the window ledge of his bedroom but in the morning he heard it clatter to the floor the core had put out tiny white rootlets and the tooth was dragging itself like a hermit crab out of the morning light yulians teeth except the back ones had always been sharp as knives and chiseltipped but human teeth for all that certainly not animal teeth the one which had pushed out the lost one was anything but human it was a fang since then most of his teeth had been replaced and the new ones were all fangs especially the eyeteeth his jaws had changed too to accommodate them sometimes he thought perhaps im the cause of this change in myself maybe im making it happen willing it mind over matter because im evil georgina had used to say that to him sometimes tell him he was evil that was when he was small and she still had a measure of control over him when hed done things she didnt like when hed first started to experiment with his necromancy ah but thered been many things she hadnt liked since then georgina mother terror stricken chicken penned with a fox cub watching him grow sleek and strong for as yulian had grown older so the element of control had changed passed into his hands it was his eyes he only had to look at her with those eyes of his and and she was powerless the teachers and pupils at his school too and with use so hed become expert in hypnotism practice makes perfect to that extent at least the book was correct the vampire is quite capable of mesmerising its prey but what about mortality or immortality undeath that was still a puzzle a mystery but it was one hed soon resolve now that he had george there was very little he couldnt resolve for george was still in large part a man returned from the grave undead yes but his flesh was still a mans flesh and that which was within him couldnt have grown very large in so short a time unlike the other which had had plenty of time yulian had of course experimented with the other his experiments had told him very little but it was better than nothing according to the fiction vampires were supposed to succumb to the sharpened stake the other ignored the stake seemed impervious to it trying to stake it was like trying to leave an imprint on water the other could be solid enough at times it could form teeth rudimentary hands even eyes but in the main its tissues were protoplasmic gelatinous and as for putting a stake through its heart or cutting off its head and yet it wasnt indestructible it wasnt immortal it could die could be killed yulian had burned part of it in an incinerator down there in the cellars and by god if there was a god which yulian doubted it hadnt liked that he was perfectly sure that he wouldnt have liked it either and that was a thought which occasionally worried him if ever he were discovered if men found out what he was would they try to burn him he supposed they would but who could possibly find him out and if someone did who would believe it the police werent much likely to listen to a story about vampires now were they on the other hand what with the local satanic cult maybe they were again he smiled his awful smile it was funny now but it hadnt been at all funny when the police came knocking at the door the day after george came back he had very nearly made a serious mistake then had gone too quickly on his guard on the defensive but of course theyd put his nervousness down to the recent loss of his uncle if only theyd been able to know the truth that in fact george lake was right under their feet whining and shivering in the cellars and even so what could they have done about it it was hardly yulians fault that george wouldnt lie still was it and that was another part of the legend which was a fact that when a vampire killed a victim in a certain way then that victim would return as one of the undead three nights george had lain there and on the fourth hed clawed his way out a mere man buried alive could never have done it but the vampire in him had given george all the strength he needed and more the vampire which had been part of the other which had put one of its pseudohands into him and stopped georges heart the other which had been part of yulian in fact yulians tooth what a torn and bloodied state george had been in when yulian opened the door to him that night and how the house had rung to his demented sobbing and shrieking until yulian had grown angry with him told him to be quiet and locked him in the cellar and there hed stayed yulian watched the silver light of the moon creeping through a crack in his curtains channelled his thoughts anew what had he been recounting ah yes the police they had come to report a shocking crime the illegal opening of george lakes grave by person or persons unknown and the theft of his corpse was mrs lake still residing at harkley house why yes she was but she was still suffering from the shock of her husbands death if it wasnt absolutely necessary that they see her yulian would prefer to break the news to her himself but who could be responsible for so despicable a crime well sir we do believe weve got one of them there cults at work in these here parts despoiling graveyards and the like and holding er sabbats druids or some such devil worshippers you know but this time theyve gone too far dont you worry sir well get em in the end but do break it easy to his missus all right of course of course and thank you for bringing us this news terrible though it is i certainly dont envy you your job all in a days work sir sorry weve nothing good to report thats all good night to you and that was that but again he had strayed and once more he was obliged to focus his thoughts back on the legend of the vampire mirrors vampires hated mirrors because they had no reflections false and yet in a way true yulian did have a reflection but sometimes looking in a glass especially at night he saw far more than others could see for he knew what he was looking at that it was something alien to man and he had wondered if others saw him like that reflected in a glass would they too see the real thing the monster behind the man and lastly there was the vampires lust the way he sated himself on women now yulian had tasted the blood and more than the blood of women and had found it rich as deep red wine it excited him as all blood did but not so much that hed glut himself on it georgina anne helen hed tried the blood of all three and certainly in good time he would try the blood of many more but his attitude towards taking blood puzzled him if he were a true vampire surely blood would be the driving force of his life and yet it wasnt perhaps his metamorphosis wasnt yet complete perhaps as the change waxed in him so the human part would wane disappear altogether and then hed become a vampire fullblown or fullblooded lust yes but there was more to lust than mere bloodlust much more and little wonder the women in the fiction succumbed so readily to the vampires charms especially after the first time hah what woman had ever truly felt fulfilled in the arms of a man not one they only thought they had because they didnt know better what fulfilled filled full by a mere man utterly impossible but by a vampire yulian turned a little on to his side and gazed in the moonpierced darkness of his room at the girl beside him cousin helen she was very beautiful and had been very innocent not quite pure but very nearly who it was took her virginity but what did that matter in fact he had taken nothing and he had given very little they had been fumbling lovers for an hour but now now she knew what it was to be fulfilled indeed she knew that if yulian willed it he could fill her to bursting literally a chuckle rose in his throat formed on his lips like a bubble of bile ohyes for the other wasnt the only one who could put out pseudopod extensions of himself yulian held back the laughter he felt welling inside reached out a hand and with a deceptive gentleness stroked helens cool rounded flank even deeply asleep and dreaming the dreams of the damned still she shuddered under the touch of his hand gooseflesh appeared and her breathing rapidly mounted to a moaning pant she whined in her hypnotic sleep like a thin wind through a cracked board her hypnotic sleep yes the power of hypnotism and that of telepathy which was its kin nowhere in the literature except for the occasional hint in some of the better fictions had yulian discovered mention of the vampires control of others by will and the reading of minds at a distance and yet this too was one of his powers it was very inchoate as yet as were all his talents but it was also very real once touched by yulian once invaded by him physically then his victim was an open book to him even at a distance even now if he reached out his mind in a certain way there those were the dull vacuous thoughts of the other no not even that he had merely touched upon the others instinctive sense of being a sort of basic animal awareness the other was aware of himself itself in much the same way as an amoeba is aware and because it had been part of him yulian could sense that awareness now that he had taken or used helen anne george and georgina why he could sense all of them he let his exterior thoughts leave the other and wander and and there was anne asleep in some cold damp corner down there in the dark and there too was george except that george was not asleep george yulian knew he would soon have to do something about george he wasnt behaving as he should there was an obstinacy in him oh hed been completely under yulians control in the beginning just like the women but just recently yulian focused on georges mind wormed his way silently into his thoughts and a pit of black hatred shot with flashes of red rage lust too a bestial lust yulian could scarce believe and not only for blood but also revenge frowning yulian withdrew his mind before george could sense him obviously he would have to deal with his uncle sooner than hed thought he had already decided to make use of him knew how he would use him but now he must set a definite date on it like tomorrow he left the unsuspecting undead creature raging and prowling the cellars and what was that hair prickling at the nape of his neck yulian swung his legs down to the floor and stood up it hadnt been one of the women and hed only just left george so who had it been someone close by was thinking thoughts about harkley house thoughts about yulian himself he went to the curtains opened them six inches stared anxiously out at the night out there the estate the old derelict buildings gravel path shrubbery and copse the high perimeter wall and gate the road beyond the gate a ribbon of light under the moon and beyond that a tall hedge yulian wrinkled his nose sniffed suspiciously like a dog at a stranger oh yes a stranger there in the hedgerow that glint of moonlight on glass the dull red glow of a cigarettes tip someone in the shadow of the hedge watching harkley watching yulian now knowing where to aim he redirected his thoughts and met the mind of the stranger but only for a moment the merest instant of time then mental shutters came down like the jaws of a steel trap the glint of spectacles or binoculars disappeared the cigarettes glow was extinguished and the man himself the merest shadow was gone vlad yulian commanded instinctively go find him whoever he is bring him to me and down in the brambles and undergrowth near the door to the vaults where he lay half asleep viad at once came alert turned his sensitive ears towards the drive and the gate sprang up and set off at a loping run deep in his throat a growl not quite a dogs growl rumbled like dull thunder darcy clarke was doing late shift on the harkley place he was a psychic sensitive with a high degree of telepathic potential also he was big on selfpreservation a freakish automatic talent over which he had no conscious control was always on guard to keep him safe he was the opposite of accident prone and led a charmed life which on this occasion was just as well clarke was young only twentyfive but what he lacked in years he more than made up for in zeal he would have made a perfect soldier for his duty was his all it was that duty which had kept him here in the vicinity of harkley house from till pm and it was exactly on the dot of pm that he saw the crack of the curtains widen a little in one of harkleys dormer windows that in itself was nothing there were five people in that house and godknowswhat else and no reason at all why it shouldnt show signs of life with a grimace clarke quickly corrected himself signs of undeath fully briefed he knew that harkleys inhabitants were something other than they seemed but as he adjusted his nitelite binoculars on the window suddenly there was something else a realisation that struck at clarke like a bolt of lightning he had known of course that someone in there probably the youth was psychically endowed that had been obvious for the last four days ever since clarke and the others first clapped eyes on the place to any halftalented sensitive the old house would reek of strangeness and not just strangeness evil tonight as darkness fell clarke had sensed it growing stronger the wash of dark emanations flowing from the house like mental sewage until now hed simply let it flow right past him without touching but as that dark figure had come into view behind the crack in the curtains and as hed focussed his binoculars upon it something had been there in his head touching on his mind a talent at least as strong as his own probing his thoughts but it wasnt the talent that surprised him that was a game hed played before with his colleagues at intesp where they practised constantly to break in on each others thoughts it was the sheer unbridled animal animosity that caused him to gasp draw back a little slam shut the doors on his espendowed consciousness the gurgling black whirlpool bog of the invading mind and because he had set up defences so he failed to detect any hint of the physical threat the orders yulian had issued to his black alsatian he had failed but his primary talent the one no one as yet understood was not failing him it was pm and his instructions were quite clear hed go back now to his temporary surveillance ho at a hotel in paignton and make his report the watch on the house would begin again at am tomorrow when a colleague of clarkes would take it up he tossed his cigarette down ground it out under his heel pocketed his nitelites clarkes car was parked in a layby where the hedge and fence were cut back twentyfive yards down the road he was on the field side of the hedge he put his hand on the top bar preparatory to climbing over to the road then thought better of it though he didnt know it that was his hidden talent coming into play instead of climbing the fence he hurried through the long grass at the edge of the field towards his car the grass was wet where it whipped his trousers but he ignored it it saved time this way and he was in a hurry now eager to be away from the place only natural he supposed considering what hed just learned and he hardly gave it a thought that by the time he got to his car he was almost running but it was then as he fumbled the key into the lock and turned it that he heard something else running the faint scuff of padded feet slapping the road the scrabble of claws as something heavy jumped the fence back there where hed been standing then he was into the car slamming the door behind him eyes wide and heart thumping as he gazed back into the night and two seconds later viad hit the car he hit so hard with forepaws shoulder and head that the glass of the window in clarkes door was starred into a cobweb pattern the impact had sounded like a hammer blow and clarke knew that one more charge like that would shatter the glass to fragments and leave him totally unprotected but hed seen who or what his assailant was and he had no intention of sitting here immobile and just waiting for it to happen clarke turned the key in the ignition revved reversed a skidding three feet to bring the bonnet free of overhanging branches vlads second spring aimed again at clarkes window sent the dog sprawling on the bonnet directly in front of the windscreen and now the young esper saw just how fortunate his escape had been out in the open there was little he could have done against that viads face was a savage black mask of hatred a contorted snarling salivaflecked visage of madness yellow eyes spotted with crimson pupils glared through the glass at clarke with such a burning intensity that he almost fancied he could feel their heat then he was into first gear and skidding out on to the road as the car jerked and slewed forward so the dogs feet were jolted from under him he crashed over on to his side on the bonnet and was sent sprawling into the darkness of the hedgerow as clarke straightened the car up and sent it careening along the road in his rearview mirror he saw the dog emerge from the hedge and shake itself glaring after the speeding car then clarke was round a bend and vlad lost to sight that wasnt something he felt sorry about indeed he was still shaking when he switched off the cars engine in the hotel car park in paignton following which he flopped back in his seat and wearily lit a cigarette which he smoked right down to the cork tip before securing the car and going in to make his report frankies franchise was wall to wall sleazy it was a place for habitual wharfrats prostitutes and their pimps pushers and genoese lowlife in general and it was noisy an old american jukebox back in fashion was blasting little richards raw tutti frutti across the main room like a gale force wind there was no smallest corner of the place that escaped the musics blast but in any one of the halfdozen arched alcoves you could at least hear yourself think that was why frankies was so ideally suitable you couldnt concentrate enough to hear anyone else think alec kyle and carl quint felix krakovitch and sergei gulharov sat at a small square table with their backs to the protective alcove walls east and west faced each other across their drinks curiously on the one side kyle and quint drank vodka and on the other krakovitch and gulharov sipped american beers identifying each other had been the easiest thing in the world in frankies franchise no one else fitted the prescribed picture at all but personal appearance wasnt the only yardstick for of course even in the hubbub the three sensitives were able to detect each others psychic auras they had made their acknowledgement with nods of their heads picked their way with their drinks from the bar to an empty alcove certain of the clubs regulars had given them curious glances the hard men a little wary narroweyed the prostitutes speculative they had not returned them seated for a few moments finally krakovitch had opened the discussion i dont suppose you speaking my language he said his voice heavily but not unpleasantly accented but i speaking yours but badly this my friend sergei he tipped his head sideways a little to indicate his companion he know a little very little english he not have esp kyle and quint glanced obediently at gulharov what they saw was a moderately handsome young man with closecropped blond hair grey eyes hardlooking hands where they lay loosely crossed on the table enclosing his drink he seemed uneasy in his modern western clothes which werent quite the right fit thats true enough quint narrowed his eyes turning back to krakovitch hes not skilled that way but im sure he has many other worthwhile talents krakovitch smiled thinly and nodded he seemed a little sour kyle had been studying krakovitch committing him to memory the russian head of espionage was in his late thirties he had thinning black hair piercing green eyes and an almost gaunt hollow face he was of medium height slimly built a skinned rabbit thought kyle but his thin pale lips were firm and the high dome of his head spoke of a rare intelligence krakovitchs impression of kyle was much the same a man just a few years younger than himself intelligent talented it was only the physical side of kyle that was different which hardly mattered kyles hair was brown and plentiful naturally wavy he was well fleshed even a little overweight but with his height that scarcely showed his eyes were brown as his hair his teeth even and white in a toowide mouth that sloped a little from left to right in another face that look might well be mistaken for cynicism but not in kyle krakovitch thought quint on the other hand was more aggressive but he probably had superb selfcontrol he would reach conclusions quickly right or wrong and he would probably act on them he would act and hope hed done the right thing but he wouldnt feel guilty if it turned out wrong also there wasnt much emotion in quint all of this showed in his face his figure and krakovitch prided himself on reading character quint was lithe built like a cat in no way massive but he had that coiled spring look about him not nervous tension just a natural ability to think and act fast he had eyes of disarming blue that took in everything a thin even nose and a forehead creased from frowning he too was in his midthirties thin on top dark featured and he had a talent krakovitch could tell that quint was extremely espsensitive he was a spotter oh sergei gulharov has been trained krakovitch finally answered as my bodyguard but not in your arts or mine he has not got that kind of mind indeed of the four of us i could argue that he is the only normal man present which is unfortunate now he stared accusingly at kyle for you and i were supposed to meet as equals without er backup at that moment the music went quiet the rocknroll replaced by an italian ballad krakovitch said kyle hardeyed now and keeping his voice low wed better be straight on this youre right our deal was that the two of us should meet we could each bring along a second but no telepaths what we have to say to each other well just say without someone picking our thoughts quint isnt a telepath hes a spotter thats all so we werent cheating and as far as your man here er gulharov is concerned quint says hes clean so you arent cheating either or you wouldnt appear to be but your third man is something else my third man krakovitch sat up straight seemed genuinely surprised i have no but you do quint cut in kgb weve seen him in fact hes here in frankies franchise right now that was news to kyle he looked at quint youre certain quint nodded dont look now but hes sitting in the corner over there with a genoese whore hes changed his clothes too and looks like hes just off a ship not a bad cover but i recognised him the moment we walked in here out of the corner of his eye krakovitch looked then slowly shook his head i do not know him he said not to be surprised i do not know any of them i dislike strongly but you are sure how can you be so sure kyle would have been caught on the hop but not quint we run the same sort of branch as the one you run comrade he stated flatly except we have the edge on you were better at it hes kgb all right krakovitchs fury was obvious not against quint but the position in which he now found himself intolerable he snapped why the party leader himself has given me his he half stood up half turned towards the man indicated a thickset barrel of a man in rough and ready suit and opennecked shirt his neck must be at least as thick as krakovitchs thigh fortunately he was looking the other way talking to the prostitute before krakovitch could carry it any further kyle said i believe you that you dont know him it was done behind your back so sit down act naturally anyway its obvious we cant talk here apart from the fact that were being watched its too damned noisy and christ for all we know there might even be someone listening in on us krakovitch abruptly sat down he looked startled glanced nervously about bugged he remembered how his old boss borowitz had had a thing about electronic surveillance we could be quint gave a sharp nod this one either followed you here or he knew in advance where we were going to meet krakovitch gave a snort this getting out of hand i no good at this what now kyle looked at krakovitch and knew he wasnt faking it he grinned im no good at it either listen im like you felix i prognosticate i dont know your word for it i er foretell the future i occasionally get fairly accurate pictures of how things are going to be do you understand of course said krakovitch my talent almost exactly except i usually get warnings so so i saw us getting along ok together how about you krakovitch heaved a sigh of relief i also he shrugged at least no bad warnings time was running out for the russian and there were things he desperately needed to know questions he must have answered this englishman might be the only one who could answer them so what we do about it quint said wait he got up crossed to the bar ordered fresh drinks he also spoke to the bartender then he came back with drinks on a tray when we get the nod from the bloke behind the bar we pile out of here fast he said eh kyle was puzzled taxi said quint smiling tightly ive ordered one well go to the airport why not on the way we can talk at the airport we find a warm comfortable place in the arrivals lounge and carry on talking even if our pal over there manages to follow us he wont dare get too close and if he does show up well take a taxi somewhere else good said krakovitch five minutes later their taxi came and all four exited at speed kyle was last out looking back he saw the kgb man come slowly to his feet saw his face twisting in anger and frustration in the taxi they talked and at the airport they started talking at about twenty minutes before midnight and finished at am kyle did most of it aided by quint with krakovitch listening intently and only breaking in here and there to confirm or ask for an explanation of something that had been said kyle started with these words harry keogh was our best he had talents no one ever had before a lot of them he told me everything im going to tell you if you believe what i tell you we can help you with some big problems youve got in russia and romania in helping you well also be helping ourselves for well learn by experience now then do you want to know about borowitz and how he died about max batu and how he died about the the fossil men who wrecked the chвteau bronnitsy that night i can tell you all of those things more importantly i can tell you about dragosani and nearly three hours later he finished with these so dragosani was a vampire and there are more of them you have them and we have them we know where at least one of yours is or if not a vampire something a vampire left behind which could be just as bad whichever it has to be destroyed we can help if youll let us call it what you like dйtente while we deal with a mutual threat but if you dont want our help then youll have to do the job yourself but wed like to help because that way we might learn something face it felix this is bigger than eastwest political squabbling wed work together if it was plague wouldnt we drug trafficking ships in trouble at sea of course we would and im admitting right here and now our own problem back in england might be bigger than we know the more we learn from you the better our chances the better all of our chances krakovitch had been silent for a long time at last he said you want to come to ussr with me and and put this thing down not the ussr said quint romania thats still your territory the two of you both the leader and a highranking member of your ebranch is that not to be the big risks kyle shook his head not from you at least i dont think so anyway we all have to start trusting someone somewhere weve already started so why not go all the way krakovitch nodded and afterwards i perhaps come with you see what kind problem you have if you wish krakovitch pondered it you tell me a lot he said and you solve some big problems for me maybe but you not say where exactly this thing in romania if you want to go it alone said kyle i will tell you not exactly for i dont know exactly but close enough that youll be able to find it working together we might do it a lot faster thats all also krakovitch was still thinking it out you not say how you knowing all of this hard to accept all i hear without i know how you know harry keogh told me said kyle keogh is dead a long time now said krakovitch yes quint cut in but he told us everything right up to the time he died ah krakovitch drew breath sharply he was that good such talent in a telepath must be very rare unique said kyle and your lot killed him quint accused krakovitch quickly turned to him dragosani killed him and he killed dragosani almost it was kyles turn to gasp almost are you saying that krakovitch held up a hand i finish the job keogh started he said i tell you about that but first you say keogh in contact right until the end kyle wanted to say he still is but that was a secret best kept yes he answered then you can describe what happen that night in detail said kyle would that satisfy you that the rest of what ive said is the truth krakovitch slowly nodded they came out of the night and the falling snow kyle began zombies men dead for four hundred years and harry their leader bullets couldnt stop them for they were already dead cut them down with machinegun fire and the bits kept right on coming they got into your defensive positions your pillboxes they pulled the pins on grenades fought with their old rusty weapons their swords and axes they were tartars fearless and made more fearless by the fact that they couldnt die twice keogh wasnt just a telepath amongst his other talents he could also teleport he did right into dragosanis control room he took a couple of his tartars with him that was where he and dragosani had it out while in the rest of the chвteau in the rest of the chвteau krakovitch took up the story his face deathly white it was hell i was there i lived through it a few others with me the rest died horribly keogh was some kind of monster he could call up the dead not as big a monster as dragosani said kyle but you were going to tell me what happened after keogh died how you finished off the job he started what did you mean by that dragosani was a vampire krakovitch nodded almost to himself yes you are right of course he got a grip of himself look sergei here was with me when we clean up what was left of dragosani let me show you what happen when i remind him about that and when i tell to him there are more of them he turned to his silent companion spoke to him rapidly in russian they were sitting at a scruffy bar lit by flickering neon in the airports almost deserted night arrivals lounge the barman had gone off duty two hours earlier and their glasses had stood empty ever since gulharovs reaction to what krakovitch told him was immediate and vehement he went white and drew back from his boss almost falling from his barstool and as krakovitch finished speaking so he slammed his empty beer glass down on the bar nyet nyet he gasped his denial his face working with a strange mixture of fury and loathing and then his voice gradually rising and growing shrill he began a diatribe in russian which would soon attract attention krakovitch gripped his arm and shook him and gulharovs jabbering faded into silence now i ask him if we accepting your help krakovitch informed he spoke to the younger man again and this time gulharov nodded twice rapidly and his colour began to return to normal da da he gasped emphatically his throat made a dry rattle as he added something else unintelligible to the two englishmen krakovitch smiled humourlessly he says we should accept all the help we can get he translated because we have to kill these things finish them and i agreeing with him then he told these strangest of allies all that had happened at the chвteau bronnitsy after harry keoghs war when hed finished there was a long silence broken at last by quint were in agreement then that well act together on this krakovitch nodded he shrugged said simply no alternative and no time to waste quint turned to kyle but how do we go about it as far as possible kyle answered we go the straightforward way we get it all right up front without any of the usual the airport tannoy broke in on him echoing tinnily as some sleepy unseen announcer requested in english that a mr a kyle please take a telephone call at the reception desk krakovitchs face froze who would know that kyle was here kyle stood up shrugged apologetically this was very embarrassing it could only be brown and how to explain that to krakovitch quint on the other hand was his usual readyforanything self calmly he said to krakovitch well you have your little bloodhound following you about and now it would seem that we have one too krakovitch gave a curt sour nod and with an edge of sarcasm echoing kyle he said without any of the usual eh did you know about this its none of our doing quint wasnt exactly truthful were in the same boat as you on krakovitchs orders gulharov accompanied kyle to the receptioncumenquiries desk leavingquint and krakovitch alone together maybe this is all in our favour said quint eh krakovitch had turned sour again we are followed spied upon overheard bugged and you say is favourable i meant you and kyle both having shadows quint explained it evens things up and maybe we can cancel out one with the other krakovitch was alarmed i not being party to violence anything happen to that kgb dog is possible i get the troubles but if we could arrange for him to be er detained for a day or two i mean unharmed you understand completely unharmed just detained i not know to give you time to clear our route into romania you know visas etcetera with a bit of luck well be finished there in just a day or two krakovitch slowly nodded maybe but positive guarantee no dirty work he is kgb you say but if true then hes russian too and i am russian if he vanish quint shook his head grasped the others thin elbow they both vanish he said but only for a few days then well be out of here and getting on with the job again krakovitch gave his slow nod maybe if it can be arranged safely kyle and gulharov returned kyle was careful that was somebody called brown he said hes been watching us apparently he looked at krakovitch he says your kgb tail has traced us and is on his way here by the way this kgb fellow is well known his name is theo dolgikh krakovitch shook his head shrugged looked mystified i never heard of him did you get browns number quint was eager i mean can we contact him again kyle raised his eyebrows actually yes he nodded he said that if things were getting sticky he might be able to help why do you ask quint grinned tightly said to krakovitch comrade it might be a good idea if you were to listen carefully since youre a little concerned about this you can start working on an alibi for from this point forward youre hand in hand with the enemy your only consolation is that youll be working against a greater enemy the grin left his face and deadly serious he said ok heres what i suggest on saturday morning at kyle phoned krakovitch at his and gulharovs hotel the latter answered the call grunted fetched krakovitch who came grumbling to the phone he was just out of bed could kyle call later while this brief show was going on downstairs in the genoveses lobby quint was talking to brown at kyle phoned krakovitch again and arranged a second meeting they would meet outside frankies franchise in an hours time and go on from there there was nothing new in this arrangement it was part of the plan worked out the night before kyle suspected that the phone in his room was now bugged and he simply wanted to give theo dolgikh plenty of advance notice if kyles phone wasnt bugged then krakovitchs surely was which could only work out the same anyway the psychic sixth senses of both kyle and quint were playing up a little which told them that something was brewing sure enough when they left the geriovese just before am and headed for the docks they had a tail dolgikh was keeping well back but it could only be him kyle and quint had to admire his tenacity for despite his rough night he was still very much the masterspy now his attire was that of the shipyard worker darkblue coveralls and a heavy bag of tools and the blueblack stubble of twentyfour hours growth on his round intense face he must have a hell of a wardrobe this lad said kyle as he and quint approached the narrow still slumbering streets of genoas dockland id hate to have to carry his luggage quint shook his head no he answered i shouldnt think so theyll probably have a safe house here and theres bound to be one of their ships in the harbour whichever when he requires a change of clothing theyll be the ones wholl fix it for him kyle squinted at him out of the corner of his eye you know he said im sure youd have been better off in m you have a bent for it it might make an interesting hobby quint grinned mundane spying that is but im happy where i am the real talents with intesp now if our man dolgikh were an esper then we could be in real trouble kyle gave his companion a sharp glance then relaxed but he isnt or wed have spotted him without browns assistance no hes simply one of their surveillance types and pretty good at his job ive been thinking of him as something big but this is probably the biggest assignment hes ever had which quint grimly added with any luck is just about to terminate a mite ingloriously but i wouldnt be too sure hes small fry if i were you after all he was big enough to show up on browns firms computer carl quint was right theo dolgikh was not small fry not in any sense of the word indeed it was a measure of yuri andropovs respect for the soviet ebranch that hed put dolgikh on the job for leonid brezhnev would likely give andropov a hard time if krakovitch were to report to him that the kgb were interfering again dolgikh was in his early thirties a native siberian bred of a long line of komsomol lumberjacks he was the complete communist for whom little else existed but party and state he had trained and later done some teaching in berlin bulgaria palestine and libya he was an expert in weapons also in terrorism sabotage interrogation and surveillance as well as russian he could speak a broken italian decent german and english but his real forte indeed his penchant lay in the field of murder for theo dolgikh was a coldblooded killer because of his compressed build dolgikh might seem at a distance short and stubby in fact he was fiveten and weighed in at almost sixteen stone heavyboned heavjowled under a moon face that supported a mop of uneven jetblack hair dolgikh was heavy in all departments his japanese instructor at the kgb school of martial arts in moscow used to say comrade you are too heavy for this game because of your bulk you lack speed and agility sumo wrestling would be more your style on the other hand very little of your weight is fat and muscle is most useful since teaching you the disciplines of selfdefence is probably a great waste of time i shall therefore concentrate my instruction on ways of killing for which i am assured you are not only physically but mentally best suited now closing in on his quarry as they entered the winding labyrinthine streets and alleys close to the docks dolgikh felt his blood rising and wished this were that sort of job after last nights runaround he could happily murder this pair and it would be so easy they seemed utterly obsessed with this most seamy side of the city thirty yards ahead of him kyle and quint made a sudden sharp turn into a cobbled alley where the buildings loomed high shutting out the light dolgikh put on a little speed arrived at the alleys entrance passed from grey drizzle into a steamy gloom where the refuse of four or five days stood uncollected in many places overhead the opposing buildings were arched over following a frantic friday night this district wasnt even awake yet if dolgikh had been after the lives of these two this would have been the place to do it footsteps echoed back to him the russian agent narrowed small round eyes to gaze through the gloom of the alley at a pair of shadowy figures as they rounded a bend he paused for a second then started after them but sensing movement close by a silent presence he at once skidded to a halt from the shadows of a recessed doorway a gravelly voice said hello theo you dont know me but i know you dolgikhs japanese instructor had been right he wasnt fast enough at times like this his bulk got in the way gritting his teeth in anticipation of the dull smack of the suspected cosh and its pain or maybe the blue glint of a silencer on the end of a gun barrel he whirled towards the voice in the darkness hurled his heavy bag of tools a tall shadowy figure caught the bag full in the chest grunted and lobbed it aside to clatter on the cobbles dolgikhs eyes were getting used to the gloom it was still dark but hed seen no sign of a weapon this was just the way he liked it head down like a human torpedo he hurled himself into the doorways shadows mr brown hit him twice two expertly delivered blows not calculated to kill but simply stun and to be doubly sure before dolgikh could fall brown slammed the russians head into the stout panels of the door splintering one of them a moment later he stepped out of the shadows into the alley glanced this way and that satisfied himself that all was well just the drip of rain and the stinking vapours from the garbage and now there was this extra heap of garbage brown grinned hugely toed dolgikhs crumpled figure that was always the way of it with big men they tended to assume that they were the biggest the toughest but that wasnt always the case brown was about the same weight as dolgikh but he was three inches taller and five years younger exsas his training had been none too gentle in fact if he hadnt developed something of a kink in his mental makeup hed probably still be with the sas he grinned again then hunched his shoulders and shrank down into his raincoat hands thrust deep into his pockets he hurried to fetch his car chapter eight that same saturday at noon yulian bodescu decided hed had enough of his uncle george lake rather he decided that the time had come to use lake in his search for knowledge his specific aim was simple he desired to know how a vampire could be killed how one of the undead might be made more surely dead forever never to return and in this way learn how best to protect himself from any such demise they could die by fire certainly he knew that much already but what about the other methods those methods specified in the socalled fictions george would provide the ideal test material better far than the other which was more a dull tumour than a healthy intelligence when a vampire comes back from the dead the thought suddenly struck yulian he comes back stronger he had put something into georgina anne and helen something of himself but he had not killed them now they were his george he had killed or at least caused to die and george was not his he obeyed him yes or had until now but for how much longer now that george was over the initial shock he was growing strong and hungry twice during the night striving restlessly for sleep yulian had sprung awake feeling oppressed menaced and twice he had sensed lakes skulking furtive movements down in the cellars the man prowled down there in the darkness his body aching thoughts seething and a monstrous thirst was on him he had taken from the woman from the veins of his own wife but her blood had not been much to his taste oh blood is blood it would sustain him but it was not the blood he craved that blood flowed only in yulian and yulian knew it which was the other reason he had determined to kill george he would kill him before he himself was killed and before george could drain anne oh yes for if not thered soon be two of them to deal with it was like a plague and yulian thrilled to the thought that he was the source the carrier and then there was a third reason why lake must die somewhere out there in the sunlight in the woods and fields lanes and villages somewhere there were people who watched the house even now yulians senses his vampire powers were weaker by day but still he could feel the presence of the silent watchers they were there and he feared them a little that man last night for instance yulian had sent viad to fetch him but viad had failed who had he been that man and why did he watch perhaps georges return had not gone entirely unnoticed was it possible that someone had seen him emerge from his grave no yulian doubted that the police in their innocence would have mentioned it or then again perhaps the police had not been satisfied with his reaction that day they came here with their report of vile graverobbing and george with his bloodlust what if he should break out one night he was a vampire now george and growing stronger how long could viad contain him no better far if george died gone without a trace leaving no shred of evidence no jot of proof of the evil at work here he would die a vampires death this time from which thered be no returning at the back of the house a great stone chimney rose from earth to sky buttressed at the bottom and flaring up through the gable end its source was a huge iron furnace in the cellars a relic of older generations though the house was centrally heated now a heap of dusty coke still lay in the furnace room down there nesting place for mice and spiders twice when the winters had been especially cold yulian had stoked up the fire and watched the iron flue glow red where its fat cylindrical conduit joined the furnace to the chimneys firebrick base it had served to heat the back of the house admirably now he would go down there and sweat a little and fire the thing up again albeit for a different purpose but his sweat would be well worth the effort there was a trapdoor under one of the back rooms which since george had been down there yulian had kept boarded up that left only the entrance from the side of the house where viad kept his vigil as usual yuiian took a steak thick and dripping blood from the kitchen out to the dog where he guarded the cellars left him growling and tearing at his food while he descended the narrow steps down one side of the ramp and shoved open the door then as he stepped into darkness he had maybe a halfseconds warning of what was waiting for him but it was enough george lakes mind was a bubbling pit of crimson hatred many emotions were trapped in there controlled until that last halfsecond lust selfloathing a hunger beyond human hunger which was so intense it was in fact an emotion disgust jealousy so strong it burned but mainly hatred for yulian and in the moment before george struck the bile of his mind touched yulians like acid so that he cried out as he avoided the blow in the dark for darkness had been yulians element long before george discovered it a fact which the new halfmad vampire had failed to take into account yulian saw him crouching behind the door saw the arc of the mattock as it swung towards him he ducked under the rushing rusty vicious head of the tool came up inside the circle of its swing and closed fingers like steel on georges throat at the same time with his free hand he wrenched the mattock away from him and hurled it aside and drove his knee again and again up into georges groin for any ordinary man the fight would have been over there and then but george lake was no longer ordinary and no longer merely a man forced to his knees as yulians fingers tightened on his throat he glared back at the youth through eyes like coals under a bellows blast a vampire his grey undead flesh shrugged off the pain found strength to fight back his legs straightened against all yulians weight and he smashed at yulians forearm to break his grip astonished the youth found himself tossed back saw the other springing at him to tear his throat out and again yulian knew fear for he saw now that his uncle was almost as strong as he himself he feinted before georges charge thrust him sprawling snatched up the mattock from the stone floor he hefted the tool murderously in his powerful hands advancing on george where he came surging to his feet at which moment anne yulians dear auntie anne came ghosting and gibbering out of the shadows and the darkness to throw herself between yulian and her undead husband oh yulian she wailed yulian no please dont kill him not again naked and grimy she crouched there her eyes full of animal pleading her hair wild yulian thrust her aside just as george made his second spring george he grated through clenched teeth thats twice youve gone for me with this now lets see how you like it flakes of rust splintered from the sharp point of the mattock as it slammed into georges forehead and punched a neat hole one and a half inches square just above the triangle formed of eyes and nose the sheer force of the blow checked georges forward impetus snapping him upright like a puppet on a string gak he said as his eyes filled with blood and his nose spurted crimson his arms rose up at fortyfive degrees his hands fluttering as if hed been plugged into a live electric socket gugakarghh he gurgled then his bottom jaw fell open and he toppled backwards like a felled tree crashing to the floor on his back mattock still fixed firmly in his head anne came scrambling threw herself down wailing on top of georges twitching body she was in thrall to yulian but george had been her husband what he had become was yulians fault not his own george oh george she wailed oh my poor dear george get off him yulian spat at her help me they dragged george by his ankles to the furnace room the mattocks handle clattering on the uneven floor in front of the cold furnace yulian put a foot on the vampires throat and wrenched the mattock free of his head blood and greyishyellow pulp welled up to fill the crater in his forehead and overflow the rim but his eyes stayed open his hands continued to flutter and one heel thumped the floor in a continuous series of galvanic spasms oh hell die hell die anne wrung her grimy hands sobbed and cradled georges shattered head no he wont yulian worked to get the furnace going thats just it you stupid creature he cant die not like that anyway whats in him will heal him its working on his crushed brain even now he could be good as new maybe even better except thats something i cant allow the fire was set yulian struck a match held it to paper opened the iron draught grid squealingly so that the flames would draw and closed the furnace door as he turned from the furnace he heard anne gasp george the hammering of georges spastic heel on the stone floor had been absent for some little time yulian spun on his heel and the thing he had made crashed into him and forced him back against the furnace door as of yet there was no heat but the wind was driven from yulians lungs in a huge gasp he drew air painfully held the other at bay georges feral eyes glared through blood and mucus from the hole in his head his teeth like small daggers chomped in his twisted face his hands flopped against yulian like blind things his ruptured brain was functioning barely but already the vampire in him was mending his wound and his hatred was as strong as ever yulian gathered his strength hurled george from him unable to control the impaired functions of his limbs he crashed down on to the pile of coke before he could rise again yulian glared all about in the gloom moved to take up the mattock yulian yulian anne went to intercede get out of my way he thrust her aside ignoring george where he crawled after him hooked hands reaching he loped to the arched entrance where the stone walls were massively thick and there without pause he swung the shaft of the mattock against the stonework the hardwood shaft broke splintering diagonally across its grain and the rusty head went clattering into darkness yulians hands were left numb where they clutched a nearperfect stake eighteen inches of hardwood narrowing down to an uneven but deadly sharp point well and it had been his intention to discover the full range of a vampires vitality hadnt it george had somehow managed to lurch to his feet eyes sulphurous in the neardarkness he came after yulian like some demoniac robot yulian glanced at the floor here there were thick stone paving slabs pushed up a little in places by some force from below the other of course in its mindless burrowing george was closer stumbling spastically mouthing thick phlegmy noises unrecognisable as words yulian waited until the crippled vampire took another lurching pace towards him then stepped forward and slammed the stake into georges chest slightly left of centre the hardwood point ripped through georges linen burial shift and grated between his ribs shedding splinters as it went it skewered his heart and almost severed it george gasped like a speared fish fumbled at the stake with useless hands there was no way he was going to pull it out yulian watched him staggering there watched in disbelief astonishment almost in admiration and wondered would it be this hard for someone to kill me he supposed it would after all george had tried hard enough then he kicked georges jelly legs out from under him and went in search of the broken mattock head a moment later and he returned and still george squirmed and gagged and wrestled with the stake in his chest yulian grabbed one of his twitching legs dragged him to a spot where black soil showed between the broken jointing of displaced flags he got down on his knees beside him used the mattock head as a hammer to drive the stake right through him and into the floor finally jammed between two of the flags the stake would go no further george was pinned like some exotic beetle on a board only two or three inches of the stake stood up from his chest but there was little blood to be seen his eyes were still open wide as doors and there was white froth on his lips but no more movement in him yulian stood up wiped his hands down his trousers went in search of anne he found her crouching in a dark corner whimpering and shivering looking for all the world like a discarded doll he dragged her to the furnace room and pointed to a shovel stoke that fire he ordered i want it hotter than hell and if you dont know now how hot hell is im the one to show you i want that flue glowing red and whatever else you do dont go near george leave him completely alone do you understand she nodded whimpered shrank back away from him ill be back he told her leaving her there by the furnace which was now just beginning to roar on his way out yulian spoke to viad stay watch then he went back into the house upstairs passing his mothers room he heard her moving he looked in georgina was pacing the floor wringing her hands and sobbing she saw him yulian her voice was a tremor oh yulian whats to become of you and whats to become of me what was to become has become he answered coldly unemotionally can i still trust you georgina i i dont know if i trust myself she eventually answered mother he used the term without thinking do you want to be like george oh god yulian please dont say because if you do he stopped her it can be arranged just remember that he left her and went to his own room helen heard him coming she gasped at the sound of his quiet even footfalls and threw herself on his bed as he came in through the door she lifted her dress up to display the lower half of her body she was naked under the dress he saw her the way her face worked trying to smile through a mask of white terror it was as if someone had thrown powdered chalk on the face of a clown cover yourself slut he said i thought you liked me like this she cried oh yulian dont punish me please dont hurt me she watched him stride to a chest of drawers take out a key and unlock the top drawer when he turned towards her he was grinning his sick grin and in his hands he weighed a shining new cleaver the thing had a seven inch blade and was heavy as a small axe yulian helen gasped her mouth dry as sawdust she slid off the bed and shrank away from him yulian i he shook his head laughing a weird bubbling laugh then his face turned blank again no he told her its not for you youre safe as long as youre useful to me and you are useful id have to pay a lot to find one as sweet and fresh as you and even then like all women she wouldnt be worth it he walked out and closed the door noiselessly behind him downstairs as he left the house again yulian noticed the column of blue smoke rising from the chimney stack at the back he smiled to himself and nodded anne was working hard down there but even as he studied the smoke the fluffy september clouds parted a little and the sun struck through struck bright hot searing the smile twisted on yulians face became a snarl he had left his hat indoors even so the sun shouldnt burn like this his flesh almost felt scalded and yet looking at his naked forearms he could see no blisters no burns he guessed what it must mean the change had speeded up in him and his final metamorphosis was beginning then shrinking from the sun gritting his teeth to keep from crying out as the pain increased he hurried back to the cellars down below anne worked at the furnace her breasts and buttocks were shiny with sweat and streaked with grime yulian looked at her and marvelled that this had been a lady as he approached she dropped the shovel backing away from him he carefully put down his cleaver so as not to dull its edge in any way and advanced on her the sight of her like this wild and naked hot and perspiring and full of fear had triggered his lust he took her on the heaped coke filled her with himself with the vampire thing in him until she cried out her immeasurable horror her unthinkable pleasure as his alien protoflesh surged within her finished at last he left her sprawling exhausted and battered on the coke and went to inspect george he found the other inspecting him too up from the gaps between strained flags protoplasmic flesh had crept in doughy flaps and tendrils binding george lake to the floor as the other examined him there was no real curiosity in the thing no hatred no fear but there was hunger even the amoeba which knows very little knows enough to eat and if yulian had not returned when he did certainly the other would have devoured george absorbed him for there was little denying that he was food yulian scowled at the others flaccid groping pseudopods its quivering mouths and vacuous eyes no he sent out the sharp thought like a drill on the creatures nerve endings leave him begone and whatever else it failed to understand definitely the other understood yulian as if seared by a blowtorch the pseudopods and other anomalies lashed retracted disappeared with squelching sounds below it took only a second or two but this had been only part of the other yulian wondered how big it had grown now just how much of it filled the compacted earth under the house yulian took his cleaver and got down beside george he placed his hand on his midriff just under the stump of stake something at once moved convulsively in him yulian sensed it coiling itself like a prodded caterpillar george might look dead should be dead but he wasnt he was undead the thing that lived in him that which had been yulians but grown now and controller of georges mind and body merely waited the stake alone had not been enough but that came as no real surprise yulian had not been especially sure that it would be he took up his cleaver and wiped the shining blade on his rolled shirt sleeve and the yellow eyes in georges grey mutilated face moved in their bloodrimmed orbits to follow his movements not only was the vampires body in georges body but its mind was in his mind grafted to it like a feasting leech good yulian struck he struck rapidly three times hard chopping blows that bit into georges neck and cut through flesh and bone with perfect ease in another moment his head rolled free yulian gripped the severed head by its hair and stared into the core of the neck stump something green and greymottled drew itself out of sight into fibrous mucus nothing yulian could see looked like it should the manpart of this thing was a mere envelope of flesh a shell or disguise to protect the creature within likewise the body when yulian propped up the headless trunk with his knee a sinuous something slipped quickly down into the bloody pipe of georges yawning gullet perhaps in two parts the vampire would eventually die but it was not dead yet which left only one sure way one tried and true means of disposal fire yulian kicked the head in the direction of the furnace it rolled past anne where she lay exhausted barely conscious in her extremity of terror she had seen all that yulian had done the head came up against the foot of the furnace rebounded a little way and stopped yulian dragged the body to the furnace and threw open the door inside all was an orange and yellow shimmer heat blasted out a shaft of heat roared up into the flue without pause yulian picked up the head and threw it into the furnace as far to the back as he could get it then he propped up georges body against the open door and levered him shoulders first into the inferno last to go in were the legs and feet which already were starting to kick yulian needed all his strength to control the thrashing limbs until he at last got them up over the rim of the door and slammed it shut the door at once banged open impelled by a raw steaming foot again yulian thrust the member inside and slammed the door and this time he shot the bolt for long seconds in addition to the roaring of the fire there came thumping vibrations from within in a little while however the noises subsided then there was only a long sustained hissing finally only the fires roar could be heard yulian stood there for long moments with his own private thoughts before finally turning away by pm that same saturday alec kyle and carl quint felix krakovitch and sergei gulharov were on a scheduled al italia night flight for bucharest which would arrive just after midnight of the four krakovitch had spent the busiest day arranging all the paraphernalia of entry into a soviet satellite for the two englishmen he had done this the easy way by phoning his second in command at the chвteau bronnitsy one ivan gerenko a rarely talented deflector and getting him to pass the details on to his highpowered gobetween on brezhnevs staff he had also asked that it be arranged for him to have maximum assistance if he should require it from the ussrs comrades in puppet romania they were still an insular lot the romanians and one could never be absolutely sure of their cooperation thus krakovitchs afternoon was taken up in making and answering calls between genoa and moscow until all arrangements were in hand not once through all of this did he mention the name of theo dolgikh ordinarily he would have taken his complaint to the very top to brezhnev himself as the party leader had ordered but not in the present circumstances krakovitch had only kyles word that dolgikh was temporarily and not permanently detained as long as he remained ostensibly in ignorance of the kgb agent and his affairs then all would be well and if indeed dolgikh were safe and merely for the moment secure time enough later to bring charges of interference against yuri andropov krakovitch did marvel though that the kgb had got on to his supposedly secret mission to italy so quickly it made one wonder were ebranch officials under kgb surveillance all of the time as for alec kyle he too had made an international call to the duty officer at intesp that had been late in the afternoon when it had looked fairly certain that he and quint would be accompanying the two russians to romania is that grieve how are things going john he had asked alec the answer came back ive been expecting you to give us a ring john grieve had two talents one of them dodgy branch parlance for an as yet undeveloped esp ability and the other quite remarkable and possibly unique the first was the gift of farseeing he was a human crystal ball the only trouble was he must know exactly where and what he was looking for otherwise he could see nothing his talent didnt work at random but must be directed he must have a definite target his second string made him doubly valuable it could well prove to be a different facet of his first talent but on occasions like this it was a godsend grieve was a telepath but one with a difference yet again he must aim his talent he could only read a persons mind when he was face to face with that person or when talking to him even on the telephone if he knew the person in question there was no lying to john grieve nor any need for a mechanical scrambler that was why kyle had left him on permanent duty at hq while he was away john said kyle how are things at home and he also asked whats happening down on the ranch in devon oh well you know grieves answer sounded iffy can you explain whats up but careful how you answer well see its young yb came back the answer it seems hes cleverer than we allowed i mean hes inquisitive you know sees and hears too much for his own good well we must give him credit for it kyle tried to sound casual while in his head he added urgently you mean hes talented telepathy i suppose so answered grieve meaning probably jesus christ is he on to us anyway weve had tough customers before said kyle and our salesmen are in possession of the full brief how are they armed well yes they have the standard kit said grieve still its a bit leery ill tell you set his dog on one of our blokes no harm done though as it happens it was old dc and you know how wary he is no harm will come to that one darcy clarke thank god kyle breathed more easily out loud he said look john youd better read my file on our silent partner you know from eight months ago the first keogh manifestation our blokes might well need all the help they can get and i really dont think that in this case standard kit is sufficient its something i should have thought of before except i didnt anticipate young ybs foxiness mm automatics might not stop him or any of the others in that house but theres a description in the harry keogh file of something that will i think get the squad armed with crossbows just as you say alec ill look into it at once said grieve no sign of surprise in his voice and how are things with you oh not bad were thinking of moving up into the mountains tonight actually were off to romania with krakovitch hes ok i hope as soon as ive got anything definite ill get back to you then maybe youll be able to move in on bodescu but not until we know all there is to know about what were up against lucky you said grieve the mountains eh beautiful at this time of year ah well some of us must work do drop me a card now wont you and do take care same goes for you kyle spoke light and easy but his thoughts were sharp with concern for gods sake make sure those lads down in devon are on the ball if anything were to happen i oh well do our best to keep out of trouble grieve cut him off it was his way of saying look we can only do as much as we can do ok ill be in touch good luck and then he had broken the connection for a long time hed stood in his room looking at the telephone and chewing his lip things were warming up and alec kyle knew it and when quint came in from the room next door where hed been taking a nap one look at his face told kyle that he was right quint looked rough round the edges suddenly more than a little haggard he tapped his temple things are starting to jump he said in here kyle nodded i know he answered ive a feeling theyre starting to jump all over the place in his tiny room in what had once been harry keoghs hartlepool flat whose window looked out over a graveyard harry junior was falling asleep his mother brenda keogh shushed the baby and lulled him with soft humming sounds he was only five weeks old but he was clever there were lots of things happening in the world and he wanted in on them he was going to make very hard work of growing up because he wanted to be there now she could feel it in him his mind was like a sponge soaking up new sensations new impressions thirsting to know gazing out of his fathers eyes and striving to envelop the whole wide world oh yes this could only be harry keoghs baby and brenda was glad shed had him if only she could still have harry too but in a way she did have him right here in little harry in fact she had him in a bigger way than she might ever have suspected just what the babys fathers work had been with british intelligence brenda didnt know she only knew that he had paid for it with his life there had been no recognition of his sacrifice not officially anyway but cheques arrived every month in plain envelopes with brief little covering notes that specified the money as widows benefit brenda never failed to be surprised they must have thought very highly of harry the cheques were rather large twice as much as she could ever have earned in any mundane sort of work and that was wonderful for she could give all of her time to harry poor little harry she crooned at him in her soft northern dialect an old old ditty shed learned from her own mother whod probably learned it from hers got no mammy got no daddy born in a coal hole well not quite as bad as all that but bad enough without harry and yet occasionally brenda felt pangs of guilt it was less than nine months since shed last seen him and already she was over it it all seemed so wrong somehow wrong that she no longer cried wrong that she never had cried a great deal entirely wrong that he had gone to join that great majority who so loved him the dead long fallen into decay and dissolution not necessarily morally wrong but wrong conceptually definitely she didnt feel that he was dead perhaps if shed seen his body it would be different but she was glad that she hadnt seen it dead it wouldnt have been harry at all enough of morbid thinking she touched the babys tiny button nose with the knuckle of her index finger bonk she said but very very softly for little harry keogh was asleep harry felt the infants whirlpool suction ebb felt the tiny mind relax its constraint aimed himself into and through a transdimensional door and found himself adrift once more in the ultimate darkness of the mцbius continuum pure mind he floated in the flux of the metaphysical free of the distortions of mass and gravity heat and cold he revelled like a swimmer in that great black ocean which stretched from never to forever and nowhere to everywhere where he could move into the past no less rapidly than into the future harry could go any and everywhere and everywhen from here it was simply a matter of knowing the right direction of using the right door he opened a timedoor and saw the blue light of all earths living billions streaming into unimagined everexpanding futures no not that one harry selected another door this time the myriad blue lifethreads streamed away from him and contracted narrowing down to a fardistant dazzling single blue point it was the door to time past to the very beginning of human life on earth and that wasnt what he wanted either actually he had known that neither of these doors was the right one he was simply exercising his talents his powers that was all for the fact was that if he didnt have a mission but he did have one it was almost identical with the mission which had cost him his corporeal life and it was still unfinished harry put all other thoughts and considerations aside used his unerring intuition to point himself in the right direction calling out to that one he knew he would find there thibor his call raced out into the black void only answer me and ill find you and we cantalk a moment passed a second or a million years it was all the same in the mцbius continuum and it made no difference at all to the dead then ahhhh came back the answer is it you haarrry the mental voice of the old thing in the ground was his beacon he homed in on it came up against a mobius door and passed through it it was midnight on the cruciform hills and for two hundred miles in every direction most of romania lay asleep no requirement for harry and his infant simulacrum to materialise here for there was no one to see them but knowing that he could be seen there if there were eyes to see gave harry a feeling of corporeality even as a willothewisp he would feel that he was somebody not merely a telepathic voice a ghost he hovered in the glade of stirless trees above the tumbled slabs and close to the tottering entrance of what had been thibor ferenczys tomb and formed about his focus the merest nimbus of light then he turned his mind outwards to the night and the darkness if he had had a body harry might have shivered a little he would have felt a chill but a purely physical chill and not one of the spirit for the undead evil which had been buried here five hundred years ago was gone now was no longer undead but truly dead which fact begged the question had all of it been removed was it dead entirely for harry keogh had learned and was learning still of the vampires monstrous tenacity as it clung to life thibor said harry im here against the advice of all the teeming dead ive come again to talk to you ahhhh haaarrry you are a comfort my friend indeed you are my only comfort the dead whisper in their graves talking of this and that but me they shun i alone am truly alone without you there is only oblivion truly alone harry doubted it his sensitive esp warned him that something else was here something that held back biding its time something dangerous still but he hid his suspicions from thibor i made you a promise he said you tell me the things i want to know and i in turn will not forget you even if its only for a moment or two ill find time now and then to come and talk to you because you are good haaarrry because you are kind while my own sort the dead they are unkind they continue to hold this grudge harry knew the old thing in the grounds wiles how he would avoid at all cost the issue of the moment harrys principal purpose in being here for vampires are satans own kith and kin they speak with his tongue which speaks only lies and deceptions thus thibor would attempt from the outset to turn the conversation this time to his unfair treatment by the great majority harry would have none of it you have no complaint he told him they know you thibor how many lives have you cut short in order to prolong or sustain your own they are unforgiving the dead for theyve lost that which was most precious to them in your time you were the great stealer of life not only did you bring death with you but even on occasion undeath you cant be surprised that they shun you thibor sighed a soldier kills he answered but when he in turn dies do they turn away from him of course not he is welcomed into the fold the executioner kills also the maniac in his rage and the cuckold when he discovers another in his bed and are they shunned perhaps in life some of them but not after life is done for then they move on into a new state in my life i did what i had to do and i paid for it in death must i go on paying do you want me to plead your case for you harry wasnt even halfserious but thibor was quickwitted i had not considered that but now that you mention it ridiculous harry cried youre playing with words playing with me and thats not why im here there are a million others who genuinely desire to talk to me and i waste my time with you ah well ive learned my lesson ill trouble you no more harry wait panic was in thibor ferenczys voice which came to harry quite literally from beyond the grave dont go harry who will talk to me if there is no other necroscope thats a fact youd do well to keep in mind ahhh dont threaten me harry what am i what was i after all but an old creature entombed before his time ff have seemed to be difficult forgive me come now tell me what it is that you want from me harry allowed himself to be mollified very well its this i found your story very interesting my story your tale of how you came to be what you were as i recall it you had reached that stage where faethor had trapped you in his dungeon and transferred or deposited in you his egg thibor cut him off the pearly seed of the wamphyri your memory serves you well harry keogh and so does mine too well his voice was suddenly sour you dont wish to continue with that story i wish i had never started it but if that is what it takes to keep you here harry said nothing simply waited and after a moment or two i see that is what it takes the exvampire groaned very well and after a further sullen silence thibor continued the telling of his story picture it then that strange old castle up in the mountains its walls wreathed in mist its central span arching over the gorge its towers reaching like fangs for the rising moon and picture its master a creature who was once a man but no longer a thing which called itself faethor ferenczy i have told how he how he kissed me ah but no one was ever kissed by his father like that before he lodged his egg in me oh yes and if i had thought that the bruises and gouges of battle were painful to receive the seed of a vampire is to know an almost fatal agony almost fatal but never quite no for the vampire chooses his eggbearer with great care and cunning he must be strong that poor unfortunate he must he keenwitted preferably cold and callous and i admit it i was all of those things having lived a life like mine how could i be otherwise and so i experienced the horror of that egg in me which fashioned tiny pseudopods and barbs of its own to drag itself down my throat and into my body swift the thing was quicksilver indeed it was more than quicksilver a vampire seed can pass through human flesh like water through sand faethor had not needed to terrify me with his kiss he had simply desired to terrify me and he had succeeded his egg passed through my flesh from the back of my throat to the column of my spine which it explored as a curious mouse explores a cavity in the wall but on feet that burned like acid and with each touch on my naked nerve endings came fresh waves of agony ah how i writhed and jerked and tossed in my chains then but not for long finally the thing found a resting place newborn it was easily tired i think it settled in my bowels which instantly knotted causing me such pain that i cried out for the mercy of death but then the barbs were withdrawn the thing slept the agony went out of me in a moment so swiftly indeed that the sensation was a sort of agony in itself then in the sheer luxury of painlessness i too slept when i awoke i found myself free of all manacles and chains lying crumpled on the floor there was no more pain despite my thinking that my cell should be in darkness i found that i could see as clearly as in brightest daylight at first i failed to understand i sought in vain for the hole which let in the light tried to climb the uneven walls in search of some hidden window or other outlet to no avail before that however before this futile attempt of mine to escape i was confronted by the others who shared my dismal cell or by what they had become first there was old arvos who lay in a heap just as faethor had left him or so i thought i went to him observed his grey flesh his withered chest beneath the rags of his torn coarse shirt and i laid my hand upon him there perhaps in an attempt to detect the warmth of life or even a faltering heartbeat for i had thought i saw a certain fluttering in his bony chest no sooner was my hand upon him than the gypsy caved in all of him collapsing inwards like a husk like last years leaves when stepped upon beneath the cage of ribs which also powdered away there was nothing the face likewise crumbled into dust set free by the bodys avalanche that old grey unlovely countenance smoking into ruin limbs were last to go deflating even as i crouched there like ruptured wineskins in the merest moment he was a heap of dust and small shards of bone and old leather and all still clad in his coarse native clothes fascinated jaw lolling i continued to stare at what had been arvos i remembered that worm of a finger coming loose from faethors hand and going into him and was that worm responsible for this had that small fleshy part of faethor eaten him away so utterly if so what of the worm itself where was it now my questions were answered on the instant consumed thibor aye said a dull echoing voice gone to feed the one which now burrows in the earth at your feet out from the dungeons shadows stepped an old wallach comrade of mine a man all chest and arms with short stumpy legs ehrig had been this ones name when he was a man for looking at him now i saw nothing in him that was known to me he was like a stranger with a strange aura about him or maybe not so strange for indeed i thought i knew that emanation it was the morbid presence of the ferenczy ehrig was now his traitor i told him scowling the old ferenczy saved your life and now in gratitude youve given that life to him and how many times in how many battles have i saved your life ehrig i long since lost count thibor the other huskily answered his eyes round as saucers in a gaunt hollow face enough that you must know i would never willingly turn against you what are you saying you are still my man i laughed however scathingly but i can smell the ferenczy on you or perhaps youve unwillingly turned against me eh and still more harshly i added why should the ferenczy save you eh except to serve him didnt he explain anything to you ehrig came closer he didnt save me for himself im to serve you as best i may after he departs this place the ferenczy is mad i accused he has beguiled you cant you see have you forgotten why we came here we came to kill him but look at you now gaunt dazed puny as an infant how may one such as you serve me ehrig stepped closer still his great eyes were very nearly vacant unblinking nerves in his face and neck jumped and twitched as if they were on strings puny you misjudge the ferenczys powers thibor what he put in me healed my flesh and bones aye and it made me strong i can serve you as well as ever be sure only try me now i frowned shook my head in a sudden amaze certain of his words made sense went some little way towards cooling my furious thoughts by now by rights you should indeed be dead i agreed your bones were broken aye and your flesh torn are you saying that the ferenczy is truly the master of such powers i remember now he said that when you recovered you would be in thrall to him but to him dyou hear so how is it that you stand here and tell me i am still your lord and leader he is the master of many powers thibor he answered and indeed i am in thrall to him to a point he is a vampire and now i too am a vampire of sorts and so are you i i was outraged i am my own man he did something to me granted put that which was of himself into me which was surely poisonous but here i stand unchanged you ehrig my once friend and follower may well have succumbed but i remain thibor of wallachia ehrig touched my elbow and i drew back from him with me the change was swift he said it was made faster through the ferenczys flesh mingling with my own which worked to heal me my broken parts were mended with his flesh and just as he has bound me together so has he bound me to himself i will do his bidding that is true mercifully he demands nothing of me but that i stay here with you meanwhile while he spoke in his mournful fashion i had prowled all about the dungeon looking for an escape even attempted to scale the walls the light i muttered where does it come from if the light finds its way in i can find my way out there is no light thibor said ehrig following behind me his voice doleful as ever it is proof of the ferenczys magic because we are his we share his powers in here all is utter darkness but like the bat of your standard and like the ferenczy himself you now see in the night more you are the special one you bear his egg you will become as great as perhaps greater than the ferenczy himself you are wamphyri i am myself i raged and i grabbed ehrig by the throat and now as i drew him close i noticed for the first time the yellow glow in his eyes they were the eyes of an animal mine too if he spoke the truth ehrig made no effort to resist me indeed he went to his knees as i applied greater pressure well then i cried why dont you fight back show me this wonderful strength of yours you said i should try you and now i take you at your word youre going to die ehrig aye and after you so too your new master the very moment he sticks his dogs nose into this dungeon i at least have not forgotten my reason for being here i grabbed up a length of the chain which had bound me to the wall and looped it round his neck he choked gagged his tongue lolled out still he made no effort to resist me useless thibor he gasped when i relaxed the pressure a little all useless choke me suffocate me break my back i will mend you may not kill me you cannot kill me only the ferenczy can do that a fine jest eh for we came here to kill him i tossed him aside ran to the great oak door raged and hammered at it only echoes came back to me in desperation i turned again to ehrig so then i panted you are aware of the change taken place in you of course for if its plain to me it must be plainer still to you very well but tell me why then am i the same as before i feel no different surely no great change is wrought in me ehrig rubbing his throat came easily to his feet he had great bruises on his neck from the chains other than this it seemed he suffered no ill effects from my manhandling his eyes burned as before and his voice was doleful as ever as you say he said the change in me has been wrought as iron is wrought in the furnace the ferenczys flesh has taken hold of me and bent me to its will as iron bends in the fires heat but with you it is different more subtle the vampires seed grows within you it grafts itself to your mind your heart your very blood you are like two creatures in one skin but slowly you will meld fuse into one this is what faethor had told me i sagged against the damp wall then my destiny is no longer my own i groaned but it is thibor it is ehrig was eager now why now that death no longer holds any terrors you can live forever you have the chance to grow more powerful than any man before you and what is that for destiny i shook my head powerful in thrall to the ferenczy surely you mean powerless for if im to be his man then how may i be my own no that shall not be the way of it while yet i have my will i shall find a way i prodded my chest and grimaced how long before before this thing within commands me how much time do i have before the guest overpowers the host slowly sadly i thought he shook his head you insist on making difficulties he said the ferenczy told me it would be so because you are wild and wilful he said you will be your own man thibor it shall be like this that the thing within cannot exist without you nor you without it but where before you were merely a man with a mans frailties and puny passions now you shall be hold i told him my memory suddenly whispering monstrous things in my mind he told me he said that he was sexless he said the wamphyri have no sex as such and you talk to me of my puny passions as one of the wamphyri ehrig patiently insisted as doubtless the ferenczy had ordered him to insist you will have the sex of the host and you are that host you will also have your lust your great strength and cunning all of your passions but magnified many times over picture yourself pitting your wits against your enemies or boundlessly strong in battle or utterly untiring in bed my emotions raged within me ah but could i be sure they were mine entirely mine but it will not be me emphasising each word i slammed my balled fist again and again into the stone wall until blood flowed freely from my riven knuckles but it will be you he repeated drawing near staring at my bloodied hand and licking his lips aye hot blood and all the vampire in you will heal that in a very little while but until then let me tend to it he took my hand and tried to lick the salt blood i hurled him away keep your vampires tongue to yourself i cried and with a sudden thrill of horror perhaps for the first time i began to truly understand what he had become and what i was becoming for i had seen that look of entirely unnatural lust on his face and i had suddenly remembered that once there were three of us i looked all around the dungeon into all of the corners and cobwebbed shadows and my changeling eyes penetrated even the darkest gloom looked everywhere and failed to discover what i sought then i turned back to ehrig he saw my expression began to back away from me ehrig i said following closing with him now tell me pray what has become of the poor mutilated body of vasily where pray is the corpse of our former colleague the slender ever aggressive vasily in a corner ehrig had tripped on something he stumbled fell amidst a small pile of bones flensed almost white human bones after long moments i found voice vasily ehrig nodded shrank back from me scuttling like a crab on the floor the ferenczy he he has not fed us he pleaded i let my head slump turned away in disgust ehrig scrambled to his feet carefully approached keep well away i warned him my voice low and filled with loathing why did you not break the bones for their marrow ah no said ehrig as if explaining to a child the ferenczy told me to leave vasilys bones for for the burrower in the earth that which took shape in old arvos and consumed him it will come for them when all is quiet when we are asleep sleep i barked turning on him you think ill sleep here with you in the same cell he turned away shoulders slumping ah you are the proud one thibor as i was proud it goes before a fall they say your time is still to come as for me i will not harm you even if i dared if my hunger was such that but i would not dare the ferenczy would cut me into small pieces and burn each one with fire that is his threat anyway i love you as a brother as you loved vasily i scowled at him where he gazed at me over his hunched shoulder he had no answer leave me in peace i growled then i have much to think about i went to one corner ehrig to another there we sat in silence hours passed finally i did sleep in my dreams for the most part unremembered perhaps mercifully i seemed to hear strange slitherings and sucking sounds also a period of brittle crunching when i awakened vasilys bones had disappeared chapter nine the voice of the extinct vampire faded in harry keoghs incorporeal mind for long moments nothing further was said and they were empty seconds which harry couldnt really afford at any moment he could find himself recalled by his infant son back through the maze of the mцbius continuum to the garret flat in hartlepool but if harrys time was important so too was the rest of mankinds i begin to feel sorry for you thibor he said his lifeforce burning blue as a neon firefly in the dark glade under the trees i can see how you fought against it how you did not want to become what you eventually became eventually the old thing in the ground spoke up at last no eventually about it harry i had become from the moment faethors seed embraced my body my brain i was doomed for from that moment it was growing in me and growing quickly first its effect became apparent in my emotions my passions i say apparent but scarcely so to me can you feel your body healing after a cut or a blow are you aware of your hair or fingernails growing does a man who gradually becomes insane know that he is going mad suddenly as the voice of the vampire faded again there came a rising babble in harrys mind a cry of frustration of fury he had expected it sooner or later for he knew that thibor ferenczy was not alone here in the dark cruciform hills and now a new voice formed words in the necroscopes consciousness a voice he recognised of old you old liar you old devil cried the inflamed spark the enraged spirit of boris dragosani ah and how is this for irony not enough that i am dead but to have for companion in my grave that one creature i loathed above all others and worse to know that my greatest enemy in life the man who killed me is now the only living man who can ever reach me in death ha ha and to be here knowing once more the voices of these two the one demanding the other wheedling beguiling seeking to lie as always and knowing the futility of it all but yet yearning burning to be involved oh god if ever there were a god wont somebody speak to meeeee pay no attention said thibor at once he raves for as you well know harry since you were instrumental when he killed me he killed himself the thought is enough to unhinge anyone and poor boris was halfmad to begin with i was made mad dragosani howled by a filthy lying loathsome leech of a thing in the ground do you know what he did to me harry keogh i know of several things he did to you harry answered mental and physical torture seems an unending activity for creatures of your sort alive or dead or undead you are right harry a third voice from beyond the grave now spoke up it was a soft whispering voice but not without a certain sinister inflection they are cruel beyond words and none of them is to be trusted i assisted dragosani i was his friend it was my finger which triggered the bolt that struck thibor through the heart and pinned him there halfin halfout of his grave why i was the one who handed dragosani the scythe to cut off the monsters head and how did he pay me eh ah dragosani how can you talk of lies and treachery and loathsomeness when you yourself you were a monster dragosani silenced max batus accusations with one of his own my excuse is simple i had thibors vampire seed in me but what of you max what a man so evil he could kill with a glance batu a mongol esper who in life had held the secret of the evil eye was outraged now hear this great liar this thief he hissed sibilantly he slit my throat drained my blood despoiled my corpse and tore from it my secret he took my power for his own to kill as i killed hah little good it did him now we share the same gloomy hillside aye thibor dragosani and myself and all three of us shunned by the teeming dead listen to me all of you said harry before they could start again so youve all suffered injustices eh well maybe you have but none so great as those youve worked how many men did you kill with your evil eye max stopping them dead in their tracks and crumpling their hearts like paper and were they all bad men did they deserve to die as horribly as that no for one at least was my friend as good a man as you could ever wish to meet the head of your british ebranch batu was quick off the mark but dragosani ordered me to kill him it was our mission dragosani railed dont play the innocent here mongol youd killed others before him he also ordered ladislau giresci killed said batu one of his own countrymen and entirely innocent ah but giresci knew dragosanis secret that he was a vampire he was a danger to to the state dragosani blustered i worked only for mother russia and you worked only for yourself harry stopped him the truth is you desired to be a power in the land no in the whole world lie if you must dragosani for its a trait of vampires after all but not to yourself ive spoken to gregor borowitz remember and did he too die for mother russia the head of your own ebranch there you have it dragosani said thibor his voice a dark chuckle caught on your own barbs dont crow thibor harrys voice was lower still you were as bad and probably worse than both of them i why i have or i had lain here in the earth for five hundred years what harm can a poor thing in the ground do alone with the worms in the cold hard earth and what of the five hundred years before that said harry you know as well as i that wallachia trembled to your tread for centuries the earth itself is soaked black with the blood you spilled and dont lay it all at faethor ferenczys feet hes not entirely to blame he knew what you were else he wouldnt have chosen you and is that why youve come thibor asked after a moment to harangue and accuse and denounce no i came to learn said harry now look i cant lie as well as you do i was never much of a liar at the best of times so im sure youd see through me if i tried any sort of subterfuge thats why ill come straight out with it well then said dragosani out with it if you will harry ignored him was silent for a few seconds thibor he said at last a moment ago you asked what harm youd done buried here these last five hundred years i can tell you what harm he did dragosani would not be ignored only look at me i was an innocent child and he taught me the arts of necromancy later as a youth he beguiled me with his hypnotism and his lies as a man he put his vampire egg in me and when it had matured he your history concerns me not at all harry stopped him neither that nor any calumny of charges you bring against thibor or anyone else calumny dragosani was furious be quiet harrys patience had broken be quiet now or i leave you at once immediately to wait out all the ages in your loneliness all three of you there was a sullen silence very well said harry now as i was saying im not greatly concerned with thibors crimes or supposed crimes against you boris dragosani no but i am concerned to know about what he did to another i refer to a woman georgina bodescu who came here with her husband one winter there was an accident and the man died he died here on this very spot she was pregnant and fainted at the sight of his blood and afterwards ah said thibor his interest quickening but ive already told you that story are you telling me now that are you saying it took effect beware harry keogh dragosani interrupted tell him no more i heard the tale too when the old liar told it to you if that unborn child as was is now a man hell be in thrall to thibor aye even though his masters dead cant you see this devil would see himself alive again in the body and mind of this new disciple you dog thibor howled you are wamphyri does that mean nothing to you we may fight among ourselves but we do not divulge our secrets to others you are damned for all time dragosani old fool im that already dragosani snarled very well then harry sighed i can see im wasting precious time that being the case ill bid you wait thibors voice was all burning anguish you cant tell me just so much and leave it at that thats inhuman hah harry snorted a trade then i shall finish my story and you shall tell me if the child was born and lives and how he lives agreed harry guessed hed said too much already which in itself might be as good a reason as any for going on there were now four principal things he must try to discover one the full range of a vampires powers two how exactly thibor might try to use yulian bodescu for dragosani seemed to think it was possible for thibor to resurrect himself in bodescu three the rest of thibors story concerning the occurrences a thousand years ago at the castle of faethor ferenczy so that he might know if anything of evil yet remained in that place and four how to kill a vampire but definitely as to the last harry had thought he knew that much eight months ago when hed waged war on the chвteau bronnitsy but looking back now he saw that dragosanis death had only come about through a fortunate combination of events for one thing dragosani had been blinded his eyes had been ruined by a reflected mindbolt when max batus stolen talent had rebounded on him from one of harrys zombies for of course harry had had his zombie tartars his shock troops for backup in that affray it had been one of them called up from the preserving peat whod hacked dragosanis head from his shoulders and another whod pinned his parasite vampire to his chest with a wooden stake when it deserted his shattered body harry couldnt have done all of these things maybe not any of them on his own in fact harrys only real ace had been his mastery of the mцbius continuum when hed been very nearly cut in half by machinegun fire hed fled his dying body and dragged dragosanis mind in there with him in the mцbius continuum hed hurled dragosani through a pasttime door which had led the necromancer back to thibor in his grave and there an earlier dragosani had lured up and killed thibor never dreaming that with the same stroke he had also determined his own fate as for harrys incorporeal mind hed gone forward found his sons lifethread and joined with it lay with it in the womb of brenda waiting to be born she had been his lover his wife and now in a way might even be considered his mother his second mother but what if he had left dragosanis mind in his corpse back at the chвteau how long would that broken body have stayed a corpse that was conjectural and harry wondered how had the surviving russian ebranch members dealt with what remained when all the fighting stopped what had they made of his zombies it must have seemed utter madness an absolute nightmare harry supposed that after he left the chвteau along the mobius way the tartars had fallen once more into quiescence perhaps by now alec kyle had the answers to these questions learned from felix krakovitch harry would find out eventually but for now there were fresh problems foremost among them how much dare he tell thibor about yulian bodescu very little he supposed but on the other hand by now the extinct vampire had probably guessed all of it for himself which made any continued secrecy pointless very well said harry finally we trade fool dragosani cut in at once i had given you some credit harry keogh i thought you were cleverer than that and yet here you are attempting to bargain with the devil himself i see now that i was unlucky in our little contest you are as big a fool as i was harry ignored him the rest of your story then thibor and quickly for i dont know how much time i have the first time the old ferenczy came i was not ready for him i was asleep but exhausted halfstarved its unlikely i could have done anything anyway the first i knew of his visit was when i heard the heavy oaken door slam and a bar was dropped into place outside four trussed chickens alive fullfeathered squawked and fluttered in a basket just inside the door as i roused myself and went to the door ehrig was a pace ahead of me i caught him by the shoulder threw him aside got to the basket first whats this faethor i cried chickens i thought we vampires supped on richer meat we sup on blood he called back chuckling a little beyond the door on coarse meat if and when we must but the blood is the true life the fowl are for you thibor tear out their throats and drink well squeeze them dry give the carcasses to ehrig if it please you and whats left goes to your cousin under the flags i heard him starting up stone steps called out faethor when do i take up my duties or perhaps youve changed your mind and deem it too dangerous to let me out his footsteps paused ill let you out when im ready his muffled voice came back and when you are ready he chuckled again but more deeply in his throat this time ready im ready for better treatment than this i told him you should have brought me a girl you can do more with a girl than just eat her for a moment there was silence then he said when you are your own master you may take what you like his voice was colder but i am not some mother cat to fetch fat mice for her kittens a girl a boy a goat blood is blood thibor as for lust youll have time for that later when you understand the real meaning of the word for now save your strength and then he moved on ehrig had meanwhile taken hold of the basket was sidling off with it i gave him a clut which knocked him protesting to the floor then i looked at the terrified birds and scowled but i was hungry and meat is meat i had never been a squeamish one and these birds were plump and anyway the vampire in me was taking the edge off all points of mannered custom and nicety and civilised behaviour as for civilisation what was that to me a wallach warrior i had always been twothirds barbarian i ate and so did the dog ehrig aye and later when next we slept so did my cousin the next time i came awake more strongly surging awake refreshed from my meal i saw the thing that mindless being of vampire flesh which hid in the dark earth under the floor i do not know what i had expected faethor had mentioned vines creepers in the earth that is what it was like partly anyway if you have seen a squashy octopus from the sea then you have seen something like the creature spawned of the finger which faethor shed fattened on the flesh of arvos the gypsy the one thing i cannot comment upon was its size however if a mans body were flattened to a doughy mass it would spread a long way the matter of arvos had been reshaped certainly the groping hands which the being put up were stretchy things there were also many of them and they were not lacking in strength its eyes were very strange they formed and unformed came and went they ogled and blinked but in all truth i cannot say that they saw indeed i had the feeling they were blind or perhaps they saw in the way a newborn infant sees without understanding when one of the things hands came up from the soil close to where i lay i cursed out loud and kicked it away and how it shot down out of sight then how well another might fare i could not say but the vampire thing was certainly wary of me perhaps it sensed that i was a higher form of itself i remember how at the time that was a very shuddersome thought faethor had this way with him he was devious sly as a fox slippery as an eel that was how i considered him feelings brought on by sheer frustration of course he was that way he was of the wamphyri i should not have expected him to be any other way but quite simply he would not be ambushed i spent hours waiting for him behind the oak door chains in my hands hardly daring to breathe lest he hear me but let hell freeze over he would not come ah but only let me fall asleep a squealing piglet would wake me or the fluttering of a tethered pigeon and so the days probably weeks passed i will give him his due after that first time the old devil didnt let me get too hungry i think to myself now that the initial period of starvation was to let the vampire in me take hold it had nothing else to feed on and so must rely on my stored fats must become more fully a part of me similarly i was obliged to draw on its strength but as soon as the bond was properly formed then faethor could begin to fatten us up again and i use that phrase advisedly along with the food there would be the occasional jug of red wine at first remembering how the ferenczy had drugged me i was careful i would let ehrig drink first then watch for his reaction but apart from a loosening of his tongue there was nothing and so i too drank later i would give ehrig none of the wine but consume it myself that too was exactly the way the old devil had planned it came the time when after a meal i was thirsty and quaffed a jug at one swig then staggered this way and that before collapsing poisoned again faethor had made a fool of me at every turn but this time my vampire strength buoyed me up i held fast to my consciousness and sprawling there in my fever i wondered now what is the purpose of this hah only listen and ill explain faethors purpose a girl a boy a goat blood is blood hed told me that time the blood is the life indeed but what he had not told me was this that of all pulses of delight of all founts of immortality of all nectarbearing flowers that one source from which a vampire would most prefer to sip is the throbbing red rush of another vampires blood and so when i had succumbed more fully to his wine then faethor came to me again two purposes are served here he told me crouching over me one it is long and long since i took from one of my own and a great thirst is on me two you are a hard one and will not submit to thraldom without a fight so be it this should take all of the sting out of you what what are you doing i croaked the question tried to will my leaden arms to rise up and fend him off it was useless i was weak as a kitten even my throat found the greatest difficulty simply forming words doing why i sit me down to my evening meal he answered gleefully and such a menu blood of a strong man spiced with the blood of the fledgling vampire within him you youll drink from from my throat i stared up at him aghast my vision swimming he merely smiled but a smile hideous as any i ever saw him make and tore my clothes then he put his terrible tapering hands on me and felt my flesh all over frowning a little as he searched for something he turned me on my side touched my spine pressed it again harder and said ah the very gobbet the prize itself i would have cringed away from him but could not inside i cringed perhaps that child of his within me cringed too but externally my skin merely shivered i tried to speak but that also had grown too difficult my lips only trembled and i made a moaning sound thibor the old devil said his voice level as if in polite conversation youve much to learn my son about me about yourself about the wamphyri you are not yet aware you fail to perceive all the mysteries i have bestowed upon you but what i am you shall be and the powers i possess they too shall be yours you have seen and learned a little now see and experience more he continued to balance me on my side but propped up my head a little so that i could see his face his magnetic eyes held me a fish speared on their pupils my blurred sight cleared the picture sharpened i saw more clearly than ever before my body and limbs might well be made of lead but my mind was sharp as a knife my awareness so keen that i could almost feel the change taking place in the creature who leaned over me faethor had somehow for some reason heightened my perceptions increased my sensitivity now watch he hissed observe the skin of faethors face largepored and grainy at best underwent a swift metamorphosis watching it i thought i have never known what he looks like and even now i wont know he is how he wants me to see him the pores of his face opened up more yet pockmarks cratering his flesh his jaws enormous already elongated with a sound like gradually tearing cloth and his leathery lips rolled back until his mouth was all bulging crimson gums and jagged dripping teeth i had seen faethors teeth before but never displayed like this nor was the metamorphosis complete it was all in the jaws in the teeth in the nightmarish then for a long time i knew no more for which as you might suppose i was not unthankful at first when i regained consciousness i thought that i was alone but then i heard ehrig whimpering in a shadowed corner heard him and remembered i remembered the comradeship wed shared all the bloody battles wed been through together remembered how he had been my true friend who would gladly lay down his life for me and i mine for him perhaps he remembered too and that was why be whimpered i did not know i only knew that when the ferenczy had fastened his teeth in my spine ehrig was nowhere to be seen to say that i beat him would not do his punishment justice but without faethors vampire stuff in him he would certainly have died it could be that i consciously tried to kill him i cant say about that either for the episode is no longer clear in my mind i only know that when i was done with him he no longer felt my blows and that i myself was completely exhausted but he healed of course and so did i and i conceived a new strategy after that there were times of sleeping of waking of eating outwardly life consisted of little more but for me these were also times of waiting and of patient silent scheming as for the ferenczy he tried to train me like a wild dog it started like this he would come silently to the door and listen strangely i knew when he was there i would feel fear and when i became afraid then he would be there at times i could feel him groping at the edges of my mind slyly attempting to insinuate himself into my very thoughts i remembered how he had communicated with old arvos over a distance and did what i could to close my mind to him i think i succeeded greatly for after that i could sense a frustration other than my own he used a system of rewards if i was good and obeyed him there would be food he would call through the door thibor i have a pair of fine piglets here if i answered aha your parents have come visiting he would simply take the food away but if i said faethor my father i am starving feed me pray for if not then i shall be obliged to eat this dog youve locked in with me down here and who will serve me then when you are out in the world and i am left in charge of your lands and castle then he would open the door a crack and place the food inside but only let me stand too close to the door and i would see neither faethor nor food for three or four days and so i weakened i grew less and less abusive i began to plead for food for the freedom of the castle for fresh air and light and water to bathe myself but most of all for separation however brief from ehrig whom i now detested as a man detests his own wastes moreover i made out that i was growing physically weaker i spent more time asleep and came less readily awake finally came the time when ehrig could not wake me and how the dog battered on the door and screamed for his true master then faethor came they carried me up up to the battlements above the covered hail where it spanned the gorge there they laid me down in the clean air under the first stars of night pale spectres in a sky i had not seen for far too long the sun was a dull blister on the hills casting its last rays over the spires of rock behind the castles towers he is likely starved for air said faethor and maybe simply starved a little too but you are right ehrig he seems weaker than he should be i desired only to break his will a little not the man himself i have powders and salts that sting which should stir him up wait here and ill fetch them and watch him he descended through a trapdoor out of sight leaving ehrig to hunch down to his vigil all of this i saw through eyes threequarters shuttered but the moment ehrig allowed his attention to wander i was on him in a trice closing off his windpipe with one hand i snatched from my pocket a leather thong which id earlier removed from my boot i had intended it for the ferenczys neck but no matter wrapping my legs round ehrig to stop him kicking i looped the thong round his neck and yanked it tight then made a second loop and tied it off choking he tried to lurch to his feet but i slammed his head so hard against the stone parapet that i felt his skull shatter he went limp and i lowered him to the timbered floor at that moment my back was to the trapdoor and of course that was when the ferenczy chose to return hissing his fury he came leaping up light as a youth but his hands were iron on me where he took hold of my hair and grasped the flesh between my neck and shoulder ah but strong though he was old faethor was out of practice and my own fighting skills were as fresh in my mind as my last battle with the pechenegi i kneed him in the groin and drove my head up under his great jaw so hard that i heard his teeth crunching he released me fell to the planking where i leaped astride him but as his fury waxed so waxed his strength calling on the vampire within he tossed me aside as easily as a bale of straw and in a moment he was on his feet spitting shattered teeth blood and curses as he came gliding after me i knew then that i couldnt beat him not unarmed and i cast all about in the eerie twilight for a weapon and found several suspended from the high rear battlements a row of circular bronze mirrors hung at different angles two or three of them just catching the last faint rays of sunlight and reflecting them away down the valley the ferenczys signalling devices arvos the gypsy had said that the old ferengi didnt have much use for mirrors or for sunlight i wasnt exactly sure what hed meant but i seemed to remember something of the sort from old campfire legends in any case i didnt have a lot of choice if faethor was vulnerable then there was only one sure way to find out before he could close with me and avoiding places where the timbers seemed suspect i ran across the roof he came after me like a great loping wolf but pulled up short when i tore down a mirror from its fastenings and turned to face him his yellow eyes went very wide and he bared bloodied teeth at me like rows of shattered spires he hissed and his forked tongue flickered like crimson lightning between his jaws i held the mirror in my hands and knew at once what it was a sturdy bronze shield possibly old varyagi it had a grip at the back for my hand aye and i knew how to use it but if only it were spiked in the centre of its face then unwitting the burnished bronze caught a stray ray from the scythe of sun setting on the hills caught it and hurled it straight into faethors snarling visage and now i knew old arvoss meaning the vampire cringed before that blaze of sunlight he shrank down into himself threw up spider hands before his face backed off a pace i was never one to waste an opportunity i pursued drove the buckler clanging into his face kicked at his loins again and again as i forced him back and whenever hed make to advance on me then id catch the sun and throw it in his teeth so that he had no chance to gather his reserves in this way i beat him back across the roof with kicks and blows and blinding rays of sunlight once his leg went through the rotten roof but he dragged it out and continued to retreat before me frothing and cursing his fury and so at last he came up against the parapet wall beyond that parapet was eighty feet of thin air then the rim of the gorge and three hundred feet of almost sheer slope clad in closepacked spiky pines down at the bottom was the bed of a rivulet in short a nightmare of vertigo he looked over the rim glanced at me with eyes of fire eyes of fear at which precise moment the sun dipped down out of sight the change in faethor was instantaneous the twilight deepened and the ferenczy swelled up like some great bloating toadstool his face split open in the most soulwrenching smile of triumph which i at once crushed under one last battering blow of my buckler and over he went i couldnt believe that id got him it seemed a fantasy but even as he toppled so i clung to the parapet wall and peered after him then the strangest thing i saw him like a dark blot falling towards the greater darkness but in another moment the shape of the blot changed i thought i heard a sound like a vast stretching like giant knuckles cracking and the shape hurtling towards the trees and the gorge seemed to unfurl like a huge blanket it no longer fell so swiftly nor even vertically instead it seemed to glide like a leaf away from the castles walls out a little way over the gorge it dawned on me then that in the fullness of his powers faethor might indeed have flown in a fashion from these battlements but i had taken him by surprise and in the shock of falling he had lost precious moments too late hed wrought a great change in himself flattening himself like a sail to trap the rushing air too late because even as i stared in fascination so he struck a high branch then in a dark whirling and a snapping of branches the blot was gone there followed from below a series of crashes a shriek a final distant thud and silence i listened for long moments in the rapidly deepening gloom nothing and then i laughed oh how i laughed i stamped my feet and thumped the top of the parapet wall id got the old bastard the old devil id really got him i stopped laughing true i had thrown him down from the wall but was he dead panic gripped me of all men i knew how difficult it was to kill a vampire proof of that was right here on the roof with me in the shape of the gurgling fitfully twitching ehrig i hurried to him his face was blue and the thong had buried itself in the flesh of his neck his skull which had been soft at the back where id crashed it against the wall was already hard how long before he awakened in any case i couldnt trust him not to do what must now be done no i was on my own quickly i carried ehrig back down into the bowels of the castle to our cell in the roots of one of the towers there i dumped him and barred the door perhaps the vampire filth under the earth would find him and devour him before he recovered fully i didnt know and cared much less then i hurried through the castle lighting lamps and candles wherever i found them illuminating the place as it had not been lit in a hundred years perhaps it had never known such light as i now brought into being in it there were two entrances one was across the drawbridge and through the door id used when first i arrived here escorted by faethors wolves which i now barred the other was from a narrow ledge in the cliff at the rear where a roofed over causeway of doubtful timbers formed a bridge from the ledge to a window in the wall of the second tower doubtless this had been the ferenczys bolthole which hed never had cause to use but if he could get out that way so could he get in i found oil drenched the planking set fire to the causeway and stayed long enough to ensure that it was well ablaze i paused periodically at other embrasures to gaze out on the night at first there were only the moon and stars stray wisps of cloud the valley silvered touched occasionally by fleeting shadows but as i proceeded with my task of lighting and securing the castle so i was aware that things were beginning to stir a wolf howled mournfully afar then closer then many wolves the trees in the gorge were inky now ominous as the gates to the underworld in the first tower i found a barred bolted room a treasure house maybe i threw back the bolts lifted the bar put my shoulder to the door but the key had been turned in the great lock and removed i leaned my ear to the oak panels and listened there was sly movement in there and whispering perhaps it was as well the door was locked perhaps it had been locked not to keep thieves out but something else i climbed to the hall where faethor had poisoned me and there found my weapons where i had last seen them more i took down from the wall a mighty longhandled axe then armed to the teeth i returned to the locked room there i loaded my crossbow and placed it close to hand stuck my sword pointdown in a crack in the floor ready for grasping and took both hands to the axe in a huge swing at the door i succeeded with that blow in caving in a narrow panel but at the same time i dislodged from its hiding place atop the lintel a rusty iron key the key fitted the lock i was on the point of turning it to enter when such a clamouring from the wolves so loud i could hear its doomful dinning even down here something was afoot i left the door unopened took up my weapons and raced up winding stairs to the upper levels wolves howled all around the castle now but they were loudest at the rear in a very little while i traced the uproar to the burning causeway and arrived in time to see the bridge go crashing down blazing into the back chasm and there across the gap were faethors wolves in a pack crowding the narrow ledge behind them in the shadow of the cliff was that the ferenczy himself the hairs on my neck stood erect if it was him he stood crookedly like a queer bent shadow broken from his fall i took up my crossbow but when i looked again gone or perhaps hed never been there the wolves were real enough however and now the leader a giant of a beast stood at the rim measuring the gap it would be a leap of all of thirty feet possible only if he had a clear run along the ledge and even as i thought it so the lesser wolves made way shrank back into shadows left the ledge clear he ran back turned made his loping run and leaped and midflight met my bolt which sank directly into his heart dead but still snarling his last snarl he hit the rim of the opening and went tumbling into oblivion and when i looked up the rest of the pack had melted away but i knew that the ferenczy would not give up that easily i went up onto the battlements found jars up there full of oil and cauldrons seated on tilting gear setting fires in braziers under the cauldrons i halffilled each one with oil and left them to simmer and only then did i return to the locked room as approached a hand slender female wriggled in the hole in the panelling tried desperately to reach and take hold of the key in the lock what a prisoner a woman but then i remembered what old arvos had said about the ferenczys household retainers serfs he has none a woman or two perhaps but no men here was a seeming contradiction if this woman was his servant why was she locked in for her safety while there was a stranger in the house that seemed unlikely in a house like this for my safety an eye peered out at me i heard a gasp and the hand was withdrawn without further pause i turned the key kicked open the door there were two of em aye and theyd been handsome enough women in their time who who are you one of them approached me with a curious halfsmile faethor did not tell us that there would be she floated closer gazed upon me in open fascination i stared back she was wan as a ghost but there was a fire in her sunken eyes i looked about the room the floor had a covering of local weave ancient and wormy tapestries hung on the walls there were couches and a table but there were no windows and no light other than the yellow aura from a silver candelabrum on the table the room was sparse but sumptuous by comparison with the rest of the place safe too the second woman was sprawled somewhat wantonly on one of the couches she stared sulphurously upon me but i ignored her the first drifted closer still stirring myself i held her at bay with the point of my sword move not at all lady or ill spit you here and now she turned wild in a moment glowered at me and hissed between her needle teeth and now the second woman rose like a cat from her couch they faced me menacingly but both were wary of my sword then the first one spoke again her voice hard and cold as ice what of faethor where is he your master i backed out of the door they were vampires obviously hes gone youve a new master now me without warning the first one sprang at me i let her come then drove the pommel of my sword against the side of her head she collapsed in my arms and i threw her aside then yanked shut the door in the face of the second i barred it locked it and pocketed the key inside the room the trapped vampire hissed and raged i picked up her stunned sister carried her to the dungeon and tossed her inside ehrig came crawling he had managed somehow to remove the thong from his neckwhich was white and puffy and looked sliced as if by a knife around its entire circumference similarly his head at the back was strangely lumpy deformed like a freaks or a cretins he could hardly speak and his manner was childlike in the way of simpletons perhaps i had damaged his brain and the vampire in him had not yet corrected it thibor he husked his amazement my friend thibor the ferenczy did you kill him treacherous dog i kicked at him here amuse yourself with this he fell upon the woman where she lay moaning youve forgiven me he cried not now not ever i answered i leave her here because shes one too many enjoy yourself while you may as i barred the door he had already begun to rip his filthy clothes off hers too now climbing the spiralling steps i heard the wolves again their song had a triumphant note to it what now like a madman i raced through the castle the massive door in the foot of the tower was secure and the causeway burned down where would faethor attempt his next assault i went to the battlements only just in time the air over the castle was full of tiny bats i saw them against the moon flitting in their myriads their concerted voices shrill and piercing was that how the ferenczy would come flitting like a great bat a stretchy blanket of flesh falling out of the night to smother me i shrank down gazed fearfully up into the vault of the night sky but no surely not his fall had injured him and he would not yet be ready to tax himself so greatly there must be some other route with which i was not familiar ignoring the bats which came down at me in waves but not so close as to strike or interfere with me i went to the perimeter wall and looked over why i did this i cant say for it would take more than any mere man to climb walls as sheer as these fool that i was the ferenczy was no mere man and there he was flat to the wall making his way agonisingly slowly like a great lizard up the stonework a lizard aye for his hands and feet were huge as banquet platters and sucked where they slapped the walls horrified to my roots i stared harder in the dark he had not yet seen me he grunted quietly and his huge disc of a hand made a quagmire sound where it left the wall and groped upward his fingers were long as daggers and webbed between hands like that would pull a mans flesh from his bones as if they were plucking a chicken i looked wildly about the bubbling cauldrons of oil were positioned at the ends of the span where the great hall joined the towers rightly so for who would suppose that a man could crawl under the flying buttresses and come up that way with nothing but the gorge and certain death beneath him i flew to the closest cauldron laid my hands on its rim agony the metal was hot as hell i took my sword belt and passed it through the metal framework of the tilting engine then dragged device and cauldron and all back the way i had come oil splashed and drenched my boot one foot of the tilting bench went through a rotten plank and i must pause to free it the entire contraption jerked and shuddered through friction with the planking so that i knew faethor must hear me and guess what i was about but finally i had the cauldron above the spot where i had seen him i glanced fearfully over the parapet and a great groping sucker hand came up over the rim missed my face by inches slapped down and gripped the coping of the wall how i gibbered then i threw myself on to the tilting device turned the handle furiously and saw the cauldron bearing over towards the wall oil spilled and ran down the cauldrons side it met the hot brazier and caught fire my boot went up in flames the ferenczys face came up over the rim of the parapet his eyes reflected the leaping flames his teeth whole again were gleaming white slivers of bone in his gaping jaws with that flickering abomination of a tongue slithering over them shrieking i worked at the handle the cauldron tilted slopped a sea of blazing oil towards him no he croaked his voice a broken bell no no noooooo the blue and yellow fire paid him no heed ignored his cry of terror it washed over him lit him like a torch he wrenched his hands from the wall and reached for me but i fell back out of harms way then he screamed again and launched himself from the wall into space i watched the fireball curving down into darkness and turning it day bright and all the while the ferenczys scream echoed back up to me his myriad minion bats flocked to him midflight dashing their soft bodies against him to quell the flames but the rush of air thwarted them a torch he fell and his scream was a rusty blade on the ends of my nerves even blazing he tried to form a wing shape and i heard again that rending and crackling sound ah what sweet agony that must have caused him with his crisp skin splitting instead of stretching and the burning oil getting into the cracks even so he halfsucceeded began to glide as before and as before struck a tree and so went spinning and crashing through the pines and out of sight he left a few sparks and scraps of fire drifting on the air and a host of scorched bats skittering crippled against the moon and a lingering odour of roasted flesh and that was all still i wasnt satisfied that he was dead but i was satisfied that he wouldnt be back that night it was now time to celebrate my triumph i doused the fire where it had taken hold of dry timbers shut down the burning braziers and went wearily to faethors living quarters there was good wine there which i sipped warily then gulped heartily i spitted pheasants sliced an onion nibbled on dry bread and swilled wine until the birds were done and then i dined royally it was a good meal aye and my first in a long time and yet it lacked something i couldnt say just what fool i still thought of myself as a man in other ways however i still was a man i took a stone jar of proven wine with me and went unsteadily to the lady in the locked room she did desire to receive me but i was in no mood for arguments i took her again and again in as many ways as entered my head so i entered her only when she was exhausted and slept did i too sleep and so the castle of faethor ferenczy became mine chapter ten harry keoghs nimbus of blue fire burned bright in the stirless glade over thibors tumbled mausoleum and keoghs incorporeal mind was aware of the passage of time in the mцbius continuum time was a very nearly meaningless concept but here in the first low foothills of the carpatii meridionali it was very real and still the dead vampires tale was not completely told the important part for harry and for alec kyle and intesp was still to come but harry knew better than to ask directly for the information he desired he could only press thibor to the bitter end go on he urged when the vampires pause threatened to stretch indefinitely what go on thibor seemed mildly surprised but what more is there my tale is told still id like to hear the rest of it did you stay in the castle as faethor had commanded or did you return to kiev you ended your days in wallachia right here in these cruciform hills how did that come about thibor sighed surely it is now time for you to tell me certain things we made a bargain harry i warned you harry keogh the spirit of boris dragosani joined in sharper than that of thibor never bargain with a vampire for theres always the devil to pay dragosani was right harry knew hed heard of thibors cunning from the very horses mouth it had taken no small amount of guile to defeat faethor ferenczy a deal is a deal he said when thibor has delivered so shall i now come on thibor lets have the rest of the story so be it he said this is how it was something brought me awake i thought i heard the rending of timber my mind and body were dull from the nights excesses all of the nights excesses of which faethor had only been the first but nevertheless i stirred myself up i lay naked on the ladys couch smiling strangely she approached from the direction of the locked door her hands clasped behind her back my dull mind saw nothing to fear if she had sought to escape she could easily have taken the key from my clothes but as i made to sit up her expression changed became charged with hatred and lust not the human lust of last night but the inhuman lust of the vampire her hands came into view and clasped in one of them was a splinter of oak ripped from the shattered door panel a sharp knife of hardwood youll put no stake through my heart lady i told her knocking the splinter from her hand and sending her flying while she hissed and snarled at me from a corner i dressed went out and locked the door behind me i must be more careful in future she could easily have slipped away and unbarred the castles door for faethor if he still lived obviously shed been more intent on putting an end to me than on seeing to his wellbeing her master he may have been but that wasnt to say shed relished it i checked the castles security all stood as before i looked in on ehrig and the other woman at first i thought they were fighting but they were not then i went up onto the battlements a weak sun peered through dark drifting clouds heavy with rain i thought the sun frowned on me certainly i did not enjoy the sensation of its feeble rays on my naked arms and neck and in a very little while i was glad to return indoors and now i found myself with time on my hands which i put to use exploring the castle more fully than before i searched for loot and found it some gold very ancient in plate and goblets a pouch of gems a small chest of rings necklaces bangles and such in precious metals enough to keep me in style for an entire lifetime a normal lifetime anyway as for the rest empty rooms rotten hangings and wormy furniture a general air of gloom and decay it was oppressive and i determined to be on my way as soon as possible but first i would like to be sure that the ferenczy was not lying in wait in the evening i dined and drowsed in front of a fire in faethors quarters but as night drew on it brought thoughts to disturb and niggle in the back of my mind disquieting ideas which would not surface the wolves were aprowl again but their howling seemed dismal distant there were no bats the fire lulled me thibor my son said a voice be on your guard i started awake leaped to my feet snatched up my sword oh ha ha ha that same voice laughed but no one was there who is it i cried knowing who it was come out faethor for i know youre here you know nothing go to the window i stared wildly all about the room was full of shadows leaping in the fires flicker but plainly i was alone then it came to me that while i had heard the ferenczys voice i had not heard it it had been like a thought in my head but not my thought go to the window fool the voice came again and again i started shaken i went to the window tore aside the hangings outside the stars were coming out a moon was rising and the eerie crying of wolves floated down from distant peaks look said the voice look my head turned as if directed by some others will i looked up away to the ultimate range a black silhouette against the sunken suns fast fading glow up there a far weary distance something glinted caught the rays of the sun aimed them at me blinded by that effulgence i threw up an arm and staggered back ah ah see how it hurts thibor a taste of your own medicine the sun which once was your friend but no more it didnt hurt i shouted at no one stepping to the window again and shaking my fist at the mountains it merely startled me is that really you faethor who else did you think me dead i willed you dead then you are weak willed who travels with you i asked surrendering to the strangeness of it not your women for i have them who signals with your mirrors now faethor it isnt you who casts the sun about the mirror flashed at me again but i stepped aside my own go where i go came his voice in answer they carry my scorched and blackened body until it is whole again you have won this round thibor but the battle is undecided old bastard you were lucky i boasted youll not be so fortunate next time now listen he ignored my bluster you have incurred my wrath you will be punished the degree of punishment is up to you stay and guard my lands and castle and all that is mine while im gone and i may be merciful desert me and what and you shall know hells torment for eternity this i faethor ferenczy swear faethor im my own man even if it were in me to serve i could never call you master you must know that for i did my best to destroy you thibor you do not yet understand but i have given you many things great powers ah but ive also given you several great weaknesses common men when they die lie in peace most of them that last was some sort of threat and i knew it it was in his voice a doom delivered in a whisper what do you mean i asked only defy me and you shall find out i have sworn and for now farewell and he was gone the mirror twinkled once more like a brilliant star on the far ridge and then it too was gone i had had enough of vampires male and female i locked my bedmate of last night in the dungeon with her sister ehrig and the burrowing thing and slept in a chair in front of the fire in faethors apartments come daybreak and there was nothing to hold up my departure except yes there were certain things i must do before leaving the ferenczy had made threats and i was never one to suffer threats lightly i went out of the castle shot two fat rabbits with my crossbow and took them down to the dungeon i showed them to ehrig told him what i wanted and that he must help me together we tightly bound and gagged the women dumping them in one corner of the dungeon then though he protested loudly i also bound and gagged ehrig and put him with the women finally i cut open the rabbits and threw their crimson carcasses down on the black soil where the flags were torn up then it was a matter of waiting but not for long in a little while a tentacle of leprous flesh came to explore the source of the fresh blood came groping up through the crumbly soil pushing it aside and in a trice i took what i wanted i left ehrig and the women tied up barred the door on them and went up into the base of the tower above the dungeon the steps wound about a central stone pillar i broke up furniture piled the pieces around this pillar i scavenged through the castle breaking furniture wherever i found it and sharing the wood between the towers then i poured oil on all the timbers of the battlements in the hall and rooms where they spanned the gorge down all the stairwells at last i was done and the work had taken me halfway through the morning i left the castle with my loot walked out a little way from it and looked at it again one last time then returned and set a fire in the open door and on the drawbridge and never looking back i started out to retrace my steps to moupho aide ferenc yaborov at midday i met my five remaining wallachs come to find me they saw me coming down the cliffhugging path and waited for me in the stony depression at its base hallo thibor the senior man greeted me when i joined them he looked beyond me ehrig and vasily they are not with you they are dead i jerked my head towards the peaks back there they looked saw the column of white smoke reaching like some strange mushroom into the sky the house of the ferenczy i told them which i have burned then i looked at them more sternly why did you wait so long before coming to look for me how long has it been five six weeks those damned gypsies the szgany their spokesman growled when we awoke the morning after the three of you left the village was all but deserted only women and children left we tried to find out what was happening no one seemed to know or they werent saying we waited two days then set out after you but the missing szgany menfolk were waiting along the way five of us and more than fifty of them they blocked the way and they had the advantage of good positions in the rocks he shrugged uncomfortably tried not to look embarrassed thibor wed have been of use to no one dead i nodded spoke quietly and yet now you have come because they are gone he shrugged again when they stopped us we went back down to their socalled village yesterday morning the women and kids started to drift off in ones and twos small parties here and there they wouldnt speak and looked miserable as sin as if they were in mourning or something at sunup today the place was empty except for one old grandad chief a prince he calls himself his crone and a couple of grandchildren he wasnt saying anything and anyway he looks half simple so i came up the trail alone sticking close to cover and discovered that all the men had gone too then i called up these lads to come and look for you truth to tell wed long thought you were a goner i might well have been i answered but im not here i tossed him a small leather sack carry this and you i gave my loot to another you burden yourself with this its heavy and ive carried it far enough as for the job we came to do its done tonight we stay in the village tomorrow its back to kiev to see a lying cheating scheming prince vladimir svyatoslavich ugh the spokesman held out his sack at arms length theres a creature in here it moves i chuckled darkly aye handle it carefully and tonight put it in a box sack and all but dont sleep with it next to you then we went down to the village on the way down i heard them talking among themselves mainly of the trouble the szgany had given them they mentioned putting the village to the torch i wouldnt hear of it no i said the szgany are loyal in their way loyal to their own anyway theyve moved on gone for good what profit in burning an empty village and so they said no more about it that evening i went to the ancient szgany prince in his hut and called him out he came out into the coolness of the clearing and saluted me i stepped close to him and he looked hard at me and i heard him gasp old chief i said my men said burn this place but i stopped them ive no quarrel with you or the szgany he was brown and wrinkled as a log toothless hunched his dark eyes were all aslant and seemed not to see too clearly but i was sure they saw me he touched me with a hand that trembled gripped my arm hard above the elbow wallach he inquired that i am and ill return there soon i answered he nodded said ferengi you it was not a question thibors my name i told him and on impulse thibor ferenczy aye again he nodded you wamphyri i began to shake my head in denial then stopped his eyes were boring into mine he knew and so did i for certain now yes i said wamphyri he drew breath sharply let it out slow then where will you go thibor the wallach son of old one tomorrow i go to kiev i answered grimly ive business there after that home business he laughed a cackling laugh ah business he released my arm grew serious i too go wallachia many szgany there you need szgany i find you there good i said he backed away turned and went back into his hut we came out of the forest into kiev in the evening and i found a place on the outskirts to rest and buy a skin of wine i sent four of my five into the city soon they began return bringing with them prominent members of my peasant army what was left of it half had been lured away by vladimir and were off campaigning against the iechenegi the rest remained faithful then had gone into hiding and waited for me there were only a handful of the vlads soldiers in the city even the palace guard were away fighting the prince tad only a score of men his personal bodyguard at court that was part of the news and this was the rest that tonight there was to be a small banquet at the palace in honour of some bootlicking boyar i invited myself along i arrived at the palace alone or that is the way it must have appeared i strode through the gardens to the sound of laughter and merrymaking from the great hail men at arms barred my way and i paused and looked at them who goes there a guardsmaster challenged me i showed myself thibor of wallachia the princes voevod he sent me on a mission and now i am returned along the way i had walked in mire deliberately the last time i was here the vlad had commanded that i come in my finery unweaponed all bathed and shining now i was weighed down with arms i was unshaven dirty and my forelocks all awry i stank worse than a peasant and was glad of it youd go in there like that the guardsmaster was astonished he wrinkled his nose man wash yourself put on fresh robes cast off your weapons i glowered at him your name what he stepped a pace to the rear for the prince hell have the balls of any man who impedes me this night and if youve none of those hell have your head instead dont you remember me last time i came it was to a church and i brought a sack of thumbs i showed him my leather sack he went pale i remember now i ill announce you wait here i grabbed his arm dragged him close i showed him my teeth in a wolfs grin and hissed through them no you wait here a dozen of my men stepped out of the trees held cautionary fingers to their lips and bundled the guardsmaster and his men away i went on entering the palace and the great hall unimpeded oh true a pair of royal bullyboy bodyguards closed on me at the door but i thrust them aside so hard they almost fell and by the time they were organised i was among the revellers i strode to the centre of the floor i stood stock still then slowly turned and gazed all about from under lowered brows the noise subsided there came an uneasy silence somewhere a lady laughed a titter which was quickly stilled then the crowd fell away from me several ladies looked fit to faint i smelled of ordure which to my nostrils was fresh and clean compared to the scents of this court the crowd parted and there sat the prince at a table laden with food and drink his face wore a frozen smile which fell from it like a leaden mask when he saw me and at last he recognised me he straightened to his feet you none other my prince i bowed then stood straight he couldnt speak slowly his face went purple finally he said is this your idea of a joke get out out he pointed a trembling finger at the door men were closing on me hands on their sword hilts i rushed the vlads table sprang up onto it drew my sword and held it on his breast tell them to come no closer i snarled he held up his hands and his bodyguard fell back i kicked aside platters and goblets and made a space before him throwing down my sack are your greek christian priests here he nodded beckoned in their priestly robes they came hands fluttering jabbering in their foreign tongue four of them at last it got through to the prince that he was in danger of his life he glanced at my swords point lying lightly on his breast looked at me gritted his teeth and sat down my sword followed him pale now he controlled himself gulped and said thibor what is all of this would you stand accused of treason now put up your sword and well talk my sword stays where it is and weve time only for what i have to say i told him but now listen prince of kiev you sent me on a hopeless quest and you know it what me and my seven against faethor ferenczy and his szgany what a joke but while i was away you could steal my good men and if i were so lucky as to succeed that would be even better if i tailed and you believed i would it would be no great loss i glared at him it was treachery but he said again his lips trembling but here i am alive and well and if i leaned a little on my sword and killed you it would be my right not according to your laws but according to mine ah dont panic i wont kill you let it suffice that all gathered here know your treachery as for my mission do you remember what you commanded me to do you said fetch me the ferenczys head his heart and his standard well at this very moment his standard flies atop the palace wall his and mine for ive taken it for my own as for his head and heart ive done better ive brought you the very essence of the ferenczy prince vladimirs eyes went to the sack before him and his mouth twitched at one corner open it i told him tip it out and you priests come closer see what ive brought you among the thronging courtiers and guests i spied grimfaced men edging closer this couldnt last much longer close by a higharched window looked out on a balcony and the gardens beyond vladimirs hands trembled towards the sack open it i snapped prodding him he took up the sack tugged at its thong tipped the contents onto the table all stared aghast the very essence of the ferenczy i hissed the part was big as a puppy but it had the colour of disease and the shape of nightmare which is no shape at all but a morbid suggestion it could be a slug a foetus some strange worm it writhed in the light put out fumbling fingers and formed an eye a mouth came next with curving dagger teeth the eye was soft and mucous damp it stared about while the mouth chomped vacuously the vlad sat there white as death his face twisting grotesquely i laughed as the vampire stuff wriggled closer to him and he gave a cry and toppled himself over backwards in his chair the thing had intended no harm it had no intent larger and hungry it might be dangerous or if it were alone with a sleeping man in a dark room hut not here in the light i knew this but vladimir and the court didnt vrykoulakas vrykoulakasp the greek priests began to scream and at that though few could have known what the word meant the great hall became the scene of furious chaos ladies cried out and fainted everyone drew back from the huge table guests crushed together at the door to give the greeks their due they were the only ones who had any idea what to do one of them took a dagger and pinned the thing to the table it at once split open slipped free of the blade like water the priest pinned it again cried bring fire burn it in the pandemonium now reigning i jumped down from the table up into the window embrasure and so on to the low balcony as i vaulted the balcony wall into the garden a pair of angry faces appeared at the window behind me the viads bodyguard all brave and bristling now that the danger was past except that for them it wasnt yet past i glanced back the two were now out onto the balcony they shouted and waved swords and i ducked low bolts whistled overhead out of the dark garden one pursuer was taken in the throat the other in the forehead the noise from the hall was an uproar but there were no more pursuers i grinned made away we camped that night in the woods on the outskirts all of my men slept for i posted no guards no one came near in the morning light we sauntered our horses through the city then turned and headed west for wallachia my new standard still fluttered from its pole over the palace wall apparently no one had dared remove it while we were near i left it there as a reminder the dragon and tiding its back the bat and surmounting them both the livid red devils head of the ferenczy for the next five hundred years those arms would be mine my tales at an end said thibor your turn harry keogh harry had got something of what he wanted but not everything you left ehrig and the women to burn he voiced his disgust the women vampire women i think i can understand that but would it have been so hard to give them a decent death i mean did they have to burn like that you could have made it easier for them you could have beheaded them thibor seemed unconcerned gave a mental shrug and as for ehrig he had been your friend had been yes but it was a hard world a thousand years ago harry and anyway you are mistaken i didnt leave them to burn they were deep down under the tower the broken furniture i piled around the central pillar was to shatter it bring the stone steps down into the stairwell and block it forever burn them no i simply buried them harry recoiled from thibors morbid darkly sinister tone thats even worse he said you mean better the monster contradicted him chuckling but better far than even i guessed for i didnt know then that theyd live down there forever ha ha and hows that for horror harry theyre down there even now mummied aye but still alive in their way dry and desiccated as old bones bits of leather and gristle and thibor came to an abrupt halt he had sensed harrys keen interest the intense calculating way in which he seized on all of this and analysed it harry tried to back off a little tried to close his mind to the other thibor sensed that too i suddenly have this feeling he very slowly said that i may have said too much it comes as something of a to learn that even a dead creature must guard its thoughts your interest in all of these matters is more than merely usual harry i wonder why dragosani for so long silent broke in with a burst of laughter isnt it obvious old devil he said hes outsmarted you why is he so interested because there are vampires in the world in his world right now its the only answer and harry keogh came here to find out about them from you he needs to find out about them for the sake of his intelligence organisation and for the sake of the world now tell me does he really need to tell you the present circumstances of that innocent you corrupted while he was still in his mothers womb he has already told you the boy lives and yes he is a vampire dragosanis voice died away there was silence in the motionless glade where only harrys neon nimbus lit the darkness to give any indication of the drama enacted there and finally thibor spoke again is it true does he live is he yes harry told him he lives as a vampire for now thibor ignored the implications of that last but how do you know he is wamphyri because already he works his evil thats why we have to put him down myself and others who work for the same cause and certainly we must destroy him before he remembers you and comes to seek you out dragosani has said that you would rise up again thibor now how would you set about that dragosani is a brash fool who knows nothing i fooled him you fooled him so well indeed that you helped him destroy himself why any child could make a fool of dragosani take no notice of him hah cried dragosani a fool am i listen to me harry keogh and ill tell you exactly how this devious old devil will use what he has made first be silent thibor was outraged i will not dragosani cried because of you i am here a ghost nothing should i lie still while you prepare to be up and about listen to me harry when that youth but that was as much as thibor was willing to let him say a hideous mental babble started up such a blast of telepathic howling that harry could unscramble no single word of it and not only from thibor but also max batu understandably the dead mongol sided with thibor against his murderer i can hear nothing harry tried to break into the din and through it to dragosani absolutely nothing the telepathic cacophony went on unabated louder if anything more insistent than ever in life max batu had been able to concentrate hatred into a glare that could kill in death his concentration hadnt failed him if anything the mental din he created was greater than thibors and since there was no physical effort involved they could probably keep it up indefinitely quite literally dragosani was being shouted down harry attempted to lift his voice above all three if i leave you now be sure i wont be back but even as he issued his threat he realised that it no longer carried any weight thibor was shouting for his life the sort of life he had not known since the day they buried him here five hundred years ago even if the others did quieten down he would go right on bellowing stalemate and too late anyway harry felt the first tug of a force he couldnt resist a force that drew him as a compass is drawn northwards harry jnr was stirring again coming awake for his scheduled feed for the next hour or so the father must merge again with the id of his infant son the tugging strengthened an undertow that began to draw harry along with it he searched for a mцbius door found one and started towards it in that same instant of time as he made to enter the mцbius continuum something other than harry jnr stirred something in the earth where the rubble of thibors tomb lay scattered perhaps the concentrated mental uproar had disturbed it maybe it had sensed events of moment anyway it moved and harry keogh saw it great stone slabs were shoved aside tree roots snapped loudly where something massive heaved its bulk beneath them the earth erupted in a black spray as a pseudopod thick as a barrel uncoiled itself and lashed upwards almost as high as the trees it swayed there among the treetops then was drawn down again harry saw this and then he was through the door and into the mobius continuum and incorporeal as he was still he shuddered as he sped across hitherto hypothetical spaces towards the mind of his infant son and uppermost in his own mind this single thought ground to clear indeed sunday am bucharest the office of cultural and scientific exchanges housed in a converted museum of many domes standing conveniently close to the russian university the wroughtiron gates being opened by a yawning uniformed attendant and a black volkswagen variant accelerating out into the quiet streets and heading for the motorway to pitesti inside the car sergei gulharov was driving with felix krakovitch as frontseat passenger and alec kyle carl quint and an extremely thin hawkfaced bespectacled middleaged romanian woman in the back she was irma dobresti a highranking official with the ministry of lands and properties and a true disciple of mother russia because dobresti spoke english kyle and quint were a little more careful than usual how they spoke to each other and what they said it was not that they feared theyd let something slip about their mission for she would see more than enough of that but simply that they might err and make some comment about the woman herself not that they were especially rude or churlish men but irma dфbresti was a very different sort of woman she wore her black hair in a bun her clothes were almost a uniform dark grey shoes skirt blouse and coat she wore no makeup or jewellery at all and her features were sharp and mannish where womanly curves and other feminine charms were concerned nature seemed to have forgotten irma dobresti entirely her smile showing yellow teeth was something she switched on and off like a dim light and on those few occasions when she spoke her voice was deep as any mans her words blunt and always to the point if i were not thinly she said making a common enough mistake in her attempt at casual conversation this long ride is most uncomfortable she sat on the extreme left quint in the middle and then kyle the two englishmen glanced at each other then quint smiled obligingly er true he said your thinlyness is most accommodating good she gave a curt nod the car sped on out of the city picked up the motorway kyle and quint had spent the night at the dunarea hotel in the city centre while krakovitch had spent most of it up and about making connections and arrangements this morning looking haggard and holloweyed hed tuned them for breakfast gulharov had picked them up and theyd driven to the office of cultural and scientific exchanges where dobresti had been getting her instructions from a soviet liaison officer she had met krakovitch lie night before now they were on their way into the romanian countryside following a route krakovitch knew fairly well actually he said stifling a yawn this not too surprising coming here i mean he turned to look at his guests i know this place after that business at chвteau bronnitsy when party leader brezhnev give tie my appointment he ordered me to find out everything i could about about what happened i suspected dragosani was at root of it so i came here you followed his old tracks you mean said kyle krakovitch nodded when dragosani have holiday he always come here to romania no family no friends but he come here quint nodded he was born here romania was home to him and he did have one friend here kyle quietly added krakovitch yawned again peered at kyle through eyes which were a little red in their corners so it would seem anyway he used to call this place wallachia not romania wallachia is a country long gone and forgotten hut not by dragosani where exactly are we going kyle asked i was hoping you could tell me said krakovitch you said romania a place in the foothills where dragosani was a boy so that is where we are going well stay at a little village he liked off the corabiacalinesti highway we should be there in maybe two hours after that he it rugged your guess is as good as mine oh we can do better than that said kyle how far is slatina from this place where were staying slatina oh about one hundred twenty kilometres said irma dobresti krakovitch had earlier told her the name of the place they were staying a difficult and meaningless name to the two englishmen but she had known it fairly well a cousin of hers had lived there once about an hour and half to travelling do you want to go straight to slatina krakovitch asked whats in slatina anyway tomorrow will do said kyle we can spend tonight making plans as for whats in slatina records quint cut in therell be a local registrar wont there pardon krakovitch didnt know the word a person who registers marriages and births kyle explained and deaths quint added ah i begin to see said krakovitch but you are mistaken if you think a small towns records will go back five hundred years to thibor ferenczy kyle shook his head thats not it we have our own vampire remember we know he er got started out here and we more or less know how we want to find out where ilya bodescu died the bodescus were staying in slatina when he had some sort of skiing accident in the hills if we can trace someone who was involved in the recovery of his body well be within an ace of finding thibors tomb where ilya bodescu died thats where the old vampire was buried good said krakovitch there should be a police report statements perhaps even a coroners report doubting said irma dobresti shaking her head how long ago this man die eighteen nineteen years kyle answered simple death accident dobresti shrugged not suspicious no coroners report but police report yes also ambulance recovery they make report too kyle began to warm towards her thats good reasoning he said as for getting hold of those reports through the local authorities thats your job mrs er not mrs never had time just call me irma please she smiled her yellowtoothed smile her attitude in all of this puzzled quint a little you dont think its a bit odd that were here hunting for a vampire er irma she looked at him raised an eyebrow my parents come from the mountains she said when i am little they sometimes talk about wampir up there in carpatii meridionali old people still believe once there were great bears up there and sabretooth tigers before that big lizards er dinosaurs yes they are no more but they were later there was plague that swept the world all of these things gone now you tell me that my parents were right there were vampires too odd no i not think so if you want hunt vampires where better than romania eh krakovitch smiled romania he said has always been something of an island true dobresti agreed but that not always good world is big no strength in being small also being cut off means stagnation nothing new ever comes in kyle nodded thinking to himself and some of the old things are things you can well do without it had been a rough night for brenda keogh when harry jnr had finished his small hours feed he hadnt wanted to go back to sleep again he wasnt bad about it just wouldnt sleep after an hour or two of rocking him then cradling and crooning to him shed finally put the baby down and gone back to bed herself but at am hed been right on time again crying for his change and another feed and shed known from the way he twisted his little face and clenched his fists that he was tired hed been awake right through the night from no cause that brenda could discover but good what a good little chap he was he hadnt cried at all until he was hungry and uncomfortable just lay there in his cot through the night doing his own thing whatever that might be even now his will to stay awake and be a part of the world was strong but his yawning told his mother that he couldnt with dawn an hour away harry was going to have to go to sleep the world would have to wait no matter how fast your mind grows up your body goes more slowly as his baby son went to sleep harry snr found himself free and was struck with a thought as strange as any hed ever had even in his thoroughly strange existence hes leeching on me he thought the little rascals into my mind into my experiences he can explore my stuff because theres lots of it but i cant touch him because theres nothing in there yet he put the extraordinary idea to the back of his mind now that harry jnr had released him he had places to go people dead people to talk to there were things he knew which he was unique in knowing he knew for instance that the dead inhabit another sphere also that in their lonely netherexistence they go on doing all the things theyve done in life the writers write masterpieces they can never publish each line perfectly composed each paragraph polished every story a gem where time isnt a problem and deadlines dont exist things get done right the architects plot their cities of the mind beautiful aerial constructs flung across fantastic worlds and spanning sculpted oceans and continents each brick and spire and skyriding highway immaculately positioned no smallest detail missing or botched the mathematicians continue to explore the formulae of the universe reducing the all to symbols they can never put on paper for which men in the corporeal world should be grateful and the great thinkers carry on thinking their great thoughts which far outweigh any they thought in life that had been the way of it with the great majority then harry keogh necroscope had come along the dead had taken to harry at once he had given their existence new meaning before harry each one of them had inhabited a world consisting of his own incorporeal thoughts without contact with the rest they had been like houses with no doors or windows no telephones but harry had connected them up it made no difference to the living but it made a great deal of difference to the dead mцbius had been one such mathematician and thinker both and he had shown harry keogh how to use his mobius continuum hed done so gladly for like all of the dead hed quickly come to love the necroscope and the mцbius continuum had given harry access to times and places and minds beyond the reach of any other intelligence in all of mans history now harry knew of a man whose one obsession in life tad been the myths and legends and lore of the vampire his name was ladislau giresci how was it going for him now harry wondered in the aftermath of his murder max batu had killed him with his evil eye for no good reason other than that dragosani had ordered it killed him yes but not girescis lifelong penchant for the legend of the vampire what had been an obsession in life must certainly have continued afterwards harry could no longer make any headway with thibor and thibor would not let him get through to dragosani his next best bet had to be ladislau giresci how to reach him however was a different matter harry had never met the romanian in life he did not know the ground where girescis spirit lay he must rely on the dead to supply him with directions see him on his way across the road from brendas flat once harry and brendas flat there sprawled a graveyard hundreds of years old containing a large number of harrys friends he knew most of them personally from previous conversations now he drifted towards the lines of markers and occasionally leaning tombstones his mind drawn by the minds of the dead where they lay in their graves communing they sensed him at once knew that it was him who else could it be harry said their spokesman an exrailway engineer whod lived all his life in stockton until he died in its good to talk to you again nice to know you havent forgotten us how are things with you harry inquired still designing your trains the other came aglow in a moment i have designed the train he answered do you want to hear about it unfortunately i cant harry was genuinely sorry my visit is purely business im afraid well spit it out harry someone else exclaimed an exbobby of harrys acquaintance late of sir robert peels time how can we help you sir there are some hundreds of you here harry answered but is there anyone from romania i want to go there and i need directions and an introduction the only people i know there are bad people voices rose in something of a babble but one of them cut through speaking directly to harry it was a girls voice sweet and small i know romania it said something of it anyway i came here from romania after the war there were troubles and oppressions and so my elder brothers sent me away to an aunt who lived here strange but i came all this way then caught a cold and died i was very young and do you know someone i can seek out who can perhaps help me on my way harry didnt like to seem too eager to be off but he really couldnt help himself its very important i assure you but my brothers will be delighted to guide you harry she said at once its only since you came that weve all been able to well get together again we all owe you so much if i may harry answered ill come back and talk to you again some time meanwhile im afraid ive no time to spare what are your brothers called they are jahn and dmitri syzestu she said wait and ill call them for you she called and in a moment her brothers answered they were very faint like voices on a telephone from the other side of the world harry was introduced just keep talking to me he told the brothers and ill find my way to you he excused himself from the company of his friends in the hartlepool cemetery found a spacetime door and passed through it into the mobius continuum jahn dmitri are you still there were here harry and were honoured to be able to help you like this he homed in on them emerged through another door into the grey romanian dawn he found himself in a field of grass beside a pockmarked wall fast crumbling into ruins there were ponies in the field but of course they couldnt see him they just stood still shivering a little their coats shining with drops of dew plumes of warm air came snorting from their nostrils like smoke in the distance the last lights of a town were blinking out as the sun rose on the eastern horizon where is this place harry asked the brothers syzestu the town is cluj said jahn who was the oldest this place is just a field we were in prison political prisoners and we ran away they came after us with guns and caught us here trying to climb this wall now tell us harry keogh how we can help you cluj said harry a little disappointed i need to be south i think and east across the mountains this is easy the younger brother dmitri was excited our father and mother lie side by side in the graveyard in pitesti only a little while ago we were talking to them indeed they were a deeper sterner voice joined in from some distance away youre welcome to come and visit harry if you can find your way here harry excused himself a little hastily but with many apologies and reentered the mobius continuum in a little while he was in a misted graveyard in pitesti who is it youre seeking inquired franz syzestu his name is ladislau giresci said harry all i can tell you is that he died some little time ago at his home near a town called titu titu anna syzestu repeated why thats nought but fifty kilometres or so away whats more weve friends buried there she was plainly proud to be of assistance to the necroscope greta can you hear indeed i can a new voice sharp and shrewish answered and ive the very man right here there you are said anna syzestu in a toldyouso tone if you want to meet someone in titu ask greta mirnosti she knows everyone harry keogh a male voice now came to the fore im ladislau giresci do you want to come closer or will this do im on my way said harry he thanked the syzestus and went to girescis plot in titu and finally at last in the presence of the vampire expert himself he asked sir i believe you can help me if you will young man said giresci unless im very much mistaken i know why youre here last time someone came to me inquiring about vampires it cost me my life but if theres any way i can help you harry keogh any way at all just ask it that was boris dragosani who came to see you right said harry he sensed the others shudder giresci might have no body but at the mention of dragosanis name he shuddered that one yes giresci answered at last dragosani when first met him i didnt know it but he was already one of them or as good as he didnt know it himself not quite but the evil was in him he sent max batu to kill you with his evil eye yes because by then i knew what he was thats the thing a vampire fears most that people will discover what he is anyone who suspects he has to die so the little mongol killed me and he stole my crossbow that was for dragosani he used it to kill thibor ferenczy in the cruciform hills then at least it was put to good use ah but when you talk about thibor youre talking about a real vampire said giresci if dragosani with all of his potential for evil had lived alive or undead as long as that one then the world would have an incurable illness im sorry said harry but i can find nothing to admire in such monsters and in any case there was one greater than thibor who came before him and outlasted him his name was faethor and thibor took his second name from him rightly so for it was faethor who made him a vampire im speaking of faethor ferenczy of course ladislau girescis voice was the merest whisper now as he answered indeed and that was where my interest in the undead really began for i was with faethor when he died imagine that and him a creature at least thirteen hundred years old these are the ones i want to know about harry was eager thibor and faethor in your life you were a vampire expert however people might scorn your obsession or look upon you as an eccentric you studied the vampires myths his legends his lore you were still studying them when you died and its my guess that dying didnt stop you so wheres your research led you now ladislau how did thibor end up buried there on the cruciform hills and what of faethor between the tenth and twentieth centuries its important that i know these things for they relate to what im doing now and what im doing relates to the safety and sanity of the whole world i understand said giresci soberly but harry dont you think you should speak to someone with even more authority i believe it can be arranged what harry was taken aback someone with more authority than you is there such a person ahhh said a new voice a powerful voice it was black as the night itself and deep as the roots of hell and it seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at the same time oh yesss haarrry there is or was just such a one and i am he no one knows as much about the wamphyri as i do for no one has or ever will live so long so very long indeed that when i died i was ready for it oh i fought against it be sure but in the end it was for the best now i have peace and i have ladislau giresci to thank for giving me that final merciful release since he obviously holds you in the greatest esteem as do all the dead apparently then so must i so come to me harry keogh and let a real expert answer your questions it was an offer harry couldnt refuse he knew who it must be at once of course and he wondered why he hadnt thought of it himself it was after all the obvious answer im coming faethor he said just give me a moment and ill be right there chapter eleven to this day on the outskirts of ploiesti towards bucharest there stand gutted ruins reminders of the mundane horrors of war the burnedout shells lie like halfburied stony corpses in open countryside strangely gorgeous in the summer when the old bomb craters are full of flowers and brambles and wildlife and ivy climbs shattered walls to turn them green but it takes the winter and the snow to make the devastation visible to bring into monochrome perspective the gaunt reality of the region the romanians have never rebuilt in or near these ruins this was where faethor ferenczy had finally met his death at the hands of ladislau giresci during a second world war bombing raid on bucharest and ploiesti pinned to the floor of his study by a splintered ceiling beam when his home was hit he had feared the encroaching flames because alive vampires burn very slowly giresci working for the civil defence had seen the house bombed entered the blazing ruin and tried to free faethor to no avail it was hopeless the vampire had known that he was finished with a superhuman effort of will he had commandedgiresci to make a quick end of it the old way was still the only way since faethor was already staked giresci need only behead him the flames would do the rest and the ancient monster would burn along with his house the things he experienced in that house of horror stayed with giresci for the rest of his life they were what had made him an authority on vampirism now ladislau giresci was dead along with faethor but still the vampire stood in his debt which was why he would give harry keogh whatever assistance he could at least that was part of the reason the rest of it was that keogh was up against thibor the wallach it wasnt yet winter when harry keogh homed in on faethors incorporeal thoughts and emerged from the mцbius continuum into the creeper and bramblegrown ruin which had been the vampires final refuge on earth indeed the summer was barely turning to autumn the trees still green but the chill harry felt might have suggested winter to the bones of any ordinary man harry was least of all ordinary he knew it was a chill of the spirit a wintry blast blowing on the soul a psychic chill which is only felt in the presence of a supernatural power faethor ferenczy had been such and harry recognised that fact but just as surely faethor too knew when he was face to face with a power the dead speak well of you harry the vampire opened his mental voice sepulchral indeed they love you that is hard for one who was never loved to understand you are not one of them and yet they love you perhaps it is because you too like them are without body the voice took on a grimly humorous note why it might even be said that you are undead if theres one thing ive learned about vampires harry answered evenly its that they love riddles and word games but im not here to play still ill answer your questions why do the dead love me because i bring them hope because i intend no harm but only good because through me they are something more than memories in other words because you are pure the vampires words dripped with sarcasm i was never pure said harry but i understand your meaning and i suppose youre near enough right which might also explain why theyll have nothing to do with you theres no life in you only death you were dead even in life you were death and death walked with you wherever you walked dont compare my condition with undeath im more alive now than you ever were when i arrived here and before you spoke i noticed something do you know what it was the silence exactly no cock crowing no birdsong even the droning of bees is absent here the brambles are lush and green but they bear no fruit nothing no one will come near you not even now the things of nature sense your presence they cant speak to you like i can but they know youre here and they shun you because you were evil because even dead youre still evil so dont sneer at my pureness faethor i shall never be alone and after a moments silence faethor said thoughtfully for one who seeks my help you dont much hide your feelings we are poles apart harry told him but we do have a mutual enemy thibor why then have you spent time with him thibor is the source of the trouble harry answered he is or was your enemy and what he left behind is my enemy i hoped to learn things from him and was partially successful now hell tell me no more you offered help and here i am to accept your offer but we dont have to pretend friendship guileless faethor said that is why they love you but you are right thibor was and is my enemy however much ive punished him can never punish him enough so ask what you will of me and ill answer all then tell me this said harry eager once more after he hurled you from your castle in flames what became of you then i shall be brief faethor answered because i sense that this is only part of what you desire to know cast your mind back then if you will one thousand years into the past thibor the wallach whom i had called son to whom i had given my name and banner and into whose hands i had bequeathed my castle lands and wamphyri power had injured me sorely more sorely than even he suspected that cursed ingrate thrown down from the walls of my castle in flames i was burned and blinded myriad minion bats fluttered to me as i fell were scorched and died but dampened the flames not at all i crashed through trees and shrubs tumbled in a thousand agonies down the steep side of the gorge was torn by trees and boulders alike before striking bottom but my fall was broken in part by the foliage and i fell in a shallow pool which put out the flames that threatened to melt my wamphyri flesh stunned as close to true death as a vampire might come and remain undead still i put out a call to my faithful gypsies down in the valley i know you will understand what i mean harry keogh we share the power to speak with others at a distance to speak with the mind alone as we do now and the szgany came they took out my body from the still salving water and cared for it they carried me west over the mountains into the hungarian kingdom they protected me from jars and jolts hid me from potential enemies kept me from the suns searing rays and at last they brought me to a place of rest ah and that was a long rest for recuperation for reshaping a time of enforced retirement i have said thibor had hurt me but how he had hurt me i was sorely damaged all bones broken back and neck skull and limbs chest staved in heart and lungs a mangle skin flayed by fire torn by sharp branches and boulders even the vampire in me which occupied most parts and portions was battered torn and scorched a week in the healing a month a year nay an hundred years a century in which to dream my dreams of red or nightblack revenge my long convalescence was spent in an inaccessible mountain retreat but a place more a cavern than a castle and all the while my szgany tended me and their sons and their sons and their daughters too slowly i became whole again the vampire in me healed itself and then healed me wamphyri i walked again practised my arts made myself wiser stronger more terrible than ever before i went abroad from my aerie made plans for my lifes adventure as if thibors treachery had been but yesterday and all my wounds no more than a stiffness of the joints and it was a terrible world in which i emerged with wars everywhere and great suffering and famines and pestilence terrible aye but the very stuff of life to me for i was wamphyri i builded me a small castle in the border with wallachia almost impregnable and there set myself up as a boyar of some means i led a mixed body of szgany hungarians and local wallachs paid them well housed and fed them was accepted as a landowner and leader the szgany of course would have followed me to the ends of the earth and they did they did not out of love but some strange emotion which is in the wild breast of all the szgany simply say that i was a power and that they associated with me as for my name i became stefan ferrenzig common enough in those parts but that was only the first of my names thirty years after my full recovery i became the son of stefan called peter and thirty years later karl then grigor a man must not be seen to live too long and certainly not for centuries you understand as for wallachia i avoided crossing the border mainly for there was one in wallachia whose strength and cruelty were already renowned a mysterious mercenary voevod named thibor who commanded a small army for the wallach princelings and i did not wish to meet him who should now be guarding my lands and properties in the khorvaty no i would not meet him now not yet oh i doubted that he would recognise me for i was changed beyond measure but if i saw him i might not be able to contain myself that could well prove fatal for in the years of my healing he had been active and was grown strong indeed he was in large part the power behind the throne of wallachia he had his own szgany but well disciplined and he also commanded the army of a prince while i merely led an untrained rabble of gypsies and peasants no my revenge could wait what is time to the wamphyri eh for a further sixty years i bided my time contained my activities was subdued covert by now i had access to a worthy force of fighters for payment fierce mercenaries and i considered how best to use them i was tempted to take on thibor and the wallachs but any sort of even fight was not to my liking i wanted the dog on his knees before me to do with him as i desired i did not want a battlefield confrontation for i had learned at first hand his wiles and his strength by now he possibly considered me dead it were best i continued to let him think it my time would still come but meanwhile i was restless confined pent up here was i lusty strong something of a power and i had nowhere to channel my energies it was time i went further abroad in the roiling world then i heard of a great crusade by the franks against the moslems the world was two years into its thirteenth christian century and even now a fleet was sailing against zara originally the crusaders had intended to attack egypt then the centre of moslem power but their armies were heirs to a long hostility towards byzantium the old doge of venice who provided their fleet and who was himself an enemy of byzantium had diverted them first to hungary zara only recently won by the hungarians was retaken and sacked by venetians and crusaders alike in november by which time i was on my way to that key city with a select company of my own supporters the hungarian king my master believing i was acting for him against the crusaders put no obstacle in my way when i reached zara however i sold myself into mercenary service and took the cross which had been my intention all along it seemed to me that the best way to venture out across the world would be with the crusaders but if i had hoped for instant action then it was a vain hope the venetians and franks had already divided the citys spoils they had argued and fought over them too but their quarrelling was soon over and now the doge and boniface of montferrat who led the expedition decided to winter at zara now the original intention the prime purpose of this fourth crusade had been of course to destroy the moslems but many crusaders believed that byzantium had been a traitor to christendom throughout all the holy wars and suddenly constantinople was within grasp or at least within reach of vengeful crusader passions moreover constantinople was rich wildly rich madly rich the prospect of loot such as constantinople offered settled the matter egypt could wait the very world could wait for the target was now the imperial capital itself i shall be brief we set sail for constantinople in the spring stopped off at several places to do various things and late in june arrived before the imperial capital i will assume you know something of history for months running to years there were objections moral religious and political to the citys sack avarice and lust eventually won the day all schemes of going on from there to fight the infidel were finally abandoned pope innocent iii who had been in large part responsible for calling the crusade had already excommunicated the venetians for sacking zara now he was once more aghast but both news and intervention travelled slowly in those days and in the eyes of the crusaders constantinople had become a jewel their quests end and every man of us lusted after it agreement was reached on the division of spoils and then early in april we commenced the attack all political scheming and pious talk were put aside at last for this was why we were here ah and how my fierce heart rejoiced every fibre of my being thrilled gold is one thing but blood is another blood spilled blood drunk blood coursing through veins of fire i will tell you what we came up against first of all the greeks had ships on the golden horn to keep us from landing below the walls they fought hard but in vain though their efforts were not entirely wasted greek fire is a terrible thing it ignites and burns in water their catapults hurled it among our ships and men blazed in the sea itself i was scalded my right shoulder chest and back burned near to the bone ah but i had been burned before and by an expert a mere scorching could not keep me out of it my pain served only to spur me on for this was my day you might wonder about the sun how could i wamphyri fight under its searing ray i wore a flowing black cloak in the fashion of moslem chiefs and a helm of leather and iron to guard my head also i fought wherever possible with the sun at my back when i was not fighting and believe me there were other things to do as well as fight then of course i kept out of it but the crusaders when they saw me and my szgany in battle ah they were awed ignored hitherto considered a rabble to bulk out the ranks and go down as fodder to fire and sword now we were regarded by frank and venetian alike as demons as fighting hellfiends how glad they must have been to have us on their side so i thought but let me not stray a breach was made in the wall guarding the blachernae quarter of the city simultaneously a fire broke out in the city in that quarter the defenders were confused they panicked we crushed them and poured over them into the mainly empty streets where the fighting was nothing much to mention for after all what were we up against greeks with all of the wind knocked out of them an illdisciplined army mainly mercenary still suffering from years of mismanagement slav and pechenegi units which would fight only so long as their chances were good and the payment better frankish units whose members were torn obviously two ways the varangian guard a company composed of danes and englishmen who knew their emperor alexius iii for a usurper with merit neither as a fighting man nor as a man of state what work there was for us was slaughter those who were not willing to die at once fled there was no other choice in a few hours the doge and frankish and venetian lords occupied the great palace itself from there they issued their orders the war and lootcrazed crusaders were told that constantinople was theirs and they had three days in which to complete the citys sack they were the victors there was no crime they could commit they could do with the capital its people and possessions whatever they wished can you imagine what such orders conveyed for nine hundred years constantinople had been the centre of christian civilisation and now for three days it became the sinkhole of hell the venetians who appreciated great works carried off grecian masterpieces and other works of art and beauty by the ton and treasures in precious metals near enough to sink their ships as for the french the flemings and various mercenary crusaders including me and mine they desired only to destroy and destroy we did however precious if something could not be carried or hauled away it was reduced to wreckage on the spot we fuelled our madness from rich winecellars paused only to drink rape or murder then returned to the sack nothing no one was spared no virgin came out of it intact and few came out alive if a woman was too old to be stabbed with flesh she was stabbed with steel and no female was too young convents were sacked and nuns used as whores christian nuns mind men who had not fled but stayed to protect their homes and families were slit up their bellies and left clutching their steaming guts to die in the streets the citys gardens and squares were full of its dead inhabitants mainly women and children and i faethor ferenczy known to the franks as the black one or black grigor the hungarian devil i was ever in the thick of it the thickest of it for three days i glutted myself as if there were no end to my lust i did not know it but the end my end the end of glory of power of notoriety was already looming for i had forgotten the prime rule of the wamphyri do not be seen to be too different be strong but not overpowering be lustful but not a legendary satyr command respect but not devotion and above all do nothing to cause your peers or those who have the power to consider themselves your superiors to become afraid of you but i had been burned by greek fire and it had merely infuriated me and rapacious for every man i had killed i had taken a woman as many as thirty in a day and a night my szgany looked to me as a sort of god or devil and finally finally of course the crusaders proper had come to fear me more than all matters of conscience more than all the murder and rape and blasphemies they had committed my deeds had given them bad dreams aye and they were sore in need of a scapegoat i believe that even without innocents pious protestations and handflutterings and cries of horror still i would have been persecuted anyway this was the way of it the pope had been enraged by the sack of zara at first delighted by constantinople then aghast when he heard of the atrocities he now washed his hands of the crusade in its entirety far from helping true christian soldiers in their fight against islam it seemed its only aim had been to conquer christian territories and as for the blasphemies and generally atrocious behaviour of the crusaders in constantinoples holy places i say again they needed a scapegoat and no need to look too far for one a certain bloodthirsty mercenary recruited in zara would fit the bill nicely in secret communiquйs innocent had ordered that those directly responsible for gross acts of excessive and unnatural cruelty must gain neither glory nor rich rewards nor lands for their barbarism their names should no more be spoken by good men and true but struck forever out of the records all such great sinners were to be offered neither respect nor high regard for by their acts they had shown that they were worthy only of contempt hah it was more than excommunication it was a death warrant excommunication i had taken the cross in zara as a matter of expediency it meant nothing a cross is a symbol nothing more soon however i would come to hate that symbol we had a large house on the outskirts of the sacked city my szgany and i it had been a palace or some such was now filled with wine and loot and prostitutes the other mercenary groups had turned over their plunder to their crusader masters for the prearranged split but i had not for we had not yet been paid perhaps i was in error there certainly our loot was an extra incentive for crusader treachery they came at night which was their mistake i am or was wamphyri night was my element some vampire premonition had warned me that all was not well i was awake and on the prowl when the attack came i roused up my men and they set to but it was no good we were heavily outnumbered and taken by surprise my men were still halfasleep when the place began to burn i saw that i couldnt win even if i beat off all of these crusaders they formed only a fraction of the total body they had probably diced with ten other equal parties for the privilege of killing and robbing me also if they had guessed what i was and the fire suggested that they had quite obviously my situation was untenable i took gold and a great many gemstones and fled into the darkness on my way i carried off one of my attackers with me he was a frenchman only a lad and i made a quick end of it for i had not time to tarry before he died though he told me what it was all about from that day to this i have loathed the cross and all who wear it or live in its shadow or under its influence of my szgany not a man of them survived to follow me out of that place but i later learned that two captives had been taken for questioning as it was i stood off and watched the blaze from afar and since the inferno was ringed about by crusaders i could only suppose that they assumed i had died in the flames so be it i would not disillusion them and now i was alone and a long way from home well hadnt i desired to see the world now i have said i was a long way from home in miles on the ground this statement is seen to be far from accurate but where indeed was my home i could hardly return to hungary not for some little time wallachia was no place for me and my old castle in the khorvaty looking down on russia was in ruins what then was i to do where to go ah but the world is a wide place to detail my adventures from that time forward would take too long i shall merely outline my deeds and travels and you must forgive or fill in for yourself any great gaps or leaps in time north was out of the question likewise west i headed east it was need i remind you of a singular emergence in mongolia just two years later of course not his name was temujin later genghis khan with a party of uighurs i joined him and helped subdue and unite the last of the rowdy mongol tribes until all mongolia was finally united i proved myself a capable warlord and he showed me some respect with some small effort i was able to change my features until i looked the part that is to say i willed my vampire flesh into a new mould the khan knew that i was not a mongol of course but at least i was acceptable and later he would have many mercenaries in his command so that my participation was in no way a rare thing i was with him against the chin when we penetrated the great wall and after his death i was there to see the total obliteration of the chin empire i passed my loyalty down to genghiss grandson batu i could have offered my services to other mongol khans but batus objective was europe it was one thing to return a man alone but another to go back as a general in a mongol army in the winter of in a lightning campaign we smashed the russian principalities in we took kiev by storm and burned it to ashes from there we struck at poland and hungary only the death of the great khan ogedei in saved europe in its entirety there were disputes about the succession and the westward campaigns were stalled later it was time for the fereng as i was known to die again i obtained permission to journey to an ambiguous homeland far in the west my son would join hьlegь in his push against the assassins and the caliphate as fereng the black son of the fereng under hьlegь i assisted in the extermination of the assassins and was there at the fall of baghdad in ah but a little more than two years later at am jalut in the socalled holy land we were delivered a crushing defeat by the mamelukes the turning point for the mongols had come in russia mongol rule would continue to the end of the fourteenth century but rule implies peace and my taste for war had grown insatiable i stuck it out forty years more then parted company with the mongols and sought action elsewhere i fought for islam i was now an ottoman a turk aha what it is to be a mercenary eh yes i became a ghazi a moslem warrior fighting against the polytheists and for nearly two centuries my life was one great unending river of blood and death under bayezid wallachia became a vassal state which the turks called eflak i could have returned then and sought out thibor who had moved with his szekely into the mountains of transylvania but i was busy campaigning elsewhere by the middle of the fifteenth century my chance had passed me by the boundaries of the ottoman state at the accession of mehemmed ii were shrinking in sigismund the holy roman emperor had invested viad ii of wallachia with the order of the dragon licence to destroy the infidel turk and who was viads instrument in this holy work who was his warweapon thibor of course of thibors deeds strangely i heard with no small measure of pride he butchered not only the infidel turk but hungarians germans and other christians in their thousands ah he was a true son of his father if only he had not been disobedient alas but disobedience to me was not his only failing like myself at the end of my crusader adventure he had not practised the caution of the wamphyri he was adored by the szekely but set himself on a level with his superiors the wallachian princes and his excesses had made him notorious he was feared throughout the land in short he had in every way brought himself into prominence a vampire may not be prominent not if he values his longevity but thibor was wild demented in his cruelties vlad the impaler radu the handsome and mircea the monk had all tasked him with the protection of wallachia and the chastisement of its enemies tasks in which he delighted at which he excelled indeed the impaler one of historys favourite villains suffers undeservedly he was cruel aye but in fact he has been named for thibors deeds like my name thibors has been struck but the stark terror of his deeds will live forever now let me get on when i had lived too long with the turks finally i deserted their cause which was crumbling as all causes must in the end and returned to wallachia the time was well chosen thibor had gone too far mircea had recently acceded to the throne and he feared his demon voevod mightily this was the moment i had so long awaited crossing the danube i put out wamphyri thoughts ahead of me where were my gypsies now did they still remember me three hundred years is a long time but it was night and i was nights master my thoughts were carried on the dark winds all across wallachia and into the shadowed mountains romany dreamers where they lay about their campfires heard me and started awake gazing at each other in wonder for they had heard a legend from their grandfathers who had heard it from their grandfathers that one day i would return in two of my mercenary szgany had come home the same two taken for questioning on the night of crusader cowardice and treachery whose lives had been spared and they had returned to foster an awesome myth but now i was here a myth no longer father what shall we do they whispered into the night shall we come to meet you master no i told them across all the rivers and forests and miles i have work to finish and i alone must see to it go into the carpatii meridionali and put my house in order so that i may have my own place when my work is done and i knew that they would do it then i went to mircea in targoviste thibor was campaigning on the hungarian border a good safe way away i showed the prince living vampire flesh taken from my own body telling him that it was flesh of thibor then because he was close to fainting i burned it this showed him one way in which a vampire may be killed i told him the other way too the stake and decapitation then i questioned him about his voevods longevity did he not deem it strange that thibor must be at least three hundred years old no he answered for it was not one man but several they all were part of the same legend they all took the same name thibor all of them down through the years had fought under the devilbatdragon banner i laughed at him what but i had studied russian records and knew for a fact that this selfsame man this one man had been a boyar in kiev three hundred years ago at that time it had been rumoured that he was wamphyri the fact that he still lived gave the rumour ample foundation he was a lustful vampire and now it seemed he lusted after the throne of wallachia did i have any proof at all in support of my accusations the prince asked me i told him you have seen his vampire flesh it could have been the loathsome flesh of any vampire he said but i had dedicated myself to seek out vampires and destroy them wherever i found them i told him in pursuit of such creatures i had been in china mongolia turkeyland russia and i spoke many languages to prove it when thibor had been wounded in battle i had been there to take and keep a piece of his flesh which had grown into what the prince had seen what more proof did he need none he too had heard rumours had his suspicions his doubts the prince already feared thibor but what i had told him mostly the truth except perhaps concerning thibors ambition had utterly terrified him how could he deal with this monster i told him how he must send for thibor on some pretext or other to bestow upon him a great honour yes that would do it vampires are often prideful flattery carefully applied can win them over mircea must tell thibor that he desired to make him voevod in chief over all wallachia with powers second only to mircea himself power he has that already then tell him that eventually succession to the throne will not be out of the question what the prince pondered i must take advice ridiculous i was forceful he may have allies among your advisors dont you know his strength say on when he comes i shall be here he must be told to come alone his army staying on the hungarian border to continue the skirmishing orders can be sent to them later dispersing them to lesser more trusted generals you shall receive him alone at night alone at night mircea the monk was sore afraid you must drink with him i shall give you wine with which to drug him he is strong however and no amount of wine will kill him it may not even render him unconscious but it will rob him of his senses make him clumsy stupid like a man drunk i shall be close at hand with four or five of the most trusted members of your guard well confine him naked in a place you shall nominate a special place somewhere in the grounds of the palace then when the sun rises you will know you have trapped a vampire the suns rays on his flesh will be a torture to him but that in itself will not be sufficient proof no for above all else we must be just bound his jaws will be forced open you shall see his tongue prince forked like a snakes and red with blood at once a stake of hard wood shall be driven through his heart this for the greater part will immobilise him then into a coffin with him and off to a secret place he shall be buried where no one should ever find him a place forbidden to men from this time forward will it work i gave the prince my guarantee that it would work and it did exactly as i have stated from targoviste to the cruciform hills is perhaps one hundred miles thibor was carried there at all speed holy men came with us all the way with exorcisms ringing until i thought i would be sick i was dressed in the plain black habit of a monk with the hood thrown up none had seen my face except mircea and a handful of officials at the palace all of whom i had beguiled or hypnotised as you now have it to a degree there in the hills a rude mausoleum was hastily constructed of local stone it bore no name or title no special marks standing low to the ground and ominous in a gloomy glade as you have seen it it would in itself suffice to keep away the merely curious years later someone cut thibors emblem into the stone as an additional warning perhaps or it could be that some szgany or szekely follower found him and marked the place but feared to bring him up or lacked the wit i have gone ahead of myself we took him there to the foothills of the carpatii and there he was lowered into his hole four or five feet deep in the dark earth wrapped in massy chains of silver and iron he was and the stake still in him and nailing him secure in his box he lay pale as death his eyes closed for all the world a corpse but i knew that he was not night was falling i told the soldiers and priests that i would climb down and behead thibor and set a fire of branches in his grave to burn him and when the fire was dead fill in the hole it was dangerous witchcrafty work i said which could only be done by the light of the moon they should now retreat if they valued their souls they went stood off and waited for me on the plain the moon thinhorned rose up i looked down on thibor and spoke to him in the manner of the wamphyri ah my son and so it is come to this sad sad day for a fond father who bestowed upon an ingrate son mighty powers to be wasted a son who would not honour his fathers ordinances and is therefore fallen in the world wake up thibor and let that also which is in you waken for i know that you are not dead his eyes opened a crack as my words sank in then gaped wide in sudden understanding i threw back my cowl so that he might see me and smiled in a manner he must surely remember he marked me and gave a great start then he marked his whereabouts and screamed ah how he screamed i threw earth down upon him mercy he cried out loud mercy but are you not thibor the wallach given the name ferenczy and commanded to tend in his absence the lands of faethor of the wamphyri and if you are what do you here so far from your place of duty mercy mercy leave me my head faethor i intend to i tossed in more dirt he saw my meaning my intention and went mad shaking and vibrating and generally threatening to tear himself loose from his stake i put down a long stout pole into the grave and tapped home the stake more firmly driving it through the bottom of the coffin itself as for the coffins lid i merely let it stand there on its side in the bottom of the hole what cover him up and lose sight of that frantic fearfilled face but i am wamphyri he screamed you could have been i told him ah you could have been now you are nothing old bastard how i hate you he raved blood in his eyes his nostrils the writhing gape of his mouth mutual my son you are afraid you fear me that is the reason reason you desire to know the reason how fares my castle in the khorvaty what of my mountains my dark forests my lands i will tell you the khans have held them for more than a century and where were you thibor its true he screamed through the earth i threw in his face you do fear me if that were true then i should most certainly behead you i smiled no i merely hate you above all others do you remember how you burned me i cursed you for a hundred years thibor now it is your turn to curse me for the rest of time or until you stiffen into a stone in the dark earth and without further ado i filled in his grave when he could no longer scream with his mouth he screamed with his mind i relished each and every yelp then i built a small fire to fool the soldiers and the priests and warmed myself before it for an hour for the night was chill and eventually i went down to the plain farewell my son i told thibor and then i shut him out of my mind as i had shut him out of the world forever and so you took your revenge on thibor said harry when faethor paused you buried him alive or undead forever well that might have suited your cruel purpose faethor ferenczy but you certainly werent doing the world at large any favours by letting him keep his head he corrupted dragosani and planted his vampire seed in him and between times infected the unborn yulian bodescu who is now a vampire in his own right did you know these things harry said faethor in my life i was a master of telepathy and in death oh the dead wont talk to me and i cant blame them but there is nothing to keep me from listening in on their conversations in a way it could even be argued that im a necroscope like you oh ive read the thoughts of many and there have been certain thoughts which interested me greatly especially those of that dog thibor yes since my death i have renewed my interest in his affairs i know about boris dragosani and yulian bodescu dragosani is dead harry told him albeit unnecessarily but ive spoken to him and he tells me thibor will try to come back through bodescu now how can this be i mean thibor is dead no longer merely undead but utterly dead dissolved finished something of him remains even now vampire matter you mean mindless protoplasm hiding in the earth shunning the light devoid of conscious will how may thibor use that when he no longer commands it an interesting question faethor answered thibors root his creeper of flesh a stray pseudopod detached and left behind would seem to be the exact opposite of you and me we are incorporeal living minds without material bodies and it is what a living body without a mind ive no time for riddles and word games faethor harry reminded him i was not playing games but answering your question said faethor in part anyway you are an intelligent man can you work it out for yourself that got harry thinking about opposite poles was that what faethor meant that thibor would make a new home for himself in a composite being a thing formed of yulians physical shape and thibors vampire spirit while he worried at the problem faethor was not excluded from harrys thoughts bravo said the vampire your confidence is misplaced harry told him i still dont have the answer or if i do then i dont understand it i cant see how thibors mentality can govern yulians body not while its controlled by yulians own mind anyway bravo said faethor again but harry remained in the dark explain said the necroscope admitting defeat if thibor can lure yulian bodescu to the cruciform hills said faethor and there cause his surviving creeper the protoflesh he shed perhaps for this very purpose to join with bodescu he can form a hybrid why not bodescu already has something of thibor in him he already is influenced by him the only obstacle as you point out will be the youths mind answer thibors vampire tissue once it is in him will simply eat yulians mind away to make room for thibors eat it away harry felt a dizzy nausea literally but a body without a mind must quickly die a human body yes if it is not kept alive artificially but bodescus body is no longer human surely that is the essence of your problem he is a vampire and in any case thibors transition would take the merest moment of time yulian bodescu would go up into the cruciform hills and he would appear to come down again from them but in fact it would be thibor bravo said faethor a third time however caustically thank you said harry ignoring the others sarcasm for now i know that im on the right track and that the course of action chosen by certain friends of mine is the right one which leaves only one last question unanswered oh black humour had returned to faethors voice a certain sly note of innuendo let me see if i can guess it you desire to know if i faethor ferenczy like thibor the wallach have left anything of myself behind to fester in the dark earth am i right you know you are said harry for all i know its a precaution all the wamphyri take against the chance that death will find them out harry you have been straightforward with me and i like you for it now i too shall be forthright no this thing is of thibors invention however i would add that i wish i had thought of it first as for my vampire remains yes i believe there is such a revenant if not several except revenant is perhaps the wrong word for we both know there will be no return and it they whatever is in your castle in the khorvaty which thibor razed a simple enough deduction but have you no desire to use such remains like thibor to raise yourself up again you are naпve harry if could i probably would but how i died here and may not depart this spot and anyway i know that you will destroy whatever thibor left buried in that castle a thousand years ago if it has survived but a thousand years harry think of it even i do not know if vampire protoplasm can live that long in those circumstances but it might have survived doesnt that interest you harry detected something like a sigh harry i will tell you something believe me if you like or disbelieve but i am at peace with myself anyway i have had my day and i am satisfied if you had lived for thirteen hundred years then you might understand perhaps you will believe me if i say that even you have been a disturbance but you must disturb me no longer my debt to ladislau giresci is paid in full farewell harry waited a moment then said goodbye faethor and tired now strangely weary he found a spacetime door and returned to the mцbius continuum harry keoghs conversation with faethor ferenczy had ended none too soon harry jnr was awake and calling his fathers mind home snatched from the mцbius continuum into the infants increasingly powerful id harry was obliged to wait out his sons period of wakefulness which continued into sunday evening it was pm in england when finally harry jnr went back to sleep but in romania it was two hours later and darkness had already fallen the vampirehunters had a suite of rooms in an old world inn on the outskirts of lonesti there in a comfortable pinepanelled lounge they finalised their plans for monday and enjoyed drinks before making an early night of it that at least was their intention only irma dobresti was absent having gone into pitesti to make final arrangements for certain ordnance supplies she had wanted to be sure the requisition was ready all of the men were agreed that whatever she lacked in looks and personal charm irma certainly made up for in efficiency harry keogh when he materialised found them with drinks in their hands around a log fire the only warning of his coming was when carl quint suddenly sat bolt upright in his easy chair spilling his slivovitz into his lap visibly paling staring all about the room with eyes round as saucers quint stood up but even standing it was as if he had shrunk down into himself ohoh he managed to gasp gulharov was plainly puzzled but krakovitch too felt something he shivered and said what what i think there is some youre right alec kyle cut him off hurrying to the main door of the suite and locking it then turning off all the lights except one there is something take it easy all of you hes coming what krakovitch said again his breath pluming as the temperature plummeted who is coming quint took a deep breath felix he said his voice shivery youd better tell sergei not to panic this is a friend of ours but at first meeting he may come as a bit of a shock krakovitch spoke to gulharov in russian and the young soldier put down his glass and slowly got to his feet and right then at that very moment suddenly harry was there he took his usual form except that now the infant was no longer foetal but seated in his midsection and it no longer turned aimlessly on its own axis but seemed to recline against harry eyes closed in an attitude almost of meditation also the keogh manifestation seemed paler had less luminosity while the image of the child was definitely brighter krakovitch after the initial shock recognised keogh at once my god he blurted a ghost two ghosts yes and i know one of them that thing is harry keogh not a ghost felix said kyle as he took the russians arm its something rather more than a ghost but nothing to be afraid of i assure you is sergei all right gulharovs adams apple bobbed frantically his hands shook and his eyes bulged if he could have run he probably would have but the strength had gone out of his legs krakovitch spoke to him sharply in russian told him to sit that everything was in order sergei didnt believe him but he sat anyway almost collapsing into his chair the floors yours harry said kyle for the sake of goodness said krakovitch feeling a growing hysteria but trying to stay calm for gulharovs sake wont someone explain keogh looked at him at gulharov too you are krakovitch he said to the former you have psychic awareness which makes it easier but your friend doesnt im getting through to him but its an effort krakovitch opened and closed his mouth like a fish saying nothing then thumped down into his chair beside gulharov he licked dry lips glanced at kyle not not a ghost no im not harry answered but suppose its an understandable mistake look i havent time to explain my circumstances now that youve seen me maybe kyle will do that for me but later right now im short of time again and what i have to say is rather important felix said kyle try to put your astonishment behind you just accept that this is happening and try to take in what hes saying ill tell you all about it just as soon as i have the chance the russian nodded got a grip of himself said very well harry told all that hed learned since the last time he and kyle had spoken his terms of expression were very abbreviated he brought the intesp men up to date in less than half an hour finally he was done and looked to kyle for his response how are things in england i contact our people tomorrow at noon kyle told him and the house in devon i think the time has come to order them in keogh nodded so do i when do you make your move in the cruciform hills we finally get to see the place tomorrow kyle answered after that tuesday in daylight well remember what ive told you what thibor left behind is big but it lacks intelligence and as i said well be working in daylight again the keogh apparition nodded i suggest you move in on harkley house and bodescu at the same time by now he has to be pretty sure what he is and hes probably explored his vampire powers though from what we know of him he doesnt have thibor or faethors cunning or insularity they guarded their wamphyri identities jealously they didnt go around making more vampires unnecessarily on the other hand yulian bodescu perhaps because hes had no instruction is a timebomb frighten him then make a mistake and let him go free and hell go like wildfire a vile cancer in the guts of all humanity kyle knew he was right i agree with you on the timing he said but are you sure youre not just worrying about bodescu getting to thibor before we can act against him i might be the apparition frowned but as far as we know bodescu isnt even aware of the cruciform hills and whats buried there but put that aside for now tell me do your men in england know what has to be done it isnt every man whod have the stomach for it its rough work the old methods the stake decapitation fire there are no other ways nothing else will work it cant be done with kid gloves the fire at harkley will have to be a big one a bonfire because of the cellars because we dont know whats down there i agree when i speak to my men tomorrow ill make sure they fully understand they already do im sure but ill make absolutely certain the whole house has to go from the cellars up yes and maybe down a little too good said keogh for a moment he stood silent a hologram of thin blue neon wires he seemed a little uncertain about something like an actor needing a prompt then he said look ive things to do there are people dead people i need to thank properly for their help and ive not yet worked out how to break my baby sons hold on me thats becoming a problem so if youll excuse me kyle stepped forward there seemed some sort of air of finality about harry keogh kyle wanted to hold out his hand but knew there was nothing there nothing of any substance anyway harry he said er give them our thanks too your friends i mean i will said the other he smiled a wan smile and disappeared in a rapidly dispersing burst of foxfire for long moments there was a breathless silence then kyle turned the light up and krakovitch drew a massive breath of air finally he expelled it and said and now now i hope youll agree that you owe me something of an explanation which was something kyle could only go along with harry keogh had done all he could the rest of it lay in the hands of the physically alive or at least with people who still had hands to accept it in the mцbius continuum harry felt a mental tugging even sleeping his baby sons attraction was still enormous harry jnr was tightening his grip and harry snr was sure that he had been right about the infant he was drawing on his mind leeching his knowledge absorbing the substance of his id soon harry must make a permanent break but how to where what would be left of him he wondered if he were completely absorbed would there be anything left at all or would he simply cease to be except as the future esoteric talent of his own son using the mцbius continuum harry could always plumb the future to find the answers to these questions he preferred not to know all of the answers however for the future seemed somehow inviolable it wasnt that he would feel a cheat but rather that he doubted the wisdom of knowing the future for like the past the future was fixed if harry saw something he didnt like would he try to avoid it of course he would even knowing it was unavoidable which could only complicate his weird existence more yet the one single glimpse he would allow himself would be to discover if indeed he had any future at all which for harry keogh was the very simplest of exercises still fighting his sons attraction he found a future door and opened it gazed out upon the ever expanding future against the subtly shifting darkness of the fourth dimension earths myriad human lifelines of neon blue shot away into a sapphire haze defining the length of lives that were and lives still to come harrys line sped out from his own incorporeal being from his mind he supposed and wound away apparently interminably but he saw that just beyond the mцbius door it took on a course lying parallel to a second thread like the twin strips of a motorway with a central verge or barrier and this second lifeline harry supposed must belong to harry jnr he launched himself from the door and traversed future time following his own and the infant harrys threads faster than the lifelines themselves he propelled himself into the near future he witnessed and was saddened by the termination of many blue threads which simply dimmed and went out for he knew that these were deaths and he saw others burst brightly into existence like stars then extend themselves into brilliant neon filaments and knew that these were births new lives and so he forged a little way forward time was briefly furrowed in his wake like the sea behind a forging ship before closing in and sealing itself once more suddenly despite the fact that harry was without body he felt an icy blast blowing on him from the side it could hardly be a physical chill and must therefore be of the psyche sure enough away out across the panorama of speeding lifelines he spied one that was as different as a shark in a school of tuna for this one was scarlet the mark of a vampire and quite deliberately it was angling in towards his and harry jnrs threads harry knew panic the scarlet lifeline drifted closer at any moment it must converge with his and the infants then harry jnrs lifethread abruptly veered away from his fathers raced off at a tangent on its own amidst an ocean of weaving blue lines and the thread of harry snr followed suit avoiding the vampire threads thrust and turning desperately away the action had looked for all the world like the manoeuvring of drivers on some otherworldly race track but the last move had been blind almost instinctive and harrys lifethread seemed now to careen out of control across the skein of future time then in another moment harry witnessed and indeed was party to the impossible a collision another blue lifethread dimming crumbling disintegrating converged with his out of nowhere the two seemed to bend towards each other as by some mutual attraction before slamming together in a neon blaze that was much brighter and speeding on as one thread briefly harry felt the presence or the faint fading echo of another mind superimposed on his own then it was gone extinct and his thread rushed on alone he had seen enough the future must go its own way he cast about found a door and sidestepped out of time into the mцbius continuum at once the infant harrys tractor id put a grapple on him and began to reel him in harry didnt fight it but merely let himself drift home home to his sons mind in hartlepool on a sunday night early in the autumn of he had intended to talk to certain new friends in romania but that would have to wait as for his collision with the future of some other person he hardly knew what to make of that but in the brief moment before its expiry he was sure that he had recognised that fading echo of a mind and that was the most puzzling thing of all chapter twelve genoa is a city of contrasts from the lowlevel poverty in the cobbled alleys and sleazy bars of its waterfront areas to its highrise luxury apartments looking down on the streets from broad windows and spacious sunbalconies from the immaculate swimming pools of the rich to the dirty oilblackened beaches from the shadowy claustrophobic labyrinthine alleys down in the guts of the city to the airy hugely proportioned stradas and piazzas contrast is everywhere evident gracious gardens give way to chasms of concrete the comparative silence of select residential suburbs is torn cityward by blasts of traffic noise which lessen not at all through the night and the sweet air of the higher levels gives way to dust and blue exhaust fumes in the congested sunless slums built on a mountainside genoas levels are many and dizzying british intelligences safe house there was an enormous topfloor flat in a towering block overlooking the corso aurelio saffi to the front facing the ocean the block rose five highceilinged storeys above the road at the rear because its foundations were sunk into the summit of a fang of rock with the building perched on its rim there was a second level three floors deeper the aspect from the stubby lowwalled rear balconies was vertiginous and especially so to jason cornwell alias mr brown genoa sunday pm but in romania harry keogh was still talking to the vampirehunters in their suite of rooms in lonesti and would soon set off to follow his lifethread into the near future and in devon yulian bodescu continued to worry about the men who were watching him and worked out a plan to discover who they were and what their interest was but here in genoa jason cornwell sat thinlipped and stiffly erect in his chair and watched theo dolgikh using a kitchen knife to pick the rotten mortar out of the stonework of the balconys already dangerous wall and the sweat on cornwells upper lip and in his armpits had little or nothing to do with genoas sticky sultry indian summer atmosphere but it did have to do with the fact that dolgikh had caught him out trapped the british spider in his own web right here in this safe house normally the flat would be occupied by a staff of two or three other secret service agents but because cornwell was busy with stuff beyond the scope of ordinary espionage a specialist job as it were the regular occupiers had been called away on other work leaving the premises suitably empty and accessible to brown alone brown had taken dolgikh on saturday but only a little more than twentyfour hours later the russian had managed to turn the tables feigning sleep dolgikh had waited until sunday noon when brown went out for a glass of beer and a sandwich then had worked frenziedly to free himself from the ropes that bound him when brown returned fifty minutes later dolgikh had taken him completely by surprise later brown had come to with a start mind and flesh simultaneously assaulted by smelling salts squirted into his nostrils and sharp kicks in his sensitive places hed found their positions reversed for now he was tied in the chair while dolgikh was the one with the smile except that the russians smile was that of a hyena there had been one thing really only one that dolgikh wanted to know where were krakovitch kyle and co now it was quite obvious to the russian that hed been taken out of the game deliberately which might possibly mean that it was being played for high stakes now it was his intention to get back in i dont know where they are brown had told him im just a minder i mind people and i mind my own business dolgikh whose english was good however guttural wasnt having any if he couldnt find out where the espers were that was the end of his mission his next job would likely be in siberia how did they get on to me i got on to you recognised your ugly face details of which ive already passed on to london as for them recognising you without me they wouldnt have been able to spot you in a monkeyhouse at the zoo not that that would mean a lot if you told them about me they must have told you why they wanted me stopped and they probably told you where they were going now youll tell me i cant do that at that dolgikh had come very close no longer smiling mr secret agent minder or whatever you are you are in a lot of trouble the trouble is this that unless you cooperate i will surely kill you krakovitch and his soldier friend are traitors for they must at least have knowledge of this you told them i was here they gave you your orders or at least went along with those orders i am a field agent outside my country working against my countrys enemies i will not hesitate to kill you if you are obstinate but things will get very unpleasant before you die do you understand me brown had understood well enough all this talk of killing he tuttutted i could have killed you many times over but those werent my instructions i was to delay you thats all why blow it up bigger than it is why are the british espers working with krakovitch what are they doing the trouble with this psychic gang is this both sides think theyre bigger than the rest of us they think mind should rule the world and not muscle but you and me and the others like us we know thats not the way it is the strongest always wins the great warrior triumphs while the great thinker is still thinking about it like you and me you do what they tell you and i work from instinct and im the one on top are you is that why you use the threat of death last chance mr minder where are they still brown wasnt saying anything he merely smiled and gritted his teeth dolgikh had no more time to waste he was an expert in interrogation which on this occasion meant torture basically there are two types of torture mental and physical just looking at brown dolgikh guessed that pain alone wouldnt crack him not in the short term anyway dolgikh wasnt carrying the rather special tools hed require he could always improvise but it wouldnt be the same also he didnt wish to mark brown not initially anyway it must therefore be psychological fear and the russian had discovered browns weakness at the very first pass youll notice he told the british agent conversationally that while you are securely trussed a far better job than you did on me i have not in fact bound you to the chair then he had opened tall louvre doors leading out onto a shallow rear balcony i assume youve been out here to admire the view brown had gone pale in a moment oh dolgikh was onto him in a flash something about heights my friend he had dragged browns chair out onto the balcony then swung it sharply round so that brown was thrown against the wall six inches of brick and mortar and a crumbling plaster finish saved him from space and gravity and his face told the whole story dolgikh had left him there hurried through the flat and checked out his suspicion sure enough he found every window and balcony door shuttered closing off not only the light but the height especially the height mr brown suffered from vertigo and after that it had been a different game entirely the russian had dragged brown back inside and positioned him in his chair six feet from the balcony then hed taken a kitchen knife and started to loosen the masonry of the wall in plain view of the helpless agent as hed worked so hed explained what he was about now were going to start again and i will ask you certain questions if you answer correctly which is to say truthfully and without obstruction then you stay right where you are better still you stay alive but every time you fail to answer or tell a lie i shall move you a little closer to the balcony and loosen more of the mortar naturally ill become frustrated if you dont play the game my way indeed i shall probably lose my temper in which case i may be tempted to throw you against the wall again except that the next time i do that the wall will be so much weaker and so the game had begun that had been about pm and now it was pm the face of the balcony wall which had become the focus of browns entire being was now thoroughly defaced and many of the bricks were visibly loose worse browns chair now stood with its front legs on the balcony itself no more than three feet from the wall beyond that wall the citys silhouette and the mountains behind it were sprinkled with twinkling lights dolgikh stood up from his handiwork scuffed at the rubble with his feet sadly shook his head well mr minder you have done quite well but not quite well enough now as i suspected might be the case i am tired and a little frustrated you have told me many things some important and others unimportant but you have not yet told me what i most want to know my patience is at an end he moved to stand behind brown and pushed the chair gratingly forward right up to the wall browns chin came level with the top which faced him only eighteen inches away do you want to live mr minder dolgikhs voice was soft and deadly in fact the russian fully intended to kill brown if only to pay him back for yesterday from browns point of view dolgikh had no need to kill him it would be a pointless exercise and could only queer it for dolgikh with british intelligence who would doubtless place him on their long overdue list but from the russians viewpoint he was already on several lists and in any case murder was something he enjoyed brown couldnt he absolutely sure of dolgikhs intentions however and where theres life theres always hope the trussed agent looked across the top of the wall at genoas myriad lights london will know who did it if you he started to say then gave a small shriek as dolgikh jerked the chair violently brown opened his eyes drew breath raggedly sat gulping trembling close to fainting there was really only one thing in the world that he feared and here it was right in front of him the reason hed become useless to the sas he could feel the emptiness underneath him as if he were already falling well said the russian sighing i cant say it was a pleasure knowing you but im sure it will be a great pleasure not knowing you and so wait brown gasped promise me youll take me back inside if i tell you dolgikh shrugged i shall only kill you if you make me not answering will be more suicide than murder brown licked his lips hell it was his life kyle and the others had their head start hed done enough romania bucharest he blurted they took a plane last night to get into bucharest around midnight dolgikh stepped beside him cocked his head on one side and looked down at his sweating upturned face you know that i only have to telephone the airport and check of course brown sobbed his tears were open and unashamed his nerve had gone entirely now get me inside the russian smiled i shall be delighted he stepped out of browns view the agent felt him sawing with his knife at the ropes where they bound his wrists behind him the ropes parted and brown groaned as he brought his arms round in front of him stiff with cramp he could hardly move them dolgikh cut his feet free and collected up the short lengths of rope brown made an effort started to rise unsteadily to his feet and without warning the russian put both hands on his back and used all his strength to push him forward brown cried out sprawled forward went crashing over and through the wall into space fancy brickwork fragments of plaster and mortar fell with him dolgikh hawked and spat after him then wiped his mouth with the back of his hand from far below there came a single heavy thud and the crashing of fallen masonry moments later the russian put on browns lightweight overcoat left the flat and wiped the doorknob behind him he took the lift to the ground floor and left the building walking unhurriedly fifty yards down the road he stopped a taxi and asked to be taken to the airport on the way he wound down the window tossed out a few short lengths of rope the driver busy with the traffic didnt see him by that night theo dolgikh had been in touch with his immediate superior in moscow and was already on his way to bucharest if dolgikh hadnt been incapacitated for the past twentyfour hours if hed had the chance to contact his controller earlier he would have discovered where kyle krakovitch and the others had gone without killing mr brown for that information not that it mattered greatly for he knew he would have killed him anyway moreover he could have learned something of what the espers were doing there in romania that in fact they were searching for something in the ground dolgikhs controller hadnt wanted to be more specific than that treasure maybe dolgikh couldnt imagine and he wasnt really interested he put the question out of his mind whatever they were doing it wasnt good for russia and that was enough for him now crammed in the tiny seat of the passenger aircraft as it sped across the northern adriatic he tilted himself backwards a little and relaxed allowing his mind to drift with the hum of the engines romania the region around lonesti something in the ground it was all very strange strangest of all dolgikhs controller was one of them one of these damned psychic spies whom andropov so heartily detested the kgb man closed his eyes and chuckled what would krakovitchs reaction be he wondered when he eventually discovered that the traitor in his precious ebranch was his own second in command a man called ivan gerenko yulian bodescu had not spent a pleasant night even the presence of his beautiful cousin in his bed her lovely body his to use in whichever way amused him had not compensated for his nightmares and fantasies and frustrated halfmemories out of a past not entirely his own it was all down to the watchers yulian supposed those damned busybodies whose spying over the last fortyeight hours had become an almost unbearable irritation oh he no longer had any real cause to fear them george lake was fine ashes and the three women would never dare go against yulian but still the men were there like an itch you cant scratch or one you arent able to reach for the moment yes it was down to them they had brought on yulians nightmares his dreams of wooden stakes steel swords and bright searing flames as for those other dreams of low hills in the shape of a cross tall dark trees and of a thing in the ground that called and called to him beckoning with fingers that dripped blood yulian was not quite sure what he should make of them for he had been there actually there on the cruciform hills the night his father died he had been a mere foetus in his mothers womb when it had happened he knew that but what else had happened that time his roots were there anyway yulian felt sure of that but the fact remained that there was only one way he could ever be absolutely sure and that would be to answer the call and go there indeed a trip to romania might well be useful in solving two problems at once for with the secret watchers out there in the fields and lanes around harkley now was probably as good a time as any to make himself scarce for a while except first he would like to know what the real purpose of those watchers was were they merely suspicious or did they actually know something and if so what did they intend to do about it yulian had already developed a plan to get those questions answered it was just a matter of getting it right that was all the sky was cloudy and the morning dull that monday when yulian rose up from his bed he told helen to bathe dress herself prettily go about the house and grounds just as if her life were completely normal unchanged he dressed and went down to the cellars where he gave the same instructions to anne likewise his mother in her room just act naturally and let nothing appear suspicious indeed helen could even drive him into torquay for an hour or two they were followed into torquay but yulian was not aware of it he was distracted by the sun which kept breaking through the clouds and reflecting off mirrors windows and chrome he still affected his broadbrimmed hat and sunglasses but his hatred of the sun and its effect on him were much stronger now the cars mirrors irritated him his reflection in the windows and other bright surfaces disturbed him his vampire awareness was playing hell with his nerves he felt closed in danger threatened and he knew it but from which quarter what sort of danger while helen waited in the car three storeys up in a municipal car park he went to a travel agency and made inquiries then gave instructions this took a little time for the holiday he had chosen was outside the usual scope of the agency he wanted to spend a week in romania yulian might simply have phoned one of londons airports and made a booking but he preferred to let an authorised agency advise him on restrictions visas etc this way there would be no errors no last minute holdups also yulian couldnt stay penned up in harkley house forever driving into town had at least given him a break from routine from his watchers and from the increasing pressures of being a creature alone what was more the drive had let him keep up appearances helen was his pretty cousin down from london and he and she were simply out for a drive enjoying what was left of the good weather so it would appear after making his travel arrangements yulian took helen for lunch while she ate listlessly and tried desperately hard not to look fearful of him he sipped a glass of red wine and smoked a cigarette he might have tried a steak rare but food ordinary food no longer appealed instead he found himself watching helens throat he was aware of the danger in that however and so concentrated his mind on the details of his plan for tonight instead certainly he did not intend to stay hungry for very long by pm they had driven back to harkley and then too yulian had briefly picked up the thoughts of another watcher hed tried to infiltrate the strangers mind but it immediately shut him out they were clever these watchers furious he raged inwardly through the afternoon and could scarcely contain himself until the fall of night peter keen was a comparatively recent recruit to intesps team of parapsychologists a sporadic telepath hed been recruited after tipping off the police on a murdertobe he had accidentally scanned the mind the dark intention of the wouldbe rapist and murderer when it happened just as hed said it would a highranking policeman a friend of the branch had passed details on to intesp the job in devon was keens first field assignment for until now all of his time had been spent with his instructors yulian bodescu was under full twentyfour hour surveillance now and keen had the midmorning shift am till pm at when the girl had driven bodescu back through harkleys gates and up to the house keen had been only two hundred yards behind in his red capri driving straight past harkley hed stopped at the first telephone kiosk and phoned headquarters passing on details of bodescus outing at the hotel in paignton darcy clarke took keens call and passed the telephone to the man in charge of the operation a jolly fat middleaged chainsmoking scryer called guy roberts normally roberts would be in london employing his scrying to track russian submarines terrorist bomb squads and the like but now he was here as head of operations keeping his mental eye on yulian bodescu roberts had found the task not at all to his liking and far from easy the vampire is a solitary creature whose nature it is to be secretive there is that in a vampires mental makeup which shields him as effectively as the night screens his physical being roberts could see harkley house only as a vague shadowy place as a scene viewed through dense weaving mist when bodescu was there this mental miasma rolled that much more densely making it difficult for roberts to pinpoint any specific person or object practice makes perfect however and the longer roberts stayed with it the clearer his pictures were coming he could now state for certain for instance that harkley house was occupied by only four people bodescu his mother his aunt and her daughter but there was something else there too two somethings in fact one of them was bodescus dog but obscured by the same aura which was very strange and the other was simply the other like yulian himself roberts thought of it only that way but whatever it was in all likelihood the thing in the cellars which alec kyle had warned about it was certainly there and it was alive roberts here the scryer spoke into the telephone what is it peter keen passed his message travel agency roberts frowned yes well get on to it at once your relief hes on his way right now trevor jordan yes see you later peter roberts put down the telephone and picked up a directory moments later he was phoning the travel agency in torquay whose name and address keen had given him when he got an answer roberts held a handkerchief to his mouth contrived a young voice hello er hello hello came back the answer sunsea travel here whos calling please it was a male voice deep and smooth seem to have a bad line roberts replied keeping his voice to a medium pitch can you hear me i was in oh an hour ago mr bodescu ah yes sir the booking agent raised his voice your romanian inquiry bucharest any time in the next two weeks right roberts gave a start made an effort to keep his muffled voice even er romania yes thats right he thought fast furiously fast er look im sorry to be a nuisance but yes well ive decided i cant make it after all maybe next year eh ah there was some disappointment in the others tone well thats the way it goes thanks for calling sir so youre definitely cancelling right yes roberts jiggled the phone a bit im afraid i have to damn bad line this anyway somethings come up and well dont worry about it mr bodescu the travel agent cut him off it happens all the time and anyway i havent yet found the time to make any real inquiries so no harm done but do let me know if you change your mind again wont you oh indeed i will i will most helpful of you sorry to have been such a nuisance not at all sir bye now er goodbye roberts put the phone down darcy clarke who had been party to this exchange said sheer genius well done chief roberts looked up but didnt smile romania he repeated ominously things are hotting up darcy ill be glad when kyle gets his call through hes two hours overdue at that very moment the phone rang again clarke inclined his head knowingly now thats what i call a talent if it doesnt happen make it roberts pictured romania in his minds eye his own interpretation for hed never been there then superimposed an image of alec kyle over a rugged romanian countryside he closed his eyes and kyles picture came up in photographic no live detail roberts here guy kyles voice came back crisp with static listen i intended to route this through london john grieve but i couldnt get him roberts knew what he meant obviously he would have liked the call to be one hundred per cent secure i cant help you there he answered theres no one that special around right now are there problems then shouldnt think so in the eye of robertss mind kyle was frowning we lacked a bit of privacy in genoa but that cleared up as for why im late its like contacting mars getting through from here talk about antiquated systems if i didnt have local help anyway have you got anything for me can we talk straight well have to roberts quickly brought him up to date finishing with bodescus thwarted trip to romania in his minds eye he saw as well as physically hearing kyles gasp of horror then the head of intesp got hold of his emotions even if bodescus plans to come over here hadnt been foiled still it would have been too late for him by the time weve finished over here he grimly told roberts therell be nothing left for him anyway and by the time youve finished over there he wont be able to go anywhere then he told roberts in detail exactly what he wanted done it took him a good fifteen minutes to make sure he covered everything when roberts asked him when he was finished kyle was cautious are you part of the surveillance team i mean do you physically go out to the house and watch him no i coordinate im always here at the ho but i do want to be in on the kill very well ill tell you when its to be said kyle but youre not to pass it on to the others not until as close as possible to zero hour itself i dont want bodescu picking it out of someones mind that makes sense wait roberts sent clarke into the next room out of earshot ok when tomorrow in daylight lets settle for pm your time by then well have done our bit just an hour or so earlier there are certain obvious reasons why daylight will be best and on your side of the job one not so obvious reason when harkley goes up itll make a big blaze youll need to make sure local fire services dont get there too soon and put it out if it was at night the flames would be visible for miles anyway thats for you to work on but the last thing you want is outside interference ok got it said roberts thats it then said kyle we probably wont be talking again until its all finished so good luck good luck roberts answered letting kyles face fade in his mind as he replaced the receiver in its cradle most of monday found harry keogh trying without success to break the magnetic attraction of his sons psyche there was no way the child fought him clung to both harry and the waking world alike with an incredible tenacity would not go to sleep brenda keogh marked the babys fever thought to call a doctor then changed her mind but she determined that if the baby stayed as bad tempered through the night and if in the morning his temperature was still on the high side then shed get advice she couldnt know that harry jnrs fever resulted from the mental contest he waged with his father a fight the infant was winning hands down but harry snr knew it well enough the babys will and his strength both were enormous the childs mind was a black hole whose gravity must surely pull harry in entirely and harry had discovered something that indeed a mind without a body can grow weary and just like flesh be worn down so that when he could no longer fight he gave in and retreated into himself glad that for now his vain striving and struggling were over like a game fish on the end of a line he allowed himself to be reeled in close to the boat but he knew he must fight again when he sensed the gaff poised to strike incorporeal it would be harrys last chance to retain an individual identity that was why he would fight for the continuation of his existence but he couldnt help wondering what did all of this mean to his son why did harry jnr want him was it simply the terrific greed of any healthy infant or was it something else entirely as for the baby himself he recognised his fathers partial surrender accepted the fact that for now the fight was over and he had no means by which to tell this fantastic adult that it wasnt a fight at all not really but simply a desperate desire to know to learn father and son two minds in one small fragile defenceless body both of them took the welcome opportunity to sleep and at pm when brenda keogh looked in on her baby son she was pleased to note that he lay still and at peace in his cot and that his temperature was down again about pm that same monday afternoon in lonesti irma dobresti had just answered a telephone call from bucharest the telephone conversation had grown sufficiently heated to cause the rest of the party to listen in krakovitchs face had fallen telling kyle and quint that something was amiss when irma was through and after shed hurled the phone down krakovitch spoke up despite the fact that all of this should have been cleared now there is a problems from the lands ministry some idiot is questioning our authority you are remembering this romania not russia the land we want to burn is common land and has belonged to the people since time how do you say immemorial if it was just some farmers property we could buy him off but he shrugged helplessly this is correct irma spoke up men from the ministry from ploiesti will be coming here to talk to us later tonight i dont knowing how this leaked out but this is officially their area and under their er jurisdiction yes it could be big problems questions and answers not everyone believe in vampires but arent you from the ministry kyle was alarmed i mean we have to get the job done they had driven out early that morning to the spot where almost two decades ago ilya bodescus body had been recovered from a tangle of undergrowth and densely grown firs on a steep southfacing slope of the cruciform hills and when they had climbed higher then theyd come across thibors mausoleum there where lichencovered slabs had leaned like menhirs under the motionless trees all three psychics kyle quint and krakovitch alike had felt the still extant menace of the place they had left quickly wasting no time irma had called up her team of civil engineers a foreman and five men based in pitesti through krakovitch kyle had put a question to the hardhat boss are you and your men used to handling this stuff thermite oh yes sometimes we blast and sometimes we burn ive worked for you russians before up north in berezov we used it all the time to soften up the permafrost cant see the point of it here though plague said krakovitch at once by way of explanation it was an invention of his own weve come across old records that tell of a mass burial of plague victims right here although it was three hundred years ago the soil deep down is still likely to be infected these hills have been redesignated arable land before we let any unsuspecting farmer start ploughing it up or terracing the hillside we want to make sure its safe right down to the bedrock irma dobresti had caught all of this she had raised an eyebrow at krakovitch but said nothing and how did you soviets get involved the hardhat had wanted to know krakovitch had anticipated that one we dealt with a similar case in moscow just a year ago he had answered which was more or less the truth still the hardhat had been curious and the british now irma stepped in because they may have a similar problem in england she snapped and so theyre here to see how we deal with it right the ganger hadnt minded facing up to krakovitch but he wasnt going to go against irma dobresti where do you want your holes hed asked and how deep by just after midday the preparations were completed all that remained was for the detonators to be wired up to a plunger a ten minute job which for safetys sake could wait until tomorrow carl quint had suggested we could finish it now but kyle had decided against it we dont really know what were playing with here hed answered also when the jobs done i dont want to hang about but get straight on with the next phase faethors castle in the khorvaty i imagine that after weve burned this hillside therell be all kinds of people coming up here to see what weve been up to so id prefer to be out of it the same day this afternoon felix has travel arrangements to see to and ive a call to make to our friends in devon by the time thats done the light will be failing and id prefer to work in daylight after a good nights sleep so sometime tomorrow in the afternoon while the suns still slanting onto that hillside then hed turned to krakovitch felix are these men going back to pitesti today they will be krakovitch answered if there is nothing else for them to do until tomorrow afternoon why are you asking this kyle had shrugged just a feeling he said i would have liked them to be closer at hand but i too have had a feeling the russian answered frowning i am thinking nerves perhaps that makes all three of us then carl quint had added so lets hope that it is just nerves and nothing else right all of that had been midmorning and everything had appeared to be going smoothly and now suddenly there was this threat of outside interference between times kyle had made his call to devon taking two hours to get through and had arranged for the strike against harkley house damn it he snapped now it has to be tomorrow ministry or none weve got to go ahead with this we should have done it this morning said quint when we were right on top of it irma dobresti stepped in she narrowed her eyes and said listen these local bureaucrats are annoying me why dont you four just drive back to the site right now i mean see i was perhaps alone when that call came in you men were all out there in the foothills doing your job ill telephone pitesti get chevenu and those rough men of his back up there to meet you at the site you can do the job i mean finish it tonight kyle stared at her thats a good idea irma but what about you wont you be setting yourself up wont they give you a hard time what she looked surprised at the suggestion is it my fault i was alone here when i took that telephone call is it me for blaming that my taxi took a wrong turning and i couldnt find you to stop you from burning the hills all these country tracks looking the same to me krakovitch kyle and quint all three grinned at each other sergei gulharov was mainly out of it but he sensed the excitement of the others and stood up nodding his head as if in agreement da da right said kyle lets do it and on impulse he grabbed irma dobresti pulled her close and kissed her soundly monday night middleeuropean time and in england pm there was fire and nightmare on the cruciform hills under the moon and stars and the looming carpatii meridionali and the nightmare transferred itself westward across mountains and rivers and oceans to yulian bodescu where he tossed on his bed and sweatedthe chill rank sweat of fear in his garret room at harkley house exhausted by the unspecified fears of the day he now suffered the telepathic torments of thibor the wallach the vampire whose last physical vestiges were finally being consumed there was no way back for the vampire now but unlike faethor thibors spirit was unquiet restless malignant and it ached for revenge yuliaannn ah my son my one true son see what is become of your father now what yulian talked in his sleep imagined a blistering heat flames that crept ever closer and in the heart of the fire a figure beckoning who who are you ah you know me my son we met but briefly and you were still unborn at that meeting but you can remember if you try where am i for the moment with me ask not where you are but where i am these are the cruciform hills where it started for you and where it now ends for me for you this is merely a dream while for me it is reality you now yulian knew him the voice that called in the night unremembered until now the thing in the ground the source you my father indeed oh not through any lovers tryst with your mother not through the lust or love of a man for a woman no but your father nevertheless through blood yulian through blood yulian fought down his fear of the flames he sensed that he only dreamed however real and immediate the dream and knew he would not be hurt he advanced into the inferno of fire and drew close to the figure there black billowing smoke and crimson flames obscured his view and the heat was a furnace all around but there were questions yulian must ask and the burning thing was the only one who could answer them you have asked me to come and seek you out and i will come but why what is it you want of me too late too late the flamewreathed apparition cried out in anguish and yulian knew that his pain was not horn of the consuming fire but bitter frustration i would have been your teacher my son yes and you would have learned all the many secrets of the wamphyri in return i cant deny that there would have been a reward in it for me i would have walked again in the world of men known again the unbearable pleasures of my youth but too late all dreams and schemes to no avail ashes to ashes dust to dust the figure was slowly melting its outline gradually changing rendering down into itself yulian must know more must see more clearly he penetrated the very heart of the inferno came close up to the burning thing i already know the secrets of the wamphyri he cried above the roar and crackle of blazing trees and the hiss of molten earth i learned them for myself can you put on the shapes of lesser creatures i can go on all fours like a great dog yulian answered and in the night people would swear i was a dog hah a dog a man who would be a dog what is that for an ambition it is nothing can you form wings glide like a bat i havent tried you know nothing i can make others like myself fool that is the simplest of things not to make them is much harder when harmful men are nearby i sense their minds that is instinct which you got from me indeed everything you have you got from me so you read minds eh but can you bend those minds to your will with my eyes yes beguilment hypnotism a stage magicians trick you are an innocent damn you yulians pride was hurt at last his patience all used up what are you anyway but a dead thing ill tell you what ive learned i can take a dead creature and draw out its secrets and know all that it knew in life necromancy is it so and no one to show you how that is an achievement there is hope for you yet i can heal my own wounds as though they never were and ive the strength of any two men i could lie with a woman and love her to death if i desired and not even weary myself and only anger me dear father and then i could kill kill kill but not you for youre already dead hope for me ill say there is but what hope is there for you for a moment there was no answer from the melting thing then ahhh and indeed you are my son yuliaannn closer come closer still yulian moved to less than arms length from the thing facing it squarely the stench of its burning was monstrous its blackened outer shell began to crumble rapidly disintegrated and fell away the flames immediately attacked the inner image which yulian now saw almost as a reflection of himself it had the same features the same bone structure the same dark attraction the face of a fallen angel they could be peas from the same pod you you are my father he gasped i was the other groaned now i am nothing i am burning away as you see not the real me but something i left behind it was my last hope and through it and with your help i might have been a power in the world once again but its too late now then why do you concern yourself with me yulian tried to understand why have you come to me or drawn me to you if i cant help you whats the point of this revenge the burning things voice was suddenly sharp as a knife in yulians dreaming mind through you i should avenge you against whom against the ones who found me here the ones who even now destroy my last chance for a future against harry keogh and his pack of white magicians youre not making sense yulian shook his head gazed in morbid fascination as the thing continued to melt he saw his own features liquefying streaming away and falling from the burning creature in molten tatters what white magicians harry keogh i dont know anyone of that name but he knows you first me yulian and then you harry keogh knows us and he knows the way the stake the sword and the fire you tell me you can sense the presence of enemies and have you not sensed just such enemies close to you even now they are one and the same first me and then you even dreaming yulian felt his scalp crawling the secret watchers of course what must i do avenge me and save yourself that too is one and the same for they know what we are yulian and they cannot abide us you must kill them for if you dont theyll surely kill you the last scrap of human flesh fell from the nightmarish entity revealing at last its true inner reality yulian hissed his horror drew back a little way gazed upon the face of all evil he saw thibors bats snout his convoluted ears long jaws crimson eyes the vampire laughed at him the bass booming of a great hound and a split tongue flickered redly in a cave of teeth then as if someone had applied a giants bellows to the task the flames roared up higher still and rushed in and the image blackened at once and turned to glowing cinders trembling violently running with sweat yulian came awake sat bolt upright in his bed and as from a million miles away he heard again one last time thibors far faint voice avenge me yuliaannn he stood up in the dark room went shakily to the window looked out on the night out there a mind a man watching waiting sweat quickly dried on yulian and his flesh turned cold but still he stood there panic receded was replaced by rage hatred avenge you father he finally breathed oh i will i will in the windows luminous nightdark pane his reflection was an echo from the dream but yulian was neither shocked nor surprised it simply meant that his metamorphosis was now complete he looked through the reflection at the dark furtive shadow there in the hedgerow and grinned and his grin was like an invitation to step in through the gates of hell at the foot of the cruciform hills kyle and quint krakovitch and gulharov waited close together in a small group it wasnt cold but they stood together as if for warmth the fire was dying down now the wind which had earlier sprung up out of nowhere had quickly blown itself out like the dying breath of some unseen gargantuan human figures half hidden in the trees and the billowing black smoke toiled above and to the east of the devastated area containing the fire and beating it down a grimy coveralled hulk of a man came stumbling from the trees at the foot of the slope towards the vampire hunters where they huddled it was the romanian ganger janni chevenu you he grabbed krakovitchs arm plague you said but did you see it did you see that that thing before it burned it had eyes mouths it lashed writhed it it my god my god under the soot and sweat chevenus face was chalk slowly his glazed eyes cleared he looked from krakovitch to the others the gaunt faces that looked back seemed carved of the same raw emotion a horror no less than chevenus own plague you said he dazedly repeated but that wasnt any kind of plague i ever heard of krakovitch shook himself loose oh yes it was janni he finally answered it was the very worst kind just consider yourself lucky you were able to destroy it were in your debt all of us everywhere darcy clarke should have had the pm am shift instead he was bedded down at the hotel in paignton something hed eaten apparently stomach cramps and violent diarrhoea peter keen had taken the shift in clarkes place driving out to harkley house and relieving trevor jordan of the job of keeping bodescu under observation nothings happening up there jordan had whispered leaning in through the open window of his car handing keen a powerful crossbow with a hardwood bolt theres a light on downstairs but thats all theyre all in there or if not then they didnt come out through the gate the light did come on in bodescus attic room for a few minutes then went out again that was probably him getting his head down also i felt that there just might be someone probing for my thoughts but that lasted for only a moment since when its been quiet as the proverbial tomb keen had grinned however nervously except we know that not every tomb is quiet eh jordan hadnt found it funny peter thats a really weird sense of humour youve got there he nodded at the crossbow in keens hand do you know how to use that here ill load it for you thats ok keen nodded affably ill manage it all right but if you want to do me a real favour just make sure my reliefs on time at two in the morning jordan got into his car and started it trying not to rev the engine this makes twelve hours out of twentyfour for you doesnt it son youre a glutton for punishment keen by name and all that you should go far if you dont kill yourself first have a nice night and hed pulled carefully away in his car only turning on the lights when he was a hundred yards down the road that had been only half an hour ago but already keen was cursing himself for his big mouth his old man had been a soldier peter hed once told him never volunteer if they need volunteers thats because nobody wants the job and on a night like this it was easy to understand why there was something of a ground mist and the air was laden with moisture the atmosphere felt greasy and heavy as a tangible weight on keens shoulders he turned up his collar lifted infrared binoculars to his eyes for the tenth time in thirty minutes he scanned the house nothing the house was warm which showed clearly enough but nothing moved in there or the movement was too slight to detect he scanned what could be seen of the grounds again nothing or rather something keens sweep had passed over a hazy blue blur of warmth just a blob of body heat which his special nitelites had picked up it could be a fox badger dog or a man he tried to find it again failed so had he seen something or hadnt he something buzzed and tingled in keens head like a sudden burst of electrical current making him start slimy gibbergobble spying babblegabble bastard keen froze stiff as a board what was that what the hell was that youre going to die die die ha ha ha gibberjabber gobblegabble and then some more of the electrical tingling and silence jesus christ but keen knew without further inquiry what it was his unruly talent for a moment then just for a few seconds hed picked up another mind a mind full of hate who keen said out loud staring all about ankledeep in swirling mist what suddenly the night was full of menace hed left the crossbow in his car loaded and lying on the front seat the red capri was parked withits nose in a field about twentyfive yards away along the road keen was on the verge his shoes socks and feet already soaking from walking in the grass he looked at harkley house standing sinister in its misty grounds then started to back off towards the car in the grounds of the old house something loped towards the open gate keen saw it for a moment then lost it in the shadows and the mist a dog a large dog darcy clarke had had trouble with a dog hadnt he keen backed faster stumbled and almost fell an owl hooted somewhere in the night other than that there was only silence and a soft deliberate padding and a panting from beyond the gate just across the road keen backed faster yet all his senses alert his nerves starting to jump something was coming he could feel it and not just a dog he slammed backwards into the side of his car drew breath in an audible grateful gasp he half turned reached in through the open window groped with his hand on the front seat he found something drew it into view the lignum vitae bolt broken in two halves hanging together by a mere splinter of wood keen shook his head in dumb disbelief reached into the car again this time he found the crossbow unloaded its tough metal wings bent back and twisted out of shape something tall and black flowed out of the shadows right up to him it wore a cape which at the last moment it threw back keen looked into a face which wasnt nearly human he tried to scream but his throat felt like sandpaper the thing in black glared at keen and its lips drew back its teeth were hooked together meshing like the teeth of a shark keen tried to run leap move but couldnt his feet were rooted to the spot the thing in black raised its arm in a swift movement and something gleamed a wet silvery gleam in the night a cleaver chapter thirteen when kyle and his companions got back to lonesti and the inn they found irma dobresti pacing the floor of their suite nervously massaging her long hands her relief when she saw them was obvious likewise her delight when they told her the operation had been a complete success they werent eager however to detail much of what had happened in the foothills looking at their drawn faces she was wise enough not to pry they might tell her later in their own time so she said after theyd had a drink the job is done here we are not needing to stay any longer in lonesti it is tenthirty late i know but i am suggesting we go now these red tape dolts will arrive soon is better if we are not here red tape quint looked surprised i didnt know you used that term er over here oh yes she answered unsmiling also commie and zurich gnome and capitalist dog i agree with irma said kyle if we wait well only be obliged to brazen it out or tell the truth and the truth while it is verifiable in the long term isnt immediately believable no i can see all kinds of problems coming up if we stay here all true she nodded sighing her relief that the englishman was of a like mind later if they are determined to talk about this they can contact me in bucharest there i am on my own ground with the backing of my superiors i am not for blaming this was a matter of national security a liaison of a scientific preventative nature between three great countries romania russia and great britain i am secure but right now here in lonesti i do not feel secure so lets get to it said quint with his usual efficiency irma showed her yellow teeth in one of her infrequent smiles no need for getting to it she informed nothing to get to i took the liberty of packing your bags can we go now please without more ado they paid the bill and left krakovitch opted to drive giving sergei gulharov a break as they sped back towards bucharest on the night roads gulharov sat beside irma in the back of the car and quietly filled her in as best he could on the story of what had happened in the hills the monstrous thing they had burned there when he was finished she said simply your faces told me it must have been like that i am glad i not seeing it after his last painful visit at about pm darcy clarke had slept like a log in his hotel bedroom for nearly three hours solid when he woke up he felt fighting fit all very mysterious hed never known an attack of gastroenteritis to come and go so quickly and he had no idea what he could have eaten to cause it whatever it had been the rest of the team had felt no ill effects it was because he didnt want to let that team down that clarke dressed quickly and went to report himself fit for duty in the control room he found guy roberts slumped in his swivel chair head on his folded arms where he sprawled across his desk a dining table cluttered with notes a log book and a telephone he was fast asleep with an ashtray piled full of dogends right under his nose a tobacco addict he probably wouldnt be able to sleep comfortably without it trevor jordan snoozed in a deep armchair while ken layard and simon gower quietly played their own version of chinese patience at a small greenbaize card table gower a prognosticator or augur of some talent played badly making too many mistakes cant concentrate he growlingly complained i have this feeling of bad stuff coming lots of it stop making excuses said layard hell we know bad stuff is coming and we know where from we dont know when thats all no gower frowned tossed in his hand i mean not of our making when we go against harkley and bodescu that will be different this thing im feeling is he shrugged uneasily something else so maybe we should wake up the fat man there and tell him layard suggested gower shook his head ive been telling him for the last three days it isnt specific it never is but its there you could be right im probably feeling the dingdong coming up at harkley house if so then believe me its going to be a good one anyway let old roberts kip hes tired and when hes awake the place stinks of bloody weed ive seen him with three going at once god you need a respirator clarke stepped round robertss snoring form tocheck the roster roberts had only mapped it out until the end of the afternoon shift keen was on now to be relieved by layard a locator or finder who in turn would watch harkley till am then it would be gowers turn until pm followed by trevor jordan the roster went no farther than that clarke wondered if that was significant maybe that was what gower was feeling a dingdong as he had it but a little closer than he thought layard cocked his head on one side looked at clarke where he studied the roster whats up old son still got the runs you can stop worrying about shift work at harkley guy has pulled you off it gower looked up and managed a grin he doesnt want you polluting the bushes out there haha said clarke his face blank actually im fine now and im starving ken you can go and jump in your bed if you like ill take the next shift thatll adjust the roster back to normal what a hero layard gave a soft whistle great six hours in bed will suit me just fine he stood up stretched did you say you were hungry there are sandwiches under the plate on the table there a bit curly by now but still edible clarke started to munch on a sandwich glancing at his watch it was pm ill have a quick shower and get on my way when roberts wakes up tell him im on right gower stood up went to clarke and stared hard at him darcy is there something on your mind no clarke shook his head then changed his mind yes i dont know i just want to get out to harkley thats all do my bit twentyfive minutes later he was on his way shortly before am clarke parked his car on the hard shoulder of the road maybe quarter of a mile from harkley house and walked the rest of the way the mist had thinned out and the night was starting to look fine stars lit his way and the hedgerows had a nimbus of foxfire to sharpen their silhouettes oddly enough and for all his terrifying confrontation with bodescus dog clarke felt no fear he put it down to the fact that he carried a loaded gun and that back there in the boot of his car was a small but quite deadly metal crossbow after he had seen peter keen off duty hed bring up his car and park it in keens spot on his way he met no one but he heard a dog yapping across the fields and another answering bark for bark apparently from miles away a handful of hazy lights shone softly on the hills and just as he came in sight of harkleys gates a distant church clock dutifully gonged out the hour two oclock and alls well thought clarke except he saw that it wasnt there was no sign of keens unmistakeable red capri for one thing and for another there was no sign of keen clarke scratched his head scuffed the grass where keens car should be parked the wet grass gave up a broken branch and no it wasnt a branch clarke stooped picked up the snapped crossbow bolt in fingers that were suddenly tingling something was very very wrong here he looked up staring at harkley house standing there like a squat sentient creature in the night its eyes were closed now but what was hiding behind the lowered lids of its dark windows all of clarkes senses were operating at maximum efficiency his ears picked up the rustle of a mouse his eyes glared to penetrate the darkness he could taste almost feel the evil in the night air and something stank literally the stink of a slaughterhouse clarke took out a pencilslim torch and flashed it on the grass which was red and wet and sticky the cuffs of his trousers were stained a dark crimson with blood someone had spilled pints of the stuff right here clarkes legs trembled and he felt faint but he forced himself to follow a track a bloody swath to a spot behind the hedgerow hidden from the road and there it was much worse did one man have that much blood clarke wanted to be sick but that would incapacitate him and right now he dare not be incapacitated but the grass it was strewn with clots of blood shreds of skin and gobbets of of meat human flesh and under the narrow beam of his torch there was something else something which might just be god a kidney clarke ran or rather floated fought swam drifted as in a dream or nightmare back to his car drove like a madman back to paignton hurled himself into intesps suite of rooms he was in shock remembered nothing of the drive nothing at all except what hed seen which had seared itself onto his mind he fell into a chair and lolled there gasping trembling his mouth face all of his limbs even his mind trembling guy roberts had come halfawake when clarke rushed in he saw him the state of his trousers the dead white slackness of his face and was fully alert in an instant he dragged clarke to his feet and slapped him twice ringing blows that brought the colour back to clarkes cheeks and blood to his previously blank eyes clarke drew himself up and glared he growled and showed his gritted teeth went for roberts like a madman trevor jordan and simon gower dragged him off roberts held him tight and at last be broke down sobbing like a child finally he told the whole story the only thing he didnt tell was the one which must be perfectly obvious why it had affected him so very badly obvious yes said roberts to the others cradling clarkes head and rocking him like a child you know what darcys talent is dont you thats right he has this thing that looks after him what he could walk through a minefield and come out unscathed so you see darcys blaming himself for what happened he had the shits tonight and couldnt go on duty but it wasnt anything he ate that queered his guts it was his damned talent or else it would be darcy himself minced out there and not peter keen tuesday am alex kyle was shaken rudely awake by carl quint krakovitch was with quint both of them holloweyed through travel and lack of sleep they had stayed overnight at the dunarea where theyd checked in just before am they had had maybe four hours sleep krakovitch had been roused by night staff to answer a call from england on behalf of his english guests quint knowing by means of his talent that something was in the air had been awake anyway ive had the call transferred to my room said krakovitch to kyle who was still gathering his senses it is someone called roberts he is wishing to speak to you most important kyle shook himself awake glanced at quint somethings up quint said ive suspected it for a couple of hours i tossed and turned sleep all broken up but too tired to respond properly all three in pyjamas they went quickly to krakovitchs room on the way the russian inquired how do they know where you are your people it is them yes i mean we had not planned to be here tonight quint raised an eyebrow in his fashion were in the same business as you felix remember krakovitch was impressed a finder very accurate quint didnt bother to put him right ken layard was good all right but not that good the better he knew a person or thing the easier he could find him or it hed have located kyle in bucharest theyd have systematically checked out the major hotels since the dunarea was one of the biggest it must have come up high on the list in krakovitchs room kyle took the call guy alec here alec we have a big problem its bad im afraid can we talk cant it go through london kyle was fully awake now thatll take time roberts answered and times important wait said kyle he said to krakovitch what are the odds this is being monitored the russian shrugged shook his head none at all that i can see he stepped to the window opened the curtains it would soon be dawn ok guy kyle spoke into the phone lets have it right said roberts its just about four am here now go back two hours he told kyle the entire story then detailed the action hed taken since clarkes hagridden drive back to the hotel in paignton i got ken layard in on it he was great he fixed keens location somewhere on the road between brixham and newton abbot keen and his car smashed up burned out i scried out layards fix and he was right of course we were able to say quite definitely that peter was that he was dead i contacted the police in paignton told them i was waiting for a friend who was a little overdue gave them his name description a description of his car they said thered been an accident he was being cut out of the car they could tell me no more but an ambulance was on the scene and the driver of the car would be taken to the emergency hospital in torquay for me that was a ten minute drive i was there when he was brought in i identified him he paused go on said kyle knowing there must be worse to come alec i feel responsible we should have been tighter the trouble with this game is that we rely on our talents too damned much weve almost forgotten how to use simple technology we should have had walkietalkies better contact we should have given this damned monster more credit for mayhem i mean christ how could i let this happen were espers we have special talents bodescu is only one man and were hes not just a man kyle snapped and we dont have a monopoly on talent he has it too its not your fault now please tell me the rest of it he peter was hell he didnt get those injuries in any car smash hed been opened up gutted everything was exposed his head was god it was in two halves despite the horror conjured by robertss description kyle tried to think dispassionately hed known peter keen well and liked him but now he must put that aside and think only of the job why the car smash what did that bastard hope to get out of it the way i see it roberts answered he was just covering up the murder and what hed done to peters poor body the police said there was a strong petrol smell all around and inside the car i reckon bodescu drove peter out there put the car in top gear pointed it downhiil and let it roll being what he is a few grazes and cuts wouldnt matter much when he jumped for it and he probably splashed a lot of petrol around inside the car first so as to bum the evidence but the way hed cut that poor lad up was jesus it was horrible i mean why peter must have been dead long before that ghoul was finished if he was torturing him at least thered be some sense in it i mean however horrible at least i could understand it but you cant learn anything from a dead man now can you kyle almost dropped the telephone oh my god he whispered eh kyle said nothing stood frozen in sudden shock alec yes you can kyle finally answered you can learn an awful lot from a dead man everything in fact if youre a necromancer roberts had had access to the keogh file now it all came back to mind and he saw kyles meaning you mean like dragosani i mean exactly like dragosani quint had caught most of this good lord he grabbed kyles elbow he knows all about us he knows everything kyle said to quint and to roberts he knows the lot he dragged it out of keens guts out of his brains his blood his poor violated organs guy now listen this is important did keen know when you plan to move in on harkley house no im the only one who knows that those were your instructions thats right good well we can thank god we got that right anyway now listen im coming home tonight i mean today on the first possible flight carl quint will stay out here and see this end sewn up but im coming back dont wait for me if i cant get down to devon in time go in as planned have you got that yes the others voice was grim oh yes ive got that christ and im looking forward to it kyles eyes narrowed grew very bright and fierce have peters body burned he said just in case and then burn bodescu burn all the bloodsucking bastards quint gently took the phone from him and said guy carl here listen this is top priority get a couple of our best men up to hartlepool asap darcy clarke especially do it now even before you move on harkley right roberts answered ill do it then he got the point his gasp was perfectly audible even over the none too clear connection hell of course ill do it right now wideeyed and pale kyle and quint stared at each other there was no need to give voice to what was on their minds yulian bodescu had learned almost everything there was to know about them keen had access as had they all to the keogh file a vampires greatest fear is to be discovered for what he is he will try to destroy anyone who even suspects him intesp knew what he was and the focus the jinni loci of intesp was someone called harry keogh darcy clarke had swallowed two double brandies in quick succession before insisting on going back on duty that had been shortly before robertss call to the hotel dunarea in bucharest roberts at first dubious had finally let clarke go back to harkley but with this warning darcy stay in your car dont leave it no matter what i know you have your juju working but in this case it mightnt be enough but we do need someone watching that hellhouse at least until we can get fully mobilised and so if youre volunteering clarke had driven carefully coldly back to harkley house and parked on the stiff black grass close to where keens car had stood he tried not to think about the ground where his car stood or what had happened there he was aware of it would never forget it but he kept it on the periphery of his consciousness didnt let it interfere and so with his gun and loaded crossbow beside him hed sat there watching the house never taking his eyes off it for a moment fear had turned to hatred in clarkes heart he was here as a duty yes but it was more than that bodescu might just come out might just show his face and if he did clarke needed desperately to kill him in the house yulian sat in darkness by his garret window he too had known a little fear something of panic but now like clarke he was cold calm calculating for now with one very important exception he knew all there was to know about the watchers the one thing he didnt know was when but certainly it would be soon he gazed out into the darkness and could sense the approaching dawn down there beyond the gate in a car in the field across the road someone else watched ah but this one would be better prepared yulian sent his vampire senses reaching into the cold and misty predawn gloom touched lightly upon a mind hatred lashed out at him before the mind closed itself but not before he recognised it yulian merely grinned he sent his telepathic thoughts down to the vaulted cellars vlad an old friend of yours is keeping a vigil on the house want you to watch him but dont let him see you and dont try to hurt him they are wary now these watchers and coiled like springs if you are seen it may not go well for you so just watch him and let me know if he moves or does anything other than watch us now goa huge black shadow slopeeared feraleyed padded silently up the narrow steps in the small building standing towards the rear of the house it came out into the grounds turned towards the gates kept to the darker areas of trees and shrubbery tongue lolling vlad hastened to obey yulian called the women down into the main living room on the ground floor it was totally dark in that room but each present could see the others perfectly well like it or not night was now their element when they were assembled yulian seated himself beside helen on a couch waited a moment to be sure he had the full attention of the women then spoke ladies he commenced mockingly his voice low and sinister it will soon be dawn i cant be certain but i rather fancy that it will be one of the last dawns you ever see men will come and they will try to kill you that may not be easy but theyre determined and theyll try very hard yulian his mother at once stood up her voice shocked fearful what have you done sit down he commanded glaring at her she obeyed but reluctantly and when she was perched again on the edge of her chair he said i have done what i must do to protect myself and you all of you shall be obliged to do likewise or die soon helen simultaneously fascinated and horrified by yulian her skin crawling with her fear of him timorously touched his arm i shall do whatever you ask of me yulian he thrust her away almost hurled her from the couch fight for yourself slut that is all i ask not for me but for yourself if you desire to live helen cringed away from him i only only be quiet he snarled you must fight for yourselves for i shall not be here im leaving with the dawn when theyd least expect me to leave but you three will remain while you are here they may be fooled into thinking that i am still here he nodded and smiled yulian look at you his mother suddenly hissed her voice venomous you were always a monster inside and now youre a monster outside too i dont want to die for you for even this halflife is better than none but i dont intend to fight for it nothing you can say or do shall make me kill to preserve what youve made of me he shrugged then youll die very quickly he turned his eyes on anne lake and you auntie dear will you go to your maker so passively anne was wildeyed dishevelled she looked mad george is dead she babbled her hands flying to her hair and helen is changed my life is finished she stopped fussing leaned forward in her chair and glowered at yulian i hate you oh i know you do he nodded but will you let them kill you id be better off dead she answered ah but such a death he said you saw george go auntie dear and so you know how hard it was the stake the cleaver and the fire she sprang to her feet shook her head wildly they wouldnt people dont but these people do he gazed at her wideeyed almost innocently aping her expression they will for they know what you are they know that youre wamphyri we can leave this place anne cried come on georgina helen well leave right now yes go yulian snapped as if done with them utterly sick of them do go all of you leave me go now they looked at him uncertainly blinking their yellow eyes in unison i wont stop you he told them with a shrug he got to his feet made to leave the room no not i but they will theyll stop you dead theyre out there now watching and waiting yulian where are you going his mother stood up looked as if she might even try to take hold of him detain him he forced her back with nothing but a growl of warning swept by her i have preparations to make he said for my departure i imagine that you too will have certain final things you want to do prayers to some nonexistent god perhaps cherished photographs to look at old friends and lovers to remember while you may and sneering he left them to their own devices tuesday am middleeuropean time the airport in bucharest alec kyles flight was due to leave in twentyfive minutes and the passengers had just been called forward kyle would be in rome in twoandahalf hours given that there would be no problems with his connection hed be into heathrow around pm local time with a bit of luck he would reach his destination in devon with half an hour to spare before guy roberts and his team went in and cleaned up at harkley house even if his timings were wrong roberts should still be in situ at the house when finally he did arrive the last stages of his journey would be by mod helicopter from heathrow down to torquay and on to paignton in an airsea rescue chopper courtesy of the torbay coastguard kyle had made these final arrangements by telephone from the airport via john grieve in london as soon as hed discovered that he couldnt get a flight until now and mercifully for once hed got the call through without too much difficulty on hearing the call for embarkation felix krakovitch stepped forward and took kyles hand a lot has happened in a short time the russian psychic said but to know you has been my pleasure they shook hands awkwardly but both men meant it sergei gulharov was much more open he hugged kyle close and kissed his cheeks kyle shrugged and grinned he hoped not too sheepishly he was only glad hed said his farewells to irma dobresti the previous night carl quint nodded and gave him a thumbsup signal krakovitch carried kyles hand luggage to the departure gate from there kyle went on alone through the gates and out onto the asphalt finding a space in the jostling line of passengers he looked back once waved turned and hurried on quint krakovitch and gulharov watched him go waiting until he rounded the corner of the massive air control tower and so out of sight then they quickly left the airport now they were ready to commence their own journey up into old moldavia where theyd cross the russian border by car over the river prut krakovitch had already made the necessary arrangements through his second in command of course at the chвteau bronnitsy out on the airfield kyle approached his plane close to the foot of the mobile boarding stairway uniformed aircrew saluted him and checked his boarding pass one last time a smiling official stepped forward glanced at kyles boarding pass mr kyle one moment please his voice was bland conveyed nothing nor did kyles inbuilt warning system why should it there was nothing outside of nature here on the contrary what was coming was very downtoearth but terrifying for all that as the last of the passengers disappeared into the body of the aircraft three men emerged from behind the stairs they wore lightweight overcoats and dark grey felt hats though their clothes were intended to lend anonymity hey were almost a uniform in their own right an unmistakeable mode of identification even if kyle hadnt known them he would have recognised the cases one of them was carrying his cases two of the kgb men unsmiling restrained him while the third moved up very close put down his suitcases and took his cabin luggage kyle felt a stab of fear a moment of panic need i introduce myself the russian agents eyes bored into kyles kyle found his nerve shook his head and managed a rueful smile i think not he answered how are you this morning mr dolgikh or should i simply call you theo try comrade said dolgikh without humour that will suffice whatever yulian bodescus intentions had been he had not left harkley house at dawn at am ken layard and simon gower arrived to relieve darcy clarke who then returned to paignton at am trevor jordan joined layard and gower the three split up formed points of triangulation an hour later there were two more men reinforcements roberts had earlier called down from london all of these arrivals were dutifully reported by vlad until yulian cautioned the huge dog and ordered him down to the cellars it was broad daylight now and vlad would be seen coming and going the alsatian was yulians rearguard and no harm must come to him just yet the enemys numbers had penned yulian in but just as bad from his point of view was the fact that the day was cloudless the risen sun bright and strong the mists of the night had soon been steamed away and the air was clear and smelled fresh behind the house beyond the wall that marked the boundary of the grounds woods rose to the top of a low hill there was a track through the woods and one of the watchers had somehow managed to get his vehicle up there he sat there now watching the house through binoculars yulian could easily have seen him through one of the upper storey rear windows but he didnt need to he sensed that he was there at the front of the house were two more watchers one not far from the gate standing beside his car the other fifty yards away their weapons were not visible but yulian knew they had crossbows and he knew the agony a hardwood bolt would cause him two more men guarded the flanks one at each side of the house where they could look into the grounds across the walls yulian was trapped for the moment fight he couldnt even leave the house without them seeing him and those crossbows of theirs would be deadly accurate the day wore on through midday and into the afternoon and yulian began to sweat at pm a sixth man came on the scene driving a truck yulian watched carefully from behind the curtains at his garret window the driver of the truck must be the leader of these damned psychic spies the leader of this group anyway he was fat but in no way clumsy his mind would be hard and clear except he guarded his thoughts like gold he began to distribute indeterminate items of heavy equipment in canvas containers also jerrycans food and drink to the other men he spent a little time with each of them talking to them demonstrated with certain pieces of equipment gave instructions yulian sweated more yet he knew now that it would be this evening traffic rolled as usual on the autumn road couples walked together in the sunshine hand in hand birds sang in the woods the world looked the same as it always looked but those men out there had determined that this would be yulian bodescus last day using what cover he could find the vampire risked his neck making excursions outside the house he used a rear ground floor window where it was shrouded by shrubbery also the cellar exit through the outbuilding twice if hed been fully prepared he might have made a break for it when the watchers to the rear and at one side of the house went down to the road for their supplies on both occasions they returned while he was still calculating the odds yulian grew still more nervous his thinking becoming very erratic back in the house whenever he crossed tracks with one of the women he would lash out shout curse his nervousness transferred itself to vlad and the great dog prowled the empty cellars to and fro to and fro then about pm suddenly yulian was aware of a weird psychic stillness the mental lull before the storm he strained his vampire senses to their fullest extent and could detect nothing the watchers had screened their minds so that not even a trace of their thoughts their intentions could escape in so doing they gave away their final secret they told yulian the time they had planned for his death it was to be now within the hour and the light only just beginning to fade as the sun lowered itself towards the horizon yulian put fear aside he was wamphyri these men had powers yes and they were strong but he had powers too and he might yet prove to be stronger he went down into the cellars and spoke to vlad youve been faithful to me as only a dog can be he said facing the great beast their yellow eyes locked but you are more than a dog those men out there might suspect that and they might not whichever when they come you go out first to meet them give no quarter if you survive seek me out and then he spoke to the other that loathsome extrusion of himself it was the implanting of suggestions in a blank space the imprinting of an idea upon a void the burning of a brand into a beasts hide floor flags buckled in one dark corner the ground underfoot shifted and dust fell in rills from the low vaulting that was all perhaps it had understood and perhaps not finally yulian returned to his room he changed his clothes put on a neutral grey tracksuit and shoved his widebrimmed hat into the waistband he neatly folded a suit of clothes into a small travelling case along with a wallet containing a good deal of money in large notes that was that he needed nothing more then as the minutes ticked by he sat down closed his eyes and pitted his own dark nature against the great mother nature herself in one final test of his now mature vampire powers he willed a mist called up a wreathing white screen from the earth and the streams and the woods a clinging fog down from the hillsides the watchers tense now and taut as the strings of their crossbows scarcely noticed the sun slipping behind the clouds and the ground mist creeping at their ankles as a man their attention was riveted on the house and time moved inexorably towards the appointed hour i darcy clarke drove furiously north he had cursed aloud until his throat was raw and then silently until his cursing had come down to one fourletter word repeated over and ver again in his fuming mind what his fury amounted to was this he wouldnt be in on the kill he was out of the attack on harkley now instead he was to be minder inchief to a a tiny infant clarke was well aware of the importance of his new task and understood the purpose of it with his talent it is unlikely that any harm would come to him and so if he was shielding the young harry keogh the baby should likewise be safe but to darcys way of thinking prevention was better than cure stop bodescu dead at harkley house and you wouldnt have to worry about the baby at all and if he darcy clarke was at harkley if only he was there then guarantee bodescu would be stopped but he wasnt there he was here driving north for that godforsaken hole hartlepool on the other hand he knew that every single man of them back there was equally dedicated to bodescus destruction which helped a little clarke had got back to paignton before am and roberts had ordered him straight into bed later he said he would have a big job for him and wanted him to get at least six hours sleep finally clarke had dozed off and though hed feared the very worst dreams none had come at noon roberts had shaken him awake told him what his new job was since when clarke had been driving and cursing he had joined the m at leicester then picked up the a at thirsk he was now something less than an hour from his destination and the time was pm clarke stopped cursing god what would it be like right now down there where the hell did this mist spring from trevor jordan shivered turning up the collar of his coat hell it was a nice day from the weather point of view anyway for all his vehemence jordan had spoken in a whisper all of the intesp agents at their various stations around harkley house had been speaking in whispers for the last twenty minutes at working to robertss instructions theyd formed pairs which was as well for the mist had thickened up and started to threaten their individual security it felt nice to have someone really close to you jordans buddy in the system was ken layard the locator he was shivering too despite the fact that he carried seventyeight pounds of brissom mark iii flamethrower on his back im not sure he finally answered jordans question but i think its from him he nodded towards the house where it stood swathed in mist they were just inside the north wall at a place where theyd found a gap in the stonework just a minute ago at theyd checked their watches and squeezed through and jordan had helped layard into his asbestos leggings and jacket then theyd strapped the tank on his back and hed checked the valve on the hose and trigger mechanism with the valve open all he had to do was squeeze the trigger and he could conjure up an inferno and he fully intended to him jordan frowned he looked around at the mist it crept everywhere from here the rear wall up the hillside was invisible likewise the wall fronting onto the road harvey newton and simon gower would be making their way down from the hill ben trask and guy roberts coming up the drive from the gate they would all converge on the house together at pm sharp who do you mean him bodescu jordan led the way through shrubbery towards the dimly looming mass of the house bodescu yes layard answered im a locator remember its my thing whats that got to do with the mist jordans nerves were starting to jump he was a telepath of uncertain kill but roberts had warned him not to try it on bodescu and certainly not at this crucial stage of play when i try to find him in my minds eye layard attempted to explain inside the house there i cant zero in on him its as if he were part of the mist thats why i think hes somehow behind it i sense him as a huge amorphous cloud of fog jesus jordan whispered shivering again in utter eerie silence they moved towards the small outbuilding whose open door led down to the cellars simon gower and harvey newton approached the house from the gently sloping field of shrubs at its rear there wasnt too much cover so the mist was a boon to them so they thought newton was a telepath called down from london along with ben trask as reinforcements newton and trask werent quite as au fait with the situation as the rest which was why theyd been split up what a team we make eh said newton nervously as the ground levelled out and the mist billowed up more yet you with that bloody great torch on your back and me with a crossbow you know if this stakeout is a dud were going to look awfully god gower cut him short dropped to one knee and worked furiously at the valve on his hose what newton gave a massive start glared all about held his loaded crossbow out in front of him like a shield what he couldnt see anything but he knew gowers talent lay in reading the future especially the immediate future its coming gower no longer whispered in fact he was shouting its coming now at the front of the house where guy roberts and ben trask pulled up in robertss truck gowers shouting wasnt heard over the throbbing of the vehicles engine but on the northfacing side of the house it was trevor jordan instinctively crouched down then began to run at an angle towards the rear of the building ken layard hampered by his flamethrower load was slower off the mark layard stumbling through damp shrubbery saw jordans figure swallowed into a rolling bank of mist where he ran past the open door in the small outbuilding then saw something erupt from that door in a snarling slavering frenzy bodescus great dog without pause the flameeyed brute hurled itself into the mist after jordan trevor behind you layard yelled at the top of his voice he yanked open the valve on his hose jerked the trigger prayed god please dont let me burn trevor a roaring gouting stream of yellow fire tore open the curtain of mist like a blowtorch through cobwebs jordan was already round the corner of the house but vlad was still in view bounding purposefully after him the expanding blistering v of heat reached after the dog touched him enveloped him but briefly then he too was round the corner by now at the front of the house guy roberts and ben trask were down from the truck roberts heard shouting the roar of a flamethrower it was still a minute or two to five but the attack had started which probably meant that the other side had started it roberts put a police whistle to his lips gave one short blast now whatever else was happening all six intesp agents would move on the house together roberts had the third flamethrower he headed straight for the main door of the house where it stood ajar in the shadow of a columned portico trask followed he was a human liedetector his talent had no application here but he was also young quickthinking and he knew how to look after himself as he made to follow roberts something caught his attention a furtive movement glimpsed in the very corner of his eye twentyfive yards away between billowing banks of mist a flowing figure had passed swiftly silently inside the shell of the old barn who or whatever had gone in there there would be nothing to stop it from clearing off out of the grounds once roberts and trask were inside the house oh no you dont trask grunted and raising his voice guy in the barn there roberts at the door of the house turned to see trask running at a crouch towards the barn cursing under his breath he strode after him at the back of harkley house vlad came coughing and mewling out of the mist and attempted to spring at the three men he found there the dog was a blackened silhouette sheathed in smoke and flame burning even as he launched himself lopsidedly at jordans back as jordan had come running round the corner of the building gower had very nearly triggered his flamethrower hed recognised jordan only at the last possible moment harvey newton on the other hand had actually drawn a bead on the misted figure and was in the act of firing his bolt when gower cried a warning and shouldered him aside the bolt flashed harmlessly off at a tangent and disappeared in mist and distance fortunately jordan had seen the two men saw them apparently aiming at him and thrown himself flat he hadnt seen what pursued him however which even now overshot his sprawled body and arced overhead in a cloud of sparks and smoulder vlad landed awkwardly gathered himself to spring at newton and gower and discovered himself forging headon into a withering jet of flame from gowers torch the dog crumpled to earth a blazing crackling screaming ball of fire that tried to run in all directions at once and ran nowhere jordan got to his feet and the three men stood panting watching vlad burn newton had fumblingly reloaded his crossbow he thought he saw something move in the mist and turned in that direction what was that a loping shape or just his imagination the others didnt seem to have noticed they were watching vlad oh my god jordan gasped newton saw the look on jordans face forgot the thing he thought he had seen turned to watch the death agonies of the incandescent dog vlads blackened body throbbed and vibrated burst open put up a nest of tentacles that twined like alien fingers four or five feet into the air mouthing obscenities eyes bulging gower hosed the thing down with fire the tentacles steamed blistered and collapsed but the dogs body continued to pulsate jesus christ jordan moaned his horror he changed the dog too he unhooked a cleaver from his belt moved forward shielded his eyes against the blaze and severed vlads head from his body with one single clean stroke jordan backed off shouted at gower you finish it make sure you finish it i heard robertss whistle just now harvey and me will go on in as gower continued to burn the remains of the dogthing jordan and newton went stumbling through smoke and reek to the rear wall of the house where they found an open window they looked at each other then licked their lips nervously in unison both of them were breathing raggedly of the sodden stinking air come on said jordan cover me he aimed his crossbow in front of him swung his leg across the window sill in the barn ben trask pulled up short his square face alert ears attentive to the silence the silence said there w as no one here but it was lying trask knew it as surely is if he sat behind a oneway window and listened in on an important interrogation by police of bigtime criminals the picture here was false a lie old farm implements were strewn everywhere the mist billowing in through the open ends of the building had turned old steel slick with a sort of metallic sweat chains and worn tyres hung from hooks in the walls a stack of tongueandgroove boards teetered uncertainly as if recently disturbed then trask saw the wooden steps ascending into gloom and at the same time a single stem of straw where it came drifting down he drew air in a sharp gasp turned his face and crossbow up towards the badly gapped boarding overhead and was just in time to see a womans insanely working face framed there and hear her hiss of triumph as she launched a pitchfork at him trask had no time to aim but simply pulled the trigger the pitchforks sharp offside tine missed him but its twin scraped under his collar bone and passed through his right shoulder driving him down and backwards at the same time there came a mad babbling shriek to end all shrieks and anne lake crashed through rotten boards in a cloud of dust and powdery straw she landed square on her back with trasks bolt sticking out of her chest dead centre the bolt alone should have done for her and the fall certainly but she was no longer entirely human trask lay against the side wall and tried to pull the pitchfork out of his shoulder there was no strength in him he couldnt do it pain and shock had left him weak as a kitten he could only watch and try to keep from blacking out as yulian bodescus auntie crept towards him on all fours grabbed the pitchfork and yanked it viciously free and then trask did black out anne lake drew back the pitchfork growling like a big cat as she aimed it at trasks heart behind her guy roberts grabbed the forks wooden handle hauled on it and threw her off balance she howled her frustration fell on her back again grasped the bolt in her chest with both hands and tried to draw it out roberts impeded by the apparatus on his back lumbered by her took hold of trask by the front of his jacket and somehow managed to drag him clear of the barn then he turned back aimed his hose and applied a firm and steady pressure to the trigger the barn was at once transformed into a gigantic oven heat and fire and smoke filled it floor to tiled roof spilling out of its open ends and in the middle of it all something screamed and screamed a wildly hissing rising scream that finally shut itself off as the upper floor collapsed and tipped blazing hay down into the roaring inferno and still roberts kept his finger on the trigger until he knew that nothing nothing could have survived in there at the back of the house ken layard found gower burning vlad jordan had just stepped in through the open window and newton was about to follow him hold it layard shouted you cant work two crossbows together he came forward ill go in this way he told newton with jordan you stick with gower and go round the front go now as layard clambered awkwardly in through the window newton dragged gower away from the cindered smoking thing that had been vlad and jerked his thumb towards the far corner of the house that things finished he shouted so now get a grip of yourself come on the others will be inside by now they quickly made their way through the mistwreathed gardens on the south side of the house and saw roberts turn away from the blazing barn and drag trask out of the danger area roberts saw them yelled what the hells going on gower burned the dog newton yelled back except it wasnt wasnt a dog not any more robertss lips drew back from his teeth in a halfsnarl halfgrimace we got anne lake he said as newton and gower came closer and of course she wasnt all woman wherere layard and jordan inside said gower he was shaking rivered in sweat and its not finished yet guy not yet theres more to come ive tried scanning the house roberts said nothing just a fog in there a mental fucking fog pointless trying anyway too damned much going on he grabbed gower you ok gower nodded i think so right now listen thermite bombs in the truck plastic explosive too in haversacks dump em in the cellars spread em out try to take em all down in one go and no torching while youre holding the stuff in fact get out of that kit and take a crossbow like newton the stuffs all set to go off from excessive heat or naked flame plant it and get out and then stay out three of us in the house itself should be enough if not the fire will be youre going in there gower looked at the house licked his lips im going in yes roberts nodded theres still bodescu his mother and the girl to account for and dont worry about me worry about yourself the cellars could be far worse than the house he headed for the open door under the columned portico chapter fourteen inside the house layard and jordan had carefully systematically searched the ground floor and now approached the main staircase to the upper levels theyd switched on dim lights as they went compensating a little for the gloom at the foot of the stairs they paused where the hell is roberts layard whispered we could use some instructions why jordan glanced at him out of the corner of his eye we know what were up against mainly and we know what to do but there should be four of us in here jordan gritted his teeth there was something of a row out front trouble obviously anyway by now someone should be planting charges in the cellars so lets not waste time we can ask questions later on a narrow landing where the stairs turned through a right angle a large builtin cupboard faced them squarely its door a little ajar jordan kept his crossbow lined up on the largepanelled door sidled past and continued up the stairs he wasnt passing the buck it was simply that if there was anything nasty in there he knew layard could stop it with a single burst of liquid fire layard checked that the valve on his hose was open rested his finger on the trigger toed the door open in there darkness he waited until his eyes were growing accustomed to the dimness then spotted a light switch on the wall just inside the door he reached out his hand then drew it back he stepped forward a pace used the nozzle of his hose to trip the switch a light came on throwing the interior of the cupboard into sharp relief at the back a tall figure layard drew breath sharply his jaw fell partly open and the corners of his mouth drew back in a halfrictus of fear he was a breath from squeezing the trigger but then his eyes focussed and he saw only an old raincoat hanging on a peg layard gulped filled his lungs quietly closed the door jordan was up on the first floor landing he saw two alcoves arched over with closed doors set centrally there was also a passage with two more doors that he could see before the corridor turned a corner the closest door was maybe eight paces away the furthest twelve he turned back to the doors in the alcoves approached the first of them turned the doorknob and kicked it open it was a toilet with a high window letting in grey light jordan turned to the second door dealt with it as with the first inside was an extensive library the whole room visible at a glance then aware that layard was coming up the stairs he started down the corridor and at once paused his ears pricked up he heard water the hiss and gurgle of a tap a shower the water sounds were coming from the second room a bathroom down the corridor jordan looked back layard was at the top of the stairs their eyes met jordan pointed to the first door then at layard layard was to deal with it then jordan thumbed his own chest pointed along the corridor to the second door he went on but cautiously crossbow held chest high and pointed dead ahead the water sounds were louder and a voice a girls voice singing humming anyway some utterly tuneless melody in this house at this time a girl humming to herself in a shower or was it a trap jordan took a tighter grip on his crossbow turned the knob and kicked in the door no trap not that he could see in fact the completely natural scene beyond the bathroom door left him at a complete loss all of the tension went out of him in a moment and he was left feeling like some gross intruder the girl was beautiful and quite naked water streamed down on her setting her lovely body gleaming she stood sideways on picked out in clear definition against blue ceramic tiles in the showers shallow well as the door slammed open she jerked her head round to stare at jordan her eyes opening wide in terror then she gasped crumpled back against the showers wall looking as if she were about to faint one hand flew to her breasts and her eyelids fluttered as her knees began to give way jordan halflowered his crossbow said to himself sweet jesus but this is just a frightened girl he began to reach out his free hand to steady her but then other thoughts her thoughts abruptly printed themselves on his telepathic mind come on my sweet come help me ah just touch me hold me just a little closer my sweet there and now jordan jerked back as she turned more fully towards him her eyes were wide triangular demonic her face had been instantly transformed into that of a beast and in her right hand invisible until now was a carving knife the knife rose as she reached out and grasped jordans jacket her grip was iron she drew him effortlessly towards her and he fired his bolt into her breast pointblank slammed back against the rear wall of the shower pinned there by the bolt she dropped her knife and began to issue peal after ringing peal of soulsearing screams blood gushed from where the bolt was bedded in her with little more than its flight protruding she grasped it and still screaming jerked her body this way and that the bolt came loose from the wall in a crunching of tiles and plaster and she staggered to and fro in the shower yanking on the bolt and screaming endlessly god god oh god jordan cried riveted to the spot layard shouldered him aside squeezed the trigger on his flamethrower turned the entire shower unit into a blistering steaming pressurecooker after several seconds he stopped hosing and stared with jordan at the result black smoke and steam cleared and the water continued to hiss spurting from halfadozen places now in the molten plastic tubing of the showers system in the shallow well helen lakes body slumped features bubbling hair like smouldering stubble every inch of her skin peeling from her in great raw strips god help us jordan gasped turned away to be sick god the thing in the shower croaked like a voice from the abyss what god you bloody black bastards impossibly she came erect took a blind stumbling groping step forward layard torched her again but more out of mercy than from fear he let his flamethrower roar until fire belched out of the shower and threatened to burn him too then he switched off backed away down the corridor to where jordan stood retching over the stairs balustrade from below robertss voice reached anxiously up to them ken trevor what is it layard wiped his forehead we we got the girl he whispered then shouted we got the girl we got her mother roberts answered and bodescus dog that leaves bodescu himself and his mother theres a door up here locked layard called back i thought i heard someone in there cant you break it in no its oak old and heavy i could burn it no time for that and if there is anyone in there theyre finished anyway the cellars are mined by now youd better come down and quickly we have to get out of here layard dragged jordan after him down the stairs calling ahead guy where the hell have you been im on my own roberts responded trasks out of it for now but hes ok whereve i been ive been checking this place through downstairs a waste of time jordan groaned half to himself what roberts raised his voice more yet i said wed already done it jordan yelled but needlessly for they were down the stairs with roberts propelling them towards the entrance hall and the open door simon gower and harvey newton had gone down into the cellars via the outbuilding with its narrow steps and central ramp loaded down with almost two hundred pounds of explosives between them they had found the lights out of order and so been obliged to use pocket torches the vaults under the house were black and silent as a tomb seemed extensive as a catacomb they stuck close together dumping thermite and plastic explosive packages wherever they found support walls or buttressed archways and even though they went with something of caution still they managed rapidly to fairly well saturate the place with their load newton carried a small can of petrol with which he left a trail from one dump to the next until the whole place reeked of highly volatile fuel finally they were satisfied that theyd explored and mined every part and likewise pleased that theyd come across nothing dangerous and so turned back and retraced their tracks to the exit at a place they both agreed to be approximately central under the house they set down the last of their load then newton splashed what was left of his petrol all the way to the foot of the out building steps while gower doublechecked the charges theyd planted making sure they were all amply primed at the steps newton tossed down his empty can turned and looked back into the gloom from a little way back round a corner he could hear gowers hoarse breathing and he knew that the other man worked furiously at his task gowers torch made flickering patches of light back there its beam swinging this way and that as he worked roberts appeared at the top of the steps called down newton gower you can come up out of there as quick as you like were all set if you are the others are spread out round the house just waiting the mist has cleared so if anything tries to break loose well harvey gowers tremulous voice came out of the darkness several notes higher up the scale than it should be harvey was that you just then newton called back no its roberts hurry up will you no not roberts gower was breathless almost whispering something else roberts and newton looked at each other roundeyed the ground gave itself a shake a very definite tremor from inside the cellars gower screamed roberts came halfway down the steps stumbling and yelling simon get out of there hurry man gower screamed again the cry of a trapped animal its here guy oh god its here under the ground newton made to go in after him but roberts reached down and grabbed his collar the ground was shaking now dust billowing out of the yawning mouth of the old cellars there were rending sounds and other noises which might or might not be gower choking his life out bricks started to slide loose from rotten mortar in the retaining walls spilling down the sides of the ramp newton started to back up the trembling steps with roberts dragging him from above when they were almost at the top they saw a cloud of dust and debris suddenly expelled forcefully from the entrance to the cellar and then the door itself was lifted off its rusty hinges and hurled down at the foot of the ramp a mass of splintered boards something was framed in the dusty gap of the entrance it was gower and it was more than gower he hung for a moment suspended in the otherwise empty doorway swaying left and right then he emerged more fully and the watchers saw the huge leprous trunk which propelled him the thing indeed the other had entered his back in a solid shaft of matter but inside gower its massive pseudopod of vampire flesh had branched following his pipes and conduits to several exits tentacles writhed from his gaping mouth and nostrils the sockets of his dislocated eyes his ruptured ears and even as roberts and newton clambered in a frenzy of terror up the last few steps from the ramp so gowers entire front burst open revealing a lashing nest of crimson groping worms jesus guy roberts shouted then his voice a sandpapered howl of horror and hatred sweet jesus he aimed his hose down the ramp goodbye simon god grant you peace liquid fire roared its rage ran like a flood down the ramp hurled itself in a fireball at the suspended man and the beastthing holding him upright the great pseudopod was instantly retracted gower with it snatched back like a rag doll and roberts aimed his hose directly at the doorway at the foot of the steps he turned the valve up full and a shimmering jet of heat blasted its way into the cellar fanning out inside the labyrinth of vaults into every niche and corner for a count of five roberts held it then came the first explosion down went the entrance in a massive shuddering of earth a shockwave of lashing heat hurled dirt and pebbles up the ramp knocking roberts and newton off their feet robertss finger automatically came off the trigger his weapon smoked hot but silent in his hands and crump crump crump came evenly spaced muffled concussions from deep in the earth each one shaking the ground with piledriver power faster came the underground explosions occurring in sporadic bursts occasionally twinned as the planted charges reacted to the heat and added to the unseen inferno newton got up and helped roberts to his feet they stumbled clear of the house took up positions with layard and jordan a man to each of the four corners but standing well back the old barn still blazing began to vibrate as if itself alive and suffering its death agonies finally it shook itself to pieces and slid down into the suddenly seething earth for a moment a lashing tentacle reached up from the shuddering foundations to a height of some twenty feet then collapsed and was sucked back down into the quaking liquefying quag of earth and fire ken layard was closest to that area he ran raggedly away from the house put distance between himself and the barn too before stumbling to a halt and staring with wide eyes and gaping mouth at the upstairs windows of the main building then he beckoned to roberts to come and join him look layard yelled over the sound of subterranean thunder and the hiss and crackle of fire they both stared at the house framed in a secondfloor window the figure of a mature woman stood with her arms held high almost in an attitude of supplication bodescus mother roberts said it can only be her georgina bodescu god help her a corner of the house collapsed sank into the earth in ruins where it went down a geyser of fire spouted high as the roof hurling broken bricks and mortar with it there were more explosions and the entire house shuddered it was visibly settling on its foundations cracks spreading across its walls chimneys tottering the four watchers backed off further yet layard dragging ben trask with him then layard noticed the truck where it stood on the drive jolting about on its own suspension he went to get it but guy roberts stayed where he was stood over trask and continued to watch the figure of the woman at the window she hadnt changed her position she stumbled a little now and then as the house settled but always regained her pose arms raised on high and head thrown back so that it seemed to roberts that indeed she talked to god telling him what asking for what forgiveness for her son a merciful release for herself newton and jordan left their positions at the rear of the house and came round to the front it was clear that nothing was going to escape from that inferno now they helped layard get trask into the truck and while they busied themselves with preparations for their leaving still roberts watched the house burn and so was witness to the end of it the thermite had done its job and the earth itself was on fire the house no longer had foundations on which to stand it slumped down leaned first one way and then the other old brickwork groaned as timbers sheared chimney stacks toppled and windows shivered into fragments in their twisting frames and as the house sank in leaping flames and molten earth so its substance became fuel for the fire fire raced up walls inside and out great red and yellow gouts of flame spurted from broken windows bursting upward through a rent and sagging roof for a single instant longer georgina bodescu was silhouetted against a background of crimson searing heat and then harkley house gave up the ghost it went down groaning into a scar of bubbling earth that resembled nothing so much as the mouth of a small volcano for a little while longer the peaked gable ends and parts of the roof were visible and then they too were consumed in vengeful fire and smoke through all of this the reek had been terrible judging by the stench it might well have been that fifty men had died and been burned in that house but as roberts climbed up into the passenger seat of the truck and layard headed the vehicle down the drive towards the gates all five survivors including trask who was now mainly conscious knew that the stench came from nothing human it was partly thermite partly earth and timber and old brick but mainly it was the death smell of that rendered down gigantic monstrosity under the cellars that other which had taken poor gower the mist had almost completely cleared now and cars were beginning to pull up along the verges of the road their drivers attracted by the flames and smoke rising high into the air where harkley house had stood as the truck rolled out of the gates onto the road a redfaced driver leaned out of his cars window yelled what is it thats harkley house isnt it it was roberts yelled back offering what he hoped looked like a helpless shrug gone im afraid burned down good lord the redfaced man was aghast has the fire service been informed were off to do that now roberts answered little good thatll do though weve been in to have a look but theres nothing left to see im afraid they drove on a mile towards paignton a clattering fire engine came tearing from the other direction layard drew dutifully in towards the side of the road to give the fire engine room he grinned tiredly without humour too late my lads he commented under his breath much too late thank all thats merciful they dropped trask off at the hospital in torquay and after seeing him comfortable went back to the hotel hq in paignton to debrief roberts enumerated their successes we got all three women anyway but as for bodescu himself i have my doubts about him serious doubts and when were finished here ill pass them on to london also to darcy clarke and our people up in hartlepool these will be simply precautionary measures of course for even if we did miss bodescu weve no way of knowing what hell do next or where hell go anyway alec kyle will be back in control shortly in fact its queer he hasnt shown up yet actually im not looking forward to seeing him hes going to be furious when he learns that bodescu probably got out of that lot bodescu and that other dog harvey newton put in almost as an afterthought he shrugged still i reckon it was just a stray that got into the grounds somehow he stopped looked from face to face all were staring back at him in astonishment almost disbelief it was the first theyd heard of it roberts couldnt restrain himself from grabbing newtons jacket front tell it now he grated through clenched teeth exactly as it happened harvey newton dazed told it concluding so while gower was burning that that bloody thing which wasnt a dog not all of it anyway this other dog went by in the mist but i cant even swear that i saw it at all i mean there was so much going on it could have been just the mist or my imagination or anything i thought it loped but sort of upright in an impossible forward crouch and its head wasnt just the right shape it had to be my imagination a curl of mist something like that imagination yes especially with gower standing there burning that godawful dog christ ill dream of dogs like that for the rest of my life roberts released him violently almost tossed him across the room the fat man wasnt just fat he was heavy too and very strong he looked at newton in disgust idiot he rumbled he lit a cigarette despite the fact that he already had one going i couldnt have done anything anyway newton protested id shot my bolt hadnt reloaded yet shot your bloody bolt roberts glared then he calmed himself id like to say its not your fault he told newton then and maybe it isnt your fault maybe he was just too damned clever for us what now said layard he felt a little sorry for newton tried to take attention away from him roberts looked at layard now well when ive calmed down a little you and me will have to try and find the bastard thats what now find him newton licked dry lips how he was confused wasnt thinking clearly roberts at once tapped the side of his head with huge white knuckles with this he shouted its what i do im a scryer remember he glared again at newton so whats your fucking talent other than screwing things up i mean newton found a chair and fell into it i i saw him and yet convinced myself that i hadnt seen him what the hells wrong with me we went there to trap him to trap anything coming out of that house so why didnt i react more posit jordan drew air sharply and made a conclusive snapping sound with his fingers he gave a sharp nod said of course they all looked at him of course he said again spitting the words out hes talented too remember too bloody talented by a mile harvey he got to you telepathically i mean hell he got to me too convinced us he wasnt there that we couldnt see him and i really didnt see him not a hair of him i was there too remember when simon was burning that thing but i saw nothing so dont feel too bad about it harvey at least you actually saw the bastard youre right roberts nodded after a moment you have to be so now we know for sure bodescu is loose angry and god dangerous yes and hes more powerful far more powerful than anyone has yet given him credit for wednesday am middleeuropean time the border crossingpoint near siret in moldavia krakovitch and gulharov had shared the driving between them though carl quint would have been only too happy to drive if they had let him at least that might have relieved some of his boredom quint hadnt found the romanian countryside along their route railway depots standing forlorn and desolate as scarecrows dingy industrial sites fouled rivers and the like especially romantic but even without him and despite the often dilapidated condition of the roads still the russians had made fairly good time or at least theyd made good time until they arrived here but here was the middle of nowhere and for some as yet unexplained reason theyd been held up here for the last four hours earlier their route out of bucharest had taken them through buzau focsani and bacau along the banks of the siretul and so into moldavia in roman theyd crossed the river then continued up through botosani where theyd paused to eat and so into and through siret now on the northern extreme of the town the border crossingpoint blocked their way with chernovtsy and the prut some twenty miles to the north by now krakovitch had planned on being through chernovtsy and into kolomyya under the old mountains the old carpathians for the night but but he raged now in the paraffin lamplight glare of the border post but but but he slammed his fist down on the countertop which kept staff a little apart from travellers he spoke or shouted in russian so explosive that quint and gulharov winced and gritted their teeth where they sat in the car outside the wooden chaletstyled building the border post sat centrally between the incoming and outgoing lanes with barrier arms extending on both sides uniformed guards manned sentry boxes a romanian for incoming traffic a russian for outgoing the senior officer was of course russian and right now he was under pressure from felix krakovitch four hours krakovitch raved four bloody hours sitting here at the end of the world waiting for you to make up your mind ive told you who i am and proved it are my documents in order the roundfaced overweight russian official shrugged helplessly of course comrade but no no no krakovitch shouted no more buts just yes or no and comrade gulharovs documents are they in order the russian customs man bobbed uncomfortably this way and that shrugged again yes krakovitch leaned over the counter shoved his face close to that of the other and do you believe that i have the ear of the party leader himself are you sure that youre aware that if your bloody telephone was working by now id be speaking to brezhnev himself in moscow and that next week youd be manning a crossingpoint into manchuria if you say so comrade krakovitch the other sighed he struggled for words a way to begin a sentence with something other than but alas i am also aware that the other gentleman in your car is not a soviet citizen and that his documents are not in order if i were to let you through without the proper authorisation next week i could well be a lumberjack in omsk i dont have the build for it comrade what sort of a bloody control point is this anyway krakovitch was in full flood no telephone no electric light i suppose we must thank god you have toilets now listen to me i have listened comrade at least the officers guts werent all sagging inside his belly to threats and vitriolic raving for at least threeandahalf hours but but krakovitch couldnt believe it this couldnt be happening to him he shook his fist at the other idiot ive counted eleven cars and twentyseven lorries through here towards kolomyya since our arrival your man out there didnt even check the papers of half of them because we know them they travel through here regularly many of them live in or close to kolomyya i have explained this a hundred times think on this krakovitch snapped tomorrow you could be explaining it to the kgb more threats the other gave another shrug one stops worrying total inefficiency krakovitch snarled three hours ago you said that the telephones would be working in a few minutes likewise two hours ago and one hour ago and the time now is fast approaching one in the morning i know the time comrade there is a fault in the electricity supply it is being dealt with what more can i say he sat down on a padded chair behind the counter krakovitch almost leaped over the counter to get at him dont you dare sit down not while i am on my feet the other wiped his forehead stood up again prepared himself for another tirade outside in the car sergei gulharov had restlessly turned this way and that peering first out of one window then another carl quint sensed problems trouble danger ahead in fact hed been on edge since seeing kyle off at the airport in bucharest but worrying about it would get him nowhere and anyway he felt too bangedabout to pursue it if anything not being allowed to drive being obliged to simply sit there with the drab countryside slipping endlessly by outside had made him more weary yet now he felt that he could sleep for a week and it might as well be here as anywhere gulharovs attention had now fastened on something outside the car he grew still thoughtful quint looked at him silent sergei as he and kyle had privately named him it wasnt his fault he spoke no english in fact he did speak it but very little and with many errors now he answered quints glance nodded his shortcropped head and pointed through the open window of the car at something look he softly said quint looked silhouetted against a low distant haze of blue light the lights of kolomyya quint supposed black cables snaked between poles over the border check point with one section of cable descending into the building itself the power supply now gulharov turned and pointed off to the west where the cable ran back in the direction of suet a hundred yards away the loop of cable between two of the poles dipped right down under the night horizon it had been grounded excusing said gulharov he eased himself out of the car walked back along the central reservation and disappeared into darkness quint considered going after him but decided against it he felt very vulnerable and outside the car would feel even more so at least the cars interior was familiar to him he tuned himself again to krakovitchs raving coming loud and clear through the night from the border post quint couldnt understand what was being said but someone was getting a hard time an end to all foolishness krakovitch shouted now i will tell you what i am going to do i shall drive back into siret to the police station and phone moscow from there good said the fat official and providing that moscow can send the correct documentation for the englishman down the telephone wire then i shall let you through dolt krakovitch sneered you of course shall come with me to siret where youll receive your instructions direct from the kremlin how dearly the other would have loved to tell him that he had already received his instructions from moscow but hed been warned against that instead he slowly shook his head unfortunately comrade i cannot leave my post dereliction of duty is a very serious matter nothing you or anyone else could say could force me from my place of duty krakovitch saw from the officials red face that hed pushed him too far now he would probably be more stubborn than ever even to the point of deliberate obstruction that was a thought which made krakovitch frown for what if all of this trouble had been deliberate obstruction right from the start was that possible then the solution is simple he said i assume that siret does have a twentyfour hour police station with telephones that work his opponent chewed his lip of course he finally answered then i shall simply telephone ahead to kolomyya and have a unit of the nearest military force here within the hour how will it feel comrade to be a russian commanded by some russian army officer to stand aside while i and my friends are escorted through your stupid little checkpoint and to know that tomorrow all hell is going to descend on you because you will have been the focus of what could well be a serious international incident at which precise moment out in the field to the west of the road and back a little way towards siret sergei gulharov stooped and picked up the two uncoupled halves male and female of a heavy electrical connection taped to the main supply cable was a much thinner telephone wire its connection also broken was a simple slender plugandsocket affair he connected the telephone cable first then without pause screwed the heavier couplings together there came a sputter and crackle of current a flash of blue sparks and the lights came on in the border post krakovitch on the point of leaving to carry out his threat stopped at the door turned back and saw the look of confusion on the officials face i suppose krakovitch said this means your telephone is also working again i i suppose so said the other krakovitch came back to the counter which means his tone was icy that from now on we might just start to get somewhere am in moscow at the chвteau bronnitsy some miles out of the city along the serpukhov road ivan gerenko and theo dolgikh stood at an oval observation port of oneway glass and stared into the room beyond at a scene like something out of a science fiction nightmare inside the operating theatre alec kyle lay unconscious on his back strapped to a padded table his head was slightly elevated by means of a rubber cushion and a bulky stainlesssteel helmet covered his head and eyes in a half dome leaving his nose and mouth free for breathing hundreds of hairfine wires cased in coloured plastic sleeves shimmered like a rainbow from the helmet to a computer where three operators worked frantically following thought sequences from beginning to end and erasing them at the point of resolution inside the helmet many tiny sensor electrodes had been clamped to kyles skull others along with batteries of micromonitors were secured by tape to his chest wrists stomach and throat four more men telepaths sat paired on each side of kyle on stainlesssteel chairs scribbling in notebooks in their laps each with one hand resting lightly on kyles naked body a master telepathist zek foener ebranchs best sat alone in one corner of the room foener was a beautiful young woman in her midtwenties an east german recruited by gregor borowitz during his last days as head of the branch she sat with her elbows on her knees one hand to her brow utterly motionless totally intent upon absorbing kyles thoughts as quickly as they were stimulated and generated dolgikh was full of morbid fascination he had arrived with kyle at the chвteau about am their flight from bucharest had been made in a military transport aircraft to an airbase in smolensk then to the chвteau in ebranchs own helicopter all of this had been achieved in absolute secrecy kgb cover had been tight as a drum not even brezhnev especially brezhnev knew what was happening here at the chвteau kyle had been injected with a truth serum not to loosen his tongue but his mind which had rendered him unconscious and for the last twelve hours with booster shots of the serum at regular intervals he had been giving up all the secrets of intesp to the soviet espers theo dolgikh however was a very mundane man his ideas of interrogation or truth gathering were far removed from anything he saw here what exactly are they doing to him how does this work comrade he asked without looking at dolgikh with his faded hazel eyes following every slightest movement in the room beyond the screen gerenko answered you of all people have surely heard of brainwashing theo well that is what we are doing washing alec kyles brain so thoroughly in fact that it will come out of the wash bleached ivan gerenko was slight and so small as to be almost childlike in stature but his wrinkled skin faded eyes and generally sallow appearance were those of an old man and yet he was only thirtyseven a rare disease had stunted him physically aged him prematurely and a contrary nature had made up the deficiency by giving him a supplementary talent he was a deflector like darcy clarke in many ways he was the opposite of accidentprone but where clarkes talent avoided danger gerenko actually deflected it a wellaimed blow would not strike him the shaft of an axe would break before the blade could touch his flesh the advantage was enormous immeasurable he feared nothing and was almost scornful of physical danger and it accounted for his totally disdainful manner where people such as theo dolgikh were concerned why should he afford them any sort of respect they might dislike him but they could never hurt him no man was capable of bringing physical harm to ivan gerenko brainwashing dolgikh repeated him i had thought some sort of interrogation surely both gerenko nodded talking rather to himself than by way of answering dolgikh we use science psychology parapsychology the three ts technology terror telepathy the drug weve put in his blood stimulates memory it works by making him feel alone utterly alone he feels that no one else exists in all the universe even his own existence is in doubt he wants to talk about all of his experiences everything he ever did or saw or said because that way he will know that he is real that he has existence but if he physically tried to do it at the speed his mind is working he would rapidly dehydrate and burn himself out especially if he were awake conscious also we are not interested in the accumulation of all of that information we do not wish to know everything his life in general holds little of interest to us but of course we are completely fascinated with details of his work for intesp dolgikh shook his head in bewilderment you are stealing his thoughts oh yes its an idea we borrowed from boris dragosani he was a necromancer he could steal the thoughts of the dead we can only do it to the living but when were finished theyre as good as dead but i mean how the concept was over dolgikhs head gerenko glanced at him just a glance a twitch of the eyes in his wizened head i cant explain how not to you only what when he touches upon a mundane matter the entire subject is drawn from him swiftly and erased this saves time for he cant return to that subject again but when we are interested in his subject then the telepaths absorb the content of his thoughts as best they can if what they learn is difficult to remember or understand they make a note a jotting which can be studied later and as soon as that line of inquiry is exhausted then that subject too is erased dolgikh had taken most of this in but his interest now centred on zek fцener that girl she is very beautiful his gaze was openly lecherous now if only she were a subject for interrogation my sort of interrogation of course he gave a coarse chuckle at that exact moment the girl looked up her bright blue eyes blazed with fury she looked directly at the oneway glass as if ah said dolgikh the word a small gasp impossible she looks through the glass at us no gerenko shook his head she thinks through it at you if im not mistaken foener stood up strode purposefully to a side door and left the room emerging into the rubberfloored corridor where the observers stood she came straight up to them glanced once at dolgikh and showed him her perfect sharp white teeth then turned to gerenko ivan take this this ape away from here hes inside my radius and his minds like a sewer of course my dear gerenko smiled and nodded his wrinkled walnut head he turned away taking dolgikhs elbow come theo dolgikh shook himself loose scowled at the girl you are very free with your insults that is the correct way she spoke curtly face to face and out with it but your insults crawl like worms and you keep them in the slime in your head and to gerenko she added i cant work with him here gerenko looked at dolgikh well dolgikhs expression was ugly but slowly he relaxed shrugged very well my apologies frдulein fцener he deliberately avoided use of his customary comrade and when he looked her up and down one last time that too was quite deliberate its simply that ive always considered my thoughts private and anyway im only human barely she snapped and at once returned to her work as dolgikh followed gerenko to his office the second in command of ebranch said that ones mind is very finely tuned finely balanced we must be careful not to disturb it however distasteful this may seem theo you should never forget that any one of the espers here is worth ten of you dolgikh had pride oh he growled then why didnt andropov ask you to send one of them to italy eh maybe you yourself eh comrade gerenko smiled thinly muscle occasionally has its advantages thats why you went to genoa and its why youre here now i expect to have more work for you very soon work to your liking but theo be warned so far youve done very well so dont spoil it now our mutual er shall we say superior will be well pleased with you but he would not be pleased if he thought youd tried to impose your matter over our mind here at the chвteau bronnitsy its always the other way around mind over matter they climbed spiralling stone stairs in one of the chвteaus towers and arrived at gerenkos office before gerenko it had housed gregor borowitz and it was now felix krakovitchs seat of control but krakovitch was temporarily absent and both ivan gerenko and yuri andropov intended that his absence should become permanent this too puzzled dolgikh in my time he said taking a seat opposite gerenkos desk ive been quite close to comrade andropov or as close as a man can get ive watched him rise followed his rising star you might say in my experience since the early days of ebranch there has been friction between the kgb and you espers yet now with you things are changing what has andropov got on you ivan gerenkos grin was that of a weasel he has nothing on me he answered but he does have something for me you see i have been cheated theo nature has robbed me i would like to be a man of heroic proportions perhaps a man like you but im stuck in this feeble shell women are not interested in me men while they cannot hurt me consider me a freak only my mind has value and my talent the first has been useful to felix krakovitch ive taken a great deal of the branchs burden off his shoulders and the second is a subject for intense study by the parapsychologists here they would all like to have my shall we say guardian angel why an army of men with my talent would be quite invulnerable so you see how important i am and yet what am i but a shrunken little man whose lifespan is destined to be short and so while i live i want power i want to be great for however short a span and because it will be short i want it now and with krakovitch gone youll be the boss here dolgikh nodded gerenko smiled his withered smile that for a start but then comes the integration of ebranch and the kgb brezhnev would be against it of course but alas the party leader is rapidly becoming a mumbling crumbling cretin he cant last long and andropov because he is strong has many enemies how long will he last do you think which means that eventually possibly even probably youll have it all dolgikh could see the logic of it but by then surely you too will have made enemies leaders always climb to the top over the bodies of dead leaders ah gerenkos smile was sly cold and not entirely sane but this time it will be different what do i care for enemies sticks and stones will not break my bones and i shall weed them out one by one until there are no more and i shall die small and wrinkled but also great and very powerful so whatever you do theo dolgikh make sure youre my friend not my enemy dolgikh said nothing for a moment but let all that gerenko had said sink in the man was obviously a megalomaniac tactfully dolgikh changed the subject you said thered likely be more work for me what sort of work as soon as we are sure that we can learn everything we desire to know from alec kyle then krakovitch his man gulharov and the other british agent quint will become quite expendable at the moment when krakovitch wants something done he speaks to me and i in turn pass on his request to brezhnev not directly to brezhnev but through one of his men a mere lackey but a powerful lackey the party leader is keen on ebranch and so krakovitch usually gets what he wants witness this unheard of liaison between british and soviet espers but of course im also working for andropov he too knows everything that is happening and he has already instructed me that when the time comes you are the tool i shall throwinto krakovitchs machinery ebranch has been soundly beaten almost destroyed by intesp once before brezhnev wants to know how and why and so does andropov we had a mighty weapon in boris dragosani but their weapon a youth called harry keogh was mightier what gave him his power what were his powers and right now we know that with the aid of intesp krakovitch has destroyed something in romania i have been through krakovitchs files and i think i know what he destroyed the same thing which gave dragosani his powers krakovitch sees it as a great evil but i see it only as another tool a powerful weapon that is why the british are so eager to help krakovitch the fool is systematically destroying a possible route for future soviet supremacy then hes a traitor dolgikhs eyes narrowed the soviet union was all power struggles within the structure were only to be expected but treachery of this sort was something else no gerenko shook his head hes a dupe now listen at this very moment krakovitch gulharov and quint are stalled at a crossingpoint on the moldavian horder i organised that through andropov i know where they want to go and very shortly ill be sending you to deal with them there when exactly rather depends on how much we get from kyle but in any case we must stop them from doing any more damage which means that time is of the essence they cant be stalled forever and soon must be allowed to proceed also they know the location of whatever it is theyre seeking and we do not not yet tomorrow morning you will be there to follow them to their destination their ultimate destination at least i hope so dolgikh frowned theyve destroyed something you say and theyll do it again what sort of something if you had been in time to follow them into the romanian hills youd probably have seen for yourself but dont worry about it let it suffice that this time they mustnt succeed as gerenko finished speaking his telephone rang he lifted it to his ear and his expression at once became wary alert comrade krakovitch he said i was beginfling to worry about you i had expected to hear from you before now are you in chernovtsy he looked pointedly across his desk at dolgikh even from where he sat dolgikh could hear the angry tinny clatter of krakovitchs distant voice gerenko began to blink rapidly and a nervous tic jerked the corner of his mouth finally when krakovitch was finished he said listen comrade ignore that stupid frontier guard he isnt worth losing your temper over just stay exactly where you are and in a few minutes i shall have full authorisation phoned through but first let me speak to that idiot he waited a moment until he heard the slightly tremulous inquiring voice of the border official and then very quietly said listen do you recognise my voice good in approximately ten minutes i shall phone again and tell you i am the commissioner for frontier control in moscow ensure that you and you alone answer the phone and that you cant be overheard i will order you to let comrade krakovitch and his friends through and you will do so do you understand oh yes comrade if krakovitch should ask you what i have just said tell him i was shouting at you and calling you a fool yes of course comrade good gerenko put the phone down he looked at dolgikh as i was saying i couldnt hold them up forever already this affair is growing clumsy becoming embarrassing but even though theyll now go through to chernovtsy they can do nothing tonight and tomorrow youll be there to stop them doing anything dolgikh nodded do you have any suggestions in what respect about how it should be done if krakovitch is a traitor it seems to me that the easiest way of dealing with this would be no gerenko cut him off that would be hard to prove and he has the ear of the party leader remember we must never leave ourselves open to question in this matter he tapped a finger on his desk gave the problem a moments thought ah i think i may have it i have called krakovitch a dupe so let it appear let carl quint be the guilty party arrange it so that he can be blamed let it be seen that the british espers came into russia to discover what they could of ebranch and to kill its head why not theyve damaged the branch before havent they but on this occasion quint will err and become a fatality of his own strategy good said dolgikh im sure ill work something out along those lines and of course ill be the only witness light footsteps sounded and zek foener appeared on the office threshold she merely glanced coldly at dolgikh then fixed her gaze on gerenko kyle is a goldmine the sane part of him anyway there is nothing he doesnt know and hes releasing it in a flood he even knows a good many too many things about us things i didnt know fantastic things suddenly she looked tired gerenko nodded fantastic things i had supposed that they would be is that why you think hes partly insane that his mind is playing him tricks believe me it isnt do you know what they destroyed in romania she nodded yes but its hard to believe i gerenko held up a warning hand she understood felt caution emanating from him theo dolgikh was not to know like most of the other espers at the chвteau foener hated the kgb she nodded and kept her silence gerenko spoke again and is it the same sort of thing that lies hidden in the mountains beyond chernovtsy again she nodded very well gerenko smiled without emotion and now my dear you must return to your work give it total priority of course she answered i only came away while they were dosing him again and because i need a break from she shook her head dazedly her eyes were wide bright with strange new knowledge comrade this thing is utterly again gerenko held up his childs hand in warning i know she nodded turned and left her footsteps a little uncertain on the descending stone stairs what was all that about dolgikh was mystified that was the joint death certificate of krakovitch gulharov and quint gerenko answered actually quint was the only one who might have been useful but no longer now you can get on your way is the branch helicopter ready for you dolgikh nodded he began to stand up then frowned and said first tell me what will happen to kyle when you are finished with him i mean ill take care of that other pair of traitors and the british esper quint but what of kyle what will become of him gerenko raised his eyebrows i thought that was obvious when we have what we want everything we want then well dump him in the british zone in berlin there hell simply die and their best doctors wont know why but why will he die and what of that drug youre pumping into him surely their doctors will pick up traces gerenko shook his walnut head it leaves no trace it completely voids itself in a few hours that is why we have to keep dosing him a clever lot our bulgarian friends hes not the first one weve drained in this fashion and the results have always been the same as to why he will die he will have no incentive for life less than a cabbage he will not retain sufficient knowledge or instinct even to move his body there will be no control none his vital organs will not function he might survive longer on a lifesupport machine but and he shrugged braindeath dolgikh nodded and grinned but there you have it in a nutshell gerenko emotionlessly clapped his childs hands bravo for what is an entirely empty brain if not dead eh and now if youll excuse me i have a telephone call to make dolgikh stood up ill be on my way he said already he was looking forward to the task in hand theo said gerenko krakovitch and his friends they should be killed with despatch dont linger over it and one last thing do not be too curious about what they are trying to do up there in the mountains do not concern yourself with it believe me too much curiosity could be very very dangerous in answer to which dolgikh could only nod then he turned and left the room as their car drew away from the checkpoint towards chernovtsy quint might have expected krakovitch to carry on raging but he didnt instead the head of the soviet ebranch was quiet and thoughtful and even more so after gulharov quickly told him about the disconnected cable there are several things i not liking here krakovitch told quint in a little while at first i am thinking that fat man back there is simply stupid but now not being so sure and this business with the electricity all very strange sergei finds and fixes that which they could not and he does it quickly and without difficulty which would seem to make our fat friend at the checkpoint not only stupid but incompetent you think we were deliberately delayed quint felt an uneasy dark oppressiveness settling all around him like a positive weight on his head and shoulders that telephone call he got just now krakovitch mused the commissioner for frontier control in moscow i never heard of him but i suppose he must exist or must he one commissioner controlling all of the thousands of crossing points into the soviet union so i assume he exists which is meaning that ivan gerenko got in touch with him in the dead of night and that he then personally called up this little fat official in his stupid sentrybox of a control hut all in ten minutes who knew we were coming through here tonight quint in his way of going to the root of things asked the most obvious question eh krakovitch scratched behind his ear we knew it of course and and and my second in command at the chвteau bronnitsy ivan gerenko krakovitch turned to quint and stared hard at him then while i dislike saying it said quint if there is something funny going on gerenko has to be your man krakovitch gave a disbelieving snort shook his head but why what reason quint shrugged you have to know him better than i do is he ambitious could he have been got at and by whom but remember we did have that trouble in genoa and didnt you remark how surprised you were that the kgb were trailing you your explanation was that theyd probably had you under constant surveillance until we put a stop to it anyway but just lets suppose there is an enemy in your camp did gerenko know you were meeting us in italy apart from brezhnev himself through an intermediary who cannot be brought into question gerenko is the only one who knew krakovitch answered quint said nothing merely shrugged again and raised an eyebrow i am thinking said krakovitch slowly that from now on i tell no one how i moving until after the move is completed he looked at quint saw his troubled frown is there something else quint pursed his lips lets just say this gerenko fellow is a plant a spy in your organisation am i right in thinking he can only be working for the kgb for andropov yes almost certainly then gerenko must think youre a complete fool oh why do you say so in fact he thinks most men are fools he fears no one gerenko and so can afford to think so but i no i believe i am one of the few men who he respects or used to used to quint nodded but no more surely he must know youll work all of this out for yourself given a little time theo dolgikh in genoa and now this shambles at the romanosoviet border unless he himself is an idiot gerenko must know hes for the highjump as soon as you get back to moscow sergei gulharov had managed to understand most of this now he spoke to krakovitch in a soft rapid burst of russian hah krakovitchs shoulders jerked in a humourless chuckle for a moment he was silent then he said perhaps sergei is smarter than all of us and if he is then were in for trouble oh said quint what did sergei say he said perhaps comrade gerenko feels that he can now afford to be a little slipshod perhaps he isnt expecting to see me again in moscow and as for you carl we just crossed the border and youre in russia i know quint quietly answered and i must say i dont exactly feel at home strangely krakovitch nodded neither do i nothing more was said until they reached chernovtsy chapter fifteen back in london at intesp ho guy roberts and ken layard had traced alec kyle carl quint and yulian bodescu the devonbased team of espers had travelled back to the capital by train leaving ben trask to mend in the torquay hospital having used the journey to catch up on some sleep theyd got into ho just before midnight layard had roughly located the three figures in question and roberts had attempted to scry their whereabouts a little more precisely desperation had seemingly honed their talents and the familiarity of their surroundings had helped them to get results of a sort now roberts held a briefing in attendance were layard john grieve harvey newton trevor jordan and three others who were permanent members of the hos staff roberts was redeyed unshaven and itchy his breath reeked of an endless chain of cigarettes he glanced around the table and nodded to each man in turn then got straight into it weve been trimmed back a bit he said untypically phlegmatic kyle and quint are out of it perhaps permanently trask is banged up a bit darcy clarkes up north and and then theres poor simon gower and the result of our outing our job isnt only that much harder its that much more important yes and weve less men to do it we could certainly use harry keogh now but alec kyle was keoghs main man and alecs not here and as well as the danger we know exists out there loose theres now a second problem which could be just as big namely the espers of the soviet ebranch have got kyle on ice at the chвteau bronnitsy this was news to everyone except layard lips tightened and heartbeats stepped up ken layard took up the briefing were pretty sure hes there he said i located him i think but only with the greatest difficulty theyve got espers blocking everything in there far more concentrated than weve ever known it before the place is a mental miasma thats a fact roberts nodded i tried to pinpoint him get a picture of him and failed miserably just a general mindsmog which doesnt bode at all well for alec if his being there was all above board theyd have nothing to hide also hes not supposed to be there at all but here my guess is theyll be milking him for all hes worth and for all were worth if im coldblooded about it believe me its only to save time what about carl quint john grieve put the question hows he faring carls where he should be layard said near as i can make out in a place called chernovtsy under the carpathians whether hes there willingly is another matter but we think willingly roberts added ive managed to reach and see him however briefly and i think hes with krakovitch which only serves to confuse things further if krakovitch is straight up then why is kyle in trouble and bodescu newton asked he now felt he had a personal vendetta with the vampire that bastard is heading north roberts grimly answered it could be coincidence but we dont think so ultimately we think hes after the keogh child he knows everything knows the guiding force behind our organisation bodescu has been hit and now he wants to hit back the one mind in this entire world which is an authority on vampires particularly yulian bodescu is housed in that child that has to be his target we dont know how hes travelling layard carried on public transport could be he could even be thumbing lifts but hes certainly not in any sort of hurry hes just taking it easy taking his time he got into birmingham an hour ago since when hes been static we think hes put up for the night but its the same story as before he exudes this mental swamp thats what its like groping around in the heart of a foggy swamp you cant pinpoint him at all but you know theres a crocodile in there somewhere at the moment birmingham is the centre of it but do we have any plans jordan couldnt stand the inactivity i mean are we going to do something or do we just sit here playing with ourselves while everything goes to hell there are jobs for everybody roberts held up a huge controlling hand first i need a volunteer to go up and help darcy clarke in hartlepool apart from a couple of special branch men who are good blokes but simply cant be expected to know what theyre on darcys on his own the ideal thing would be to send a spotter except we dont have one right now so it will have to be a telepath he looked pointedly at jordan harvey newton got in first however saying thats me i owe bodescu that much he got by me last time but he wont do it again jordan shrugged and no one else objected roberts nodded ok but stay sharp go now by car the roads will be empty so you should be able to go flat out depending on how things go at this end ill probably be joining you sometime tomorrow that was all newton had wanted he stood up nodded once to all in general got on his way take a crossbow roberts called after him and harvey next time you shoot your bolt make sure you hit the target whats my job jordan asked youll work with mike carson roberts told him and with me and layard well try to locate quint again and you telepaths can take a stab at sending to him its a long shot but quints a spotter hes a psychic sensitive he might just feel you your message to him will be simple if he can hes to get in touch with us if we can get him on the phone we can perhaps find out about kyle and if he doesnt know about kyle well that in itself will answer one question also if we do manage to contact him it might be a good idea to tell quint to get the hell out of there if and while he can so thats the four of us tied up for the night he looked round the table the rest of you can concentrate on the proper running of this place before it comes apart at the seams every man jack is on duty full time as of now right are there any questions are we the only ones in on this john grieve asked i mean are the public the authorities still entirely in the dark totally what do we tell them that were chasing a vampire through the countryside from devon to british west hartlepool listen even the people who fund us and know we exist dont wholly believe in us how do you think theyd react to the facts about yulian bodescu and as for harry keogh of course the public is in the dark about it with a single exception anyway said layard weve had the police alerted to the fact that theres a mad killer on the loose bodescus description of course weve told them hes heading north possible destination the hartlepool area theyve been warned that if hes spotted theyre not to apprehend him but get in touch with us first then the special branch lads who are up there on the job as and when bodescu gets closer to his target then well be more specific thats as much as we dare do for now roberts looked from face to face any more questions he asked there were none am at brenda keoghs tiny but immaculate garret flat overlooking the main road through the town and across the road an old old cemetery harry jnr lay in his cot sleeping and dreaming baby dreams and his fathers mind slept with him exhausted from a struggle he now knew he had no hope of winning the child had him it was as simple as that harry was the babys sixth sense in the wee small hours of the misty morning with dawn still half a night away a thicker mist was forming in slumbering minds bringing horror as it swirled and eddied in subconscious caverns of dream and out of nowhere telepathic fingers were reaching probing discovering ahhh came that gurgling clotted mental voice in the two harrys minds is that you haarrryyy yesss i see it is well im coming for you haarrryyy im coming for you the babys scream of terror ripped his mother from her bed as if it were the hand of some cruel giant she stumbled to his tiny room shook herself awake as she entered and went to him and how he cried cried cried when she took him in her arms cried like shed never heard before but he wasnt wet and no nappy pins were sticking in him was he hungry no it wasnt that either she rocked him in her arms but still he sobbed and his little eyes wide and wild and full of fear a dream maybe but youre too tiny harry she told him kissing his hot little head far too tiny and sweet and so very very young to be dreaming naughty dreams thats all it was baby a naughty dream she carried him back to her own bed thinking yes and must have been dreaming too she must have been for the babys scream when it woke her hadnt sounded like the scream of a child at all but that of a terrified man it was in london where guy roberts and ken layard assisted by the telepaths trevor jordan and mike carson had spent the last ninety minutes trying to get through to carl quint without any success that they could measure they were working in layards private locations room an office or study set by solely for his use wall racks carried maps and charts of the entire world without which layards work for intesp would be almost impossible the map which had been spread on his desk for the last two hours was a blownup aerial recce photograph of the russomoldavian border with chernovtsy circled in red felttip the air was blue and acrid from robertss endless chainsmoking and steam whistled from an electric kettle in one corner where carson was making yet another cup of instant coffee im knackered roberts admitted stubbing out his halfsmoked cigarette and lighting another well take a break find somewhere quiet and try to snatch forty winks start up again in an hours time he stood up stretched said to carson stow the coffee for me mike one addictions enough thanks trevor jordan pushed his chair away from the desk went over to the rooms small window and opened it as far as possible he lowered himself into a chair beside it and hung his head out into the night layard yawned rolled up the map and pigeonholed it in a rack behind him in doing so he exposed the huge scale map of england which they had worked on earlier at ten miles to an inch the thing covered the desk he glanced at it at birminghams grey blot let his talent reach out and touch that sleeping city and guy layards whisper stopped roberts halfway out of the door he looked back eh layard jerked stiffly to his feet crouched over the map his eyes searched frantically and he licked suddenly dry lips guy he said again we thought he was down for the night but hes not hes off and running again and for all we know hes been on the move for the last hour and a half what the hell robertss tired mind could barely grasp it he came lurching back to the desk jordan too what are you talking about bodescu right said layard that bloody thing bodescu hes cleared off out of birmingham grey as death roberts slumped down into his chair as before he put a meaty hand over birmingham on the map closed his eyes forced his talent into action but no use there was nothing no mindsmog no slightest suggestion that the vampire was there at all oh christ roberts hissed through grating teeth jordan looked across the room at carson where he was stirring sugar into three cups of coffee square one mike he said youd better make it four after all it had been harvey newtons first choice to take the al north but in the end hed settled for the motorway what he lost in actual distance hed get back in speed comfort threelane running and the mls rulerstraight road at leicester forest east he stopped for a coffee break answered the call of nature picked up a can of coke and a wrapped sandwich and breathing the cool moist night air he turned up his coat collar and made his way back across the almost deserted car park to his car he had left the door open but had taken his keys with him the whole stop had taken no more than ten minutes now hed top up with petrol and get on his way again but as he approached his car he slowed down stopped his footsteps echoing back to him seemed to pause just a moment too late something niggled at the back of newtons mind he turned looked back towards the friendly lights of the allnight eater for some reason he was holding his breath and maybe it was a very good reason he turned in a slow circle took in the entire car park the squat hulking snailshapes of parked cars a heavy vehicle turning off the motorway lit him up in the glare of its thousand watt eyes he was dazzled and after the lorry angled away the night was that much darker then he remembered the upright forwardleaning dogthing he thought hed seen no which he had seen at harkley house and that brought his mission back into focus he shook off his nameless fears got into his car and started the engine something closed on newtons brain like a clamp a mind warped and powerful and growing ever more powerful he knew it was reading him like a stolen book reading his identity divining his purpose good evening said a voice like hot tar in newtons ear he gave a gasp of shock and terror combined an inarticulate cry and turning looked into the back of the car feral eyes fixed him in a glare far more penetrating far worse than the lorrys lamps beneath them the darkness was agleam with twin rows of white daggers wha newton started to say but there was no need even to ask he knew that his vendetta with the monster had run its course yulian bodescu lifted newtons crossbow aimed it directly into his gaping gasping mouth and pulled the trigger it had been felix krakovitchs plan to stay overnight in chernovtsy in the event however he had ordered sergei gulharov to drive straight on to kolomyya since ivan gerenko had known that krakovitchs party was scheduled to stop over in chernovtsy it had seemed a very good idea not to thus after theo dolgikh got into chernovtsy at about am it had taken him a futile and frustrating two hours simply to discover that the men he sought were not there after another delay while he contacted the chвteau bronnitsy gerenko had finally suggested that he go on to kolomyya and try again dolgikh had been flown from moscow to a military airport in skalapodolskaya where hed been required to sign for a kgb fiat now in the somewhat battered but unobtrusive car he drove to kolomyya and arrived there just before am discreetly checking out the hotels it was a case of third time lucky and also unlucky they had put up at the hotel carpatii but they had been up and on their way again by he had missed them by half an hour the proprietor was only able to tell him that before leaving theyd inquired the address of the towns library and museum dolgikh obtained the same address and followed after them at the museum he found the curator a bustling beaming little russian in thicklensed spectacles in the act of opening the place up following him inside the old cupolaed building where their footsteps echoed in musty air dolgikh said might i enquire if youve had three men in to see you this morning i was supposed to meet them here but as you see im late they were fortunate to find me working so early the other replied and luckier still that i let them in the museum doesnt really open until you see but since they were obviously in a hurry he smiled and shrugged so ive missed them by how much dolgikh put on a disappointed expression the curator shrugged again oh ten minutes maybe but at least i can tell you where they went i would be very grateful comrade dolgikh told him following him into his private rooms comrade the curator glanced at him his eyes bright and seeming to bulge behind the dense glass of his spectacles we dont hear that term too much down here on the border so to speak might i inquire who you are dolgikh presented his kgb identification and said that makes it official now then ive no more time to waste so if youll just tell me what they were looking for and where they went the curator no longer beamed no longer seemed happy are they wanted those men no just under observation a shame they seemed pleasant enough one cant be too careful these days said dolgikh what did they want a location they sought a place at the foot of the mountains called moupho aide ferenc yaborov a mouthful dolgikh commented and you told them where to find it no the other shook his head only where it used to be and even then i cant be sure look here he showed dolgikh a set of antique maps spread on a table not accurate by any means the oldest is about four hundred and fifty years old copies obviously not the originals but if you look there he put his finger on one of the maps youll see kolomyya and here ferengi the curator nodded one of the three english i believe seemed to know exactly where to look when he saw that ancient name on the map ferengi he grew very excited and shortly after that they left dolgikh nodded studied the old map very carefully its west of here he mused and a little north scale roughly one centimetre to five kilometres but as ive said the accuracy is very suspect something less than seventy kilometres then dolgikh frowned at the foot of the mountains do you have a modern map oh yes the curator sighed if youll just come this way fifteen miles out of kolomyya a new highway still under construction sped north for ivanofrankovsk its tarmac surface making for a smooth ride certainly to krakovitch quint and gulharov the ride was a delightful respite following in the wake of their bumpy bruising journey from bucharest through romania and moldavia to the west rose the carpathians dark forested and brooding even in the morning sunlight while to the east the plain fell gently away into greygreen distance and a far hazy horizon eighteen miles along this road in the direction of ivanofrankovsk they passed a fork off to the left which inclined upwards directly into misty foothills quint asked gulharov to slow down and traced a line on a rough map hed copied at the museum that could be our best route he said the road has a barrier krakovitch pointed out and a sign forbidding entry its disused a dead end and yet i sense thats the way to go quint insisted krakovitch could feel it too something inside which warned that this was not the way to go which probably meant that quint was right and it was theres grave danger there he said which is more or less what we expected said quint its what were here for very well krakovitch pursed his lips and nodded he spoke to gulharov but the latter was already slowing down up ahead the twin lanes narrowed into one where a construction gang worked to widen the road a steam roller flattened smoking tarmac in the wake of a tar spraying lorry gulharov turned the car aboutface and at krakovitchs command brought it to a halt krakovitch got out went to find the ganger and speak to him quint called after him whats up up oh i mean to see if these people know anything about this area also perhaps i am able to enlist their aid remember when we find what were looking for we still have to destroy it quint stayed in the car and watched krakovitch stride towards the workmen and speak to them they pointed along the deserted road to a construction shack krakovitch went that way ten minutes later he came back with a bearded giant of a man in faded overalls this is mikhail volkonsky he said by way of introduction quint and gulharov nodded apparently you are right carl krakovitch continued he says that back there up in the mountains thats the place of the gypsies da da volkonsky growled and nodded his concurrence he pointed westward quint got out of the car gulharov too they looked where the ganger pointed szgany volkonsky insisted szgany ferengi beyond the foothills rising out of the thin morning mist the blue smoke of a wood fire climbed almost vertically into the still air their camp said krakovitch they they still come quint shook his head in disbelief they still come their homage krakovitch nodded what now asked quint after a moments silence now mikhail volkonsky will show us the place said krakovitch that blocked off road we passed back there goes to within half a mile of the castles site volkonsky has actually seen the place all three searchers got back into the car the huge foreman with them and gulharov began to drive back the way theyd come quint asked but where does the road go nowhere krakovitch answered it was meant to cut through the mountains to the railhead at khust but a year ago the pass was declared unworkable because of shale sliding scree and badly fractured rock to force it through would constitute a major engineering feat and thered be little real benefit to show from it as an alternative and to save face the road will be driven through to ivanofrankovsk instead that is the existing road will be widened and improved all on this side of the mountains there is already a railway route however tortuous from ivanofrankovsk through the mountains as for the fifteen miles of new road already built he shrugged eventually there may be a town out there industrial sites it wont have been a total waste very little is wasted in the soviet union quint smiled however wryly krakovitch saw it said yes i know dogma its a disease we all seem to catch sooner or later now it appears i have it too there is great waste not least in the mass of words from which we build our excuses gulharov stopped the car at the new roads barrier volkonsky got out swivelled the barrier to one side waved them through they picked him up again and headed up into the mountains no one noticed the battered old fiat parked a halfmile down the road back towards kolomyya or the blue exhaust fumes and cloud of dust as it rumbled into life and followed in their tracks guy roberts had eaten two british rail breakfasts washed down with pints of coffee and by the time his train pulled out of grantham he was halfway through the days first packet of marlborough kings he was huge red eyed and whiskery and no one bothered him much he had his corner of the carriage all to himself no one looking at him would ever have guessed he possessed the talent of some primal wizard or that his mission was to slay a twentiethcentury vampire indeed the thought might be amusing if it wasnt so very desperate there were too many desperate things too much to do and no time to do it all it was so very tiring thinking back on the events of last night he lay back in his seat and closed his eyes he and layard had stayed with it right through the night and it had been one strange strange night for both of them kyle for instance at the chвteau bronnitsy as the sky had brightened into dawn so layard had found it increasingly difficult to locate alec kyle in his own words it had been like the difference between finding a live man and a dead one with kyle somewhere in between that didnt bode at all well for intesps number one roberts too had been unable to penetrate the chвteaus mind blocks he should have been able to scry kyle but all hed got on those few occasions when he had actually penetrated the mental defences of bronnitsys espers had been well an echo of kyle a fastfading image roberts didnt know for sure what ebranch was doing to kyle and he didnt much care to guess then thered been yulian bodescu or rather there hadnt been him for try as they might layard and roberts hadnt been able to relocate the vampire it was as if hed simply vanished off the face of the map there was no mindsmog in or around birmingham none anywhere in the whole country so far as the british espers were able to discover but after theyd thought about it for a little while then the answer had seemed obvious bodescu knew they were tracking him and he had talents too somehow he was screening himself making himself disappear out of mindscan but at in the morning layard had picked him up again very briefly hed made contact with a reeking writhing mindsmog an evil something that had sensed him at once snarling its mental defiance before disappearing once more and layard had located it somewhere in the vicinity of york that had been enough for roberts it had seemed to him that if thered ever been any doubt as to where bodescu was heading his destination was now confirmed leaving intesp hq once more in the capable hands of john grieve the permanent duty officer hed prepared to head north it was only as he was actually making his exit from the hq that word of harvey newton came in how his car had been discovered in an overgrown ditch just off the motorway at doncaster and how his mutilated body had been found in the boot with a crossbow bolt transfixing the head that had clinched it not only for roberts but for everyone else involved they didnt even consider that there might be some other explanation apart from bodescu from now on it would be outright warfare no quarter asked and none given until the fiend was staked decapitated burned and definitely dead at this juncture of robertss reflections someone ahemmed and stepped over his outstretched feet he opened his eyes briefly saw a slim man in a hat and overcoat claiming the seat beside him the stranger took off his hat shrugged out of his coat and sat down he produced a paperback book and roberts saw that it was dracula by bram stoker he couldnt help but grimace the stranger saw his expression shrugged almost apologetically a little fantasy doesnt hurt he said in a thin reedy voice no roberts growled his agreement before closing his eyes again fantasy doesnt hurt anyone and to himself but the real thing is something else entirely it was pm on the russian side of the carpathians and theo dolgikh was weary as a man could be but he drew strength from the sure knowledge that his job was almost done after this hed sleep for a week then indulge himself in as many pleasurable diversions as he could manage before seeking a new assignment assuming that was that he hadnt already been assigned some new task but pleasure can take many forms depending on the man and dolgikhs work had its moments his missions were often very satisfying certainly he was going to enjoy the end of this one he looked out and down from his vantage point in a clump of pines on the north face of the mountainside where it wound back into the gorge and trained his binoculars on the four men who climbed carefully along the last hundred yards of boulder and screelittered ledge weathered into the sheer cliff which formed the south face they were less than three hundred yards away but dolgikh used his binoculars anyway he enjoyed closeup the strain in their sweating faces imagined he could feel their aching muscles tried to picture their thoughts as they headed one last time for the old creepergrown ruins up there where the ravine bottlenecked and the stream rushed and gurgled unseen in the depths of the gorge theyd be congratulating themselves that their quest their mission was almost concluded ah but they could hardly imagine that they themselves were also at an end this was the part that dolgikh was going to enjoy bringing them to their conclusion and letting them know that he was their executioner most of the time the four moved in clear light free of shadows krakovitch and his man the british esper and the big construction boss but where the cliff overhung there they merged with brown and green shade and black darkness dolgikh squinted into the sky the sun was well past its zenith sinking slowly beyond the looming mass of the carpathians in just two more hours it would be twilight the carpathian twilight when the sun would abruptly slip down behind the peaks and ridges and that was when the accident would happen he trained his binoculars on them again the huge russian foreman carried a haversack with its strap across one shoulder a tshaped metal handle protruded the firing box for gelignite charges dolgikh nodded to himself earlier in the day hed watched them lay charges in and around the old ruins now they were going to blow the place and whatever it contained a fabulous weapon according to that twisted dwarf ivan gerenko to hell so they thought but that was what dolgikh was here to prevent he put his binoculars away waited impatiently until they were safely off the ledge and into the woods of the overgrown slope beyond then quickly moved in pursuit for the last time the cat and mouse game was over and it was time for the kill they were out of sight in thetrees now with perhaps a mile to go to the ruins and so dolgikh must make haste he checked his blunt bluedsteel standard issue malatukov automatic shoved home the clip of snubnosed rounds and reholstered the heavy weapon under his arm then he stepped out from cover directly opposite his position across the narrow gorge the new road came to an abrupt end this was the point at which someone had decided it wouldnt be cost effective to proceed further rubble from the blasted cliff filled the depression forming a dam for the mountain stream a small lake lay smooth as a mirror behind it beneath the dam the water had forced a route erupting in a torrent where the much reduced stream continued its course down towards the plain dolgikh scrambled down to the jumbled debris which formed the bridge of the dam and nimbly made his way across and up on to the road a minute more and hed left the tarmac behind for the narrow treacherous surface of the screelittered ledge and without further pause he followed in the tracks of his quarry as he went he thought back on the events of the day this morning hed followed them when they first came up here finding their car parked on the road hed hidden his fiat in a dense clump of bushes and tracked them on foot along this very ledge then at the apex of the gorge where the two sides almost came together theyd entered crumbling old ruins and searched through them dolgikh had observed keeping well back for maybe two hours theyd busied themselves digging in the ruins by the time they were ready to leave they all seemed much subdued dolgikh didnt know what theyd found or failed to find but in any case hed been told that it was probably dangerous and warned to steer clear seeing them about to leave hed quickly hurried back to his car waited for them to show up and in passing so as to be on the safe side hed fitted their vehicle with a magnetic bug theyd driven back into kolomyya then with dolgikh close behind but keeping just out of sight hed almost caught up with them where they stopped halfway back along the new road to talk with a party of gypsies in their encampment but in a few minutes theyd been on their way again and still they hadnt seen him kolomyya was a railhead and meeting point for four tracks from khust ivanofrankovsk chernovtsy and gorodenka every other building seemed to be a warehouse or storage depot it wasnt hard to find ones way about the industrial and commercial sides of the town were distinctly separate the four men dolgikh followed had driven to the towns main telephone exchange parked outside and gone in dolgikh parked his fiat stopped a passerby and asked about public call boxes three the man told him obviously disgusted only three public telephones in a town as big as this and all of them constantly in use so if youre in a hurry youd best make your call here at the exchange theyll put you through quick as a flash in about ten minutes krakovitch and his party had left the exchange got into their car and driven off their tracker had been torn two ways to follow them or find out who theyd contacted and why since their car was bugged and he could always find them later hed decided on the latter course inside the small but busy exchange hed wasted no time but asked for the manager his kgb id had guaranteed immediate cooperation it turned out that krakovitch had called moscow but not a number dolgikh was familiar with it seemed that the head of ebranch had required higher authorisation for something or other there had been some talk of blasting and the big man in overalls had been very much involved krakovitch had allowed him also to use the phone that was as much as anyone at the exchange knew of the matter dolgikh had then asked to be put through to gerenko at the chвteau bronnitsy to whom hed passed on all that he had learned at first gerenko had seemed confused but then theyre working directly through brezhnevs contact hed snapped not through me which can only mean that they suspect theo make sure you get them all yes including that construction foreman and when its done let me know at once tracking the bug hed planted dolgikh had arrived at the depot of a local civil engineering firm in the town just in time to see gulharov and volkonsky loading a box of explosives into the boot of their car while krakovitch and quint looked on obviously the big russian foreman was now a member of their team equally obvious their contact in moscow had cleared the use of materials for blasting while dolgikh still did not know what they intended to destroy he did have an idea where it was and what was more that was as good a place as any for them to die while theo dolgikh was thinking back on the days events carl quints mind was similarly engaged and now that the broken fangs of faethor ferenczys castle once more appeared through the dark motionless pines so his memory instinctively homed in on what he and felix krakovitch had found there during their first visit this morning all four of them had been present but only he and krakovitch had known where to look the place had been almost magnetic in their psychically enhanced minds the exact spot had drawn them like iron filings to a magnet except they were not filings and it was not their intention to get stuck here quint remembered now how it had been faethors castle hed breathed as they came to a halt at the very rim of the ruins the mountain fastness of a vampire and in the eye of his mind hed seen it again as it must have been a thousand years ago volkonsky would have gone clambering into and amongst the crumbling stone blocks but krakovitch had stopped him the ganger knew nothing at all of what was buried here and krakovitch didnt intend to tell him volkonsky was down to earth as any man could be at the moment he was committed to assist them but that might change if they tried to tell him what they were doing here and so krakovitch had simply warned be careful try not to disturb anything and the big russian had shrugged and climbed down again from the tumbled mass of the decaying old pile then quint and krakovitch together had simply stared at the place and touched its stones and let the aura of its antiquity and its immemorial evil wash over them theyd breathed its essence tasted of its mystery and let their talents lead them to its innermost secret as they had picked their way carefully almost timidly through the fallen rubble of ancient masonry suddenly quint had come to an abrupt halt and said huskily oh yes it was here all right it still is here this is the place and krakovitch had agreed yes i sense it too but i only sense it i dont fear it theres no warning to bar me from this place im sure that there was a great evil here but its gone now extinct utterly lifeless quint had nodded sighed his relief thats my feeling too still here but no longer active its been too long there was nothing to sustain it then they had stared at each other both of them thinking the identical thought finally krakovitch had given it voice dare we try to find it perhaps disturb it for a moment quint had known fear but then hed answered if i dont at least discover what it was like at the end i mean then ill wonder about it for the rest of my life and since were both agreed that its harmless now and so they had called up gulharov and volkonsky to the place where they stood and all four of them had set to work at first the going was easy and they used makeshift implements and their bare hands to clear away masses of loose dirt and rubble soon theyd revealed the inner core of an ancient stone staircase with the steps winding on the outside the stone had been scorched black with fire and was scarred by jagged cracks as from great heat apparently thibors plan had worked the spiral stairwell leading downstairs had been blocked by blazing debris burying the vampire women and the unfortunate ehrig alive yes and the burrowing protothing too all of them buried alive or undead but a thousand years is a long time in which even the undead might truly die then volkonsky had got his massive arms around a great block of fractured rock and eased it upwards from the rubble which seemed to completely choke the stairwell suddenly it had come loose at which gulharov had added his own not inconsiderable muscle to the task together theyd heaved the block up and over the rim of the excavation at which the debris at their feet had sighed and settled down a little and a blast of foul air had rushed up into their faces theyd jumped back startled but still there had been no threat in it no sense of impending danger after a moment taking gulharovs arm to steady himself the big russian foreman had stepped down from the already uncovered stone steps onto the now dubious surface of the material blocking the descent still clinging to gulharov hed stamped first one foot then the other and at once gone down with a cry of alarm up to his waist in the stuff as it suddenly shifted and gave way under him then the earth had seemed to rumble and shudder a little volkonsky had clung to gulharov for dear life quint and krakovitch had thrown themselves flat and reached down from above to grab hold of the ganger under his armpits but hed been quite safe for already his feet had found purchase on unseen steps below and as theyd all four watched in astonishment so the choking debris around volkonskys thighs had settled down collapsing in upon itself sinking like quicksand into the hollow depths of the stairwell hollow yes the stairs had not been completely choked but merely plugged and now the plug had been removed now its our turn quint had said when the dust had settled and they could breathe freely you and me felix we cant let mikhail go down there ahead of us for he has no idea what hes up against if there is still an element of danger attached to it we should be the first ones down there theyd climbed down beside volkonsky paused and looked at each other were unarmed krakovitch had pointed out up above sergei gulharov had produced an automatic pistol passed it down to them volkonsky saw it laughed he spoke to krakovitch who smiled quint asked what did he say he said why do we need a gun if were seeking treasure krakovitch answered tell him were scared of spiders said quint and taking the gun he had started down the littered steps what good bullets would be if the vampires were still extant he couldnt have said but at least the feel of the weapon in his hand was a comfort blackened chunks of rock large and small cluttered the stairs so badly that quint was often obliged to climb over them but after turning through another full spiral at last the steps were clear of all but small pieces of rubble pebbles and sand sifted down from above and at last he had been at the bottom with krakovitch and the others close on his heels light filtered down from above but not much its no good quint had complained shaking his head we cant go in there not without proper light his voice had echoed as in a tomb which was what the place was the place he spoke of was a room a dungeon the dungeon for it could be no other place than thibors prison beyond a low arched stone doorway maybe quints reluctance had been his final attempt to back away from this thing maybe not whichever the resourceful gulharov had the answer hed produced a small flat pocket torch passed it to quint who shone its beam ahead of him there under the arch of the doorway fossilised timber ageblackened fragments of oak lying in a pile with red splashes of rust marking the passing of defunct nails and bands of iron all that remained of a once stout door and beyond that only darkness then stooping a little to avoid a keystone which had settled somewhat through the centuries quint had stepped warily under the archway pausing just inside the dungeon and there hed aimed his torch in a slow circle to illumine each wall and corner of the place the cell was quite large larger than hed expected it had corners niches ledges and recesses where the beam of light couldnt follow and it seemed cut from living rock quint aimed the beam at the floor dust the filtered dust of ages lay uniformly thick everywhere no footprint disturbed it in roughly the centre of the floor a humped formation of stone possibly bedrock strained grotesquely upwards it seemed there was nothing here and yet quints psychic intuition told him otherwise his and krakovitchs too we were right krakovitchs voice had echoed dolefully hed moved to come up alongside quint they are finished they were here and we sense them even now but time has put paid to them hed moved forward leaned his weight on the anomalous hump of rock which at once crumbled under his hand in the next moment hed jumped back with a cry of sheer horror colliding with quint grabbing him and hugging him close oh god carl carl its not not stone gulharov and volkonsky both of them suddenly electrified had steadied krakovitch while quint shone his torch directly at the humped mass then mouth gaping and heart fluttering the englishman had breathed did you sense anything the other shook his head took a deep breath no no my reaction that was simply shock not a warning thank god for that at least my talent is working believe me it is working but it reveals nothing i was shocked just shocked but just look at this this thing quint had been awed hed moved forward carefully blown dust from the surface of the mass and used a handkerchief to dust it down parts of it anyway for even a perfunctory dusting had revealed total horror the thing was slumped where in uncounted years past it had groped one last time upwards from the packed earth of the floor it was one mass now the mummied remains of one creature but clearly it was composed of more than one person hunger and possibly madness had forced the issue the hunger of the protoflesh in the earth the madness of ehrig and the women there had been no way out and weak with hunger the vampires had been unable to resist the advances of the mindless subterranean creeper it had probably taken them one by one adding them to its bulk and now that bulk lay here fallen where it had finally mercifully died in the end governed only by weak impulse and indeterminate instinct perhaps it had attempted to reconstitute the others certainly there was evidence to that effect it had the breasts of women and a halfformed male head and many pseudohands eyes bulging behind their closed lids were everywhere and mouths some human and others inhuman yes and there were other features much worse than these emboldened gulharov and volkonsky had come forward the latter before he could be cautioned had reached out a hand and laid it upon a cold shrivelled breast where it protruded alongside a flabbylipped mouth all was the colour of leather and looked solid enough but no sooner had the big ganger touched the teat than it crumbled into dust volkonsky snatched back his hand with an oath stepped back a pace but sergei gulharov was much less timid he knew something of these horrors and the very thought of them infuriated him cursing he lashed out with his foot at the base of the thing where it sprouted from the floor lashed out again and again the others had made no attempt to stop him it was his way of working it out of his system he waded into the crumbling monstrosity fists and feet pounding at it and in a very little while nothing remained but billowing dust and a few fretted bones out krakovitch had choked lets get out of here before we suffocate carl hed clutched the others arm thank god it was dead and with their hands to their mouths finally theyd climbed back up the stairwell into clean healthy daylight that whatever it was should be buried volkonsky had growled to gulharov as they moved away from the ruins exactly krakovitch had taken the opportunity to agree with him so as to be absolutely certain it has to be buried and thats where you come in the four had been back to the ruins a second time since then when volkonsky had drilled holes laid charges unrolled a hundred yards of detonating cable and made electrical connections and now theyd returned for the third and last time and as before theo dolgikh had followed them which was why this would be the last time now from the cover of bushes back along the overgrown track near the cliff and its precarious ledge the kgb man watched volkonsky put down his firing box at the end of the prepared cable watched as the party moved on towards the ruins presumably for one last look this was dolgikhs best chance the moment the russian agent had been waiting for he checked his gun again took off the safety and reholstered it then quickly scrambled up the scree slope on his left and into a straggling stand of pines where the trees marched at the foot of the gaunt cliffs if he used his cover to its best advantage he could stay out of sight until the last minute and so moving with some agility beneath the trees he quickly closed the distance between him and his intended victims as they approached the gutted ruins in order to maintain his cover in this way dolgikh occasionally had to lose sight of his quarry but finally he reached the furthest extent of the cliffhugging trees and was forced back down into the lesser undergrowth of the old track from here the group of men at the ancient castles walls were plainly visible and if they should happen to look in dolgikhs direction they might also see him but no they stood silent one hundred yards away lost in their own thoughts as they gazed upon that which they intended to destroy all three of them were deep in thought three dolgikh squinted frowned glanced quickly all about he saw nothing out of the ordinary presumably the fourth man that young fool that traitor gulharov had entered through the broken exterior wall of the ruins and so passed out of sight whichever dolgikh knew that he now had all four men trapped there was no way out at their end of the defile and in any case they had to come back here to detonate the charges dolgikhs leering expression changed turned into a grim smile an especially sadistic thought had just occurred to him his original plan had been simple surprise them tell them he was investigating them for the kgb have them tie each other up finally hurl them one at a time from the castles broken rim it was a hell of a long way down hed make sure that part of the rotten wall went with them to make it more convincing then at a safe place hed climb down make his way back to them and carefully remove their bindings an accident as simple as that thered be no escape for them the nylon cord in dolgikhs pocket had a b breaking strain they probably wouldnt even be found for weeks months maybe never but dolgikh was something of a vampire in his own right except he fed on fear yes and now he saw the opportunity to give his plan an elaborate twist a little extra something for his own amusement he quickly kneeled used his strong square teeth to strip the cable down to its copper cores and connected up the firing box then still on one knee he called out loudly up the trail gentlemen the three turned saw him quint and krakovitch recognised him at once looked stunned now what are we having here he laughed holding up the box for them to see see someone is forgetting to make the connections but i have done it for him he put down the box and drew up the plunger for gods sake be careful with that carl quint threw up his arms in warning stumbled out of the ruins stay right where you are mr quint dolgikh shouted and in russian krakovitch you and that stupid ox of a foreman come to me and no tricks or i blow your english friend and gulharov to bits he gave the tshaped handle two savage righthand twists the box was now armed only depress the plunger and dolgikh are you mad krakovitch called back im here on official business the party leader himself is a mumbling old fool dolgikh finished for him as are you and youll be a dead fool if you dont do exactly as i say do it now and bring that lumbering engineer with you quint mr english mindspy you stay right there he stood up took out his gun and the nylon cord krakovitch and volkonsky had put up their hands in the air were slowly leaving the area of the ruins in the next split second dolgikh sensed that something was wrong he felt the tug of hot metal at his sleeve before he heard the crack of sergei gulharovs automatic for when the others had gone forward to the ruins gulharov had stepped into a clump of bushes to answer a call of nature he had seen and heard everything put up your gun he now yelled coming at dolgikh at a run the next shot goes in your belly gulharov had been trained but not nearly as thoroughly as theo dolgikh and he lacked the agents killer instinct dolgikh fell to his knees again straightened his gun arm toward gulharov aimed and squeezed the trigger of his weapon gulharov was nearly on him he too had fired again his shot went inches wide but dolgikhs was right on target his snubnosed bullet blew away half of gulharovs head gulharov dead on the instant jerked to a halt then took another stumbling step forward and crashed over like a felled tree directly on to the firing box and its extended plunger dolgikh hurled himself flat felt a hot wind blow on him as hell opened up just one hundred yards away deafening sound blasted his ears left them ringing with wild peals he didnt see the actual explosion or simultaneous series of explosions but as the spray of soil and pebbles subsided and the earth stopped shaking he looked up and then he did see the result on the far side of the gorge the ruins of faethors castle stood much as before but on this side they had been reduced to so much rubble craters smoked where the castles roots were bedded in the mountain a landslide of shale and fractured rock was still tumbling from the cliff onto the wide pitted ledge burying deep the last traces of whatever secrets had been there and of krakovitch quint and volkonsky nothing whatsoever flesh isnt nearly as strong as rock dolgikh stood up brushed himself down heaved gulharovs corpse off the detonating box he grabbed gulharovs legs and dragged his body to the smouldering ruins then toppled him from the cliff an accident a genuine accident on his way back down the track the kgb man rolled up what was left of the cable he also collected gulharovs gun and the box halfway down the ledge where it hugged the cliff he threw all of these things into the dark gurgling ravine it was finished now all of it before he got back to moscow he would have thought up an excuse a reason why gerenkos supposed weapon whatever it had been no longer existed that was a pity but on the other hand dolgikh congratulated himself that at least half of his mission had been accomplished successfully and very satisfactorily pm at the chвteau bronnitsy ivan gerenko lay in a shallow sleep on a cot in his inner office down below in the sterility of the brainwashing laboratory alec kyle also lay asleep his body anyway but since there was no longer a mind in there it was hardly kyle any longer mentally he had been drained to less than a husk the information this had released to zek foener had been staggering this harry keogh if he had still lived would have been an awesome enemy but trapped in the brain of his own child he was no longer a problem later maybe when the child had grown into a man as for intesp foener was now privy to that entire organisations machinery nothing remained secret kyle had been the controller and what he had known zek fцener was heir to which was why as the technicians dismantled their instruments and left kyles body naked and drained even of instinct she hurried to report something of her findings and one thing in particular to ivan gerenko zekintha fцeners father was east german her mother had been greek from zakinthos in the ionian sea when her mother died zek had gone to her father in posen to the university where he worked in parapsychology her psychic ability which he had always suspected in her when she was a child had become immediately apparent to him he had reported the fact of her telepathic talent to the college of parapsychological studies on brasov prospekt in moscow and had been summoned to attend with zek so that she could be tested that was how she had come to ebranch where she had rapidly made herself invaluable fцener was fivenine slim blonde and blueeyed her hair shone and bounced on her shoulders when she walked her chвteau uniform fitted her like a glove accentuating the delicate curves of her figure she climbed the stone stairs to krakovitchs office entered the anteroom and knocked firmly on the closed inner door gerenko heard her knock forced himself awake and struggled to sit up in his shrivelled frame he tired easily slept often but poorly sleep was one way of prolonging a life which doctors had told him would be short it was the ultimate irony men could not kill him but his own frailty surely would at only thirtyseven he already looked sixty a shrunken monkey of a man but still a man come in he wheezed as he sucked air into his fragile lungs outside the door while gerenko had come more surely awake zek fцener had broken a trust it was an unwritten rule at the chвteau that telepaths would not deliberately spy on the minds of their colleagues that was all very well and only decent in normal conditions normal circumstances but on this occasion there were gross abnormalities things which fцener must track down to her satisfaction for one the way gerenko had literally taken over krakovitchs job it wasnt as if he stood in for him at all but had in fact replaced him permanently fцener had liked krakovitch from kyle she had learned about theo dolgikhs surveillance activities in genoa kyle and krakovitch had been working together on come in gerenko repeated breaking her chain of thought but not before everything had fallen together gerenkos ambition burned bright in her mind bright and ugly and his intention to use those those things which krakovitch was quite rightly bent on destroying she drew air deeply and entered the office staring at gerenko where he lay in the dark on his cot propped up on one elbow he put on a bedside lamp and blinked as his weak eyes accustomed themselves yes what is it zek wheres theo dolgikh she waded straight in no preliminaries no formalities what he blinked at her is something wrong zek many things perhaps i said i heard what you said he snapped and what has it to do with you where dolgikh is i saw him for the first time with you on the morning that felix krakovitch left for italy after he left she answered following which he was absent until he brought alec kyle back here but kyle wasnt working against us he was working with krakovitch for the good of the world gerenko swung his brittle legs carefully off the cot onto the floor he should only have been working for the good of the ussr he said like you she came back at once her voice sharp as broken glass i know now what they were doing comrade something that had to be done for safety and sanity not for themselves but for mankind gerenko eased himself to his feet he wore childs pyjamas looked frail as a twig as he made for his great desk are you accusing me zek yes she was relentless furious kyle was our opponent but he personally had not declared war on us we arent at war comrade and weve murdered him no you have murdered him to foster your own ambitions gerenko climbed into his chair put on a desk lamp and aimed its light at her he steepled his hands in front of him shook his head almost sadly you accuse me and yet you were party to it you drained his mind i did not she came forward her face was working full of anger i merely read his thoughts as they flooded out of him your technicians drained him unbelievably gerenko chuckled mechanical necromancy yes she slammed her hand flat down on the desk top but he wasnt dead gerenkos shrivelled lips curled into a sneer he is now or as good as krakovitch is loyal and hes russian she wouldnt be stopped and yet youll murder him too and that really would be murder you must be mad and in that she had hit upon the truth for gerenkos warps werent only in his body that is enough he snarled now you listen to me comrade you speak of my ambition but if i grow strong russia herself grows that much stronger yes for we are one and the same you youve not been russian long enough to know that this countrys strength lies in its people krakovitch was weak and was her arms trembled where she leaned forward knuckles white on the edge of his desk he suddenly felt that she had grown very dangerous he would make one last effort listen zek the party leader is a weak old man he cant go on much longer the next leader however andropov her eyes went wide i can read it in your mind comrade is that how it will be that kgb thug the man you already call your master gerenkos faded eyes suddenly narrowed their slits blazing with his own anger when brezhnev is gone but he isnt not yet she was shouting now and when he learns of this that was an error a bad one even brezhnev couldnt harm gerenko not personally not physically but he could have it done for him at a distance he could have gerenkos state flat in moscow boobytrapped once a boobytrap is set no mans hand is involved from then on the thing is entirely automatic or gerenko could wake up one morning and find himself behind bars and then they could forget to feed him his talent did have certain limitations he stood up in his childs hand was an automatic taken from a drawer in the desk his voice was a whisper now you will listen to me he said and i will tell you exactly how it is going to be first you wont speak of this matter or even mention it again not to anyone youve been sworn to secrecy here at the chвteau break your trust and ill break you second you say we are not at war but you have a short memory the british espers declared war against ebranch nine months ago and they came close to destroying the organisation utterly you were new here then you were away somewhere holidaying with your father you saw nothing of it but let me tell you that if this harry keogh of theirs were still alive he paused for breath and fцener bit her tongue to keep from telling him the truth that indeed harry keogh was still alive however helpless third he finally continued i could kill you now on the spot shoot you dead and no one would even question me about it if they did i would say that i had had my suspicions about you for a long time i would tell them that your work had driven you mad and that you threatened me threatened ebranch you are quite correct zek the party leader puts a deal of faith in the branch he is fond of it under old gregor borowitz it served him well what a woman mad running around loose here threatening irreparable damage of course i should shoot her and i will if you dont mark each word i say most carefully do you think anyone would believe your accusation wheres the proof in your head in your addled head oh they just might believe ill grant you that but what if they didnt and would i sit still and simply let you have it all your own way would theo dolgikh sit still for that you have any easy time here zek ah but there are other jobs in other places for a strong young woman in the ussr after your rehabilitation doubtless theyd find you one again he paused put away the gun he saw that he had made his point now get out of here but dont leave the chвteau i want a report on everything you learned from kyle everything the initial report may be brief an outline ill have that by midday tomorrow the final report will be detailed down to the last minutia do you understand she stood looking at him bit her lip well finally she nodded blinked away tears of frustration turned on her heel on her way out he softly said zek and she paused but she didnt face him zek you have a great future remember that and really thats the only choice you have a great future or none at all then she left and closed the door behind her she went to her own small suite of rooms the austere quarters she used when she was not on duty and threw herself down on her bed to hell with his report shed do it in her own time if she did it at all for what use would she be to gerenko once he knew what she knew after a little while she managed to compose herself and tried to sleep but though she was weary to death she tried in vain chapter sixteen wednesday pm fifteen minutes to midnight in hartlepool on englands northeast coast and a thin drizzling rain turning the empty streets shiny black the last bus for the colliery villages along the coast had left the town half an hour ago the pubs and cinemas had all turned out grey cats slinked in the alleys and a last handful of people headed for their homes on a night when it simply wasnt worth being out but in a certain house on the blackhall road there was a muted measure of activity in the garret flat brenda keogh had fed her baby son and put him down for the night and was now preparing herself for bed in the hitherto empty first floor flat darcy clarke and guy roberts sat in neardarkness roberts nodding off to sleep and clarke listening with an anxious awareness to the timbers of the old house creaking as they settled for the night downstairs in the ground floor flat its permanent residents two special branch men were playing cards while a uniformed policeman made coffee and looked on in the entrance hail a second uniformed officer kept his vigil just inside the door smoking a slightly damp and illmade cigarette while he sat in an uncomfortable wooden chair and wondered for the tenth time just what he was doing here to the special branch men it was old hat they were here for the protection of the girl in the garret flat she didnt know it but they werent just good neighbours they were her minders hers and little harrys theyd looked after her for the better part of a year and in all of that time no one had so much as blinked at her theirs must be the cushiest best paid number in the entire length and breadth of the security business as for the two uniformed men they were on overtime kept over from the middle shift to do special duties they should have gone off home at pm but it appeared there was this bloody maniac on the loose and the girl upstairs was thought to be one of his targets that was all theyd been told all very mysterious on the other hand in the flat above clarke and roberts knew exactly why they were here and also what they were up against roberts uttered a quiet snort and his head lolled where he sat close to the curtained window in the livingroom he gave a grunt and straightened himself up a little and in the next moment began to nod again clarke scowled at him without malice turned up his collar and rubbed his hands for warmth the room felt damp and cold clarke would have liked to put on a light but didnt dare this flat was supposed to be empty and that was the way it must appear no fires no lights as little movement as possible all theyd allowed themselves by way of comfort was an electric kettle and a jar of instant coffee well a little more than that comforting too was the fact that earlier in the day a flame thrower had been delivered to roberts and both men had crossbows clarke picked up his crossbow now and looked at it it was loaded with the safety on how dearly he would love to sight it on yulian bodescus black heart he scowled again and put the weapon down lit up and drew deeply on one of his rare cigarettes he was feeling tired and miserable and not a little nervous that was probably to be expected but he put it down to the fact that hed been taking his coffee blacker and blacker until he felt sure his blood must now be at least seventyfive per cent pure caffeine hed been here since the early hours of the morning and so far nothing at least he had that much to be thankful for down in the entrance hall constable dave collins quietly opened the door of the flat looked into the livingroom stand in for me joe he said to his colleague five minutes for a breath of fresh air im going to stretch my legs down the road a bit the other glanced once more at the special branch men at their game stood up and began buttoning his jacket he picked up his helmet and followed his friend out into the hall then unlocked the door and let him out into the street fresh air he called after him youre joking looks like theres a fog coming up to me joe baker watched his colleague stride off down the road went back inside and closed the door he should by rights lock it but was satisfied to throw home the single small stainless steel bolt he took his seat beside an occasional table bearing a heap of junk mail and some old newspapers and a tin of cigarette tobacco and papers joe grinned rolled himself a free one hed just smoked the cigarette down when he heard footsteps at the door and a single quiet knock he got up unbolted the door opened it and looked out his colleague stood with his back to the door rubbing his hands and glancing up and down the road a fine film of moisture gleamed black on his raincoat and helmet joe flipped the stub of his cigarette out into the night and said that was a long five but that was all he said for in the next moment the figure on the threshold had turned and grabbed him in hands huge and powerful as iron bands and hed taken one look at the face under the helmet and knew that it wasnt dave collins it wasnt anybody human at all these were his last thoughts as yulian bodescu effortlessly bent joes head back and sank his incredible teeth into his throat they closed like a mantrap on his pounding jugular and severed it he was dead in a moment throat torn out and neck broken yulian lowered him to the floor turned and closed the door to the street he pushed home the light bolt that would suffice it had been the work of mere seconds a most efficient murder blood stained bodescus mouth as he snarled silently at the door of the ground floor flat he reached out his vampire senses and sent them beyond the closed door two men in there close together busy with whatever they were doing and totally unaware of their danger but not for long yulian opened the door and without pause strode into the room he saw the special branch officers seated at their card table they looked up smiling saw him his helmet and raincoat and casually returned to their game then looked again but too late yulian was in the room pacing forward reaching a taloned hand to pick up a service automatic with its silencer already screwed in position he would have preferred to kill in his own way but he supposed that this was as good as any the officers had barely drawn breath were scarcely risen to their feet before hed fired at them pointblank halfemptying the weapons magazine into their cringing shuddering bodies darcy clarke had been on the point of falling asleep perhaps for a little while he had been asleep but then something had woken him up he lifted his head all of his senses at once alert something downstairs in the hall a door closing furtive footsteps on the stairs it could have been any of these things but how long ago seconds or minutes the telephone rang and shocked him upright rigid as a pillar in his chair heart pounding he reached for the phone but guy robertss hand closed on it first i woke up a minute before you roberts whispered his voice hoarse in the darkness darcy i think somethings up he put the handset to his ear said roberts clarke heard a tinny voice from the telephone but couldnt make out what it said but he saw roberts give a massive start and heard his whooshing intake of breath jesus roberts exploded into life he slammed the phone down came rearing unsteadily to his feet that was layard he panted hes found the bastard again and guess where he is clarke didnt have to guess for his talent had taken over it was telling him to get the hell out of this house it was even propelling him towards the door but only for a moment for his talent knew that there was danger out there on the landing and now it was heading darcy towards the window clarke knew what was happening he fought it grabbed up his crossbow forced himself to follow robertss bulk to the door of the flat out on the first floor landing yulian had already sensed the hated espers in the room he knew who they were and how dangerous they were an old upright piano stood on broken castors with its back to the handrail at the top of the stairs it must weigh almost a fifth of a ton but that was hardly an obstacle to the vampire he grasped it gave a grunt and dragged it bodily into place in front of the door its castors snapped off and went skittering their broken housings ripping up the carpet as yulian finally got the piano positioned to his satisfaction no sooner was he finished than roberts was on the other side of the door trying to push it open shit roberts snarled it can only be him and hes trapped us in here darcy the door opens outwards give me a hand they thrust their shoulders at the door together and at last heard the pianos broken claws squealing on the scored floorboards a gap appeared and roberts thrust out an arm into darkness got a grip on the top of the piano and started to haul himself up and over it he dragged his crossbow after him with clarke pushing from behind where the hell are those idiots from downstairs roberts panted hurry for christs sake clarke urged him on hell be up the stairs by now but he wasnt the landing light came on sprawled on top of the piano robertss eyes stood out like shiny pebbles in his face as he gazed directly into the awful visage of yulian bodescu the vampire wrenched robertss crossbow from fingers made immobile through shock he turned the weapon and fired its bolt directly into the gap of the door behind the piano then he gurgled something from a throat clotted with blood and began to methodically batter at robertss head the wire string of the crossbow hummed with the speed and force of his blows roberts had screamed once one high shrill scream before he fell silent under yulians onslaught blow after blow the vampire rained on him until his head was a raw red pulp that dripped brains onto the pianos keyboard and only then did he stop inside the room clarke had heard the thrumm of the bolt where it missed him by a hairsbreadth and looking out through the gap in the door halfblinded by the light he had seen what this nightmare thing had done to roberts numb with horror nevertheless he tried to line up his own weapon for a shot but in the next moment yulian had thrust robertss corpse back inside the room on top of clarke and rammed the piano back up against the door and that was when clarke broke he couldnt fight that thing out there and his talent the latter wouldnt let him instead he dropped the crossbow stumbled back inside the flat and sought a window looking down on the street outside there was no longer any coherency left in him all he wanted to do was get away as far and as swiftly as possible in the garret flatlet brenda keogh had been asleep for only twenty minutes a scream like the welling cry of a tortured animal had snatched her awake brought her tumbling out of bed at first she thought it was harry but then she heard scuffling sounds from downstairs and a noise like the slamming of a door what on earth was going on down there she went a little unsteadily to her door opened it and leaned out to listen for any recurrence of the sounds but all was silent now and the tiny landing stood in darkness a darkness which suddenly flowed forward to send her crashing back into the room and now yulian was within an ace of his revenge and his coughing growl was full of triumph as he gazed with a wolfs eyes on the girl sprawled upon the floor brenda saw him and knew she must be nightmaring she must be for nothing like this should live and breathe and move in any sane waking world the creature was or had been a man certainly he stood upright however forwardsloping his arms were long and the hands at the ends of those arms were huge and clawlike with projecting nails the face was something unbelievable it might have been the face of a wolf but it was hairless and there were other anomalies which also suggested a bat his ears grew flat to the sides of his head they were long and projected higher than the rearward sloping elongated skull his nose no his snout was wrinkled convoluted with black gaping nostrils the skin of the whole was scaly and his yellow eyes scarletpupilled were deep sunken in black sockets and his jaws his teeth yulian bodescu was wamphyri and he made no effort to hide it that essence of vampire in him had found the perfect receptacle had worked on him like yeast in a potent brew he was at the peak of his strength his power and he knew it in everything he had done no trace had been left which might definitely identify him as the author of the crime intesp would know it of course but no court could ever be convinced and intesp as yulian had discovered was far from omnipotent indeed it was impotent its members were merely human and fearful he would hunt them down one by one until hed destroyed the entire organisation he would even set himself a target say one month to be rid of all of them for good but first there was the child of this woman that scrap of life which contained his one and only peer in powers his helpless peer yulian swept upon the girl where she cringed locked his beasts fist in her hair and half dragged her to her feet where his gurgling voice questioned the child where brendas mouth fell open harry this monster wanted harry her eyes widened flashed involuntarily towards the babys tiny room and the vampires eyes lit with knowledge as he followed her glance no she cried and drew breath for a scream of sheer terror which she never uttered yulian threw her down and her head banged against the polished floorboards she lost consciousness at once and he stepped over her loped to the open door of the small room in the middle flat struggling blindly with an old sash window which seemed jammed darcy clarke suddenly felt his terror drain out of him or if not his terror certainly his urge to flee his talents demands were ebbing which could only mean that the danger was receding but how yulian bodescu was still in the house wasnt he as sanity returned clarke stopped trembling found a switch and put on the light adrenalin flooded into his system now he could focus his eyes again could see the catches with which the window had been made secure he released them and unprotesting the window slid upward along its grooves clarke sighed his relief at least he now had an emergency exit he glanced out of the window down into the midnight road and froze at first his eyes refused to accept what they were seeing then he gasped his horror and felt the flesh creep on his shoulders and back the road outside the house was filling with people silent streams of them were converging massing together they were coming out of the cemetery gates over its front wall men women and children all silent crossing the road to gather in front of the house but worse than the sight of them was their silence for they were quiet as the graves they had so recently vacated their stench drifted up to clarke on the damp night air the overpowering stomachwrenching reek of moulder and advanced decay and rotting flesh eyes popping he watched them they were in their graveclothes some of them recently dead and others others who had been dead for a long time they flopped over the cemetery wall squelched out of its gate shuffled across the road and now one of them was knocking on the house door seeking entry clarke might have thought he was mad and indeed that thought occurred to him but in the back of his mind he knew and remembered that harry keogh was a necroscope he knew keoghs history a man who could talk to the dead whom the dead respected even loved whats more keogh could raise the dead up when he had need of them and didnt he have need of them now that was it this was harrys doing it was the only possible answer the crowd at the door began to turn their grey fretted heads upward they looked at clarke beckoned to him pointed at the door they wanted him to let them in and clarke knew why perhaps im mad after all he thought as he ran back through the flat to the door its past midnight and theres a vampire on the loose and im going downstairs to let a horde of dead men come inside but the door of the flat was immobile as ever with the piano still wedged against it on the landing outside clarke put his shoulder to it and shoved until he thought his heart would burst the door was giving way but only an inch at a time he simply didnt have the bulk but guy roberts did clarke didnt know his dead friend had stood up until he saw him there at his side helping to force the door open roberts his head a crimson jelly where it flopped on his shoulders with the broken skull showing through inexorably thrusting forward filled with a strength from beyond the grave and then clarke simply fainted away the two harrys had looked out through the infants eyes into the face of terror itself the face of yulian bodescu crouched over the babys cot the leering malignancy of his eyes spoke all too clearly of his intention finished harry keogh thought all done and it ends like this no another voice not his own had spoken in his mind no it doesnt through you ive learned what had to learn dont need you that way any more but i do still need you as a father so go save yourself it could only have been one person speaking to him doing it now for the first time when there was no longer any time to question the hows and whys of it for harry had felt the childs restraints falling from him like broken chains leaving him free again free to will his incorporeal mind into the safety of the mцbius continuum he could have gone right there and then leaving his baby son to face whatever was coming he could have gone but he couldnt bodescus jaws had yawned open like a pit revealing a snakes tongue flickering behind the dagger teeth go little harry had said again with more urgency youre my son harry had cried damn you i cant go i cant leave you to this leave me to this it had been as if the infant couldnt follow his reasoning but then he did and said but did you think i was going to stay here the beasts taloned hands were reaching for the child in his cot yulian saw now that harry jnr was was more than a child harry keogh was in him yes but it was even more than that the baby boy looked at him stared at him with wide moist innocent eyes and was totally unafraid or were those eyes innocent and for the first time since harkley house yulian knew something of fear he drew back a fraction then checked himself this was what he was here for wasnt it best to get it done with and quickly again he reached for the baby little harry had turned his small round head this way and that seeking a mцbius door there was one beside him floating up out of his pillows it was easy instinct in his genes it had been there all along his control over his mind was awesome over his body much less certain but hed been able to manage this much bunching inexpert muscles hed curled himself up rolled into and through the mцbius door the vampires hands and jaws had closed on thin air yulian strained back and away from the cot as if it had suddenly burst into flames he gaped then pounced upon the cots covers tearing them to shreds nothing the child had simply disappeared one of harry keoghs tricks the work of a necroscope not me yulian said harry softly from behind him not this time he did it all for himself and thats not all he can do yulian whirled saw harrys naked figure outlined in glowing blue neon mesh advanced menacingly upon him he passed through the manifestation found himself tearing at nothing what he gurgled what harry was behind him again youre finished yulian he told him then with a deal of satisfaction whatever evil youve created we can undo it we cant give life back to those youve destroyed but we can give some of them their revenge we the vampire spoke round the snake in his mouth his words dripping like acid theres no we theres only you and if it takes me forever ill you dont have forever harry shook his head in fact youve no time left at all there was a soft but concerted shuffling of footsteps on the landing and up the stairs something no a good many somethings were coming into the flat yulian swept out of the tiny bedroom into the flats main room and skidded to a halt brenda keogh no longer lay where he had tossed her but yulian barely noticed that the keogh manifestation suspended in thin air moved after the vampire to watch the confrontation a policeman his throat torn out was leading them and with steps slow and staggering but full of purpose they came on you can kill the living yulian harry told the mewling vampire but you cant kill the dead you yulian turned to him again you called them up no harry shook his head my son called them up he must have been talking to them for quite some little time and theyve grown to care for him as much as they care for me no bodescu rushed to the window saw that it was old and no longer opened one of the corpses a thing that shed maggots with every step lurched after him in its bony hand it carried darcy clarkes crossbow others had long wooden staves taken from cemetery fences animated corruption was now spewing into the room like pus from a ruptured boil its all over yulian said harry bodescu turned on them all scowled his denial no it wasnt over yet what were they anyway but a mirage and a mob of dead men keogh you bodiless bastard he snarled and did you think you were the only one with powers he crouched down spread his shoulders laughed in their faces his neck elongated the flesh rippling with a life of its own his terrible head was now like that of some primal pterodactyl his body seemed to flutter flattening in depth and increasing in width until his clothes unable to contain it tore into so many rags around him he reached out his arms and lengthened them forming a blasphemous cross then grew a webbing of wing down each side of his body with greater ease more fluency far than ever faethor ferenczy had possessed he completely remoulded his vampire flesh and where moments before a manlike being had stood now a huge batlike creature confronted its hunters then the thing that was yulian bodescu turned and launched itself at the thinlatticed panes of the wide bay window dont let him get away harry told them but without need for that wasnt their intention yulian went out through the latticework showering glass and fragments of painted woodwork down into the road now he formed an aerofoil curving his monstrous body like a straining kite to catch a night wind blowing up from the west but the avenger with the crossbow stood in the gap of the broken window and aimed his weapon a corpse without eyes should not see but in their weird pseudolife these pieces of crumbling flesh enjoyed all of the senses theyd known in life and this one had been a marksman he fired and the bolt took yulian in his spine halfway down his rubbery back the heart harry admonished you should have gone for his heart but in the end it was all to work out the same yulian cried out the raucous ringing cry of a wounded beast he bent his body in a contortion of agony lost his control sank like a crippled bird towards the graveyard he tried to maintain his fight but the bolt had severed his spine and that would take time to mend there was no time left yulian fell into the cemetery crashing into the damp shrubbery and at once the crumbling dead turned in their tracks and began to file out of the garret flat shuffling in pursuit down the stairs they went some with their flesh sloughing from their bones and others who couldnt help but leave bits behind which followed of their own accord harry went with them with all of the dead hed befriended oh how long ago when hed lived here and new friends he hadnt even spoken to yet there were two young policemen among them whod never return home to their wives and another two from special branch with bullet holes like scarlet flowers blooming in their clothing and there was a fat man called guy roberts whose head wasnt much of anything any more but whose heart was in the right place roberts had come to hartlepool with a job to do which he expected to finish right now down the stairs out of the door and across the road they all went and into the graveyard there were plenty of stragglers there who hadnt made it over the road to the flat who simply werent in any condition to do so but when yulian had fallen theyd ringed him about advancing on him with their staves and threatening in their mute mouldering way through the heart harry told them when he arrived damn it harry but he wont keep still one of them protested his hides like rubber too and these staves are blunt maybe this is the answer another corpse recently dead came forward this was constable dave collins who walked all aslant because yulian had broken his back in an alley not a hundred yards down the road in his hands he carried the cemetery caretakers sickle a little rusty from lying in the long grass under the graveyard wall thats the way harry agreed ignoring yulians hoarse screaming the stake the sword and the fire ive got the last someone whose head had collapsed utterly guy roberts stumbled forward dragging heavy tanks and a hose an army flamethrower and if yulian had screamed before now he did so in earnest the dead payed him no heed they piled onto him and held him down and in his extreme of terror even yulian bodescu terrified he reshaped his vampire body to that of a man it was a mistake for now they could find his heart more easily one of them brought a piece of a broken headstone for a hammer and at last a stave was driven home pinned down like some ugly butterfly yulian writhed and shrieked but it was nearly over now dave collins looking on sighed and said an hour ago i was a policeman and now it seems im to be an executioner its a unanimous verdict dave harry reminded him and like the grim reaper himself so dave collins advanced and took yulians hideous head as cleanly as possible even though he had to strike more than once or twice after that it was guy robertss turn he worked on the now silent vampire with roaring gouting blistering cleansing fire until there was really nothing much left of him at all and he didnt stop until his tanks were empty by then the dead were dispersing back to their riven graves it was time for harry to move on the wind had blown yulians fog away the stench of putrefaction too and stars were shining in the night sky harrys work was finished here but elsewhere there was still a great deal to be done he thanked the dead one and all and found a mцbius door harry was almost used to the mцbius continuum now but he suspected that most human minds would find it unendurable for it was always nowhere and nowhen on the spacetime mцbius strip but a man with the right equations the right sort of mind could use it to ride anywhere and everywhen before that of course he would need to conquer his fear of the dark for in the physical universe there are degrees of darkness and nature seems to abhor all of them much as she abhors a vacuum the metaphysical mцbius continuum however is made of darkness that is all it consists of beyond the mцbius doors lies the very primal darkness itself which existed before the material universe began harry might be at the core of a black hole except a black hole has enormous gravity and this place had none it had no gravity because it contained no mass it was immaterial as thought itself yet like thought it was a force it had powers which reacted to harrys presence and worked to expel him like a mote caught in its eye he was a foreign body which the mцbius continuum must reject at least that was how it had used to be but this time harry sensed that things were different previously there had always been this sensation of matterless forces pushing at him attempting to dislodge him from the unreal back into the real and he had never dared to let that happen except where or when he desired it to happen else he might well emerge in a place or time totally untenable but now now it seemed to him that those same forces were bending a little perhaps even jostling each other to accommodate him and in harrys unfettered incorporeal mind he believed he knew why intuition told him that this was his yes his metamorphosis from real to unreal from a flesh and blood being to an immaterial awareness from a living person to a ghost harry had always refused to accept that premise that he was in fact dead but now he began to fear that it might indeed be so and mightnt that explain why the dead loved him so the fact that he was one of theirs he rejected the idea angrily angry with himself no for the dead had loved him before this when he was still a man fullfleshed and that was a thought which also angered him i still am a man he told himself but with far less authority for now that hed conjured it the idea of a subtle metamorphosis was growing in him something less than a year ago he had argued with august ferdinand mцbius about a possible relationship between the physical and metaphysical universes mцbius in his grave in a leipzig cemetery had insisted that the two were entirely separate unable to impose themselves in any way one upon the other they might occasionally rub up against each other the action producing reaction on both sides such as ghosts or psychic experiences on the physical plane but they could never overlap and never run concurrent and as for jumping from one to the other and back again but harry had been the anomaly the fly in mцbiuss ointment the spanner in the works or perhaps the exception that proves the rule all of that however had been when he had form when he was corporeal and now perhaps now the rule was at last asserting itself ironing out the discrepancy harry belonged here he was no longer physical but metaphysical and so should remain here here forever riding the unimaginable and scientifically impossible flux of forces in the abstract mцbius continuum perhaps he was becoming one with the place word association forceflux force fields lines of force lines of life the bright blue lines of life extending forward beyond the doors to future time and suddenly harry remembered something and wondered how it could possibly have slipped so far to the back of his mind the mцbius strip couldnt claim him not yet anyway because he had a future hadnt he seen it for himself he could even witness it again if he wished by simply finding a futuretime door or perhaps this time it wouldnt be so simple what if the mцbius continuum should claim him while he traversed time that was an unbearable thought to hurtle into the future forever but no need to take the risk for harry could remember it well enough the scarlet lifeline drifting closer angling in towards his own and harry juniors blue threads yulian bodescu surely and then the infants lifethread abruptly veering away from his fathers racing off at a tangent that must have been his escape from the vampire the moment when hed first used the mцbius continuum in his own right after that then thered been that impossible collision that strange blue lifethread dimming crumbling disintegrating converging with harrys own thread out of nowhere the two had seemed to bend towards each other as by some mutual attraction before slamming together in a neon blaze and speeding on as one thread briefly harry had felt the presence or the faint fading echo of another mind but then it was gone extinct and his thread rushing on alone yes and he had recognised that dying echo of a mind now he knew for sure where he must go who he must seek out and with something less than his usual dexterity he found his way to intesp ho in london the top floor selfcontained suites of offices labs private quarters and a communal recreation room which comprised intesp ho were in turmoil fifteen minutes ago something had occurred which despite the nature of the ho and the various talents of its personnel was completely beyond all previous experience there had been no warning the thing had not telegraphed itself to intesps telepaths precogs or other psychic sensitives it had simply happened and left the espers running round in circles like ants in a disturbed nest it had been the arrival of harry keogh jnr and his mother the first intesp had known of it was when all the security alarms went off simultaneously indicators had shown that the intruder was in the top office alec kyles control room no one but john grieve had been in that room since kyle flew to italy and the place was now secured there couldnt possibly be anybody in there it could be a fault in the alarm system of course but and then had come the first real intimations of what was happening all of intesps espers had felt it at the same time a powerful presence a mental giant in their midst here at ho harry keogh finally theyd got the door to kyles office open and found mother and child curled up together in the middle of the office carpet nothing physical had ever manifested itself in this way before not here at intesp anyway when keogh himself had visited kyle here he had been incorporeal without substance a mere impression of the man keogh had been but these people were real solid alive and breathing they had been teleported here the why of it was obvious to escape bodescu as for the how that would have to wait mother and child and therefore intesp itself were safe and that was the main thing at first it had been thought that brenda keogh was simply asleep but when grieve carefully examined her he found the large soft lump at the back of her head and guessed she was concussed as for the baby he had looked around alert and wideeyed appeared a little startled but not unduly afraid lying in his mothers relaxed arms sucking his thumb not much wrong with him with the greatest care and attention to their task the espers had then carried the pair to staff accommodation and put them to bed and a doctor had been summoned then intesps buzzing members had concentrated themselves in the ops room to talk it over which was when harry came on the scene while his coming was startling if anything it was less of a shock and more of an anticlimax the previous materialisation had prepared them for it it might even be said that he was expected john grieve had just taken the ops room podium and turned the lights down a little when harry appeared he came in the form all of the espers had heard about but which few of them and none present had ever seen a faint mesh of luminous blue filaments almost a hologram in the image of a man and again that psychic shockwave went out telling them all that they were in the presence of a metaphysical power john grieve felt it too but he was the last of them to actually see harry for hed appeared on the podiums platform slightly to grieves rear then the permanent duty officer heard the concerted gasp that went up from his small audience where theyd taken their seats and he turned his head my god he said staggering a little no said harry just harry keogh are you all right grieve had almost fallen from the podium only finding his balance at the last moment he steadied himself said yes i think so then he held up his hand to quiet the buzz of excited expectant conversation whats happening harry he got down off the podium and backed away try not to be frightened harry told them all this was a ritual he was getting used to im one of you remember were not frightened harry ken layard found his voice just cautious im looking for alec kyle said harry is he back yet no grieve shook his head turned his face away a little and he probably wont be but your wife and son got here ok the keogh manifestation sighed visibly relaxed this told him the extent of the babys delving into his mind good he said about brenda and the baby i mean i knew theyd be somewhere safe but this place has to be the safest the handful of espers were now on their feet had come forward to the base of the raised platform but didnt you er send them here grieve was puzzled harry shook his neon head that was the babys doing he brought them both here through the mцbius continuum youd better look after that one for hes going to be a hell of an asset listen there are things that cant wait so explanations will have to tell me about alec grieve did and layard added i know hes there at the chвteau but i read him like well like hes dead that hit harry hard that strange blue lifethread dimming crumbling disintegrating alec kyle there are things youll want to know he told them apparently in a hurry now things you have every right to know first yulian bodescu is dead someone whistled his appreciation and layard cried christ thats wonderful it was harrys turn to avert his face guy roberts is dead too he said for a moment there was silence then someone asked darcy clarke hes fine harry answered as far as i know listen everything else will have to wait ive got to go now but ive a feeling ill be seeing all of you again he collapsed in upon himself to a single point of radiant blue light and disappeared harry knew the route to the chвteau bronnitsy well enough but the mцbius continuum fought him all the way it fought to retain him to keep him to itself the longer he remained unbodied the worse it would become until finally hed be trapped in the endless night of an alien dimension but not yet alec kyle was not dead and harry knew it if he had been then harry could simply reach out his mind and talk to him as he talked to all the dead but though he tried however tentatively at first cringingly mercifully there was no contact this made him bolder he tried harder putting every effort into contacting kyles mind while yet hoping that hed fail but this time harry felt horror wash over him as indeed he picked up the faint failing echo of the man h had known an echo yes a depairing fading cry tailing off into nothing but it was all the beacon harry needed and he homed in on it in a moment then it was as if he were caught in a maelstrom it was harry jnr all over again but ten times worse and this time there was no resisting it harry did not have to fight free of the mцbius continuum but was ripped out of it intact torn from it and inserted elsewhere it hadnt been easy but zek fцener had eventually fallen asleep only to toss and turn for hours in the throes of sheerest nightmare finally shed started awake in the small hours of the morning and looked all about in the darkness of her spartan room for the first time since coming to the chвteau bronnitsy the place seemed alien to her her job here was empty now it offered neither reward nor satisfaction indeed it was evil it was evil because the people she worked for were evil under felix krakovitch things had been different but under ivan gerenko his very name had become a bad taste in zeks mouth her life would be impossible if he took control here and as for that squat murderous toad theo dolgikh zek had got up splashed cold water in her face made her way down to the cellars which housed the chвteaus various experimental laboratories on her way on the stairs and in a corridor shed passed a nightduty technician and an esper both had nodded their respect but shed hardly noticed merely brushed by them and continued on her way she had her own respects to pay to a man as good as dead letting herself into the mindlab shed taken a steel chair and sat beside alec kyle touched his pale flesh his pulse was erratic the rise and fall of his chest weak and abnormal he was almost totally braindead and less than twentyfour hours from now the authorities in west berlin wouldnt know who he was or what had killed him murder pure and simple and she had been part of it she had been duped told that kyle was a spy an enemy whose secrets were of the utmost importance to the soviet union while in reality they were only of the utmost importance to ivan gerenko she had defended herself before that sick creature made excuses when he said shed been party to it but there was no defence against her own conscience oh it was easy for gerenko and the thousands like him who only ever read reports zek read minds and that was a different matter entirely a mind is not a book books only describe emotions they rarely make you feel them but to a telepath the emotion is real raw and powerful as the story itself she hadnt simply read alec kyles stolen diary shed read his life and in doing so she had helped to steal it an enemy yes she supposed hed been that in that he held allegiance to another country a different code but a threat oh in higher echelons of his government there were doubtless personalities who would wish to see russia devolve become subservient but kyle wasnt a militarist hed been no subversive strategist worrying at the foundations of communist identity and society no hed been humanitarian with an overwhelming belief that all men were brothers or should be and his only desire had been to maintain a balance in his work for the british ebranch hed been used much as zek herself was now being used when both of them could have been working towards greater things and where was alec kyle now nowhere his body was here but his mind a very fine mind was gone forever eyes filming zek looked up looked scathingly at the machinery backed up against the sterile walls vampires the world was full of them what of these machines which had sucked out his knowledge and sluiced it all away forever but a machine cant feel guilt which is an entirely human emotion she came to a decision if it were at all possible shed find a way to break free of ebranch there had been cases before where telepaths lost their talent so why shouldnt she if she could fake it convince gerenko that she was no longer of any use to this sinister organisation then zeks train of thought stopped right there under her fingertips where they lay on kyles wrist his pulse had suddenly grown steady and strong his chest was now rising and falling rhythmically his mind his mind no the mind of another an astonishing wave of psychic power washed outwards from him it wasnt telepathy wasnt anything zek had felt before but whatever it was it was strong she snatched back her hand and sprang to her feet found her legs wobbly as jelly and stood gulping staring at the man lying on the operating table that should have been his deathbed his thoughts at first jumbled finally fell into a rhythm of their own it isnt my body harry told himself without knowing that someone else was listening but its a good one and its going free theres nothing left for you alec but theres still a chance for me a good chance for harry keogh god alec wherever you are now forgive me his identity was in zeks mind and she knew shed made no mistake her legs began to buckle under her then the figure whoever however it was on the table opened its eyes and sat up and that finished the job for a moment she passed out two or three ticks of the clock but sufficient time in which to slump to the floor time enough too for him to swing his legs off the table and go down on one knee beside her he rubbed her wrists briskly and she felt it felt his warm hands on her suddenly cold flesh his warm alive strong hands im harry keogh he said as her eyes fluttered open zek had learned a little english from british tourists on zakinthos i i know she said and i im crazy he looked at her at her grey chвteau uniform with its single diagonal yellow stripe across the heart looked all around at the room and its instruments finally looked with a great deal of wonder at his own naked self yes at his self now and to her he said accusingly did you have something to do with this zek stood up looked away from him she was still shaky not quite certain of her sanity it was as if he read her mind but in fact he merely guessed no he said youre not crazy i am who you think i am and i asked you a question did you destroy alec kyles mind i was part of it she finally admitted but not with that her blue eyes flickered towards the machinery back to harry im a telepath i read his thoughts while they while they erased them she hung her head then lifted it and blinked away tears why have you come here theyll kill you too harry looked down at himself he was becoming aware of his nakedness at first it had been like wearing a new suit of clothes but now he saw it was only flesh his flesh you havent sounded the alarm he said i havent done anything yet she answered shrugging helplessly maybe youre wrong and i am crazy whats your name she told him listen zek he said ive been here before did you know that she nodded oh yes shed known about that and about the devastation hed wrought well im going now but ill be back probably soon too soon for you to do anything about it if you know what happened last time i was here youll heed my warning dont stay here be anywhere else but not here not when i come back do you understand going she began to feel hysterical felt ungovernable laughter welling inside you think youre going somewhere harry keogh surely you know that youre in the heart of russia she half turned away turned back again you havent a chance in or perhaps he did have a chance for harry was no longer there harry called out carl quints name into the mцbius continuum and was at once rewarded with an answer were here harry weve been expecting you sooner or later we harry felt his heart sink myself felix krakovitch sergei gulharov and mikhail volkonsky theo dolgikh got all of us you know felix and sergei of course but you havent met mikhail yet youll like him hes a real character hey what about alec how did he make out no better than you said harry homing in on them he emerged from the infinite mцbius strip into the blasted ruins of faethor ferenczys carpathian castle it was just after am and clouds were fleeing under the moon turning the wide ledge over the gorge into a land of phantom shadows the wind off the ukrainian plain was cold on harrys naked flesh so alec copped it too eh quints dead voice had turned sour but then he brightened maybe well be able to look him up no said harry no you wont i dont think youll ever find him i dont think anybody will and he explained his meaning you have to square things up harry said quint when hed finished it cant be put right harry told him but it can be avenged last time i warned them this time i have to wipe them out total thats why i came here to see if i could motivate myself taking life isnt my scene ive done it but its a mess id prefer the dead to love me most of us always will harry quint told him after what i did to bronnitsy last time harry continued i wasnt sure i could do it again now i know i can felix krakovitch had been silent until now i havent the right to try and stop you harry he said but there are some good people there like zek fцener shes one of them yes ive already told her to get out of it i think she will well im glad for that at least now i suppose its time i got mobile said harry carl maybe you can tell me does ebranch have access to compact high explosives why quint replied the branch can get hold of just about anything given a little time hmm harry mused i was hoping to do it a bit faster than that even tonight now mikhail volkonsky spoke up harry does this mean youre going after that maniac who killed us if so maybe i can help you ive done a lot of blasting in my time mainly with gelignite but ive also used the other stuff in kolomyya theres a place where they keep it safe detonators too and i can explain how to use them harry nodded seated himself on the stump of a crumbling wall at the edge of the gorge allowed himself a grim humourless smile keep talking mikhail he said im all ears something brought ivan gerenko awake he couldnt have said what it was just the feeling that something wasnt right he dressed as quickly as possible got the night duty officer on the intercom and asked if anything was wrong apparently nothing was and theo dolgikh was due back any time now as gerenko switched off the intercom he glanced out of his great curving bulletproof window and then he held his breath down there in the night silvered by moonlight a figure moved furtively away from the chвteaus main building a female figure she was wearing a coat over her uniform but gerenko knew who it was zek fцener she was using the narrow vehicular access road she had to for the fields all around were mined and set with tripwires she tried to walk light and easy casual but there was that in her movements which spoke of stealth she must have booked out presumably on the pretext of being unable to sleep or maybe she really couldnt sleep was simply out for a walk and a little night air gerenko snorted oh indeed a long walk presumably probably right to leonid brezhnev himself in moscow he hurried down the winding stone stairs took the key to his duty vehicle from the watchkeeper at the door and set off in pursuit overhead to the west the lights of a helicopter signalled its approach theo dolgikh hopefully with a good excuse for the mess hed earlier hinted at on the phone twothirds of the way to the massive perimeter wall that surrounded the entire grounds gerenko caught up with the girl pulled up alongside and slowed to a halt she smiled shielded her eyes from the dazzle of the headlights then saw who was hunched behind the wheel her smile died on her face gerenko slid open his window going somewhere fraulein fцener my dear he said ten minutes earlier harry had stepped out of the mцbius continuum into one of the chвteaus pillbox gun emplacements hed been there before and knew the exact locations of all six and guessed that theyd only be manned in the event of an alert since that might well be the current state of readiness if kyles absence had been discovered he carried a loaded automatic pistol in the pocket of an overcoat hed stolen from a peg in the ordnance dump in kolomyya across his shoulders he bore the weight of a bulky sausageshaped bag that weighed all of one hundred pounds putting it down he unzipped it and took out the first of a dozen gauzewrapped cheeses that was how he thought of the stuff like soft grey cheese except it smelled a lot worse he moulded the ultrahighexplosive plastic over a sealed ammunition box stuck in a timerdetonator and set the explosion for ten minutes time this had taken him maybe thirty seconds he couldnt be sure for he had no watch then he moved on to the next pillbox where this time he set the detonation for nine minutes and so on less than five minutes later he began to repeat the process inside the chвteau itself first he went to the mindlab where he materialised beside the operating table it seemed strange that he had been lying on that table something less than threequarters of an hour ago sweating he stuffed uhep into the gap between two of the filthy machines theyd used to drain kyles mind set the detonator picked up his much lighter bag and stepped through a mцbius door emerging into a corridor in the accommodation area he met face to face with a security guard doing his rounds the man looked tired shoulders drooping where he ambled down the corridor for the fifth time that night then he looked up and saw harry and his hand went straight for the gun at his hip harry didnt know how his new body would react to physical violence this was when hed find out hed learned his stuff long ago from one of the first friends hed ever made among the dead sergeant graham lane an exarmy pt instructor at his old school whod died in a climbing accident on the beach cliffs sergeant had taught him a lot and harry hadnt forgotten it his hand shot out and trapped the guards hand where it snatched at the pistol jamming it back down into its holster at the same time he drove his knee into the mans groin and butted him in the face the guard made some noise but not much and then he was out like a light harry set another charge right there in the corridor but now he noticed just how badly his hands were shaking how profusely he was sweating he wondered how much time he had left considered the possibility of getting caught in his own fireworks he made one more jump straight into the chвteaus central duty room and in the instant of emerging caught the duty officer a blow that knocked him clean out of his swivel chair the man hadnt even had time to look up moulding the rest of his uhep onto the top of the desk between the radio and a switchboard harry fixed a final detonator and straightened up and looked straight down the barrel of a kalashnikov rifle on the other side of the raised counter unnoticed a young security guard had been dozing in a chair this was obvious from his gaping mouth and dazed expression the sound of the duty officer hitting the floor must have roused him harry didnt know how awake he was how much hed seen or understood but he did know he was in big trouble hed only set one minute on the last detonator as the guard gabbled a startled question in gasping russian harry shrugged and made a sour face pointed at a spot just behind the other it was an old ploy he knew but the old ones are often the best and sure enough it worked the guard jerked his head that way turned the ugly snout of his weapon too and when he turned back harry was no longer there which was just as well for his ten minutes were up the pillboxes went up like chinese firecrackers blowing their concrete lids off and bursting their walls the first explosion the intense flash if not the blast itself which was minimal at this distance caused zek fцener to stagger and cower back where she was about to climb up into gerenkos jeep then the crack and rumbling roar sounded and the earth gave the first and least of many shudders antipersonnel land mines fatally disturbed in the fields around began to go off spouting fountains of dirt and turf it was like a bombing raid what gerenko turned in his seat and looked back couldnt believe what he was seeing the pillboxes he shielded his eyes against the blaze of light harry keogh zek breathed but to herself then the main building went its lower walls of massive stone seemed to inhale and go on inhaling they bowed outwards and finally blew apart in white light and golden fire this time zek did feel the blast it tossed her down on the road and stung her hands where she held them up before her face the chвteau bronnitsy was slowly settling down into itself a sandcastle caught in the first wave of a swelling tide it crumbled like so much chalk volcanic fires burned in its guts and spewed out through its cratered walls and as the upper storeys and towers fell inwards so there came secondary blasts to throw them up again already the chвteau was a total ruin but then the big one in the duty room added its voice to the cacophony of destruction by this time zek had managed to climb into the jeep beside gerenko they felt a huge fist batter at the rear of the vehicle shove it forward felt their ears savaged by the massive detonation shuttered their eyes against a sudden incendiary glare a brilliant fireball like the breath of hell turned everything to a negative photograph blotted out the entire scene and made night into blinding day then slowly faded and revealed the truth that the chвteau bronnitsy was no more bits of it from pebbles to huge blocks of concrete still rained to earth black smoke curled up across the moon white and yellow fire seethed and roiled in the gutted ruins a mere handful of figures stumbled about like crippled flies trying to make their way outwards from the centre of the inferno gerenko stunned had stalled the jeep and it wouldnt start again now he got out ordered zek out too the helicopter had veered sharply away as the first explosion occurred it circled came down and landed with a bump on the road near the perimeter wall theo dolgikh spoke briefly to the pilot climbed out and advanced at a run zek fцener and gerenko made their way staggeringly towards him for alec said harry keogh softly to himself he stood in the shadows at the foot of the perimeter wall and watched the three people moving towards the helicopter he took note of the two men one the mere husk of a man and the other a hulking brute and the way they manhandled the girl into the chopper then the machine lifted off and harry was alone with the night and his hideous handiwork but like an afterimage a mental picture of those two men kept superimposing itself over the leaping flames harry didnt know who they were but his intuition told him that these two above all others ought not to have escaped the holocaust hed have to speak to carl quint and felix krakovitch about them epilogue three days later ivan gerenko theo dolgikh and zek fцener stood on the scarred rim of the gorge in the carpathians and gazed gloomily on a great mound of scree and rubble where only the stumps of the ancient castles massive outer walls protruded the scene was desolate as only these mountains can be with jagged crests and peaks all around an eerie wind moaning up off the plain and birds of prey circling slowly in a sky ribboned with cloud it was evening and the light was beginning to fade but gerenko had insisted upon seeing the site there was nothing they could do tonight but at least it would give him an idea of what must be done tomorrow gerenko was here because leonid brezhnev had given him one week to come up with the answer one allinclusive answer to the destruction of the chвteau bronnitsy dolgikh because yuri andropov also required answers zek in order that gerenko could keep an eye on her she said she had lost her talent on the night of the as yet unexplained inferno and worse that all memory of what shed learned from alec kyle had also been burned out of her but gerenko thought not in which case he couldnt be sure that if she were left on her own in moscow shed keep her mouth shut but most importantly and if she were lying she was here because she was the worlds foremost closerange telepath if danger threatened from any source zek fцener would probably know it first and so her actions would be gerenkos indicator that all was well or otherwise after what had happened at the chвteau one must look to ones personal safety and a mind such as zeks could well be of the utmost importance nothing she said now frowning at the grey ruins her forehead furrowed nothing at all but even if there were something here i couldnt read it not now ive told you ivan my talent has been destroyed it burned up in that great bonfire and now i cant even remember what it was like she told a parttruth her talent was intact all right she knew that from the seething cauldron of gerenkos mind and the cesspool of dolgikhs but she really couldnt detect anything else only a necroscope may talk to the dead or hear them talking to each other nothing gerenko repeated her his voice rasping he kicked at the dirt and sent pebbles flying then its a black day for us for you comrade perhaps said dolgikh turning up the collar of his coat but youre up against the party leader who happens to have lost a lot andropov may not have gained anything but he certainly hasnt lost much not that hell notice anyway and theres no point in him taking it out of my hide as for ebranch hes waged war with you espers for years and now youre finished no skin off his nose he wont agonise over it take my word gerenko turned on him you fool so youll return to simple thuggery will you and how far will that get you you could have gone up in the world theo with me right to the top but now at the back of the ruins in the heaped shale and fallen scree something stirred the rubble formed a small mound cracked open and foul gases filtered up into the evening air a bloodied hand that of a corpse scrabbled for a moment until it found purchase in the rocks the two men and the girl heard nothing dolgikh scowled at the smaller man comrade im not sure i want to go anywhere with you he said i prefer the company of men and sometimes women he glanced at zek fцener and licked his lips but i warn you be careful who youre calling a fool head of ebranch youre head of nothing now just another citizen and a poor specimen at that idiot gerenko muttered turning away from dolgikh dolt why if youd been at the chвteau that night id suspect you of being involved in that mess too youre too bloody good at blowing things up theo dolgikh caught his slender arm turned him about gerenkos talent was alerted but so far the kgb man intended no real harm listen you spindly thing dolgikh spat the words out you think youre so high and mighty but you forget that ive still got enough on you to put you away for the rest of your days back in the ruins his movements covered by their arguing mikhail volkonsky got to his knees and then dragged himself to his feet hed lost an arm and shoulder and most of his face but the rest of him still worked he shuffled awkwardly into the shadow of the cliff drew closer to the three live ones but its mutual theo its mutual gerenko mocked the kgb agent and it isnt only you i can damage but your boss too how would andropov fare if i let it out that hed been trying to interfere with branch work again and how would you fare after that overseer in a salt mine thats where youd be theo why you runt dolgikh swelled up huge he raised his fist and a strange expectant something filled the air however blunt his senses dolgikh felt it too why i could gerenko faced him squarely but thats just the point theo you couldnt neither you nor any other man try it and see for yourself its waiting for you to try theo go on strike me if you dare youll be lucky if you merely miss fall over in the stones and break your arm but if youre unlucky this wall could fall on you and crush you your superior physical strength pah i he paused and the sneer fell from his face what was that dolgikh lowered his threatening hand listened there was only the keening of the wind i heard nothing he said i did said zek fцener shivering rocks falling into the gorge come on lets get out of here the shadows are lengthening and that ledge back there was bad enough in full daylight why are you arguing anyway whats done is done shh said dolgikh his eyes going wide he leaned forward pointing now i hear it from over there sliding shale maybe at the rim of the gorge back along the track and hidden by the undergrowth blunt grey fingers came up from the depths sergei gulharovs shattered head came up slowly and stiffly then a shoulder and an arm thrown far forward to take the strain and give him leverage silent as a shadow now he drew himself up onto firm flat ground the temperature is falling fast said gerenko with a shudder perhaps feeling the chill ive had enough for tonight tomorrow well take another look and if its quite hopeless we can decide what to do then wheezing with the effort and gritting his small teeth he started back down the trail but this is all a great pity i had hoped to salvage something if only a little face dolgikh grinned after him calling out were pretty close to the border comrade have you ever thought of defecting when gerenko failed to answer he muttered shrivelled little shit then he put his hand on zeks shoulder and she felt his fingers bite well zek shall we join him or perhaps well hang back a little and do some stargazing eh she looked up at him first in astonishment then outrage my god she said id prefer the company of pigs before he could reply shed turned away she started after gerenko then jerked to a halt freezing in her tracks someone was coming up the trail towards them closing on gerenko and even in the failing light it was obvious that the someone was a dead man lord god he had only half a head dolgikh saw him too and knew him he recognised his fouled clothing the damage a snubnosed bullet had done to his head mother he gulped oh mother zek screamed screamed again as a huge bloody hand passed over her shoulder grabbed theo dolgikh by the collar and spun him round dolgikhs eyes stood out in his face behind the girl he saw a second corpse mikhail volkonsky and god volkonsky had taken hold of him with his one remaining arm like a startled cat zek bounded out from between them fleeing after gerenko she didnt hear the mental voices of the dead saying oh yes these are the ones harry but she did hear his answer then cant stop you taking your revenge and she knew who was speaking and guessed who he was speaking to harry keogh she screamed flinging herself breakneck down the track god oh god youre worse than all of us together until a moment ago harry had been beyond zeks reach both mental and physical hidden in the metaphysical mцbius continuum now he stepped out of the shadows directly in her path so that she flew gasping into his arms for a moment she thought he was another dead man and pounded at his chest but then she felt his warmth the beat of his heart against her breast and heard his voice easy zek easy wildeyed she pulled back from him he held her arms easy i said if you go running like that youll hurt yourself you youre commanding them she accused he shook his head in denial no i only called them up im not calling the shots what they do is for themselves what they do breathlessly she looked back towards the ruined castle where mad frenzied shadows fought and tore she glanced down the track gerenko had somehow avoided gulharovs lunges but the dead man was limping after him winds tugged at gulharov threatening to blow him back into the gorge and thorns tore at his legs trying to trip him but still he pursued nothing can hurt that one zek gasped living or dead men are only men they cant touch him but he can be hurt said harry he can be frightened too made incautious and its growing dark the ledge back there is narrow and dangerous there can easily be an accident thats what my friends are hoping that therell be an accident your friends hysteria lifted her voice gunshots sounded from the ruins and dolgikhs hoarse screaming he wasnt simply shouting but screaming like a terrified animal for hed just discovered that you cant kill the dead harry covered zeks ears drew her head to his shoulder her face buried in his neck he didnt want her to see or hear he didnt want to see or hear and so stared out over the gorge instead weaker than hed ever been before in his life weak with terror theo dolgikh was being dragged towards the rim of the almost sheer drop mikhail volkonsky on the other hand was as strong as hed ever been in life and he no longer felt pain with his one good arm round dolgikhs neck the huge ganger had him in a necklock which he wouldnt release until the man was dead and now they were almost there battling ferociously on the very edge of the gorge which was when felix krakovitch and carl quint showed up blown to pieces the two hadnt been able to do much until now but finally quints arms only his arms had dragged themselves up from below and felixs upper torso limbless had wriggled its way out of the castles debris as the arms of quint came up over the rim and grabbed dolgikh and as felixs severed sluglike cadaver wriggled into view and began to bite at him so he gave up he drew air for one last scream filled his lungs to brimming and the scream simply died on his lips the merest gurgle of sound then he closed his eyes and sighed and all of the air whooshed out of him but they made sure anyway and with one last effort dragged him over the edge into space his body pinwheeled down the face of the cliff bounding from one projection to the next all the way to the bottom harry uncovered zeks head said hes finished dolgikh i mean i know she answered with a halfsob i read it in your mind and harry its cold in there he gave a grim nod haarrry a distant voice came to him as he released her one that only he and the dead could hear one he knew and had thought never to hear again do you hear me haarrry hear you faethor of the wamphyri he answered what is it you want noooo its what you want haarrry you want ivan gerenko dead well now i give you his life harry was puzzled i havent asked any favours of you not this time but they did faethors voice was a grim chuckle the dead now felix krakovitch spoke up from the bottom of the gorge i asked him to help harry i knew you couldnt kill gerenko no more than we can not directly but indirectly i dont understand harry shook his head then look up at the ridge there over the ledge said faethor harry looked silhouetted against the dying day a straggling line of scarecrow figures stood silent on the high precarious ridge they were fretted skeletal crumbling but they stood there and awaited the old ferengis command my ever faithful my szgany said faethor that oncemightiest of all the wamphyri they have been coming here for centuries coming here waiting for me dying and being buried here but i never returned over them whose blood is my blood my power is as great as yours is over the commoner dead harry keogh and so i have called them up but why harry demanded you owe me nothing now faethor i loved these lands the vampire answered perhaps you cannot understand that but if i ever loved it was this land this place thibor could tell you how much i loved it now harry understood gerenko invaded your territory the vampires growl was deep and merciless he sent a man here who was responsible for reducing my house to dust my last vestige on earth and now there is nothing to show that i ever existed at all how then shall i reward him ahhh but how did i reward thibor harry saw what was coming you buried thibor he answered so be it cried faethor and he gave the szgany on the ridge his final command that they throw themselves down halfway along the ledge ivan gerenko heard the clattering of ancient leatherclad bones and fearfully looked up down from that high place they fell breaking up as they came skulls and scraps of bone and flaps of fretted flesh a rain of dead things that might drown him in mummied remains you cant hurt me gerenko gibbered covering his wrinkled head as the first ghastly fragments thudded down onto the ledge not even dead men can hurt me but it wasnt their intention to hurt him they didnt even know he was there theyd simply obeyed faethor and hurled themselves down and after that it was out of their hands those of them who had hands the clattering cascade continued echoing loudly and over and above the pelting of gristly bones now there swelled a new sound a terrible grumbling and groaning but in no way the groaning of the dead they were the groans of riven rock of sliding shale and scree and accumulated debris avalanche and even as that fact dawned on gerenko so the face of the cliff fell on him and he was swept away long after the dust had settled and the last rumbling echo faded away harry keogh stood with zek and watched the rim of the moon come up over the mountains it will light your way he told her take care zek she was still in his arms had needed to be there else she might have fallen now she struggled free wordlessly left him and headed for the screeburied ledge at first she stumbled then straightened up and went with more certainty more resolve she would pick her way over the fallen cliff to the bottom of the gorge then follow the stream down to the new road take care harry called after her again and zek dont ever come up against me or mine again she made no answer looked straight ahead but to herself oh no ill not do that not against you harry keogh necroscope
