 whenever tori nunn was bored she went to buenos aires partly it was because buenos aires was a place she had never worked so essentially no one knew herwhat she had been partly it was because in buenos aires sitting beneath the natural awning of the jacarandas their clattering shade striping her face she could at last forget greg but perhaps more than anything else she came to this incomplete city because here she could begin again to define herself as if now even her own shadow had become unrecognizable here in buenos aires inhabited by the portenos the port dwellers as the citys natives were knowncontrolled by the alta sociedad there was a mix of stupendously beautiful sensual people who were exhaustingly proud even as they were consumed by shame at being south americans they were like college dropouts inevitably embarrassed by themselves and their place in the world when they went to new york they always said i am flying to north america this is what made the portenos interesting to tori their inner hurt was protected by their cultural traits in the same way a tortoise is protected by its shell the patrons of the cafe la biela and the nearby cafe de la paix proved this to her they might smell of imported suntan oil of perfumes by calvin klein and jean patou just as their city might smell of auto fumes and mate the local herb tea but beneath it all tori knew the portenos and their streets were redolent of cigar smoke and marzipan this was their history as jorge luis borges wrote it as thenforefathers had lived it where illusion like the rich smoke from rolled tobacco had come to create the past even as it obscured the present in the decade after the second world war the fathers of these exquisite portenos had amassed their wealth by selling their slaughtered cattle and the fruits of their pampa to a starving europe but by the middle of the fifties the excesses of the perons had bankrupted the country throwing buenos aires and indeed all argentina into chaos escalating terrorism from the far right and left began to tear the country apart the result was the coming to power of a succession of repressive military juntas but the countrys frightening twoyear bout with hyperinflation percent per yearriots and civil unrest had toppled a succession of elected governments despair had gripped the nation until some months ago when a coalition led by las dinamicas the two most powerful women in argentine politics managed to win control of the government their party the union of the democratic center had pledged to end argentinas long history of authoritarianism by instituting reforhis granting extensive individual liberty and an end to the crippling control of the government in business the beginning of a free market economy went their successful campaign slogan is an end to hyperinflation the first priority had been to convert the official currency into american dollars which had the effect of immediately stabilizing the runaway argentine inflation through all this moody history the portenos survived and perhaps even flourished for it is said that every argentine heart beats most strongly for myth and myth cannot exist save as a balm against pain and suffering but myth was too often illusion and the truth of illusion me truth that no porteno can truly faceis that no matter how dazzling its exterior may be there is nothing inside tori knew this knew the portenos almost as well as they knew themselves thus she was comfortable here in their city strolling down their wide boulevards sunbathing amid cocoa flesh on their beaches surrounded by their aura of failure and by thenvery real sensuality and sense of style these people carried their pain as she diddeep inside them though often through the chic facade in which they had wrapped themselves she could discern the stench of their desperation tori lifted her arm ordered another hot chocolate the richest thickest in the world with it she knew would come a silver tray of small sweets an array as heady as opulent as the smoldering stares of the chantas who came to the cafes with their thistresses to while away an hour or two between bouts under the sheets a small breeze redolent of this citys peculiar perfume stirred the long branches of the jacarandas and tori felt the caress of their tears patter across her shoulders the excess water of these beautiful semisucculent trees the chantasbuenos aires wheelerdealersinterested tori most of all she had even allowed one or two to seduce her now and again but in the end they had found her too much even for them disconcerted by her habit of watching them intently during the most intimate throes of sexual congress what are you doing they would ask her at those moments this is a time for release not concentration they did not understandand she would not tell themthat for her sex with them was to be observed that by doing so she could pierce their chic shells feel the texture of their shame and hurt comparing it with her own this concentration that so puzzled them was to her as sweet and richly flavored as was her hot chocolate at the cafe la biela but this strangeness as the chantas called it was hardly the only reason they held her in awe they had heard stories that she had climbed barefoot the massive iguazu falls six hundred miles to the northeast had in fact helped the male members of her party when their strength flagged or they were in trouble they had heard she was courageous indefatigable which was after all why they sought to seduce her in her strangenessthe enigma of such brute strength and stamina in a femalethe chantas sought answers to the mysteries that obsessed them who were they where did they come from why were they such failures tori sipped her chocolate consumed a sweet in one voracious bite somewhere along the avenida quintana a man played a bandoneon squeezing out a typical tango melody infused with the bittersweet essences of latin macho unrequited love and blood vengeance the avenida quintana filled with swaggering portenos and cliques of rabid japanese tourists was one of the main streets of the swank residential recoleta district the recoleta had been born near the end of the last century due to a plague of yellow fever in the citys southern districts that caused the aristocracy to move north years ago when me recoleta was home to slaughterhouses its streets ran red with the blood of cattle during the heavy winter rains now winter brought only melancholy and a gathering sense of dissolution then buenos aires was to be avoided by the time she had finished her second cup of hot chocolate tori decided it was time to go the sun was low in the sly turning the recoletas blocky white high rises the color of blood oranges blue shadows lay in the street like the dead or unwanted reminders of the disappearedthose people taken by the military in its zeal to ferret out a group of young radical terrorists in those daysthe seventies to be a teacher a union member or merely to be known as an intellectual was to risk being drawn into el proceso a trial without either lawyer or jury it was to risk being disappeared her thoughts turning by moments more and more morbid tori gathered up her purse and small shopping bag but before she could rise she saw estilo he was a germanargentine chanta one of the few who had sought out her company but not her bed he was different in other ways as well he was a squarejawed man in his early fifties with long steelgray slickedback hair a patrician mustache and a sense of style no fullblooded german ever had his manner was often brusque but he told the truth more often than other chantas and for this tori forgave him everything estilo made his way toward her table he was smiling surprised and happy to see her he had with him a younger man slimhipped wideshouldered the man handsome with the rugged outdoorsy face of an estancieroa rancherwas most likely in his midthirties roughly the same age as tori he was dressed in a pair of baggy silk trousers and a washed silk shirt open at the neck under a trim linen sport coat he had the thick black hair the heavylidded eyes of the latin porteno estilo caught her appraising look my darling tori he exclaimed clamping her in a fervent embrace why didnt you tell me you were coming i would have made preparations i didnt know myself until the last minute tori said you know how my life is estilo gave her a rueful look too chaotic for someone in so early a retirement he clucked his tongue against the roof of his mouth i keep telling you to find a line of work that interests you he smiled showing large nicotinestained teeth and if not you have a permanent invitation to join my business just what is your business tori asked estilo threw his head back and laughed then he grabbed at the sleeve of the younger man pulled him down to a seat next to him at toris table tori nunn id like you to meet a friend of mine ariel solares ariel is a norteamericano who spends a majority of his time here his most fervent desire is to become a porteno no ariel my friend exaggerates as usual ariel solares said actually i wish to understand the porteno i come to buenos aires to soak up the air of the mythical yesterday he took a deep breath let it out can you not smell it perfuming the air like a rose he shrugged my own pastmy whole life up until nowcould not be more prosaic so i visit buenos aires to let this city touch me perhaps in some way to change me nonsense estilo said you come here to do business but tori could see that he was impressed with what ariel had said estilo like all portenos was drawn to myth and all its fascinating ramifications for him ancient gods dwelled in the rain forests and in the pampa and because they had been written about spirits inhabited his city sitting like gargoyles upon the cornices of the modern buildings this was the power of myth you speak of buenos aires as if it were lourdes tori said suddenly wanting to draw ariel out as if it had mystical healing powers it did for her why not for him ariel solares cocked his head well i never thought of it in just that way but perhaps there is some truth in what you say but healing i dont know whether that is quite the correct word i am not sick merely bored but my friend surely boredom is a form of sickness estilo said his gaze swinging from ariel to tori a personall peopleneed a purpose without one life becomes meaningless and further sicknessof a deeper more serious naturewill surely follow now tori knew that estilo was speaking directly to her and she averted her eyes the tango music drifting along the avenue had turned bitter introspective a harbinger of the last burst of violence and fury that was inevitably to come im quite all right tori said softly not looking at either man but rather into the heart of the dark tango of course you are my darling estilo said patting her hand affectionately he had big hands blunt and strong i did not mean to infer otherwisealthough tori knew that was precisely what he had meant to do i merely assumed your boredom needed alleviating in that event i would be delighted if you joined me tonight at my home his mustache arched as he smiled a very private party if you arent a friend of mine you arent coming he paused a moment then said ariel will be there tori turned her head looked again at the younger man his skin burnished by the sun and the wind she could imagine him riding the infinite pampas or bending slightly his hair swept back by the wind and the speed of his mount swinging a polo mallet at palermo fields but there was something different about him he was not a typical porteno or even trying to be and these things intrigued her all right tori said wonderful estilo beamed at her as he rose until tonight then for a moment ariel sat facing her his coffeecolored eyes staring into hers then he took her hand kissed it lightly and was swept away by estilo after the men were gone tori sat and sipped a brandy it was to her mind a melancholy drink invoking intimations of broken promises lost dreams the ashes of desire when at last she rose the tango had finished its haunting tale and only the unlovely noises of the restless city remained estilos home was an apartment that took up the entire top floor of an anonymouslooking high rise in the recoleta it was just a few blocks from the cemetery the ne plus ultra address in all of buenos aires which perhaps told you as much about the portenos as you needed to know the dead possessed a presence that made them in some subtle mystical sense less dead than the dead of other cultures the vast apartment which snaked from east to west was furnished in italian high fashion which was to say with equal amounts of chic and money each piece of furniture exhibited low sleek lines and the distinctively patterned fabrics of ungaro and missoni the place had been designed by estilos current thistress adona a stunning blackhaired argentine woman from the alta sociedad the cream of porteno societywho in some ways reminded tori of herself she had wanted more from her relationship with estilo and had insisted that he take her into me jungles of south america where many of his dangerous business dealings took place adona was as good at dispelling distrust as she was at disarming estilos enemies she was an unusual hostess in this snobbish city for she genuinely loved people and attended to their individual wants she and tori embraced warmly in the manner of sisters too long kept apart she drew tori aside in the kitchen uniformed servers were loading chasedsilver platters enormous chafing dishes with food adona ignored these people you look tired tori perhaps i am a little but if so its only the fatigue of inaction yes adona nodded i know you well you need passion like with estilo and me there is a passion but your passion is for what this violence living on the edge of the great abyss her eyes were sad i think this is not healthy estilo said much the same thing to me this afternoon adona smiled estilo is very fond of you she laughed a beautiful musical sound did you know that in the beginning i was quite jealous of you you had no reason to be tori said why not estilo is no angel but then who is me are you no tori said abruptly thinking of greg soaring like an angel above earths atmospheric envelope and then while crawling outside along the skin of his vehicle something had punctured his eva suit and all the oxygen had been sucked from his lungs a matter of seconds thats all it had taken from heaven to hell with only the brittle blue starlight for company death by hypoxia his death certificate had read but that was so cold so clinical it had not described his iced body blistered and bruised beyond recognition by the cruel vacuum of space tori adona was gripping her arm here take some brandy youve gone white im all right but just the same tori downed the liquor adona shook her head there was a time she said when i longed for the life you lead armed to the teeth in the jungle me enemy just ahead it made me feel so i dont know alive she took the empty glass from toris hand but times change ive changed the truth is that the only time i felt safe was when i had a mac in my hands and a knife on my hip then i knew i was the equal of any mannot sexually and certainly not emotionally but still i felt equal a man could kill and so could i i was respected even at times deferred to then at last there was no difference between us you understand tori looked at her what changed adona shrugged the world turns on its axis the seasons change day into night who really can say with certainty but i suspect that i have found that whatever i was reaching for is nonexistent or at least illusory i feel as though in trying to measure up to mens standards ive been sucked whole into their world and ive discovered i dont like it what does estilo say to all this he met you in the jungle thats where you fell in love estilo doesnt know but you must tell him tori said estilo loves you he wants you to be happy adonas liquid brown eyes locked with toris yes he loves me but happiness now thats another matter entirely estilo is the consummate businessmanhe lives for the deal it doesnt matter what the deal is because each deal is welldefined and estilos world is welldefined i have spent so much time and effort to become a part of that world and now as far as hes concerned everything meshes perfectly he couldnt let me go my role is too welldefined if i were to leave a black hole would appear an undefined gap he could not tolerate but do you want to leave him adona gave off a little smile like the glow of a tiny candle as darkness falls i dont know dont let him go tori said hes a good man well at least hes a little good adona suddenly leaned forward kissed tori on both cheeks go enjoy the party too much gloomy talk is bad for the soul tori squeezed adonas hand left her to monitor the coming food the rooms were filled with peoplebuenos aires most famous artists models chantas and smoke but somehow estilo found tori pushed a kir royale into her hand kissed her on the cheek murmured an endearment in german he used german infrequently only when he was slightly drunk and never in a place where he could be overheard he was argentine after all and had his own myth to foster it is times like this he said linking his aim in hers when i miss munich most tori knew he traveled to germany several times a year have you ever eaten in die aubergine ive never been to munich tori said with a sense of deja vu theyd had this conversation many times ah to look out on the maximilianplatz and dine on such food estilo shook his head still buenos aires is home and after all munich is not such a mysterious place and the germansach the germans never change that is supposed to be their great strength but i have never found much to admire in stone and concrete he guided her outside onto the terrace that overlooked buenos aires it faced west and one could see the boundary the end of the citys lights the darkness along the windwhipped plain where the pampaargentinas great prairie filled with cowboys ranchers people used to a hard dusty existence began estilo pointed to the darkness there is where i was born schatzie not in germany like my father he married the daughter of an estanciero and i like to think i was born atop a horse he laughed abruptly but that may be just another myth my analyst says i rely too heavily on myth but she doesnt understand i am half german i more than most portenos need the sanctuary of myth in order to live with myself i dont know what my father did during the war and god help me i dont want to know do you think i can tell my analyst this he shrugged it doesnt matter really the truth is id rather take her to bed than talk to her estilo looked at tori suddenly and you schatzie what is the truth about you i thought we had an agreement tori said we do ask me no questions and ill tell you no lies yes we have helped each other out in the past without being told precisely what the other did he shrugged that does not mean we dont know eh estilo was very grave but i must tell you that sometimes you worry me i never had children i never thought i wanted them i am far too selfindulgent but i confess that often i feel as if you are my daughter i feel the urge to protect you even though i know that is the last thing you want from anyone all at once tori understood that estilo was afraid of offending her she felt a corresponding rush of emotion that threatened to strangle her thinking of greg who had only wanted to protect her she went immediately into prana deep controlled breathing that sent oxygen through her entire body youre very kind she said at last the lights of the city shone through the night illuminating the undersides of lowering clouds the air had turned heavy soon it would rain and youre very dear to me she gave him a tiny smile that had about it an ironic edge but it is you portenos who are mad about analysts in my many years on this planet estilo said i have come to realize that everyone can at one time or another benefit from introspection you are an extraordinary human being tori but in this i think you are no exception tori smiled kissed him on the cheek embraced him briefly thank you papa she said in german estilo looked into her eyes and she was reminded of ariel of how the younger man also had looked her in the eyes this afternoon at the cafe la biela of the different emotions the two men stirred in her ariel has been searching for you since he arrived estilo said i think he is smitten he is very handsome tori admitted i think he will be good for what ails you schatzie estilo said tori laughed you sound like a soothsayer what does he do oh i think that depends estilo said his business is beefvery boring as he said its perfectly legitimate but i believe that he has another reason for being here the disappeared i think he is conducting a clandestine investigation into the atrocities committed here in the name of justice interesting i was certain youd think so he said then he pushed her back into the milling throng of the party go find him before he faints from anguish estilo was obliged to shout this last in order to be heard over the din of music and cacophonous conversation ariel was dressed in black in that first instant when tori spotted him through the crowd he looked like an angel she had once dreamed about he had no halo however and when he saw her he broke out in a smile his white even teeth shining and the image dissolved angelsat least as tori conceived of themnever smiled i thought you had changed your mind ariel said coming up to her i was certain you werent coming didnt you consult an adivina toris tone was deliberately sardonic i will tell you a secret ariel said coming close to her i put no stock in fortunetellers but dont tell my porteno friends they would never understand he grinned at her fortunetellers and analysts are sacred here like cows in india tori laughed surprised at how comfortable she felt with this man there was a danger in that but only to her selfimposed exile from the human race perhaps she thought there was something to what estilo had said perhaps she had come down with an illness for which there was as yet no name she wondered if there was a cure ariel said something but in the din she could not hear what it was she shrugged at him pointing to her ear and shook her head he put his lips against her ear said lets go somewhere else ten minutes later they were entering the recoleta cemetery where the esteemed ancestors of the alta sociedad lay interred beneath flowerstrewn earth and ornately carved marble this was a city of the dead a baroque necropolis from which many of the myths of the portenos were born from death to life there was a certain poetry to the notion at least from an argentine point of view the jacarandas dripped moisture but rain was on the way a low rumble filled the air its echoes reluctant to fade away ariel led the way as if he were a frequent visitor here the oppressive darkness of marble and stone ornately carved in the french and italian renaissance styles gave way to a soft glow increasing as they went forward soon they had come upon a crypt around it were laid out wreaths woven of flowers bouquets bunches of wildflowers under the trees where the rain could not penetrate the flames of perhaps a hundred candles flickered into the crypts face was carved simply eva duarte here is myth ariel said pointing to the last resting place of eva peron more has been writtenquite erroneously about her than anyone in this country was she saint or demon perhaps she was neither tori said perhaps she was just a woman well dont let the descamisados the shiftless ones hear you say that he was speaking of the workers who had slavishly followed their hope the perons it would not be enough for them ariel turned to look at her it had begun to rain a fine pattering through the trees that made tori think of airports and farewells you think it is not understandable everything else has been taken from them even their children tori said their future in a very real sense yes those that disappeared in the night during argentinas reign of terror will never be heard from again the disappeared are now only mute witnesses to this countrys savage history oppression stilled their voices forever ariel looked out across the sea of baroque headstones and crypts its quite sad stone angels surrounded tori and ariel their tiny carved wings encrusted with the soot of the city rain rolled down their cheeks like tears as they remembered the dead the polished marble of the necropolis was milky eerily luminous in the aqueous light from the massed candles does this display mean that after all this time peronism still lives only in a sense ariel said it is like a dream you see the descamisados continue to hope but now the new leaders of peronism veer from one political platform to another instead of facing the truth that the true essence of peronism is today an anachronism tori stared into the candles flames here the children paid for the sins of their fathers she turned to look into his face where is the justice in that we are in argentina ariel said a place where justice is at best misunderstood the rain drowned the candles flames and darkness once again enwrapped the city of the dead tori had the abrupt feeling that she and ariel both knew what the worst was justice used as a weapon to destroy and as a shield behind which to obscure culpability ariel shivered as if the night had suddenly turned cold or a spirit had touched the back of his neck perhaps it was a mistake to come here tonight he said do you mean estilos party or the recoleta cemetery tori asked ariel smiled and tori realized that she liked his face in repose it was a formidable visage stern strongwilled with an almost defiant edgeseemingly far from the bored businessman he claimed to be but when ariel laughed the forbidding cast disintegrated into a kind of boyish charm she found irresistible she felt this last odd and a bit discomfiting it had been a long time since she had found anyone irresistible ariel looked at her i believe you have the most extraordinary eyes ive ever seen he said this afternoon they were turquoise green i thought now they are the color of cobalt tori laughed my father used to call me angel eyes my brother and i had the same eyes had ariel had caught a tone as well as a tense tori put her head down into darkness my brothers dead im sorry tori took a deep breath well he was a wonderful man and he was blessed before he died he flew like an angel and like an angel he saw the whole planet spread out before him ariel looked at her quizzically and she smiled sadly my brother was an astronaut ariel snapped his fingersnunn wait a minute greg nunn the american who died in that joint mission to mars with the russians what was that last year eighteen months greg nunn was your brother yes it was just a whisper but it told the discerning listener volumes ariel wisely decided to change the subject estilo mentioned that you are retired he said from what what to tell him family business tori said not exactly a lie but not the truth either he grunted me too only im still in it they began to walk it used to be fun when my father ran it i could do pretty much what i wanted i never realized how boring the meat business was until my father died and i was obliged to take it over responsibility seemed to drain all the fun out of the work they were at the cemeterys gate and passing through into me street tori had the feeling that an oppressive weight had lifted from her in there it had seemed as if the very air she had been breathing was humid with the spirits of the dead she took one last look at the sadfaced stone angels as though she could hear their wings rustling in the windswept night so running the business isnt enough tori said giving him an opening to perhaps talk about why as estilo had said he was really in buenos aires i dont believe im in the mood to go back to estilos ariel said as if he hadnt heard her question its raining and the climate is not conducive to a party tori wondered whether by the climate he meant the weather or his state of mind either way it was all right she had no desire to wedge herself back into estilos ultratrendy crowd he took her to cafe tortoni a wellknown jazz bar on the avenida de mayo are you often up late at night only when im traveling ariel said he shrugged i dont know what it is but all my business associates seem to be aficionados of la vida nocturna night life tori had been in love with the night life twice as an underage teenager she had used her beauty to hang out in los angeles most dangerous night spots years later the clandestine latenight clubs of tokyo so far away from her native la had held another form of danger but by that time she was an entirely different person wasnt she they drank cane brandy while a black saxophonist made noises in concert with a west indian snare drummer and a blond slickfingered bassist it didnt sound much like music but everyone seemed content to listen to it when the set was through ariel looked at his watch its after midnight are you tired tori shook her head good he paid the check then led her out of the restaurant they picked up a taxi on the avenue and ariel told the driver la manzana de las luces the driver shrugged headed south into the downtown district the square of enlightenment between peru and bolivar at the intersection of the avenida julio roca was a treasure trove of historical landmarks but the only one tori could remember offhand was the offices of la prensa argentinas most famous newspaper the taxi let them off on peru and ariel stopped in front of number it had an italiandesigned facade typical of the mids though ariel informed her the building itself was more than a hundred years older than that this place has belonged variously to two newspapers and the university of buenos aires ariel said but by far its most interesting tenant was the general attorney of the jesuits for whom apparently it was built king charles the third of spain kicked the order out in but before then some fascinating goingson occurred here like what come on ariel said ill show you he led her around to the side of the structure here the narrow alley was dimly lit they went down a flight of ancient stone steps so worn they were concave in their centers tori saw that even in the gloom ariel had no difficulty negotiating them a moment later she heard what she suspected was the grate of an old key in an even older lock a stained woodplank door creaked inward on iron hinges a musty darkness loomed is this okay tori asked do you like to take chances she heard his voice as a disembodied whisper and did not answer watch your step ariel said reaching back and taking her hand he pulled her inside closed the door behind them he led her through absolute blackness she heard the squeal of another door opening ariels voice whispering now duck your head there were more steps and the chill mineral dampness that bred mold and lichen wafted over her the steps were very steep and quite narrow the rich scents of limestone and earth enveloped her tori thought its like smelling ones own grave and for an instant she felt the hairs stirring at the base of her neck these tunnels date back to the eighteenth century tori wondered why he was still whispering after all down in the bowels of the earth who could overhear their conversation these tunnels are something of a tourist attraction nowadays ariel continued his lips brushing her ear the tourists are told that these tunnels were built to aid in the defense of the city during wartime but the truth is the jesuits built them in order to smuggle in contraband the king had decreed that buenos aires like the other spanish colonies could trade only with spain but at the behest of the clever jesuits ships of other nationalities moored in the port pretending to work on repairs while the priests offloaded their cargo into these secret tunnels ariel snapped on a flashlight and tori could see the arched ceilings the branching corridors along the sides of the tunnels were modern lights within protective metal grills above the equally modern concrete walkway he led her around a turning into a small chamber down another steep flight of stone steps here the tunnels seemed older cruder or perhaps merely in a state of disrepair the air was closer mustier and there were no modern lights no concrete walkway loose stones ground beneath their feet ariel stopped them abruptly he squeezed her hand as he played the beam of the flash over a heap of pale bones with a start tori saw that she was staring at a grisly jumble of human skeletons here is all thats left of the disappeared ariel whispered at least some of them poor bastards dumped here to rot beneath the city what ariels hand went over her mouth as he snapped off the flashlights beam soundsfaint indistinctwafted toward them from some unknown direction ariel stood very still he seemed scarcely to be breathing the sounds came swiftly closer tori strained to hear what they were as they neared the sounds resolved themselves into male voices then words and tori thought my god theyre speaking japanese perhaps rega could have been of some further use one voice said his use was at an end the other said given half a reason he would have betrayed us a laugh besides it felt good to put the gun against the back of his neck pull the trigger and boom like snuffing out a candle in a church in that instant you know something significant has happened the law has been transgressed i am a shintoist the first voice said god and the devil mean nothing to me like the blink of an eye seen in a mirror all illusion i am catholic me second voice said so i understand the meaning of punishmentand of sin i dont understand how can you be a catholic and a sinner that laugh again i cannot be redeemed if i havent sinned so these days i do my best to ignore the law also as you must suspect there is a measure of personal pleasure for me in violation lets get on with it the first voice said it was impossible to say just how close the voices were perhaps they were around an unseen corner perhaps much nearer than thattunnel acoustics being treacherously unpredictable tori suspected that ariel was thinking the same thing she thought he wanted to get out of there but was afraid of being seen or heard suddenly a light snapped on and tori and ariel were caught in its piercing beam tori could make out the blossom of two black figures faceless on me move hey look who the fuck the glint dark and evil of machine pistols madre de dios ariel breathed he grabbed her hand pulled her out of the circle of light they began to stumble their way back down the tunnel the light flashed wildly illuminating the tunnel in rhythmic bursts casting their distorted shadows against me rough stone walls they heard swift footfalls behind them theyre coming after us tori said ariel said nothing pulling her after him down the twisting tunnel they gained a flight of steps raced down them but they could hear the heavy footfalls the panting breaths that told them their pursuers were gaining on them tori wondered what in gods name he had led her into faster ariels voice barked from out of the darkness if they catch us theyll kill us well never outrun them tori thought as they rushed past an open archway impulsively she reached out grabbed ariel brought him up short what in here she whispered in his ear and ducking down they entered the pitchblackness beyond the portal it smelled musty and tori could hear the scrabbling of tiny nails against loose rock ariel used his hands like a blind man feeling the wall following its contours light flared behind them and they both froze then it faded and they continued on their way in the darkness into another smaller chamber then a third even smaller one for the first time tori failed to scent a flow of air and she was suddenly afraid that they had worked themselves into a dead end on the other hand coming in here had thrown their pursuers off their trail she began to relax somewhat light returned again to the outer corridor and now she could hear voices talking in japanese the light increased so that the edges of it spilled into the chamber they were in tori looked around she had been right there was only one exit out of this tiny room and in order to use it they would have to get past the japanese who were hunting them in the dim inconstant light she could make out a mounded shape against me far wall breaking free of ariel she went over to inspect it more closelyand was confronted by a veritable cairn of human skeletons the disappeared more than she could count in a brief glare of light tiny red eyes peered out at her from the labyrinth of bones the light increased but the voices had ceased a clear indication that the japanese thought they were nearing their quarry tori made up her mind she turned back to ariel said quick and taking him by the hand drew him down to the cairn of bones and skulls they burrowed their way through the skeletons tori heard a brief highpitched squeal and the red eyes were gone the smell of putrefaction and earth was overpowering it was as if they climbed into a grave that was now closing round them when she reached the far wall she curled up in a ball ariel did the same all around them the forest of the dead rose up in an angular chaos of arms legs spines buried beneath the bones the two of them watched the arched portal through which their pursuers would emerge tori could feel the heat from ariels body curled against hers they were like doomed lovers breathing in the dark breathing in the dead waiting for death to claim them a beam of light entered the chamber played across the cairn of skeletons it penetrated the latticework structure deeper and deeper darkness and light revealing layer upon layer of bones as a spotlight pierces deep water tori saw a bar of light touch her skin the flesh white among the white bones a glare in her eyes dazzling her and she closed them praying that she and ariel had buried themselves deep enough so the japanese could not distinguish the living from the dead at that moment she felt a kinship with these poor murdered people if their spirits were still here she prayed they would reach out to protect her she breathed tidally shut her mind down diminished her wa her inner energy which if these japanese had been trained as she had they might be able to sense even though she was hidden from their sight beside her ariel did not move he might have been dead he knew what to do too bah theres nothing here one of the japanese said the dead are here the other japanese said mute witnesses lets go but they did not move those two saw us the first japanese said i want them fine i want them too but theyre not here still they did not leave the light continued to play over the cairn abruptly it increased in brightness and when the first japanese spoke again he was heartstoppingly close to where she and ariel lay are you certain what do i hear is it breathing is it you or me are we the only ones in this room tori felt a trickle of sweat make its way down the indentation of her spine she recognized this man as the philosophical one the maniac who said he enjoyed living outside the law he was more dangerous than the other one his imagination was by far the keener she heard a metallic click sharp clear echoing in the confined space and she thought of the machine pistols they had been holding all i have to do to find out the first japanese said is to spray this pile of bones toris heart threatened to burst through her rib cage a loud scrape as of a shoe sole then the second japanese said are you crazy this is a death site what do i care the first japanese said harshly these dead havent been property buried their spirits arent at rest to disturb them is a sin even you dont want to commit there was a pause why dont you admit weve lost them its a maze down here they could be anywhere we dont have the time to shoot up all the dark places in these tunnels and we dont want to be heard come on if we stay any longer well be in danger of missing our pickup i dont know about you but i want to get out of this hellhole but those two what did they see they cant know what were up to forget them they were probably tourists who wandered down here for a thrill and a shiver in the dark shit then the light was gone replaced by a glow in the tiny chamber swiftly fading darkness descending ariel and tori waited ariel started to move but tori put one hand on his shoulder a finger pressed gently to his lips across the littered floor the rat was back its bright beady eyes shining and tori saw in their depths the possibility of betrayal if the rat squealed now and if as she suspected the japanese were waiting with their light off just inside the adjoining chamber then they would know that they had not been alone with the cairn of skeletons and spirits or no spirits the hail of machinepistol fire would come the end tori continued to watch the rat as it made its circuitous way toward them through the maze of bones it was clear now that the rodent scented them and it was hungry tori waited patient closing her eyes to slits her right hand lay relaxed along the line of ariels hip the rat was very close now and tori without seeming to move any other part of her body whipped her right hand out to the rat and in the same motion neatly snapped its neck time passed tori let her consciousness drift off semiawake but with her senses more alert than before she heard the tiny scraping sounds the japanese made when they gave up their vigil clambering back through the succession of chambers into the more familiar corridor toris lips touched ariels neck and together they rose from the dead ariel and tori were standing on one of the two terracotta tile balconies of ariels magnificent house on russian hill in san francisco one hundred years ago ambrose bierce bret harte and mark twain frequently met in a cool salon atop this nearly vertical hill it was not quite fortyeight hours since the incident in the eighteenth century jesuit tunnels ariel who had been returning home had invited tori to accompany him and she had accepted because she found that she had lost her taste both for buenos aires and solitude besides though she was reluctant to admit it ariel intrigued her reluctant because for so long she had gone out of her way to avoid even a hint of a relationship or complication with a man but she had been presented with an enigma what was a pair of japanese yakuza assassins doing in the tunnels beneath buenos aires and how did ariel solares the man who had told her so glibly that his life was prosaic know they would be there tori looked down below them the city of hills swept away to the foot of hyde street and beyond the gray bay dotted now with ships where no doubt unseen dolphins played the houses other terrace overlooked lombard street as it wound its serpentine way down to north beach behind them filling up ariels vast living room were mementos of the ancient civilizations of south america painted pottery carved stone statues of women and animals diminutive wooden weapons set with blackened iron tips tori knew had once been dipped in poison through the years ariel solares said a man peoples a space with images of provinces kingdohis mountains bays ships islands fishes rooms tools stars horses and people he was quoting a fragment of jorge luis borges that tori knew this is the perfect spot she said away from everyone above everything my only regret ariel said is that im not here nearly enough he turned to her refilled her glass with more champagne are you familiar with san francisco not really tori drank im afraid i have the native los angelinos reflexive distaste for it its not bad as american cities go ariel said id prefer paris but ive got to work dont the french need beef not as much as we americans and theyre a bitch to deal with very picky about imported meat id rather deal with the japanese he laughed then shivered as a cool breeze ruffled his hair the sun had gone down minutes ago lets go in shall we she had never particularly liked san francisco but she was wild about ariels house she had never actually been up to russian hill it was like living along the royal mile in edinburgh there was a peace an apartness in the height and the vistas that appealed strongly to her inside he stood so that the purple sky was reflected in his coffeecolored eyes he seemed about to say something then turned away what is it tori asked for a time ariel said nothing he looked casual and relaxed in a white sport shirt black slacks a natural jacket of flax and silk he seemed genuinely disconcerted i want to ask you to go to bed with me but i know i shouldnt tori laughed well thats a new onea new line i mean it isnt at least i didnt intend it to be he seemed so uncomfortable that tori considered cutting right to the heart of the matter but then she thought that he would have to learn his lesson sometime and that in the end he might be better off learning it from her look youve made it obvious from the moment we met that youre attracted to me she said seriously i appreciated your candor im here arent i dont tell me you cant feel how attracted i am to you what i dont understand now is the shouldnt part why are you suddenly backing off youd never believe me i he stopped in midsentence could we forget i ever said any of this i doubt it tori said moving closer to him youd better learn not to check your brains at the door before you open your mouth you never know the trouble your own words can get you into i think im going to be in enough trouble as it is ariel said with whom her breasts brushed against him its you you know ariel said im usually a pretty fair liar i think you bring out the bestor the worstin me poor ariel tori lifted her face to his she could feel his heat her lips parted only to be crushed beneath his after all the inner barriers she had erected to keep her own emotions at bay she found it difficult to break away from him but when at length she did she walked away from him stood staring at the booklined shelves against an inner wall her eyes drifted over titles that had no meaning for her her vision was filled with her own quickened pulse blood roared in her ears why did you do that ariel asked without turning around tori said dont come any closer she knew that she had to stop this now before she got herself into something she could not control this man had lied to her he had known just what he was doing taking her down into the tunnels under buenos aires the only thing left to discover was where he meant to lead her but all the while she could feel the heat building a heat she felt all the way to her fingertips stop it she admonished herself concentrate on what must be done here she said why do you live here and not in virginia doesnt slade require facetoface briefings anymore for a long time there was no sound in the room then she heard ariel moving and a moment later music drifted through the house melissa etheridge singing chrome plated heart he came up close behind her said in her ear how did you know i work for the mall tori closed her eyes it wasnt just one thing the japanese who just happened to be in the tunnels you said of them if they catch us theyll kill us then just now you said youd rather work with the japanese what would you know about the japanese but the biggest mistake you made was in not showing sufficient surprise at what i did down there finding our hiding place killing the rat keeping you from making a sound when they were still out there waiting for us at last she turned to face him i think its about time you tell me what this is all about later ariel said when theres plenty of time his lips covered hers and this time she knew she lacked the will to break away she felt him around her his arms coiling a great masculine figure hard and strong a sanctuary within the heavenly aerie he had created for himself and it was as if she had been dropped into me center of a whirlpool in the grip of forces she could no longer hold in check she was out of control she knew it and still the exhilaration rose in her blotting out everything but ariel she crushed herself against him feeling her nipples erect feeling the long dormant liquid heaviness in her thighs and pelvis she trembled in his embrace and he lifted her off her feet the taste of lust was in her mourn the fire in her body given full reign conscious thought driven away on the wings of her passion she was so hungrynot only her loins but her empty heart yearned to be filled again to throb at the sight of a precious lover to anticipate his love like the coming of night and then to feel it gushing through her like a mountain stream at the first thaw of spring she wept as he kissed her breasts her thighs her wet sex she murmured endearments when she in turn took him in her mouth feeling him growing growing the taste of him intoxicating she cried out when he entered her her nails scoring his back as he slid all the way up her and she was filled to bursting her heart thundering her thighs lifting enclosing him their breaths mingled he kissed her ears her nose the comers of her eyes where her flesh was as thin and soft as a babys he inhaled the musk at the hollow of her throat licked the swelling tops of her breasts and oh it was good not only the pleasure they were creating together but the letting go like dancing in the rain or rushing naked into the sea toris heart sighed contented as she was buried breathlessly toward an ending a thunder in her soul the sun in her eyes the rain of their sweat flying as they ground together the sweet collision of flesh and emotion that only making love can produce then he was gasping and heaving she felt him shudder arch into her and something touched her core everything shattered like walking into and through a mirror arriving at a new reality a plane of existence once only hinted at oh my god ohhh she movedwhen she could gather herself to stir againto the beat of his heart as well as her own the feeling was so sweet so intense that she felt tears come again it was something to feel like a woman once more soft and vulnerable it was so different from how she had been trained she had been instructed to become as hard as a man so she had become harder she had been instructed to replace emotion with logic so she had become harder she had been instructed to replace logic with instinct so she had become harder still so immersed in her studies she had no time for personal considerations an economy of movement speech thought had overtaken her defining her new life and everything else had withered within her she had seen this as good a purging an exorcism of the toxins that had embittered her previous life that had driven her to japan to a land and a philosophy that was as far as she could get from what she had once been up until this moment now she saw the other side how the forging of her spirit in the crucible of her extraordinary training had distanced herself from everythingthe good as well as the badthat had dwelt inside her and she was immensely grateful to ariel solares for giving her back that part of herself she knew she could not live without she wanted to make love again now before thought crept back through her drunk mind but her bladder was bursting and she staggered naked off the sofa down the hallway into the bathroom she was finished splashing cold water on her face when she heard the sound or perhaps felt it would be more accurate her first thought was that an earthquake had hit she lurched grabbing onto the cool porcelain of the sink ariels toothbrush rattled in its holder and a bottle of cologne crashed to the tile floor but dimly tori was aware of the aftermath of a percussion alarm flooded through her she pulled open the door leaped over the shards of glass ran down the hall all her senses were alert the air was thick plaster dust smoke and me smell of burning filled the air choking her she smelled the acrid chemical byproducts of plastique explosives ariel she called then more urgently ariel she found him crouched on the other side of the room the sofa on which they had been making love but moments before was demolished charred as if in a fire its pieces had been thrown halfway across the floor the doors to the balcony had exploded outward shards of glass glittered in the city light there was a hole in the wall behind where the doors had been and the cruel san francisco evening wind whipped the tattered drapes impaling them on the irontipped amazonian spears tori threw herself down beside ariel he was making hideous gasping sounds he was covered in blood she tried to hold him but he shrugged her away and she saw that he was desperately trying to get to something his fingers scrabbled at a cabinet door he fumbled it open then seemed to lose all energy his shoulders slumped heavily and his forehead rested against the carpet tori turned him stifled a scream there wasnt much left of his chest how he was still breathing let alone able to open a cabinet was beyond her her mind refused to work it was as if she were stuck in tar what had happened how could this have taken place in the few moments she had been at the other end of the house ariel solares was dying but he did not seem focused on that he had more urgent business still in her arms he flopped like a landed fish until his right hand could reach into the cabinet he drew out a hardwood box it trembled in the grip of the spasm that racked him then ariel pressed the box into her hand his lips moved his eyes searching hers and tori bent down what is it ariel she whispered oh my god my god because his mouth was suddenly filled with blood bubbles formed at the corners of his lips as he drowned in his own fluids and there was nothing tori could do but hold him rocking him gently looking down at him to let him know she was there thinking of the last line of the borges fragment he had quoted before shortly before his death he discovers that the patient labyrinth of lines traces the image of his own face book one the soft cell men of action are after all only the instruments of men of thought after heinrich heine one virginia countryside los angeles she was meant to be cannedand she was canned what you should say is that you canned her should yes this is essentially what is operative here the two menone younger blackhaired hawknosed with penetrating blue eyes the other older lanky stoopshouldered with an aureole of cottoncandy hairpaused along the bluestone path laid out in concentric circles around an immaculately manicured formal english garden the late afternoon sun slid in and out of the elhis and alders catching in its burnished glow a spray of hyacinth here a twist of ancient vine there just behind the men a large tudorstyle stone and halftimber manor house was snuggled in among rustling beech sheared cypresses and wellestablished magnolia i dont understand you the younger man said he was dressed in a white shirt open at the neck the sleeves rolled up to expose his burly forearhis and blue jeans the bottohis of which were tucked neatly into blue tony lama lizard cowboy boots he wore a belt studded with silver navajo conchos you dont the older man could have added thats odd but didnt he had the face of a born commander powerful shrewd disarmingly gentle in its deceit now however the fissures of time had scored his sunken cheeks thinned his hair unearthed the tic of a railing nerve only the eyes retained the full cunning of his youth they were the eyes of the boy down the block who dared you to climb the tallest tree to ride the back bumper of the local bus and maddeningly disdained you whether or not you acceded to his dares when i was somewhat younger than you are now the older man said i spent a great deal of time with our cousins in london he gestured at the cherry and hawthorn trees the sea of crihison and lavender azalea bobbing beneath them thats where i discovered my love of gardens but not gardening russell slade the younger man could not keep the sardonic tone out of his voice the brits love to tend their gardens and so they should bernard godwin the older man nodded approvingly his summerweight henry poole hunting jacket was as immaculate as his garden his sturdy john lobb country shoes positively glittered in the sunlight when one has little space one can call ones own it is only prudent to mind it as best one can godwin swung abruptly around to face slade their eyes locked it was essential slade knew not to look away for godwin would take that as a sign of weakness but this is america russell and here space is not a problem this land goes on almost forever the cowboys learned that the hard way a hundred years or more ago but the same holds true today thats our one absolute advantage over the english the europeans the japanese what our land not the land per se but rather how having land as a natural resource makes us act and react and its our one true link with the soviets bernard godwin never said russians it was always sovietsand there was a vast difference between the two terms the russians were only one people who inhabited the union of soviet socialist republics along with the lithuanians estonians latvians the people of the baltic republics the georgians and the armenians the transcaucasians the ukrainians not to mention the moslem minorities who were part of a whole other microuniverse godwin had studied them all in depth so of course had russell slade it was just that his conclusions differed from those of godwin as long as the soviet minorities were a collective thorn in russias side so much the better he believed let the russian government be distracted and drained by internal problehis for as long as possible christ he thought why doesnt bernard see how the minorities bedevil the russian government the thought of helping to resolve that immensely difficult issue for the russians seemed absolutely insane to slade glasnost or no glasnost an offbalance russia was in his opinion a manageable russia the soviet people are not thank god the russian people godwin said now making his way around a carefully bordered semicircle of variegated pansies each soviet minority is like a fruit shaking itself free of the central tree it is time for a forest to grow up in the wilderness surrounding that one tree russell slade shook his head this is a dead issue as far as the mall is concerned he thought why wont bernard give it up he said does this in any way bring us back to tori nunn godwin fluttered one rather feminine hand its ridged back was covered with liver spots tori nunn was your affair from the beginning she still is slade recognized in that one snapped retort the edge of the boundary he had crossed he took a mental pace backward onto safer ground he was prepared to take his punishment like a man he nodded all right i admit that it might have been a mistake to bring her back like that it certainly was for solares yes it was a shame to lose such a valuable agent godwin said let me remind you this isnt a baseball game it isnt a run the opposition has scored against us its a death in the family so thats why the old man has summoned me to his summer house in the country russell slade thought stone and thatch birds and flowers all very bucolic but there isnt anything bucolic about the old man hes as full of bile as ever slade looked at bernard godwin if he had ever been under the misapprehension that being made the director of the mall meant it was his to run here was the proof it just wasnt so bernard godwin the man who created the mall despite rumors of illhealth and even imminent death was still in the thick of it his to command were the unknowable routes to power and this power continued to hum inside him like a vast engine more than anything else russell slade longed to possess this power through guile cunning and deceitgodwins trine of shadow virtuesslade had risen faster and farther through the labyrinthine ranks of bernard godwins hybrid brainchildpart espionage network part global think tankthan anyone save the old man himself there was no one better than russell to interpret the disjointed data from farflung field operatives and discover the subtle strategies hidden there give him one piece of a puzzle and he would eventually deliver to you the entire picture russell was also a gifted administrator juggling budgets maximizing men and materiel in a way no one before him had been able to do godwin admired those attributes and had rewarded slade for them but slade could not help but suspect that the old man was jealous too though his hands were bony with age gnarled with arthritis still they refused to relinquish the reins of power for slade had the one thing that the old man did notindeed could notpossess youth though slade was at the heart of the mail godwin had yet to divulge to him the last level of his worldwide contacts the ultimate power that made even presidents defer to him the mall and its godfather bernard godwin were and always had been laws unto themselves and this power was what russell slade coveted beyond anything else the time has come slade thought as he watched the old man gazing at his sheared english yews damnit render unto slade that which is rightfully slades russell let me give you a bit of advice godwin continued the moment you cannot control the lives and deaths of your field people you know it is time for you to step down you talk as if this is the first casualty weve had in the field the flapping of that feminine hand again of course weve lost agents before but in my day they were sacrificed for a greater cause there was a meaning to their deaths everything was planned do you understand me in my day indeed godwin was as callous as they come slade thought how quickly will he sever me if the situation gets too hot has he already got someone lined up to take my place by god ill fight to the death to keep this position slade understood that godwin had abruptly distanced himself from the current situation just as he understood that his own immediate priority was to regain the equilibrium godwin had stripped from him godwin loved nothing better than to prod his people pressure he firmly believed sharpened the wits and brought out the best in his peopleand if it did not they were severed from the mall without betraying any of his thoughts slade said blandly you know bernard it occurs to me that youve been spending altogether too much time with the administrations spin doctors those presidential apologists who call themselves aides love to rewrite recent history and so do you i notice that youre deliberately ignoring the losses the mall suffered at the hands of the kgbs operation boomerang godwin grunted ancient history really your predilectiondare i say it borders on obsessiontoward helping soviet dissidents is all too well documented it cost us ten good agents lost to the kgb who were running the bogus dissident cell inside russia the kgb sucked in a lot of people with that scamincluding you the experts expert on the soviet union that was a bad dream all right godwin said i dont mind telling you it gave me some sleepless nights but in the end i put that slip down to a temporary loss of my acute sense of cynicism slade thinking of how cynical godwins response was in itself shook his head no your error was in placing too much trust in your friends over there in the end friends are all that make a man a man godwin said firmly even in this shadow world of ours slade said skeptically especially here bernard in the shadow of one of his hoary hawthorn trees never seemed more mysterious he had the kind of soft eyes that engendered trust that completely masked his cynical heart it was all too easy to believe what he said even when you suspected him of spin control distorting me truth to suit his purposes i dont know about you russell but its a friend i want at the other end of a three am phone call when my ass is in the fire in istanbul or prague or some other godforsaken red zone when the opposition has blown my cover and is closing in not some operative who may or may not have been turned while i was looking the other way he gave slade a tiny ironic smile that made slades stomach contract sorry he said in a gentle tone of voice i sometimes forget that you have no field experience a rebuke or simply a reminder of fact with godwin it was impossible to tell thats the way i came up because thats the way our shadow world worked in the old days he grunted you have your own areas of expertise russell and believe me i appreciate all of them but its times like these that make me long for the relative simplicity of the past damnit i know i made the proper decision slade said i was sure that ariel solares would bring tori in a little honey on the end of the hook because otherwise i knew under the circumstances she wouldnt consider it of course she wouldnt godwin said pouncing on the opening slade had given him but if you had made her a friendan allyinstead of alienating her when she worked for you all this would have been avoided tori would be here now and solares would still be alive the best course when godwin delivered a verbal low blow slade had learned was to ignore it godwin responded to points well made not to cries of foul solares was to pique her interest with a look at what he was working on slade said in addition because there is still a question of her fitness he was to maneuver her into a challenging physical and mental confrontation he was meant to look for any deterioration of her skills the plan was perfect subtle and psychologically sound but somewhere along the line solares must have gotten careless and someone took him out solares was your man you ran him directly in retrospect you may agree with me that perhaps given your lack of experience in the field that was an error in judgment it was your call to make and i didnt interfere but nows the time to examine your motives thats why you chose to run him directly wasnt it to lure tori nunn out of her isolation to be ultimately in control of her once more as far as the canning tori nunn from the mall slade said i recall you gave your blessing to the severance immediately he regretted saying it in trying to regain control of me conversation he had walked into one of godwins verbal traps i gave you my assent russell nothing more the old man refused to give up an inch of territory he was relentless it was your decision slade looked at him do you mean to tell me now that you disagreed with it are you deliberately missing the point godwin said neatly sidestepping the kind of answer slade was seeking it was your decision you made it now you must deal with the ramifications what ramifications slade said this situation is without nuance bullshit godwin said leaning toward slade your relationship with tori nunn is all unfinished business yes you made the proper decision with solares russell but you must see that you made it for all the wrong reasons the situation as you choose to refer to it is fraught with psychological nuance ill take care of tori nunn myself slade said angrily okay will that satisfy you i want my directors full concentration on this crisis thats all godwin said soothingly he paused to allow the tension to dissipate no one knew how to orchestrate a conversation better than bernard godwin what have the caretakers come up with the caretakers were the malls group of forensic specialists who were sent in to analyze wet work sites nothing as yet slade said for the moment at least the identity of solaress murderer is unknown any guesses the old man asked i dont deal in speculation slade said annoyed that the old man still saw fit to test him you taught me that bernard speculation leads more often than not to false conclusions godwin nodded you said that solares got careless he had paused to run his hand across the ruffled field of hino crihison azalea of course theres another possibility he watched fascinated as a furry bumblebee its legs thick with pollen took off from the center of a flower someone is one step ahead of you he glanced sidelong at slade now theres a disturbing thought jesus christ slade said disturbing doesnt begin to cover that prospect how does the word disaster grab you the old man frowned to show his distaste you know i dislike words of that nature slade he said they smack of defeatism defeat is for the weakit is not for us what we need now is a sound offensive strategy of course slade said every situation has its master every speciality has its sensei we need tori nunn back we are lost in the middle of her field of expertise yes the old man saidand youve volunteered to get her back yourself i appreciate that russell just make certain it isnt simply a gesture slade suddenly saw how neatly he had been maneuvered into this personal involvement despite his own conviction that personal involvement was dangerous and potentially lethal in the shadow world in russell slades opinion emotion had no place in mall business that was a point he had tried to make over and over to tori without the slightest success it occurred to himnot for the first time but now with increasing focusthat his sense of being in total control of the mall was more illusory than real and abruptly he felt the heavy yoke of servitude to this one man stamped upon his flesh like stigmata one must consider the method of solaress death godwin was saying whoever killed him didnt just put a gun to his head they made a lot of noise they wanted us to know right away all the way back east goddamnit they wanted to embarrass us he tore off an azalea blossom and making a show of it used the pads of his thumb and forefinger to squeeze the petals there can only be one response to that he shook the flower and the bumblebee dropped at their feet go for the throat thats whats called for godwin placed the beautiful unbruised azalea in his buttonhole when youve been set back on your heels its the only strategy thats worth a damn take it from me russell slade staring at the lifeless bee wondered how he could free himself from bernard godwins tyranny and still be privy to his secrets he would discover who had murdered ariel solares in his own way but being the brilliant administrator that he was he would also devote himself to his own agenda why not he thought bernard has his hidden agenda with his soviet dissidents why shouldnt i have mine tori awoke to the sound of a bobwhite it was sitting in among the bougainvilleas which if she turned onto her right side she could see through the open jalousied window for a moment she could not think where she was then she remembered los angeles home the huge bed seemed like heaven she did not want to leave it she stirred and as she did so heard the door to the bedroom open she saw her mother come quietly in she was wearing a chic silk and chenille robe calfskin slippers she carried a tray filled with food juice coffee she smiled youre up darling how did i get here tori blinked into the sunlight closed her eyes and remembered the scents of cigar smoke and marzipan exhaust fumes and expensive suntan oil decaying earth and mold light and shadow a crazy quilt of images a jumble of sound the squeal of a rat the stench of fear as they were buried alive dont want to be back the aromas of love an intimate steam a delicious dissolving of defenses an intoxicating wine taken in through the pores of the skin and then a deathshead blossoming and the stench of fear again coming to claim her plastique detonating destroying her lover shattering her aerie her newfound peace her sanctuary i dont want to be back its so wonderful to have you home again darling laura nunn said as she set the tray down across her daughters lap we were so worried when we got your call what were you doing in a san francisco police precinct but what tori really meant was dont be dead ariel please come back greg is dead its more than i can bear for you to be dead too tori pushed the dark thoughts away from her as if they had an insupportable weight she forced herself to sit up and say with a mixture of apprehension and fatalism wheres dad ellis is at the office laura nunn settled the tray around tori he sends his apologies but you know your father hes like quicksand she put her hand over her mouth did i say quicksand well of course i meant quicksilver she gave a small embarrassed laugh i never understood how a human being could get along on three hours sleep a night but ellis is a creature of habit he still sleeps from three to six and not an instant more tori studied her mother so beautiful as a young woman so exquisite as a mature one and now in her early sixties her hair was still a long chestnut cascade her eyes brilliant green her skin devoid of makeup without serious line or flaw it was difficult to believe that any time had passed for her ah well tori thought that was la for you with a combination of good genes and even better plastic surgeons the society here had banished age just as surely as god had banished adam and eve from eden except that here sin was acceptedcherished even as a trait of success hadnt ellis nunns favorite twist on a phrase always been in los angeles nothing succeeds like sin and like undergoing a skin peel it was acknowledged that you could always shed your immediate past as long as you played the game you could continually get away with stepping on the people you didnt need as long as you kissed the asses of the people you did need laura nunn snapped out the linen napkin placed it over the bedcovers now maria has gone to great pains to cook everything you love tori looked at the flower pattern limoges china the s tiffany silverware they brought back dizzying images of her youth growing up within the boundaries of dianas garden this modernday xanadu that her parents had built mistaking her hesitation laura nunn saiddarling it would be a sin to leave all this delectable food you know what a marvelous cook maria is and shes always had a tendency to spoil you tori gave her mother a distant smile slipping on a childhood mask so familiar she did it without being altogether aware of it as soon as she took her first bite of food she found that she was famished laura nunn watched tori devour her breakfast with the kind of pleased attention one normally gives to ones key light the light that illuminates the star ellis promised hed be home early today now you promise me darling you wont get into a fight with him never get into a fight with him tori said as if in kneejerk response laura nunn rose perhaps youd like a little time to yourself no tori reached out drew her mother back down to the side of the bed im just a little disoriented she smiled of course i wont get into a fight with dad thats all over and done with i promise good laura nunn smiled at her daughter now we can get to what really matters your happiness i see that youre still alone i was half expecting you to show up with a boyfriend or well a male friend of some kind tori felt her heart contract mother i appreciate your concern but i rather think ive given up men for a while she saw her mother blanch then laughed despite herself no no what i meant is for me moment at least i feel like being on my own oh darling thats so sad laura nunn said there was a role in possessed one of her films where she played the mother of an innocent outcast that tori thought her mother kept falling into or was that an unfair assessment but you must have companionshipeveryone must its like heat or light an essential one simply cannot live without as usual tori thought laura nunns opinion was the worlds opinion but perhaps she should not be so hard on her mother it was true that she carried her mothers expectations for herself as if they could be a cure for her own heartache people do it all the time mom she said with a minimum of conviction just another kneejerk response but of course they do laura nunn said that hardly makes it right i want you to be happy thats all ive ever wanted for you and for greg whereas dad now darling you promised your fathers like a dog with a bone im afraid hell never put anything like that away laura nunn looked at her daughter then hugged her oh tori youre so much like him in so many ways well perhaps thats why he disapproves of me so strongly she had meant it to come out in a light tone but the bitterness was unmistakable laura took toris hands in hers oh my dear he doesnt disapprove of you i cant think where you get your notions its just that he was so disappointedwas that a catch in her throat or merely that she had almost used another more appropriate wordwhen greg failed to live up to his expectations jesus mom tori cried greg didnt fail to live up to dads expectations greg was killed well your father i know he could never tell the difference all at once she was aware of how soft her mothers hands were against her own callused ones now ive upset you darling i never meant to what part was laura nunn playing now tori wondered numbly you havent upset me she said slumping back into her pillows im just tired if her mother could use euphemisms why couldnt she of course rising laura nunn picked up the tray you get some sleep darling ive left instructions with everyone that youre not to be disturbed therell be no vacuuming on this floor today that was something tori thought her mother was notorious for demanding that her house be vacuumed daily including sundays tori had always harbored the suspicion that in years past she had had this done at least in part to keep her children from sleeping late on weekends sleeping late was in laura nunns opinion a sign of laziness mom will you be here this afternoon laura nunn smiled ive got a meeting at the studio at three she always said the studio whether it was paramount or warners or disney just like the old days traffics sure to be impossible that time of daythe stockbrokers are all marching off like lemmings to their health clubs or tennis matches so i cant imagine ill be home before six but ill have maria bring your dinner up herself well before then no dont tori said id like to wait until you get home have it in the dining room laura nunn smiled the smile that one hundred million people the world over knew by heart well see darling now get some rest all right when she was alone tori breathed a sigh as if holding her breath the entire time she and her mother had been together it was as if she had been in the presence of a high wattage spotlight she felt flushed her skin slightly singed from being so near the preternatural heat she wondered fleetingly how her father had dealt all these years with his wifes power over people actors were different from mere mortals they tried on and discarded identities and emotions as easily as others did clothes this chameleon quality so essential for success on the screen made for complex unsettling and at times eerie family relationships it was often like being lost in a wilderness of mirrors the trouble with actors tori had learned at an early age was that they never stopped acting you never knew whether they were doing somethingsuch as inducing an emotion in you because they were genuine or because it was some form of unconscious exercising of their art she did not envy her fathers life with her mother the lace curtains blew against the window sash bringing into the room the scents of the jacaranda the lilac bushes the bougainvillea outside drapes whipping blown inward by a wind through a hole rent by plastique scorched fabric and flesh the scent of death clogging her nostrils like pollen ariel we hardly had time convulsively tori threw the bedcovers off let her feet touch the isfahan carpet she stood felt a brief wave of dizziness went immediately into prana breathing deeply slowly completely she felt as if she had driven all night from san francisco to los angeles from the darkness into the light from monochromatic fluorescence to multicolored neon the sun struck her across the face and she closed her eyes breathing in the scents as if they were memories cars and chrome miniskirts and oversized jewelry hotrodding in the valley hot groping in the backseat lipstick as bright as any neon sign kohl as black and thick as pitch desperate attempts to escape her sadness her prison dianas garden i dont want to be back she stripped showered in very hot then very cold water dressed in a sleeveless shirt and shorts she put on minimal makeup then ventured out into the hall it was quite still she could imagine the servants tiptoeing around the estate so as not to wake her she put her hands on the polished antique mahogany banister peered over the pillar railing down to the great entrance below a sea of carrara marble bronze busts of cesare borgia niccolo machiavelli cosimo demedici ellis nunns pantheon of the florentine renaissance it amazed and saddened tori that michelangelo davinci fra angelico donatello cellini had no place in her fathers historical perspective as if the italian renaissance was an age best remembered for its politics and internecine warfare down the hall she opened the door to her mothers study her father had his in the other wing of the house nothing much had changed here it never would the walls were coated with layer upon layer of black lacquer so that they shone with a kind of opalescence these walls along with a baby grand piano a regency fruitwood escritoire and commode satinwood side tables bracketing a sofa covered in french floral chintz were all festooned with a galaxy of framed photographs mostly in black and white though some were in color these photos were either formal publicity photos or stills from films they were all of laura nunn in these shots toris mother was bathed in a luscious combination of moonlight and dreams it was an underappreciated art tori thought as she roved among the gallery to manufacture such ethereal and subtle illumination no wonder so many men fell in love with her and so many women envied her the hollywood reporter had once dubbed laura nunn the last of the great movie goddesses over the years her films had not diminished in impact in fact many of them had taken on an added historical importance beyond being directed by alfred hitchcock howard hawks or john huston they were illustrative of a woman refusing to remain in the manufactured star mold that had characterized the studiodominated motion picture industry laura nunn might have been a goddess which made her something both more and less than most of her fellow performers but she could also act that had made her invaluable tori tried hard not to see herself in her mothers visage but as always she failed her childhood had left her with the vaguely superstitious notion that if she looked like her mother she would end up being like her of course her subsequent training had taught her the fraudulence of such notions but the ties that bound child to parent were like roots often resistant to change tori slipped out of her mothers study and into the adjoining suite gregs room but here oddly things had changed she saw the same masculine blue and white theme he had liked the banners from cal tech the medals the sports trophies firsts in the nationals in diving track and lacrosse she saw the usual pictures of her older brother but now there was more as if caught in time tori gazed at photos of herself the quintessential cinnamon girl of california long blond hair streaked by the sun trim athletic body with wide shoulders and powerful thighs green eyes wide apart and so direct they are without a trace of guile but filled with the spark of competitive fire for the first time it occurred to her that all the shots were lit both by sunlight and by reflections from water the swimming pool the pool at dianas garden was both a haven and a repository of memories a kind of museum of the mind thinking of the pool she remembered the waiting the tension at the edge of the diving board the extension of her body the launch through space twisting and rolling as she plummeted down taking one quick visual fix on the water as she spun then her breath in her ears foam in her nostrils the cool water closing over her head and her father bent over the side of the pool saying almost as good as greg does it angel almost i dont want to be back then stuck in a corner of a frame she saw two yellowed bits of paper her heart thumped as she reached out unfolded them the first was a newspaper photo of greg and the cosmonaut viktor shevchenko their hands clasped triumphantly over their heads smiling at the camera in their space suits with the special combined nasa logo as they headed toward the launch pad at the tyuratam baykonur cosmodrome in russia in the background it was possible to make out the gigantic launch vehicle the sl energiya with its six strapon booster rockets tyuratam ussr may history was made today as american astronaut gregory nunn and soviet cosmonaut viktor shevchenko successfully lifted off in their odingalaktika ii module from this cosmodrome deep inside the soviet union on the first leg of what is hoped will be mankinds first manned exploration of the planet mars so vast and expensive was this undertaking that the two major superpowers decided to pool their technological resources in the effort nasa officials had been on site here for more than a year in preparation for this event tori stopped reading she knew the events by heart she returned to the photo of greg and viktor shevchenko and was struck again by how similar their faces were both handsome strong confident as if spacemen were a breed apart unconcerned by the petty differences of race or nationalism but then again greg like tori was of russian heritage she thought that somehow ironic now how proud she had been of greg that day she had been glued to the television watching the great white plume fill the bright blue soviet sky until the space vehicle was a mere point of light glittering like a star reluctantly she folded the photo away tori had known what the second newspaper clipping would be even before she saw the reproduction blurred by the newsprint paper of gregs official nasa photo perversely she forced herself to begin reading moscow dec gregory nunn the american astronaut teamed with his soviet counterpart cosmonaut viktor shevchenko was declared officially dead it was jointly reported by the soviet news agency tass and american diplomatic personnel friday mr nunn had been one half of the historic americansoviet effort piloting the odingalaktika ii module in the first manned attempt for a landing on the planet mars that mission was aborted six weeks ago when an event of unknown origin apparently killed mr nunn and severely damaged the odingalaktika ii module with the successful reentry of the damaged space vehicle and its subsequent recovery just after midnight yesterday morning officials were able to verify mr nunns death there is no word yet as to the condition of mr shevchenko although it is known that he survived the flight a severe winter storm in the black sea splashdown area hampered rescue operations following the odingalaktika iis emergency landing and for a time it was feared that the module would be lost at sea however the soviet heavy cruiser potemkin was called in when smaller ships began to founder in the heavy seas and nearzero visibility dear god tori whispered jamming the news articles back in their niche abruptly she could no longer bear to look at the bannered walls the shining trophies the photographs of who she had been and in part must still be suffocating she got out of there as quickly as she could she leaned against the closed door breathing hard in the hallway in the presence only of the powerladen florentines of old and of her own memories late in the day with the california sun slipping through the ornamental lime trees and the oleander tori was summoned to meet her father as she walked through the familiar gardens she wondered at how quickly the spell of this place had overtaken her it was already difficult to focus on the world outside to think that anything existed outside this selfcontained allencompassing environment just like old times ellis nunn was waiting for her at the near end of the sturdy teak pergola he had had built beside the olympicsize swimming pool it was overhung with knotty twists of white and lavender wisteria wisteria was a tough droughtresistant plant whose beauty ellis nunn could admire he smiled when he saw her embraced her hard in his typical bearlike way hello angel at least he hadnt spoken to her in russian as he often did despite toris protestsso you will not forget where your family was born as he used to say he smelled of tobacco and cologne a pleasant mixture that tori remembered from years past despite the fact that ellis nunn tried hard to be very american he was invariably taken for a native in europe he had the kind of nordic good looks combined with a typical slavic thickness which marked him as a russian on the continent where such things still mattered toris father had changed his name before he applied for admission to stanford it was not then the power university it eventually would be but in any event he received an outstanding education he became ellis nunn not so much because he was ashamed of his real name but because he loved america so much that he longed for what he thought of as an american name tori still did not know what an american name might be he was a big man exceptionally fit despite nearing seventy he worked out in his pool every day for an hour and a half his hair was more gray than blond now but it was just as thick as had been when he was a young man his vaguely almondshaped gray eyes were set on a slight slant his wide mouth could be as expressive as a comedians the oddest feature of his face was his nose which to toris way of thinking did not fit with the rest of his russian features no wonderellis had had it redone in his youth to be the very paradigm of an anglosaxon nose again vanity had little to do with the change his desire to fit into american society did ellis nunn was a man of light the man of light some said he had taken his fathers light bulb manufacturing business and with the knowledge he absorbed at stanford brought it west in the process turning it into the largest and most innovative creator of film illumination if you needed low light to film by dazzling light to illuminate a gigantic set spectacular lights to augment explosions lights to simulate night or any time of the day delicate fairytale twinklings to highlight a love scene you called ellis nunns this magic moment his companies extended into almost every part of the globe that was a filmmaking center italy france spain even hong kong today his computergenerated networks of lights could do literally anything and everything hollywood could ask of them especially now that he had the latest laser technology from his own r d department to draw on his work had made him rich in his own right he was not and never had been one of the sad bel air bassets as they were cruelly known husbands of movie stars who lived off their wives breathtaking incomes as they strolled under the pergola tori thought of all the times she had seen her father walking here with greg wondering what it was the two men were speaking of wondering why she had only rarely been granted the privilege of walking and talking like this with her father and never here beneath the twining wisteria ellis nunns favorite spot they reached a patch of sunlight and ellis nunn stopped as if divining her thoughts he said do you know why i love it here in my pergola because here no one can see me no one can hear me he laughed there are too many people padding around my house he shrugged began to walk againwell theres no sense in fighting it thats how its always been your mothers doing personally i cant abide strangers in the house who knows where they are and what theyre really up to when they re out of sight he grinned at her they dont know what im up to when im here out of their sight does that include mom of course it does he said shes the nosiest of the lot trouble with her is she wants to run everything cant do it no one can but shes never learned not surprised shes never been good with the basics thats why she needs all these people really her minds on other more esoteric matters who shell be today flexing those prodigious emotional muscles of hers miss emotional universe i used to call her that in the old days nothing much has changed since then i suppose but us well not your mother she never changes not reallyi mean not deep under the surface the patch of sunlight illuminated the stone statue of diana a reproduction of the one in mexico city ellis nunn pointed at it there is your mother diana the huntress did you know that she was born diana leeway no im not surprised no one does i cant imagine her telling you no one left in any of the studios now to recall it either i cant remember whose idea the name laura was anyway the producers liked the sound of laura nunn so thats what she became in reality as well as on the screen well as much as your mother knows what reality is how did you put up with her all these years tori asked you not only survived but thrived well i dont know about thriving he said but as for surviving he put his forefinger against his lips thought a moment do you know the story of the zen policeman no odd with all that time spent in japan dad my god tori look at you he only called her by her christian name when he was angry with her youre a grown woman of thirtysix and what do you have to show for it no discernible job let alone a career and as for starting your own family well thats something of a joke isnt it face it tori youve made a mess of everything and here you are standing in front of me while greg for a moment he could not go on he looked apoplectic then he seemed to gain hold of himself youre the one who has studied oriental philosophy tell me why is it that greg who had everything going for him who had his whole life laid out as clearly as a road map a career distinguished byjesus god he was going to become one of the first two men to live in space and then to land on mars have you any conception of what that means he passed a hand over his facewhy did it happen tori why is he gone tori said nothing what was there to say greg was destined for great things i knew it the moment he was born ellis nunn seemed drained of the spasm of anger that had gripped him he seemed genuinely confused why was he taken from us your mother says its gods will well if thats so then gods an unforgivably cruel and capricious creature now tori felt the words coming she could not help herself so that is what you think ive done with my life nothing well im not what you wanted me to be an astronaut stretching the envelope of space im not like greg you trained him he wanted to be just what you wanted him to be it was the perfect union of generations you were so proud of him you understood what motivated him greg was like an open book to you but you couldnt fathom why on earth i would want to go to japan to study of course you couldnt youve spent all your adult life here in la in many ways as far from global politics and economics as fiji this is the original land of nod and you built yourself dianas garden a dream within the dreamland of la is it any wonder that yon have no conception of what makes me tick japan i remember you saying what the hell could be so damn important in japan you never understood you never wanted to she shook her head i must be such a disappointment to you her father was studying the last of the sunlight as it slid down the folds of dianas stone robe he had that faraway look on his face he sometimes had during long meetings at the office as if he were there only in body not in spirit it was a sad look as well so similar to the one she had caught in the corners of gregs face now and again when he was sure no one was watching him tori put her head down too late she remembered her promise to her mother not to start a fight with her father what did it matter she thought this isnt about me or my fatherit never was its about greg its always been about greg and theres nothing i can say or do that will ever change it as she let the silence of the encroaching evening steal up on them she was aware of a great sadness welling up inside her she recognized that she was angry at her father but also at herself for letting him get to her again and again she said after a timeare you going to tell me the story of the zen policeman ellis nunn nodded but whether it was in simple assent or in acceptance of the fragility of their relationship she could not tell many centuries ago he began there was a young buddhist priest who traveled to tibet in order to further his understanding of religion and philosophy he possessed the proper credentials as well as a letter of introduction from his superior at his temple in central china when at length he came upon the monastery he was searching for he had climbed so high he felt as if he had breached the very vault of heaven and it took him some time before he was able to adapt his breathing to this dizzying height in due course he was accepted into the monastery but it was some days before he was summoned to the presence of the high lama the old wizened man looked three hundred years old i understand that though you are a priest you do not believe that your spiritual education is complete that is correct sir the young priest said in a somewhat overawed voice what is it you seek to learn here the old lama asked why all there is to learn the young priest said immediately the old lama looked at him and smiled we shall see he said in the meantime we require you to remain awake and on guard during the night the young priest looked confused it took me two months to reach here i know how remote this monastery is how could you have enemies here the monk who brought you to this chamber will tell you where you must sit tonight the lama said but i am a priest not a guard the young man protested besides i am a buddhist i have pledged never to harm a single creature i cannot even till the earth for fear of killing a worm or an insect you do not yet know who or what you are the old lama said that is why you are here that night the young priest was shown to the spot in the exact center of the monastery where he must keep watch a pillow was placed for him to sit it was a crossing of the four main corridors of the stone structure and from his vantage point he could see most if not all the monks tiny sleeping cells the hours of the night crept by with agonizing slowness nothing happened the silence became a weight on the young priests eyelids so that once or twice he found himself drifting off into a light slumber before starting awake he yawned and stretched to keep himself alert he began to wonder why he had come here or if he had come to the right place at all then all at once he stood up he looked from corridor to corridor sure that he had heard a sound but there was only the heavy awful silence claustrophobic as the inside of a tomb then he became aware that the sound was an ethereal stirring as if in his own mind and he whirled around he was not alone something was in the west corridor it came toward him but in the flickering light of the reed torches he could not make out what it was suddenly it burst out of the corridor coming upon him like a whirlwind and he felt a chill race down his spine it was as translucent as the wings of an insect he could clearly see the corridor behind it through it the wraith brushed past him careening down another corridor soon the intersection where the young priest now stood was thick with these wraiths sometimes it seemed to him that they had faces bodies hands and feet at other times they were nothing more than pure energy the young priest felt a fright welling up inside of him what were these forms were they the enemies of the tibetan monks if so how was he to combat them when violence was anathema to him these questions and ten thousand others crowded his mind in the same way the wraiths crowded the corridors of the monastery the terrible fear built inside him until he contemplated abandoning his post turning tail and putting this mad place behind him forever but as if in a dream he felt rooted to the spot he did not know whether to fear for the loss of his mind or his life then he noticed a curious thing the fear was coming from inside him when he concentrated his spiritual powers he realized that the wraiths whatever or whoever they might be posed no threat to him or to the people of the monastery the chaos of their rushing to and fro was in a way selfcontained and then he set about trying to turn the chaos into order he found that with continued concentration he could move closer to these darting wraiths could feel where they wanted to go and eventually guide them on their way it was at that moment that he recognized one of the wraiths as the monk who had led him to the lamas sanctuary and to this crossroads and then the young priest understood everything these wraiths were the spirits of the monks unleashed as they slept freed from the bonds of their daytime work these spirits were prone to the chaos that lurked within the innermost recesses of even the most disciplined mind they lacked but a single soula kind of zen policemanto see them on their proper paths to keep them from the dangers inherent in chaos tori and her father had come to the far end of the pergola he turned around took one last look at the statue of diana cloaked now in the robes of twilight he said after a long silencedoes that answer your question as to how i have survived in dianas garden i learned that i had to change in order to survive the demons peculiar to your mothers genius tori thought for a long time it was an amazing story and even more amazing that it had come from her father she simply had not thought he had such subtlety in him the story also explained many things about her parents relationship but it also brought into focus some of her own childhood concerns she said carefully i worry sometimes that i well i still sort of lose myself when moms around theres so much of herher personality her aura her wa as the japanese would saythat there often seems no space left over for me her father said you should try to understand your mother more if you did im sure youd find it worth your while im not sure you heard what i said tori was struggling to find a basis for communicating with him but either he was misunderstanding her or being willful still she pressed on i often end up not knowing how i feel about her she looked at him at that noble almost primitive profile do you love mom ellis nunn turned to his daughter i understand her tori i think in your mothers case thats the same as loving her is it well you tell me then ellis nunn said testily how else do you love an icon how do you bring something so monumental so universally adored into your reality the answer is you dont waste your time instead you enter into its reality as best you can i dont look my marriage survived where the marriages of people like dimaggio and arthur miller did not ive come to see that as accomplishment enough he looked away toward the pool as if he wished he were in there now your mother needs to be what she has become in the same way you and i need air to breathe once you understand that you understand everything tori looked up into his face there was just enough light left so that the reflections from the pool lit up his face and she was reminded of the photos of greg poolside fresh from some diving triumph his angel eyes aglow with the victory fever greg it was always greg even death could not stop them all from talking about him thinking about him trying to live up to the shining potential of his angel eyes spoken like a true zen policeman she said with all the irony she could muster evening approaches tori hidden away from her mother behind the massive carved oak doors to the library is again feeling trapped in dianas garden she remembers a time of adolescence she is trapped in the big house in la in the sunshine in her sleek tanned body she is pinned by her beauty to the imagined future the foregone conclusion that her father wants for her that boys her own age imagine is already hers they are the same these images and they dominate her life like a nuns vows she has all she wants within dianas garden and increasingly she feels that there is no reason to venture outside its perfect allencompassing environs until one night during a party given by her parents she discovers how completely she has fooled herself just about everyone who matters in hollywoodexcept enemieshas descended upon the manor house and the rooms are full of familiar faces screen legends movers and shakers there are the money men and their exquisite women as polished as gems seemingly pulled out of the mens pockets like an expensive watch or a roll of thousanddollar bills gossip which is the only approved mode of communication at affairs such as this centers around who is sleeping with whom and who is pregnant by whom gradually it dawns on tori that these people who inhabit hollywood like a race of gorgeous troglodytes run their private lives in sync with their professional careers love affairs marriages seductionwhatever the current voguish designationlast among these strange alien life forms only as long as it takes to make a film these people meet on the set become immersed in each other in the same manner in which they become immersed in their roles in order to differentiate reality from fantasy however they feel compelled to make tangible their love for one another if not their commitment a child follows as surely as the night the day but invariably with the advent of the baby the love affair marriage seduction loses its luster a mother is never as exciting as a lover three takes the edge off the heat generated by two tori understands at last that she hates these people that she feels their coming as an invasion that night whether in the living room the study the library the throngs of people overwhelm her she feels suffocated she flees the house but the grounds too are choked with celebrities and still she cannot breathe bent over by the side of the lighted pool her sanctuary where she had always felt closest to greg she wheezes like an asthmatic at last she stumbles to her car a new thunderbird convulsively turns the ignition and scattering gravel in her wake speeds away into the night the neon light of los angeles not beverly hills or westwood but beyond where people who are not rich pampered privileged work and play there is a rage inside her she can neither explain nor face she feels inadequate in the face of it and at the same time ashamed of it as if part of her mother has broken off and like a poisoned arrowhead has embedded itself in her brain she hates the shame most of all because it keeps her from embracing her rage owning it and thus understanding it kept at a distance it is nothing more than an arcane artifact living at the edge of her emotional horizon a glyphcovered stele marking what she does not know but tonight she is determined to find out down twisty mulholland to the freeway rolling over the edge of the glen coming upon the wide swath of smeary lights glowing in the valley the pollution trapped by the air inversion between high ground makes her eyes tear her skin itch she depresses the accelerator bringing the horizon closer at a seedy bar she pulls in beside a line of scruffy harleydavidson motorcycles she sits listening to the hot engine of the tbird ticking over as if it is the beating of her heart sadness mixes with her rage and she wishes that greg were with her greg who is always willing to listen to her the one person in the world who accepts her as herself and nothing more but greg is away at cal tech studying for finals which he takes more seriously than god i am alone tori thinks the glyphcovered stele coming nearer she goes into the bar and orders drink after drink she is underage but she regularly passes for eighteen in any event her beauty is something no bartender can resist and she is never turned down or asked for id a jukebox is blasting the locomotion and the dancing is ferocious there are a number of black leather jackets she sees tattoos long lank hair thick studded belts and armbands one biker wears a miniature skull on a leather thong around his neck a girt asks him something and he laughs fondling it saying over the music its real man belonged to a rat that thought it could share my kitchen with me what you think o that the girl giggles giddily and shudders but she cannot avert her gaze from the grisly talisman all the guysand most of the girlsare staring at tori she sticks out here like a tea rose in a cabbage patch someone is pointing out the window at her brand new tbird and the whispering begins the artifact once at the edge of her horizon is almost close enough to touch the only guy who hasnt noticed her is the one with the rat skull around his neck he is not handsome not even attractive to tori but that is irrelevant he is the one she wants in him burns the fire she knows so wellyet does not understand at all the rage of the beast caged bound by the laws of a hypocritical society he will be the one her rosetta stone from whom she will obtain the secret of deciphering the glyphs of her rage he is dancing with the girl who asked about the skull there is a fire in her eyes that tori recognizes and envies a fire she feels but must suppress in order to fit into the perfectly manicured life in dianas garden the fire exhibits itself as simple unadulterated elemental and it represents everything tori is not with a sudden wrenching of the girls wrist tori spins her away and begins dancing with the biker he is huge and she smells him a rich heady combination of leather and sweat primitive the beast hey hey the girl has returned her hair disheveled her face twisted into an angry mask get lost tori shouts as she dances im here now bitch the girl shouts back and reaches clumsily for her the rage bursts its bonds at last tori twists her upper torso slams her balled fist into the girls face the girls neck snaps back and her legs go out from under her tori continues to dance with the biker she has not once looked into his eyes she does not want to his eyes dont interest her hey he says hey tori is dancing and hardly notices that he has stopped the biker says to her who the fuck do you think you are and as casually as someone would swat a fly he smashes the heel of his thick hand into toris nose breaking it tori sat very still in the huge leather chair it had been a long time since she had thought of that night in the valley because her nose had healed slightly crooked her mother had taken her to her own plastic surgeon but after seeing the array of new noses he could provide her tori had run out of his office and never gone back in the end her imperfect nose had become for her a badge of sorts a reminder of what she had never gotten and what she needed freedom to be be what she did not know but adona was right she needed a passion without it she was suspended in limbo surviving perhaps but hardly living tori laura nunn poked her head into the library she was wearing a pair of blue jeans with lines of rhinestones across the pockets and down the legs and a plain white mantailored shirt both of which she had just bought at a posh store on rodeo drive in the mistaken impression this casual outfit would allow her to feel closer to her daughter but this attempt at being a pal was a role as well and the sight merely saddened tori oh there you are darling you seemed to have disappeared like a puff of smoke laura nunn flashed her kilowatt smile theres someone here to see you there is i dont see how tori looked up from the book she was reading she had one leg thrown over the arm of me oversized leather chair she was slouched in she was barefoot wearing only a pair of cutoffs and a cal tech tshirt no one knows where i am nevertheless hes here who russell russell who why you know dear russell slade laura nunn held the smile as if she were waiting for the director to yell cut jesus christ tori slammed the book shut jumped off the chair i hope to god you told him to go to hell or at the very least that i wasnt home i did nothing of the sort laura nunn said i told him i was delighted to see himwhich by the way i am i told him id go fetch you now mother russell slade fired me well im sure that was just a misunderstanding laura nunn said more a matter of internal politics than anything else im certain it had nothing to do with the kind of job you were doing new regimes and all that people who come into a new job want their own people under them its only natural darling ive seen it happen often enough at the studios one just has to thicken ones skin the last thing you need is to take this kind of unpleasantness personally oh jesus i havent even spoken to russell since he canned me a year and a half ago not even when we were in washington last year no toris mother could not bring herself to speak of it but the president had presented them with the congressional medal of honor awarded posthumously to greg and she had carried it back here put it away in a drawer in gregs room it was to her not a symbol of pride but rather another reminder of the enormous tragedy of his death i cant think why you havent patched up your differences by now darling hes such an adorable man just perfect for some sixth sense caused her to stop she turned to look over her shoulder said in a voice so bright it verged on being brittle darling look whos here and tori saw russell slade brush past her mother neatly cutting off her own avenue of escape from the library hello tori he said just as if nothing had ever happened between them tori for the moment speechless looked past him to where her mother still stood in the partly open doorway laura nunn gave tori a beseeching look then quietly closed the door russell looked around i havent been here in a long time it was good to see your mother again my god what a magnificent woman she is youve got a set of brass ones tori said what the hell are you doing here could i have a drink do you think its a long drive from the airport tori went to the wet bar along one wall fixed him a tom collins without asking him what he wanted she already knew she handed him the drink and he nodded he was dressed elegantly but comfortably in a dark blue polo shirt linen trousers a beautifully cut lightweight silk jacket tori was acutely aware that she was barefoot and dressed like a waif she seemed at a distinct disadvantage like a naughty child being interviewed by her father ive come to debrief you russell slade said debrief me he nodded someone had to do it i thought it might as well be me ariel solares was one of my best field men since you were there when he died you know its standard operating procedure that you be debriefed youre the director you dont know the first thing about debriefing field personnel theyre too far down the food chain russell ignored her sarcasm as i said solares was one of my best men i thought it wise if i came myself dont bullshit me russell you came here because it was me who was with him i understand your anger but you dont understand one thing about me tori flared russell taking a sip of his drink regarded her coolly over the rim of his glass in any event he said at last ive got to talk to you i dont work for you anymore he sighed as he took a seat on the leather sofa beside the chair she had been reading in he picked up her book the nobility of failure he looked at her i know this book its about japanese heroes of myth and history isnt it he did not take his eyes off her sit down tori please i recognize youre angry that ive intruded on your solitude but i came here because solaress murder compelled me to come i think even you can see that lets try at least to be civilized get the interview over with and call it a day how simple you make it all seem tori turned away from him went back to the bar she selected an oversized glass dropped in some ice poured singlemalt scotch then added some water she recognized that she didnt really want a drink but she needed to buy herself some time to restore her equilibrium the first thing id like to know she heard him say from across the room is if youre all right you must have been hurt in the explosion yet the san francisco police told us that you refused medical treatment thats because i didnt require any tori said taking a sip of scotch then turning around to face him not even shock i see russell regarded her for a moment then nodded that would be like you he said as if to himself you were always adamant about doing everything yourself i am more qualified yes yes i know please lets not get into that all over again what mask do you have on today russ tori sat down beside him the mask of the invincible administrator or the master chess player sacrificing one pawn after another in the bloody field youve never walked through or maybe its your favorite you have on today the bernard godwin protege mask russell sipped at his om collins thats the one you hated most isnt it he said aware of godwin saying to him your relationship with tori nunn is all unfinished business because in a way were victims of sibling rivalry we both think of ourselves as bernards proteges he never had children tori he made us instead tori made a disgusted sound sat back against the sofa allowed the coolness of the leather to penetrate her tshirt russell got up took a walk around the library this was typical of him he liked to get the lay of the land he found the physical and the emotional space inextricably entwined and he chose the ground for his interviews with meticulous care tori saw him come at length to the french fruitwood table he ran his hand across the chocolatecolored leather of its top the brass and green glass bankers lamp the chasedsilver burl cigar humidor given to toris father by samuel goldwyn in so doing russell passed near enough to touch the box ariel solares pressed into her hand just before he had died tori held her breath she had no intention of telling russell slade about its existence either now or in the future ariel had given it to her and she was now its sole guardian he turned back to her what the hell happened in san francisco why dont you tell me i dont follow you ariel solares was pursuing me russells face was impassive was he well he had better taste in women than i gave him credit for tori laughed despite herself youve gotten better russell ill give you that she got up stood facetoface with him you know ariel was pursuing me she said taking a stab in the twilight you sent him after me now thats an absurd notion i dont think it is tori said why else would you come to debrief me personally unless you were running ariel yourself it happens that solares was working on a firstpriority mission for us actually i was about to dispatch someone else to debrief you but in the end decided that mine was the duty sort of my way of taking responsibility for ariels death thats a pathetic gesture typical of a desk jockey who knows nothing of the dangers in the field dont be melodramatic he said the truth is my people go because they want to go not because i make them he put down his glass on the table beside the box ariel had given her but you already know that what i know is that ariel was working for you that his picking me up in buenos aires wasnt happenstance he was waiting for me well thats an interesting surprise russell said smoothly but its wrong a bit too machiavellian tori laughed again thats an oxymoronic sentence id like to preserve in my diary she finished off her scotch what was ariel doing for you in buenos aires russell shrugged according to you waiting to lure you into his web i mean in the tunnels russell the yakuza assassins ariel knew who they were and why they were there that means you know too sure i do but the informations classified you dont work for me anymore thank god tori said but i have to wonder whether you were ever able to replace me skills like mine are invaluable to a very select few tori smiled no i dont have to wonder i know youve never been able to replace me russell sat back stared up at the ceiling that may or may not be true but i would have thought you would recognize your ro in helping us find solaress murderers he paused significantly if only for his sake tori smiled thats right russell give it the old college try give me one last shot of team spirit see if it takes i think youve misunderstood do you really think im as completely cynical as that tori rose went back to the bar poured herself some mineral water how is bernard she asked hes still retired from the mall oh not retired never retired russell watched her carefully bernards maintained an unofficial consultancy of sorts its an arrangement that is beneficial to all concerned remember me to him would you tori said of course russell extracted a mini tape recorder from an inside jacket pocket he snapped it on now can we get on with me interview all right tori said ill tell you everything i know when she had finished russell said youre certain thats everything tori said it was she had not told him about the box or about going to bed with ariel russell snapped off the tape recorder well thats over with he said in the tone one uses when one is finally finished making funeral arrangements do you think we can call a truce of sorts what makes you think well need one tori said rising but as she passed by him he put his hand gently on her left hip and said how does it feel tori went into prana breathing deeply and easily but to regain her equilibrium had cost her time and the silence was unspooling rapidly each second increasing russell slades small victory over her i rarely think of it anymore she lied thats good he said it means the healing is complete he took his hand away but still she did not move tell me can you do everything you could do before the ah incident and abruptly it all clicked into place in her mind scattered pieces that had made little sense on their own only when they were connected did the whole picture emerge she turned to look at him it wasnt just that you sent ariel after me was it you ordered him to test me thats why he took me down into those tunnels he knew the japanese were going to be there and thats why he was so passive down there to allow me the opportunity to figure a way out i was a rat in a maze she stared wideeyed at him thats it isnt it russell smiled at her well i see theres nothing wrong with your imagination he pocketed the tape recorder but to put your mind at ease i have no idea why solares took you into the tunnels in fact he should have known better taking you into a red sector was a gross breach of securityand im afraid he paid for that breach no you dont tori said dont lay this off on ariel she came across the room stood looking down at him you have no idea why he was murdered or even who did it because if you did you wouldnt be wasting your time debriefing me no she thought you need me russell thats why youre here i passed your reentrance exams and now you want me back russell was shaking his head what a waste if only youd consented to allow our specialists to look after you following the incident dont you see by insisting on your own doctors japanese doctors who we could neither vet nor vouch foryou put the entire mall network in jeopardy i had no choice but to sever our ties at once you brought on your own fate with us i did what i had to do in order to save myself tori said i knew nothing about your specialists but i did know mine they are friends and they are the best at reconstructive surgery that all may well be true but you still dont get it do you tori shook her head without this body without it being able to do everything it did before i would have been nothing i would not have been able to live with myself i fully understand your concern for your body but our people were just as good as your japanese surgeons and they had the highest security clearance who knows what you could have revealed about the mail under anesthesia i had all of my people to think about not just you clever tori said but its not enough you used that incident but that wasnt the real reason you severed me thats the one thing you havent lied about we were like siblings i was your major competition with bernard and you wanted me out of the way and you got what you wanted because in the end the malls like every other place a bastion of male superiority control was never a place for you youre quite right about that russell stood but now youre not on any missions either that must be a source of considerable pain for you his eyes were on her as far as the hip is concerned the japanese surgeons put in a prosthesis of a material thats far superior to human bone its ten times more flexible and one hundred times as strong she gave him a cold smile but since you asked theres no pain on wet days no unusual friction nothing that reminds me that the hip had once been shattered except that i run jump and twist better than i did before the implant in any event you seem to have gotten out of the tunnels in an ingenious fashion it was his way of saying he believed her but at the same time he had confirmed her suspicion that ariel had been ordered to test her under the circumstances she felt it to be an inadequate victory she continued to study him youll never admit that i did the right thing by going to my friends instead of using your people the truth is you made a decisionone of many i might saywith your emotions instead of your brain russell said worse you could not see the danger in putting yourself in the hands of those not under mall discipline im afraid you left me no choice how convenient memory can be we all believe what we need to believe tori except for bernard you give bernard entirely too much credit russell said but thats no doubt because bernard godwin recruited you he was your mentor but you see bernard handed the reins over to me you never understood that or never wanted to you mistrusted me from the outset i detested the callous way you used people russell smiled at her you forget that bernard godwin was my mentor as well there was a silence for a time tori digested both the tone and the thrust of the conversation at length she said theres really nothing you can say that will change my mind about what about returning to the mall thats not why i came here isnt it tori said she matched his smile but all the time her heart was beating fast perhaps youre right in that case youve got what you came for right russell said dont want to overstay my welcome you never had one he laughed thanks for the drink youve been the perfect hostess tori said nothing a bientot russell said until we meet again thatll be the day the library so cozy and snug in the daytime was now wreathed in the shadows of evening made gloomy and depressing by her dream as well as by the onset of night tori sat curled in the huge leather chair still feeling russell slades presence as if it had somehow been imprinted upon her flesh for a moment she was suddenly overcome by panic her hip what if russell had mentioned it to her mother tori had never told her parents that she had been injured or that she had a prosthetic hip she could imagine russell saying its wonderful that your daughter has fully recovered mrs nunn but no she knew him better than that always securityconscious russell never said any more than he had to he was the consummate spy his lies were largely those of omission feeling a bit calmer tori got off the chair went to the desk she put her hands on the box ariel had given her she opened it once again took out the color snapshot stared at it it was a photo of ariel clearly taken recently perhaps only weeks before he had come down to buenos aires in the background tori could see trees walkways benches one of san franciscos small parks tori could see russian hill in the distance so the park was close to where ariel had lived his face was in partial shade but it must have been quite sunny because his eyes were crinkled up against the light he was smiling just behind him was what looked like a bronze sundial and beyond a child at play at the edge of the park a couple was walking toward the camera and a bit closer there was a man in the lefthand corner of the frame they were all too distant for her to be able to make out their faces tori had studied this photograph endlessly since she had come home searching for a clue as to what might make it important enough for ariel at me point of death to entrust her with it but she could find nothing out of the ordinary it was just a photo of a man in the park ariel was this the sum total of him all that might pass for a legacy there was a soft knock on the library door and laura nunn entered darling its so late we were waiting dinner for you tori glanced at her watch but its only sixthirty mother laura nunn smiled seventhirty we turned the clocks ahead this morning its daylight saving time summers on its way she cocked her head youre hungry arent you tori putting away the mysterious photo of ariel said as a matter of fact i am and speaking of zen policemen tori thought hours later when she was alone in her room there was bernard godwin the father figure in her life she had met him and her life had changed as if he had been a bolt of lightning or a zen policeman she was sitting at the art deco vanitya christmas gift from her motherwhere years before laura nunn had put ribbons in her hair tying them just so the perfect mother making her daughter in her image perfect tori running her brush through her thick hair now shuddered she stared at herself in the mirror and remembered almost ten years ago she had been in the current street patois a wild childwhat the society of sixteenth century feudal japan would have called a ronina masterless samurai those were the days when tori haunted the wicked back streets the evil bars squatting in the putrid backwaters bastard splinters of tokyos monolithic nature there were so many empty spaces in toris mind she could afford little sleep because in rest she would be forced to look into the emptiness and see perhaps what she was not ready to confront instead she walked the line closest to the abyss of death in order to prove to herself that she was still alive it was inconceivable to her for instance that she might be homesick oh she missed greg but that was a given for her it never occurred to her that she might long to see her father again to gain from him what she never had been able to a sense of her own worth a knowledge seen in his eyes heard in his tone of voice if not directly from his words that he was proud of her the way he was proud of greg there had never been room for her in a family fixated on continual praise for gregory nunn pilot astronaut and it was far less painful to relinquish all hope than to be forever disappointed the fact was had she been able to admit it to herself tori would have seen that she loved her father as she loved greg both were extraordinary people in much the same way but toris burning need to be recognized in her own right by her father made it impossible for her to see him with the same objectivity she saw greg in a way it was odd that she put no blame on her brother for the praise lavished on him shouldnt she see it as his fault that when the family spotlight swung on him it left her in shadow yet she did not perhaps her love for greg was so complete that it never occurred to her to hate him certainly she envied his relationship with ellis nunn and yet whatever her lack she saw it as her fathers fault not gregs but in another way it was perfectly understandable that she should hold her brother blameless for the excesses of her family greg was her lone ally in her skirmishes with her parents and to exclude him from her life would be to threaten her very existence but with greg gone from dianas garden tori discovered that her desire to get as far away from los angeles as possible overshadowed everything else japan where a fire awaited her burning in the darkness of her night perhaps sensei discerned the blackness inside her but if so he made no comment on it sensei was a believer in hard work in discipline he once told tori is the answer to every problem either he was mistaken or tori was unable to absorb his teachings deeply enough in either case tori graduated from his arduous course of trainingthe only woman to make it all the way throughwithout having successfully confronted the specters within her own night this was the state in which bernard godwin found her dangerous her nerves hairtrigger fine walking the edge between trouble and death and getting a hell of a kick out of it in fact when she remembered the moment of her first meeting with bernard godwin what stuck out most was that she had almost gotten him killed he had found her in an akachochin called the happily ever after the afterhours club was in the wrong end of nihonbashigod knows how bernard even found it walking into the place was like being sucked into a whirlpool in the center of a cesspit a yakuza underboss approximately as large as godzilla was hitting on her she didnt mind she liked his tattoos flames everywhere flames eating gods demons mythical animals and fierce swordsmen with indiscriminate greed the flames made her think of exorcism turning filth to oily smoke purging sacred ground that had been made profane purifying the night just before bernard godwin came down the stairs in the happily ever after she remembered composing the first line of a reply to the letter she had just received from her brother its all right greg im doing the best i can smiling up at godzilla the japanese gangster full of fantastic flames yessir she thought hes evil hes nasty and hes all mine then bernard godwin had introduced himself it was not a happy moment for either tori or godzilla neither of them wanted to be interrupted then bernard godwin said that he had a proposition for tori but first she must come away with him out of this place and all hell broke loose godzilla might have been huge but he was astonishingly quick this was his turf and he was nothing if not intensely territorial bernard had muscled in on his property and godzilla was enraged he displayed his displeasure by picking bernard up in one meathook fist and shaking him until bernards teeth rattled stop it tori said godzilla ignored her a small blade snicked into his left hand it headed for bernards throat tori drove her doubledup knuckles into godzillas sternum while simultaneously smacking him in the groin with her knee for a moment nothing happened then godzillas eyes began to water his mouth flopped open and he dropped bernard godwin to the none too clean floor tori knew her exit cue she grabbed bernard by the back of the neck and got out of there across town in roppongi in an infinitely more savory neighborhood they entered an allnight sushi restaurant a sign over the door had imprinted on it the image of a round spiky fish you re buying tori said as they sat down you owe me it will be a pleasure bernard godwin said inclining his head in a gesture that seemed both oldfashioned and appropriate she was surprised that he appeared none the worse for his ordeal tori ordered for them bowls of baby eels to start then an assortment of sushi that included abalone flying fish roe and sea urchin lastly she ordered broiled fugu all this was quite deliberate the japanese unique culture test tori had been subjected to it on her arrival she saw no reason why she shouldnt subject bernard godwin in the same way she had taken him to one of the restaurants licensed to serve blowfish which in the wrong hands could be lethally poisonous they were given hot towels the hot sake came first and tori watched bernard as he drank his they were on their second bottle when the baby eels arrived tiny white things in a clear broth the eels were without doubt disgusting to look at but really were quite tasty tori ate with gusto and was mildly disappointed when bernard dug in without so much as twitching an eyelid oh well she thought theres plenty more to come all the sushi she had ordered was food for which after a long time one might possibly acquire a taste it was true that many japanese themselves did not care for sea urchin but to impress westerners as well as to prove their superiority and separateness they ate it anyway pretending to savor its strong rancid taste to her dismay bernard tackled the sushi with a good deal of aplomb he even asked for more marinated ginger and wasabi the fiery green horseradish i once read a report he told her that said this ginger was a natural protection from any nasty microorganisms that might be in the raw fish had you heard that also tori said she hadnt the fugu came and tori told him what it was bernard looked at the fish shrugged ate it when they were both finished with their food and tori ordered their sixth bottle of sake bernard said tell me young lady how did i do pardon me how did i do on the test you just gave me he said patiently did i pass tori looked at him for a moment then laughed until the tears came to her eyes jesus christ she said wiping at her eyes you really are the limit funny bernard godwin said with a serious face that was just what i was thinking about you tori took him back to her apartment a tiny place in an ugly colorless building that looked like a cracker box stood on end but inside it was comfortable if cramped bernard seemed content to settle in he was an exceedingly magnetic man for he carried with him a singular kind of power he reminded her of images she had seen of julius caesar the planular face dominated by the long patrician nose the prominent chin the commanders eyes so full of good humor as well as power it was a good face strong and at the same time gentle it was a glyph which if you read it correctly seemed to say if you are my friend i will take care of you forever but if you are my enemy i will take you down in such a way that you will not even know its happening much later she would come to see the guile lurking like a pike in deep water behind his bright blue eyes tori got a couple of kirin beers from the half refrigerator opened them handed him one she liked that bernard was comfortable drinking it from the bottle he was dressed in a pair of dark blue trousers a polo shirt of the same color and a handsome jacket of soft chocolatecolored lambskin he wore highly polished john lobb stalking shoes that made no sound when he walked tori liked the way he movednot quickly but lithely with a sense of purpose always his were not the mannerisms of a young man but they certainly werent the mannerisms of an old man either far from it bernard godwin had obviously put his years to good use learning as he went from many sources tori found this interesting in fact she found bernard godwin altogether fascinating but after the incident in the fugu restaurant when he had so effortlessly seen through her she was careful not to let him know this he wanted something from her she thought that the chances were good that he would get it but it was she who wanted to set the price you said something about a proposition tori said flopping down beside bernard godwin on the rolledup futon she slept on that doubled as a sofa yes indeed bernard had stretched out his long legs crossing them at the ankles his eyes were hooded as if the sake was finally catching up to him or he had passed his bedtime this is something ive no doubt will pique your interest first id like to know how you heard about me bernard took a sip of the kirin the yakuza might call you the wild child but there are others to whom you are known as the female ronin he turned his head toward her in certain circles you really are quite famous like a celebrity tori got up turned on the stereo jefferson airplane stomping backbeat swirling melody grace slick singing white rabbit yeah tori thought you tell em gracie who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men when tori came back to sit beside bernard she said what circles my kind of circle he said in his sleepy voice yours too i imagine he sucked at his kirin yeah what makes you so sure you want it straight okay youre an angry young woman looking for direction right now youd as soon throw yourself in the furnace as someone else right now it doesnt matter all that much to you as long as someone burns but im here to tell you that it does matter it matters very much why for some time bernard godwin was quiet then he leaned forward put the kirin bottle on the freeform glass and iron coffee table he put his elbows on his knees there was a guy i know he said at last this was a long time ago this guy was about your age perhaps a couple of years younger his mother had just died and all through the funeral he was hoping his father would walk into the funeral parlorjust for a minute evento pay his respects this guys father had run out on his wife when his son was five years old he found another woman maybe or maybe he liked to go from woman to woman who knows anyway the guy hadnt seen his father in all those years he hadnt thought that he really wanted toharboring in his heart this hatred for his old manbut now at the moment when the minister was speaking of the fulfilled life of the dearly departed he saw the eulogy for a lie and this guy knew that he had to see his father again soon after his mother was buried the guy traveled west to chicago where his father had taken up residence he ate lunch at a great rib soul shack on the south side where he was served by a black woman who had hickory ash in her hair then he walked to the building where his father worked his father was a reporter for a chicago paper and when his son asked to see him the guy was told that his father was out running down a story no one knew where he was or when he would be back this guy said he was the reporters son that he hadnt seen his father in years and that hed wait no one said a thing he was shown to his fathers desk and he sat down in an old scarred swivel chair that squeaked when he moved it back and forth he saw the clutter on his fathers desk and thought of the clutter of his mothers life he saw the old ibm typewriter on his fathers desk and thought of how often his mother longed to hear from his father walking to the mailbox with an expression of hope returning with the weight of a secret defeat only it hadnt been a secret from her son who saw everything and hurt when she hurt this guy opened the drawers of his fathers desk one by one as if he hoped to reveal the ghosts of the past he could not remember the specters of a past that might have been in the lower righthand drawer underneath a halfempty box of kleen he pulled out a framed picture of his mother and himself as a small boy he could not remember the picture having been taken he put the photograph away as if he were not really certain that little boy was him time passed day into night the son fell asleep his head on his folded arms his arms on his fathers desk when he awoke he saw his father standing in front of the desk peering down at him son his father said what the hell are you doing here there was silence for some time even grace slick had the sense to keep quiet tori did not stir though she felt the need to cut the silence with music at last bernard godwin got up fetched two more kirins for them from the refrigerator tori heard the tops popping and it was a kind of music she took the bottle bernard offered her but she didnt drink it right away bernard said i guess in my case the truth was simple my father was a dyedinthewool sonuvabitch people who knew him better than either i or my mother did said he had to be like that to be such a good reporter but i didnt give a damn what they said as far as i could see he was an abject failure but there you are everyone has to have his own opinion maybe were not so different tori said at last bernard godwin took a thoughtful swig of his beer well if life has taught me anything its this truth is a complex animal every time you think youve caught it by the tail it turns around and bites you on the ass tori laughed but she knew he was serious as the gray end of the night became the pearlblue beginning of a new day tori and bernard godwin strolled through a tokyo filled with the last rumblings of delivery trucks the bridges were filled with them from the sumida river horns sounded as fishing boats neared the taikiji wholesale fish market tori found herself recalling how bernard had done nothing not even twitch when godzilla had lifted him off the floor now she wondered what would have happened if she had not intervened she was not at all certain that she would have put money on godzilla she thought she would give anything to see bernard godwin at work i guess nows as good a time as any to present your proposition tori said the sky above tokyo looked clean this early in the morning and the city seemed immense a world unto itself i want you to work for me bernard godwin said is the work legal i take it as a good sign that you asked bernard took a last swallow of beer gave a little belch pardon me tori smiled what i doand what you will do should you decide to join meis legal in the broadest sense of the word meaning meaning that no matter what we become involved in we would never be brought before a court of law but what we do is in another sense amoral we are beyond the laws man constructs this does not mean that we are lawless far from it much like the japanese whom you obviously love and admire so much we create and define our own set of laws bernards eyes seemed to have closed as if he were on the verge of sleep interested tori almost said god yes how soon can i start instead she drank half her kirin looked up at the forest of monstrous towers through which they were walking and said ill give it some thought three days later tori gave bernard godwin the answer she knew she would give him from the first the trouble was she did not want to go home he understood this just as he seemed to understand the rest of her character carefully hidden from all others like an enigma in the center of a stone pyramid i want you here in japan bernard told her we have no one with your expertise in this quarter of the globe weve found it impossible to infiltrate anyone of substance into the japanese underworld but youre already in it youre already respected and more importantly feared tori said i think youve got that the wrong way around well see bernard said weii see oh god tori moaned softly oh god and with bernard godwins voice still echoing in her mind she stumbled to the phone dialed a number she had long ago committed to memory there was a great deal of waiting while the switching was accomplished but when at last she heard russell slades voice crackly with mobile phone interference she said a bientot you were right im coming two tokyo moscow no one knew in advance that kunio michitas nakodohis gobetweenwas going to commit ritual suicide save honno kansei honno worked for kunio michita as personal secretary to tokyos most prominent businessman honno was privy to many secrets impending deals mergers acquisitions she could easily have put this knowledge to work on the tokyo stock market but she didnt honno was adept at keeping secrets she had made herself that way out of necessity she carried a secret buried deep inside her the horrific knowledge that she had been born during the year of hinoeuma it had been a mistake of course her father had never forgiven her mother believing of course that the pregnancy was her fault if he had come to love honno he had never showed it he always made her feel soto an outsider in her own family why according to the ancient chinese zodiac hinoeuma was a year of the horse that appeared every sixty years legend had it that women born in hinoeuma became husband killers consequently there were far fewer births in japan in the year of hinoeuma than during any other year because of her keen intuition and empathetic powers honno was almost destroyed by superstition leaving her family had both strengthened and weakened her the constant proximity to their fear and anguish had been like a knife cutting through her belly and she had believed her sensitivity to be a curse but years later it had also inadvertently exposed her to many more deeply buried secrets such as the impending death of kakuei sakata kunio michitas gobetween sakata too had been privy to many secrets he had borne this burden if not easily then well for the past four years what had changed now to cause him to snap if he had been a member of a different more western culture sakata would simply have resigned his position in the face of a scandal cracked open he would have turned states evidence against his boss acquiring immunity as well as vast wealth from the bestselling book he would then write about the affair a film or television miniseries would merely be the icing on the cake but sakata was japanese living in japan where the worth of a personal relationship created ones definition of what it meant to be a human being his death like yukio mishimas years before was a means of communication a statement a symbol even of his own personal beliefs which would now be stamped for all time upon the collective consciousness of the nation all these ramifications like ripples upon a pond were on honnos mind when she heard sakata tell his assistant your time has come i wish you luck though i doubt that in the coming maelstrom it will matter what maelstrom as she looked upon sakatas calm face honno wondered what must be in his mind what were the secrets that would unleash the maelstrom had he just unearthed them or had they at last become too difficult to bear he had come to sengakuji to the honno was certain of it this was the place one came to honor the memory of the fortyseven ronin who in feudal times had avenged themselves upon those who had wrongly put to death their lord they had died in that pursuit nobly honorably so that their deaths were as meaningful as their lives had been this too was sakatas purpose he could no longer live with what he knew or had done yet he could not divulge these secrets a betrayal of his lifelong friendship with kunio michita was unthinkable the shame would be unbearable not only for him but for the family he was leaving behind ritual suicide was the only honorable way out for him honno knew this and therefore did nothing to interfere it would not have occurred to her to commit so dishonorable and disrespectful an act she had always revered this man who handled the fundraising from tokyos complex bureaucratic and political arenas that backed michita but never more so than now on this very warm spring day the graves of the fortyseven ronin were covered in flowers incense rose in the still air the combination of heady scents was almost overpowering and for the rest of her life honno would equate this particular amalgam of odorssweet and muskywith death what were the secrets kakuei sakata could no longer live with as far as honno knew there was not even a breath of scandal connected as she was with tokyo districts feared tokusothe special prosecutors officesurely she would have heard if an investigation file had been opened on michita or sakata it was a long road from kasumigaseki the district in central tokyo where sakata and honno worked to the ancient graves at sengakuji sakata had chosen a time late in the day when the shrine was deserted he was dressed in white the color of death honno saw him limned in the setting sun against the field of flowers covering the graves a wind whipped his baggy cotton trousers about his legs the contrast between the vivid color of the blossoms and the purity of the white material was striking another memory that honno would not forget she watched as sakata knelt with his back to her he withdrew from his waist a ceremonial knife the blade slightly curved shot the suns rays into honnos eyes so that for a moment she saw nothing then the glare was gone and honno saw sakata hunched over she could see the acute angles his arms made and knew that his hands grasped around the knifes hilt were already thrust against his lower abdomen all at once his head shot up she could see his shoulders trembling as he sought to bring the blade buried deep inside him from left to right in the ritual samurais disemboweling cut sakatas spirit was being purified disentangled from the sins he had committed during the course of his duty but even the strongest hand could falter the minds determination did not fail but the body in trauma could betray the spirit and this was what was happening now to sakata honno could see that on the verge of death his body lacked the strength to finish the cut he tried again but to no avail honno could watch no longer she stepped from behind the huge cryptomeria tree that had hidden her from sakata and hurriedly she knelt by his side the lower half of his clothes were stained crimson the veins at the sides of his neck were standing out like ropes and his eyes seemed to be bugging out of his head with the massive effort honno leaned over him and placing her hands over his on the silkwrapped hilt of his ceremonial knife added her strength to his she heard a terrible ripping sound like thunder as the blade crossed fully from left to right sakatas redrimmed eyes rolled toward her locking on her for one split instant his face registered gratitude then he toppled face first into the bed of fragrant flowers placed there to honor the sacred memory of the dead irina viktorovna ponomareva awoke not knowing where she was marss large dark apartment in vosstaniya square or valeris brighter but more spartan one in kirov street she sat up in bed looked out the window there was narrow telegraph street behind the ministry of education where she worked and there was the church of the archangel gabriel irinas coworkers referred to it as menshikov tower but she could not at least to herself but then again irina had nothing in common with anyone at the ministry of education she had returned from an extended trip to the united states filled to overflowing with innovative ideas based on the american educational system she had spent the subsequent weeks painstakingly writing revising and annotating a lengthy treatise on how the soviet educational process could be streamlined and improved the paper had been duly passed around the ministry without so much as a ripple of comment at last irina had sought an interview with the minister who had spent twenty minutes circling around the fact that all the points she had made in her paper had been rejected he had been so condescending that irina had no difficulty in divining his message stick to your computer models to your statistical research use the american methodology to reform the ministrys medieval archival retrieval systemthat was after all why she had been sent to the united states in the first place the minister reminded herbut leave the important reform to the experts the men well at least i dont have to worry about being stuck in that deadend job anymore irina thought as she stared at the familiar landmark of the church of the archangel gabriel she knew where she was she was in kirov street valeris place irina felt her pulse still racing thoughts of her job the quotidian tasks of her life had failed to calm her she had awakened from the same nightmare in it she is drowning at the dinner table she jumps up goes to the window but there is blood on the streets and when she looks up in horror bars across the moon she knows she must get out into the streets something important is happening there something that will otherwise leave her behind forever but she cannot move and looking down she sees with a kind of sickening despair that she is shackled to the floor irina closed her eyes for a moment then stared again out the window across the street to her church beautiful comforting as if to assure herself that she was truly awake that the nightmare was just a dream put it out of your mind she reprimanded herself sharply though it was in the sadovaya farther out on the periphery of moscowmars insisted on living with the peopleirina actually preferred marss apartment or perhaps it was mars himself that she preferred that indeed would be ironic but this apartment had its charms she loved to wake up in the morning to the sun shining on the remnants of the church spire destroyed in a fierce electrical storm some years ago it was a reminder of how even something so fragile as faith could survive in inhospitable soil if the church could survive here she had decided some time ago so could she it was a reminder that she did not have to end up like her parents irina turned away from the window and could hear valeri bustling around the kitchen what was he preparing there was bread but no butter or milk available in all of moscow it had been this way for months now and irina recalled her mothers harrowing stories of the war when beets and turnips and perhaps a cabbage or two were all that were available to eat for months on end my god her mother had once said what we would have done for a bite of fresh food killed each other like as not although it was saidand mars assured herthat great upheavals were occurring every day in the soviet union irina thought that some things never changedand never would despite perestroika she found it just as difficultand in some cases impossibleto obtain the essentials of daytoday life soap bread fresh vegetables toilet paperas she had in the years before the restructuring the problem that no one seemed to want to face was that the old market centralism was so deeply entrenched that not even the president could dislodge it though it was clear to anyone that the produce grown by private enterprise was robust and healthy whereas the vegetables from the old collectives looked soft and withered even the president was reluctant to encourage the anathema of more private enterprise in russia after all such structural transformations always were paid for by enormous political risks so it was usually better not to act than to make a move at all instead in typical soviet doublethink the decisions to enact new freedoms were quickly followed by decisions to severely limit those freedoms this would have been an utterly depressing scenario for an americanbut not it used to be said for most russians hardship the long bonechilling winters and the even colder heart of the state apparatus inured the soviet citizen to disappointment when there is little hope depression nourishes unwillingly but flourish it does in direct proportion to alcohol consumption which warmed the body numbed the mind and destroyed the spirit irina stretched got out of bed padded down the corridor to the bathroom as usual the hot water was not working but she was used to showering in icy water nevertheless her eyes opened wide under the spray and she gave a little reflexive shout toweled dry she dressed in fresh clothes she kept in the bottom drawer of the magnificent mahogany chest valeri had had imported from england standing in front of the mirror she carefully applied the american makeup she had bought in the local beryozka store where privileged citizens like herself could buy a limited selection of imported goods she was a smallboned woman with fine high breasts a tiny waist and narrow hips her legs were shapely and had remained wellmuscled she had a peculiarly feline face triangular with large tawny eyes a small nose full sensual lips ears set close to her skull she wore her shining black hair almost shockingly short altogether she was happier with her looks than most women she knew in the kitchen valeri denysovich bondasenko was hunched over the illegal toshiba laptop computer he had smuggled into the country the amazing japanese technology had done away with the bulky crt monitor in its place was a flat gasplasma screen the battery packessential in a land where power outages were a fact of everyday lifebulged from the toshibas plastic side irina peered over his shoulder saw the food recipe up on the multicolored screen kissed him on the tip of his ear almost ready he said distractedly he was a frighteningly large man with a wrestlers meaty shoulders and the powerful forearms of a laborer irina had been terrified the first time she had gone to bed with him his face and voice were as intimidating as his body when he was angry she could feel the tension in the same way she could just before a powerful storm she had not wanted to go to bed with him that first time but she could not imagine what he would do to her if she did not acquiesce they had met at a typical state function she had gone because it was her duty to go but all the time she had been thinking of renewing her nagging spirit on her knees at the font of the church of the archangel gabriel then valeri bondasenko had spotted her he had herded her out of the throng as american cowboys did with cattle to the slaughter she had read this in a paperback copy of lonesome dove that she had smuggled back into the country and which she now kept with her wherever she went valeri had been charming gracious even but beneath that veneer irina had been aware of another bondasenkothe feared political tactician it was he who had masterminded the brutal crackdown against the national separatists in his own native ukraine it was he who had counseled forging the still controversial compromise with the leaders of the soviet unions baltic states that made the subsequent crackdown in the ukraine possible it was said that every move bondasenko made was part of a sound strategy irina was intelligent enough to wonder what it was he wanted from her she had known full well that she was being seduced but that knowledge did not stop the process from continuing whatever valeri wanted valeri got that was what everyone said and it was clear that he wanted her irina did not have the political strength to resist him no one did still it had been a sad moment in her life to be brought home to her in such concrete fashion that she was so helpless to determine her own fate sitting naked for the first time on the edge of his bed she had prayed for guidance and for the moral strength to resist his corruption then wiping a single tear from her cheek she had climbed in beside him he exuded the heat of a furnace she thought she might be crushed beneath his muscular bulk but he turned out to be a surprisingly gentle and compassionate lover as if the valeri bondasenko she met between the sheets was a different man altogether from the one who stalked through the halls of the kremlin consigning to purgatoryfigurative and literalthose foolish enough to oppose his rise to power this gave irina some semblance of hope she had not hated him when he had taken her had almost despite herself been swept up in the vortex of his lust soon she had found her own and knew that she could come to find enjoyment on her own terms in this liaison despite the fact that with him as with all of her lovers the moment of his physical parting from her brought a sense of emptiness and of sadness one night in this apartment with the sleet battering heavily against the outside walls rattling the ancient windowpanes irina discovered another layer to their relationship he had still been inside her thick and hot she was still pulsing to thenaccelerated heartbeats can i confess something she whispered i have never felt like this with any other man she pushed the hair back from his forehead you frighten people perhaps you dont know how much you frighten them when you approached me that first night i felt paralyzed i couldnt say no to you i was terrified if i said no to you i would come to work the next morning to find my job was no longer there didnt i attract you even a little yes of course you did but i dont you see that whatever i felt at the time didnt matter i did what you asked me to do that was the beginning and the end of it and then later in bed the first time i was so frightened id displease you and then then i discovered a whole other valeri bondasenko irina said one nobody else knows about it made me feeli dont knowspecial somehow in all the vast sea of women in moscow you had chosen me valeri laughed is that all there is to your confession no irina was quiet for some time she listened in the stillness to the beating of their hearts as if it were a language she needed to decipher for an instant i felt a part of your power not a reflection but one with it is that foolish not at all valeri said stirring in fact your confession as you call it makes me more confident to confide in you i had been thinking of bringing this up for some time but i wasnt sure i could trust my instincts irina snuggled closer to him what about she could feel the power radiating from him bathing her warming her was it so bad to want to get inside it i want to get inside the head of mars petrovich volkov he said startling her because in some way she could not yet fathom his thoughts had been paralleling her own he was so close his lips brushed hers as he spoke volkov has gotten the inside track against me in the congress of peoples deputies he has lined up a formidable array of party officials behind him and got himself elected i still hold the edge because of my strong union and national district ties but now that he is in the congress he is beginning to make life very difficult with reform as the new history and speaking ones mind being tolerated certain people have become drunk on spewing criticism volkov is one of them hes making a living directing it at me he appears to enjoy branding me a napoleon claiming that i have designs on becoming the next emperor of russia he falsely claims he has no ego and i do that is his problem but he is rapidly making it mine irina could see his eyes glowing and her own image filling them up in order to defeat mars volkov i must know what he is thinking i have learned through bitter experience that there are things men cannot do or do well this is one of them i need you to become my protege so that you may do to mars volkov what i have done to you you want me to seduce him irina had asked i cannot i dont have the temperament temperament valeri said is forged through circumstance i will teach you what you need to know i will not prostitute myself in that way irina had grown angry to his credit valeri had felt this immediately he crushed his lips to hers then smiled the joke is that it is you irina who has seduced me do you think that you are the latest in a long line of conquests for me no you know my reputation i make these things open so that there cannot be any misunderstanding that my rivals might turn to their advantage no one knows about us you made certain of that irina had pointed out true enough but that too is for a purpose i too have a confession to make after my wife died i found that i had little taste for sexual adventure we had tried for the last several years of our marriage to have a child unsuccessfully after my wife died i came to see that being childless was just as well in this terrible world a child too might be used against me he rolled them both over so that she lay astride himi know the danger inherent in what i ask you to do irina but when you say no so hastily you ignore the rewards to yourself what rewards a reassignment money presents from the beryozka these things cannot tempt me oh i know that he looked at her in the semidarkness and laughed again you see i felt something in you from the moment i first saw you the reason i can ask you to seduce mars volkov is that i can understand the power it will bring you most women are content to bask in the reflection of the power of men but you are different irina you are special you want the power for yourself now you understand that i can give you that power so you will make pillow talk with mars you will get to know him and you will report to me everything you learn you will do it happily irina trust me then the fear had crept through her like a worm burrowing into the core of her hes right she thought i love this new world he can open up to me no more irina the boring academic irina the computer programmer irina the educator with ideas no one will listen to now entering valeris kitchen irina could smell onions and startlingly shallots sauteing in a skillet she sat at the small blackandwhite marblepatterned formica table that might have been at home in an american kitchen of me s valeri brought her yogurt from the ukraine and tea into which she dropped two cubes of sugar a perquisite in the sugarstarved soviet union even she was not privy to on her own she watched valeri carefully stirring the eggs into the hot skillet this was another benefit of spending the night with valeri she adored being served breakfast she was an excellent cook in her own rightone of the few gifts her mother had passed down to herand had the cooks special appreciation of being served food by another good cook but it was not an unadulterated pleasure because she always felt a pang of guilt as if this small decadence indulged in while others starved would weaken her would somehow make her unfit for the continual struggle of life here she had spent much time in america learning new educational methods but also absorbing the western way of life sometimes when she was most depressed about russia she worried that she had been irrevocably contaminated by the west too often she found herself making comparisons between where she had been and where she was now and becoming despondent over moscows shortcomings her sojourns in america had brought into question the validity of the entire soviet way of life this was her secret her terrible burden and she knew that she must never allow valeri to know she harbored these treasonous thoughts she said with all the patriotic zeal she could foster what progress have you made in penetrating white star valeri delivered a rude expletive that bastard organization of minority dissidents theyre like ghosts can you believe it white star has remained hidden from us this should be impossible in our country my guess is that they are somehow being supplied by the west how else to account for our failure to discover even one of their cells it seems to me that you dont even know if they exist oh white star exists ive no doubt of that he gave a short laugh we the government are the only ones adept enough at propaganda to create a phantom organization god knows weve done it often enough he waved a hand no no the only real question is whether or not white star is responsible for the wave of nationalist uprisings in georgia uzbekistan the baltics even the bashkir autonomous republic in every case the rioters are well led and are even betterarmed handguns machine pistols even mortars are becoming common they are being supplied by someone isnt ufa the site of that recent awful dual train disaster in bashkir valeri nodded over two hundred people died in the crash but it wasnt an accident it was sabotage a cadre of red army generals was on one of those trains they were bound for a top secret military base in the urals all of them were killed sabotage irina said i had no idea nor has anyone else beyond a select few valeri cleared his throat the truth is an alarming spate of terrorist acts has been proliferating since chemobyl an internal investigation made immediately secret proved that the nuclear event at chernobyl was a deliberate act of sabotage it was the first but it was a disaster of such dimensions that it should have put us on notice that these people are quite serious and quite mad however bureaucracies are the same the world over overstaffed underutilized bloated with inertia and never more so than here in russia my god what youre telling me is incredible unfortunately youre not the first to say that it took me some time to convince the president of the need for an antinationalist task force and that i should be put in charge of it but white star is supposed to be composed of ukrainian nationalists irina said valeri considered the rest of her unspoken question it is true that white stars leadership is ukrainian and so am i he said at last but we want two separate things my loyalty is to the state theirs is to themselves now however it appears possible that white stars membership has became more eclectic it might even turn out to be the first panminority nationalist group embracing the georgians estonians latvians lithuanians even the moslem minorities that would naturally exponentially increase white stars power and its danger to us the state these people have no idea what it is they want anarchy chaos not a better more cohesive dialectically consistent whole if they gain autonomy they will like as not begin warring with each other they are primitives misguided who better than mea ukrainian a member of a soviet minorityto show them the dangerous error of their ways irina did not know whether she felt admiration or disgust perhaps it was a combination of both she suspected that there was a measure of truth to what valeri said dissidents motives were often muddled because they stemmed from the irrational anger and fear and the sad truth was that revolutionaries rarely had any idea how to wield power once they got it so they ended up making a mess of things yet she wanted to say but cant you see that this white star is a symbol a yearning of the nonrussian people to be free dont you see it as a sign that a change must come just as it has come on other eastern european nations are you and your ilk so far from the czars after all if only she could trust someone it was awful having to bottle up ones true feelings every hour of the day and night a nightmare her nightmare imprisoned in her own country how she longed to confide in someone but there was no one she could trust not even the priest at the church of the archangel gabriel certainly never ever valeri denysovich bondasenko so she held her tongue continued to play the good little russian girl with himwhat a perfect pragmatist you are she said evenly communism is the essence of pragmatism so i must be an expert valeri said now come breakfast is ready he brought the omelettes and his own glass of strong tea as was his habit he had already consumed his portion of yogurt while he was doing the cooking this is delicious irina said tearing off a hunk of coarse black bread valeri grunted the recipe is from the new york times it didnt help that i couldnt get butter pierre franey says that butter makes all the difference i had to use oil its just as well irina said oil is far healthier its not full of cholesterol her fork stopped midway to her mouth my god she thought we sound just like husband and wife have i actually begun to get used to this life of deceit and treachery god forbid but she thought again of what valeri had said about her wanting to be free and the fear gripped her again what is it valeri said you look pale irina took a bite of her omelette to give herself some time i was just thinking about tonightand mars valeri delivered a colorful oath that sonuvabitch is out to bury me and the sooner the better as far as hes concerned now hes begun questioning my proposal for compromise with the baltic states doesnt he understand that your compromise was the best thing that could have happened irina said it proved to the world that our reform is for real and it showed your colleagues in the politburo the need to be elastic besides everyone knowsalthough theyre afraid to say itthat the baltic states were never really a part of the soviet union they were awarded illegally to stalin by hitler in the molotovvon ribbentrop accord of for years estonia lithuania and latvia have had their own legations in the united states isnt it shameful that we have held on to them wasnt it time that they broke away valeri bondasenko smiled sardonically even though lithuania and latvia have succeeded in becoming independent the central committee is not happy it still calls these secessions the virus of nationalism and seeks some wayany wayto return these baltic states to the soviet fold surely thats an exaggeration irina said i mean we wouldnt go to war over it he wiped his mouth lenin said the interests of socialism are above the interests of the right of nations to selfdetermination he was just following in marxs footsteps the proletarian has no country irina hated him when he spouted ideology by rote how could he a ukrainian be so devoutly marxistleninist when historythe history of his peoplehad so painfully proven them wrong in any case valeri was saying we cant give away the world the way the american president roosevelt did in yalta we have held on to estonia well hold on to the ukraine and georgia armenia and moldavia in the face of all nationalist agitation this is the point that mars volkov continually avoids as he hammers at me over and over hes sounding as repetitive as a rock and roll record irina laughed despite herself my god valeri sometimes i forget just how backward you can be politics is my only concern he said simply one day your obsession will be the death of you irina pointed out you cannot outthink enemies with blinders on does this expansion of my horizons include decadent western rock and roll then perhaps irina looked at him but its a good example in the west rock music is a great force it not only generates a tremendous amount of money it moves young people it can galvanize them mobilize them then the army comes in and disperses them valeri pointed out only until the young people become their own army bondasenko thought about this for some time he knew that irinas position in the ministry of education allowed her to observe firsthand many of the western trends of which he was as yet ignorant he would do well he knew to listen to her advice your criticism i can take its constructive its mars volkovs criticism that must be silenced he rose but did not take his eyes off her please keep that in mind tonight when your head is snuggled comfortably into his chest two days after kakuei sakatas public suicide a certain envelope arrived by mail it was odd squareshaped of heavy handmade paper honno kansei took it out of the mailbox on her way to work the letter was from kakuei sakata it was dated the day he had killed himself there was a folded piece of note paper inside honno opened it on the subway to kasumigaseki discovered a small key and nothing else no note no explanation now she began to feel a wind rising the first chill brush of the maelstrom that sakata had spoken of for thirtysix hours the television radio and newspapers had been filled with reports and spectacular photos of the death of kakuei sakata and swirls of speculation rippled outward from that one violent and chilling act of social conscience she had seen her boss kunio michita interviewed on the news in much the same way that the former prime minister had been publicly grilled several years before except that michita was so telegenic he emerged with increased face one channel preempted its favorite nighttime soap opera to present a halfhour special live from sengakuji the site of sakatas suicide that morning honno went to work and with the key in the moist palm of her hand brought kunio michita his mail and his cup of freshly brewed coffee she watched kunio michita a small dapper man with silver hair and a neat mustache pick through his mail she dutifully took down the dictation he gave her reminded him of his full day of appointments meetings conference calls and interviews in private he gave off conflicting signals while he seemed genuinely upset at his gobetweens unexpected death he also appeared almost buoyant at the prospect of the media coverage he was exceptionally skilled in front of the cameras and he knew it in fact from his first interview on television widespread support for him both financial and otherwise had begun to pour in it was beginning to look to honno as if michita had found his metier at last our bid for the osaka ceramics has been approved kunio michita said so would you inform our contracts department he rubbed his hands together that makes sixteen bids this year weve successfully negotiated he handed her a thick file and ive decided to close our petrochemical division weve got to gear up michita satcom to beat the satellite delivery deadlines i have a hunch the government will give us a fat incentive for those moves he handed her another file also the kaga people will be here at noon so i want you to make certain that everything is in readiness for the signing our joint venture with kaga will give me great face he still had not looked at her oh by the way he touched his forehead as if his memory had just been jogged i want you to squeeze in another appointment ive got to see aoki at tandem polycarbon at noon our new dye process is perfect for their entire new line of products honno was overwhelmed thank you sir eh michita at last glanced up at her what are you talking about well last week in the staff meeting i mentioned that id heard about tandems new product line and thought our dipole dye process would be a perfect match for it really michitas attention was already on other matters i cant say i remember that perhaps you are mistaken ive got a memo here from fujinami just got it shows research he really did his homework if the deal goes through hes in for a promotion remind me would you but sir eightthirty michita said consulting the clock that dominated his desk its time for my first conference call you have set it up i trust honno retreated from his office mr fujinami had been in that meeting last week he had heard her idea used it she should have thought to put her ideas in memo form perhaps then michita would have listened to her honno sat at her desk and slowly unwrapped her fingers from around the key sakata had sent her her sweat glistened on its surface honno counted her blessings she was in the heart of tokyo her favorite place on earth she was secretary to the countrys most successful businessman and her face among friends associates and colleagues was great actually she was lucky to be at michita industries during this past year of enormous expansion it seemed to her as if every time she looked up kunio michita had negotiated another winning bid on a lucrative new governmentsponsored project the new focus on michita apparel was another example of how michita always managed to have one division or another eligible for government incentives in highspeed growth industries six months ago honno had been certain that kunio michitas massive string of good luck would rub off on her it hadnt what had happened just now she had gone into kunio michitas office fully intending to tell him of the keys existence to give him a chance to explain to her the reason behind kakuei sakatas suicide but now she knew that she would not do it honno suspected that at the very least she should tell her husband eikichi about the key because some sixth sense was already warning her that the tokuso should be notified her connection with the tokusothe tokyo district special prosecutors officewas a personal one eikichi kansei her husband worked there as deputy assistant to the chief of the tokuso i am he loved to tell her up to my armpits in investigations into political bribery extortion and influencepeddling his job made his heart sing everything in its place and a place for everything could be eikichis prosaic but simple philosophy he was a supremely organized man a scion of one of tokyos best families who by virtue of hard work as well as his fathers considerable influence had gone to the right schools had made the right contacts and had ended up in the right job prestigious enviable honorable eikichis mother had spoiled him while he was growing up but because he wanted to live up to and even surpass his fathers expectations for him he was a fanatic almost obsessive worker from the time he had graduated university in the top five percent of his class he had been on his own on the other hand with the generous annual stipend provided by his grandfather he never had to worry about working for a living eikichis world had always been defined by two linchpins money and influence both of which his family had in abundant supply and with a good degree of accuracy one could say that he took these things for granted rather than seeing them as the blessings they were honno knew all about eikichi when she had been introduced to him by a mutual friend and she had been attracted to him precisely because of his highly structured rigidly compartmentalized life she had never had much stability in her home life and the idea of being married to a brilliant organizational wizard struck her as most appealing besides the prestige accorded her by being eikichis intended bride changed her life overnight nine months ago from the moment they had gotten married her phone would not stop ringing and she was obliged to install an answering machine to handle the flood of invitations from her friends and associates to lunch and dinner for her and eikichi eikichi was everything honno could hope for in a husband he was already cool aloof displaying all the signs of ittai that special intimacy that came from the fusion of two spirits into one he never praised her and would never think to since this would be akin to praising himself which would have been unutterably embarrassing his deep male silences his coolness to her proved the existence of their ittai feeling their extreme intimacy like all her friends her age she never referred to him by name at home rather she called him otosan papa this was not particularly her choice but what the culture dictated she do anyway it was difficult for honno to put into words or even coherent thought just what her relationship with eikichi was it was ittai eikichis private life was as rigid as his professional one he liked his meals set out on the table at a certain time and expected honno to have remembered and have prepared his favorite foods each day on those occasions when they went out to eat honno was expected to follow his lead in conversations and to know when in business discussions it was time to remain silent if she harbored opinions about business mattersshe was after all the personal secretary to kunio michitashe was to keep them to herself every month like clockwork eikichi had a dinner party at his home for his business associates and contacts honno was expected to arrange everything and then like a geisha blend into the background no the same stubborn streak that prevented her from confronting michita kept her from alerting eikichi besides she had never told him about her friendship with kakuei she would never have known how the key the key seemed everything to her a message from beyond the grave a terrible responsibility thrust upon her she felt giri the obligation too great to bear weighing upon her for some reason kakuei sakata had chosen her to carry out his last wish why her honno did not know perhaps when she learned what it was this key opened she would begin to understand sakata had been a complex man in their frequent talks together he had impressed her as someone who understood the subtleties of the feminine mind he was not like most samurai disdainful of the contributions a woman could make times have changed he once told her women were once thought to be unclean my father who made sake would not see my mother for many months during the crucial stages of brewing because he was convinced that she would in some way pollute the process and spoil the sake he laughed samurai tend by nature to live in the past but the past was not always what it was cracked up to be sakata was not prone to deep male silences when he was with her he spoke to her often and at length he seemed to derive pleasure from these talks as if to him they might be a form of intimacy honno had listened answered his queries and eventually at his prompting spoke about herself she was happy too to be with him but without quite knowing why she should feel this way it was odd for a man to talk to her so much and in such detail as if her opinions were of some value to him kakuei liked modernday japan or at least admired some of its new strengths we are more resilient now he told her and so are better able to deal with adversity for younger people such as yourself there are perhaps options that we oldsters never had its only when this newfound resilience is abused and turns into corruption that i like mishima mourn the loss of the old japan as uncompromising as the blade of a katana the truth was they liked each other and she had counted sakata as one of her few friends honno could not fail that trust now she felt a growing terror of the evidence that sakata had left behind him the dark heart of the maelstrom that had so abruptly so cruelly overtaken him what would it do to her if it had destroyed a samurai but she knew that she could not back down her feet were already set upon this particular path and there was no turning back giri dictated that she find the evidence that had destroyed kakuei sakata what then was she to do about the key she could hardly handle this situation on her own honno could think of only one answer and it scared her to death mars petrovich volkov was an altogether different breed of animal than valeri bondasenko for one thing he wasnt ukrainian or a member of any other soviet ethnic minority he had been born and raised in moscowin the white city not so far from where valeri now made his home accordingly he possessed that sangfroid peculiar to muscovites which only a parisian or a new yorker would fully understand everyone else would have resented the kind of arrogance mars volkov exhibited were he not so smooth a talker and a genuinely sympathetic listener mars volkov liked to think of himself not as a lifelong politician or even a party member though there was no doubt that he was both but as a problem solver i am like a cryptographer in the kgb he told irina when they first met locked away in some subbasement of the lubyanka struggling to make sense of the incomprehensible but unlike my somewhat clinical counterpart i deal with real people in the full light of day this was not strictly speaking the whole truth or in any event it was not as simple as that for mars volkov sought to convert the subversive into the patriotic like valeri he dealt with the gray areas of daily life in the soviet union it was he who decided the new coats of paint with which to cover the old and that fundamentally was where he and valeri differed for it was marss considered opinion that the old should not merely be repainted but be done away with entirely valeri found this idea at best dangerous at worst subversive irina was up on all the latest rumors it was all well and good for valeri to be paying lip service to marss growing power in the congress but irina knew who ultimately held the advantage valeri denysovich bondasenko these days though he was continually trying his best to pound home his views to the rest of the politburo mars like all of valeris previous enemies was definitely coming out second best irina wondered how long it would be before mars was removed from his seat in the congress of peoples deputies shipped off to god only knew where far from moscow the center of power no doubt that would be determined in part by how successful she was in the aftermath of her seduction mars volkov looked like a movie star a russian movie star to be sure but a movie star nonetheless he was tall and slim with the pale eyes and high cheekbones common to the people of the windswept northern steppes his hair was blueblack very straight and he wore it slicked back from his wide forehead he had a generous thinlipped mouth and a firm chin his only oddity was his rather small ears but this lack of perfection somehow enhanced his overall appearance rather than detracted from it in sum he was more than attractive he was desirable this made the task valeri had given irina far less odious but in the beginning it was almost irrelevant what drove her valeri was so right damn himwas the sense of absolute freedom she gained by initiating the contact with mars volkov she orchestrated his subsequent seduction with the aplomb of someone born to the role by the time they went to bed for the first time irina was giddy with her newfound sense of freedom but also a little afraid by how much pleasure she derived from this act of treachery she was no longer one among many coworkers at the ministry of education some drudge given work no man would do accorded a minimum of recognition for either her initiative or her innovations up until this moment of separation she had seen herself only in terms of being her parents daughter or brieflyuntil he had died in a training maneuver accidenther husbands wife but something inside her had always whispered is this the sum of what life is can this be all there is to irina viktorovna ponomareva now she knew the answer just as valeri had known there was another irina independent in control yearning to be free and at the moment of her triumph when she knew that she had caused mars volkov to become enamored of her to desire her beyond all other women she had at last caught the first glimpse of her own true worth and she knew with an immense thrill that the real irina viktorovna ponomareva was just beginning to be defined mars had been elected to represent moscow in the congress a signal honor his constituency included the soviet baseball federation as well as zvezdny gorodok star town the city built to house and train the soviet cosmonauts he had been one of the main architects of the space program for some years which irina supposed was why he had been chosen to help build the national baseball team irina thought that valeri had good reason to fear mars their views differed in quite fundamental ways and mars was in every sense a charismatic figure in america this talent would have caused mars to go far in whatever field he chose but this was russia and charisma was looked upon with a good amount of suspicion where valeri held sway through the sheer force of his personality mars charmed people while valeri easily forced other wills to bend to his mars had to struggle for every inch of political ground gained he was he said always fighting against other peoples innate fear of valeri bondasenko i feel like a salmon he told irina that night when she asked him why he had not eaten the meal she prepared for him always swimming upstream valeri denysovich will beat me despite all my efforts just as he has beaten everyone else he looked up at her with a weary smile they say that beneath the kremlin there is a pile of bones that is all that remains of his enemies defeatist talk she said tonight mars said i feel like the defeated tomorrow tomorrow will be different yes that was what you were going to say irina wasnt it he shrugged well who knows perhaps youre right she sat down beside him took his hand tell me what happened no its too boringand too depressing and ive had enough of gloom for one evening lets go out have dinner get drunk on pepper vodka they did irina let him do all the talking he seemed in the mood to do so and she wanted to get to know him better when he spoke she was a student soaking up informationthe bits and pieces of his lifeas if she were studying for a final exam he told her about his parents who still lived in moscow and whom he visited every sunday bringing them treatstins of caviar fresh baltic herringthings they would never buy for themselves he told her about his brother who had died and his sister who was married with three children sometimes he said refilling their glasses with vodka i think that my sister is the lucky one she lives a simple uncomplicated life and her worries are small ones common ones not so much to bear she had a little trouble with the last baby it was born with a heart murmur but the child is fine now she lives under the signs of love of contentment of the family these are everything to her without them she is lost later he said you know its funny about my sister we werent close when the three of us were growing up my brother and i were inseparable and she was well an outsider i suppose the enemy we never confided in her for fear that she would pass on our secrets to our mother imagine my surprise when years later at my brothers funeral she recounted our boyhood secrets she had known them all the time because she was far smarter than either of us boys had been and she had kept them to herself our secrets had been sacred to her even though we excluded her from everything we did even though we teased her and made fun of her now were very close i have come to cherish our time together because she is the one oasis of sanity in my insane world her love of the prosaicthis country her children who will one day join the party make their contribution to the soviet way of lifeconstantly reminds me of the importance of what i am trying to accomplish irina wanted to ask mars just what that was but she downed more pepper vodka instead she already had like a professional an instinct for when to ask questions and when to keep her mouth shut the same instinct made for great military commanders the need to attack had to be tempered with the necessities of parrying and of retreat not only to cut losses but to avoid casualties altogether attack meant by definition exposure and irina did not think that the time had come for her to take that risk mars was not vulnerable enough he was still watchful too much in control despite the vodka his cheeks might be flushed his eyes overbright but she could feel beneath it that his mind continued to function unimpaired such was not the case by the time they returned to marss apartment the vodka had had time to saturate his entire system and his libido had usurped control from his mind as usual he made love at the approximate speed of an express train as if he could not wait to get to the conclusion or in some secret way could not abide the pleasure he derived from it from the beginning of their relationship irina had felt this odd in a man who obviously felt deeply a patriot who as far as she could see was far more straightforward than valeri in any case whether it was his abrupt manner in bed or something inside herself she could not bring herself to fulfillment with mars instead she acted somehow feeling more ashamed of this fakery than the more purely mental exercise of making him care for her one was akin to being up on a stage making an audience react the other was much more intimate and as usual in the cool aftermath as he slipped out of her she felt sadder even more isolated than she had before she had an image of herself a tropical fish swimming around and around a glass bowl she squeezed her eyes shut but the image remained around and around until she longed even to feel dizzy so that the emptiness would go away afterward mars chainsmoked black turkish cigarettes and drank black turkish coffee thick as honey into which he poured a finger of vodka he sat naked at a hideous danish modern desk all angles blond wood and chrome brought his gooseneck lamp down close and readthrough files he brought home in a battered leather attache case if he could work twentyfour hours a day irina thought he would his face was half hidden by acrid smoke but irina continued to watch him as she lay belly down on the bed the only good news ive had all week mars said is that support for the united states resolutions in the un is at an historic low perhaps we will be able to isolate america after all irina testing the atmosphere scented an absence of defenses the time seemed right to expose herself and see if he suspected anything where is all the bad news coming from she said casually from right here mars said flipping a page right here irina knew his files would probably be of interest to herthat is to say to valeribut she was smarter than to try to gain access to them that would be tantamount to suicide irina yawned how do you mean mars closed the cover of the file raised his gaze he regarded her for some time smoking slowly almost indolently irina was afraid that he already knew about her but how could he it was impossible she told herself then mars opened another file began to scan it and irina realized that he had not been looking at her but through her she relaxed hafnium irina blinked what language was he speaking what mars repeated the word without looking up its a hightech metal used to make control rods for certain types of nuclear reactors especially those installed in submarines he turned over a page as if he were reading directly from the file we need hafnium we never have enough but the western alliance cocomirina knew he meant the coordinating committee for multilateral export controlsforbids its member nations to sell us any because its classified a strategic metal suitable for military purposes mars lit another turkish cigarette from the butt of the one he had finished it has taken us years but we have found a reliable source in the west for hafnium that is until cocom found out about it and cut off the supply at its source japan at least thats what we believed since the hafnium supply line ceased to function shortly after the source was shut down he rose poured himself more coffee and vodka back at his desk he sat sipping and smoking for so long that irina became convinced that he had forgotten his train of thought at last she said what happened to the hafnium meant for delivery here ah mars put his cup down at first we assumed that it had been confiscated by the tokyo police and handed over to the tokuso the tokyo district special prosecutors office thats standard operating procedure there a week later however we received a reliable report which we were later able to verify from an independent sourcethat the last shipment of hafnium had gone out before the raid and we were discreetly asked for payment the trouble was we had never received the hafnium irina sat up you said the supply line had ceased to function mars threw the file to one side got up came over to the bed in a sense thats true he looked down at her when we sent people back down the pipeline to trace the whereabouts of that last shipment they found only death each link had had his tongue neatly cut off jammed down his throat to asphyxiate is far from pleasant but to die in that way is monstrous irina shuddered but the fact was she was fascinated do you know what happened to the hafnium that is as the americans say the sixhundredmilliondollar question mars sat beside her he was staring at her nakedness and she could clearly see the effect she was having on him she could feel his tension like a song in the darkness it was logical to assume that terrorists from another nation had seized the hafnium but inquiries were made and this avenue of speculation eventually came to a dead end that was three weeks ago then where is it irina closed her fingers around the thickening snake between his thighs she leaned over kissed his nipple you know dont you i do mars said thickly and i dont he closed his eyes the hafnium is here inside russia his breath quickened but oddly frighteningly we do not know who has it honno kansei had promised herself that she would never see big ezoe again but converging events now dictated that she must karma big ezoe inhabited a large almost warehouselike space on the eastern edge of tokyo honno knew that he must be very rich to be able to have so much room around him that was unsurprising since big ezoe was oyabun overlord of tokyos most powerful yakuza family the yakuza were gangsters turning the shadowed alleyways of tokyo into their own private underworld but they were also closeknit families of gamblers eternal losers when it came to tossing the dice of heaven and thus among the japanese they had attained something of the status of myth if the yakuza inhabited an almost mythical underworld then big ezoe was their charon for he had so many fingers in a multitude of legitimate pies that surely he had ferried more unsuspecting souls across the river styx into the dangerous land the yakuza controlled than anyone else one of those unfortunates had been honno kanseis father honno could never be certain but she suspected that big ezoe had killed her father not directly perhaps but what did that matter honnos father had been an inveterate gambler nothing she or her mother could say had any effect on him he gambled at the yakuza parlors and lost and when at length he had lost so much that he could not possibly repay them he had slippedor honno suspected was pushedoff a crowded curb into the path of an oncoming bus he had ended up beneath the wheels with his back broken and his blood running in a river along the gutter he had died before the ambulance could get him to the hospital as honno approached big ezoes place she could remember vividly their firstand onlymeeting she had walked meekly into the place asked politely to see big ezoe when she was refused she said tell him that noboru yamatos daughter is here to repay his debts three minutes later she was shown into big ezoes office he had a huge smile on his face honno had stood in front of him drinking in the sight of the man she believed to be her fathers murderer then her heart hammering painfully in her chest she had pulled out a small pistol aimed it at big ezoes head big ezoe never ceased to smile not even when she said you broke my fathers back and his spirit why are you smiling at me big ezoe said to show fear in the face of death would be shameful and it was at that moment that honno had understood the full ramifications of what she was about to do and simultaneously she knew that she could not do it as much as she mourned the unnecessary death of her father she could not avenge it in this way by taking the life of another she had lowered the gun placed it on big ezoes desk now just a year later desperation had driven her to return here the last place on earth she wanted to be it sickened her to have to come here but big ezoe had a power she needed he was a monstrous creature and like a mythical dragon an unpredictable one as honno entered the warehouse she had a sense of displacement as if she were returning to the past and in so doing everything else was about to be lost to her a garden had grown up in her absence a skylight had been installed in the center of the high ceiling and below it a perfect square was displayed a pebble stream with a steep rock bank on one side a grouping of ferns hostas a dwarf maple on the other side a ministand of emeraldgreen moso bamboo filled one corner creating asymmetry the tension a counterpoint to the repose that was essential for contemplation honno was taken past the garden down the warren of corridors into big ezoes office he regarded her silently as she was ushered in left alone with him the room was filled with rarities antiques both delicate and earthy a woodblock print of the great wave by hokusai transcendant with power hanging above a monumental black stone noguchi fountain that gleamed magically with an endless rippling of water that appeared as black as the stone honno took this all in thinking how could a man as base as he is have the good taste to surround himself with elements of such ethereal beauty it was a long time before big ezoe moved when he did it was to open a drawer reach inside and place on the desk the pistol honno had aimed at him one year ago i suppose he said that youve returned for this honno stared at the gleaming face of the pistol big ezoe had carefully turned the barrel away from her she saw in the bits of chrome and steel the mirror of her past and the wound of her fathers death seemed fresh and raw again if the hate is still inside you big ezoe said placidly you have another chance to act on it but honno saw only another chance at damnation you keep it she said thickly she regained control of herself slowly and painfully perhaps youll find some use for it big ezoe nodded as you wish his huge hand covered the pistol and he opened the chambers for her to see it wasnt loaded but you thought it was and that let me see what was in your heart he laughed is that all honno lifted her gaze stared into his eyes she took a deep breath said may i have some tea big ezoe arched an eyebrow but all he said was yes of course depressing a toggle on his intercom he spoke quietly into the speaker then sitting back he said to honno if you continue to frown like that you will be old before your time i used to hear my mother instructing my exwife on how to smile a laugh escaped him perhaps i should take you home to meet my mother the tea arrived big ezoe served it himself when it was poured the first cup consumed the refills steaming honno said i need your help big ezoe seemed sad my hands are dirty i am a gangster you are convinced that i had your father murdered what could i possibly assist you with he shook his head you have come to the wrong place i think it is the police you want or perhaps thetokuso so he knows about my marriage to eikichi honno thought she knew she shouldnt be surprised information was big ezoes business among other things she steeled herself neither the police nor the tokuso would be appropriate in this instance she said you are my one and only avenue i want to do the right thing but i am afraid i am bound by giri but i am a woman in a mans world will you help me big ezoe gazed at her for a long time he was a large man in his early fifties who was so muscular that he seemed to be bursting out of his silk suit he had a wide open face that oddly enough inspired confidence but there was also an aggressiveness about his mouth and chin he had bristly shortcropped hair a neat mustache with just a hint of silver in it he looked more like a law enforcement officer than a yakuza oyabun he opened his huge hands forgive me he said but why should i help you honno was prepared for this whats in it for you she said opening her pocketbook i understand she withdrew an envelope thick with yen i have money here as much as i can afford big ezoe scowled it isnt enough honno said with a sinking heart put that away i do not take money from nice young girls who should know better must you make a joke of everything honno felt desperation grip her if big ezoe would not help her what would she do your help big ezoe came around from behind his desk my help my dear mrs kansei is not bought it is earned he looked into her eyes you said it yourself you are a woman in a mans world it is like my mother used to say to my exwife i think you must convince me that you belong here if i agree to help you i take on an obligation this is a serious matter for both of us and i suggest you consider this thoroughly before you continue i have already considered it honno said if you agree to help me i am in your debt you have no concept of how violated that makes me feel now you insult me you have a peculiar methodology for asking for help i am obligated to carry out a samurais dying wish honno said fiercely he was a friend he was honorable and i helped him the with honor now he has asked a service of me and i am bound by honorhis honor as well as my ownto carry it out for him i know i havent the means to accomplish this on my own that is why i am here a samurai you say big ezoe pulled at his lower lip he appeared intrigued are you saying that you were kakuei sakatas second at sengakuji you pulled the blade across his belly when he could not yes i see he was wreathed in thought a yakuza taking up the fallen banner of a samurai now that is a fascinating situation you will help me then big ezoes eyes focused on her again you know mrs kansei i had a feeling youd be back a year ago you walked in here and pointed a gun at my head that was something i thought id never see a woman do maybe you were too dumb to know better on the other hand you were smart enough not to try to pull the trigger had you tried my men would have killed you and now i will do whatever i have to she said will you i wonder i question whether you have any notion of what your boast might entail big ezoe looked at her thoughtfully for a moment then he laid her pistol in the flat of his hand who knows where this path will lead you or what may be required of you along the way he came around from behind his desk it is not for a small matter that a samurai takes his own life you are about to take your first step into the darkness unknown forces undoubtedly lie in wait powerful malignant forces i suspect you must be prepared to defend yourself against them he hefted the pistol curled his finger around the trigger what do you think now it is not too late to change your mind honno took out the key kakuei sakata had mailed her she showed it to big ezoe and said this is where we begin three virginia countryside machinegun city russell slade picked tori up in his custom armorplated limousine it was still dark outside even the birds barely awake in his arrogance he had been at the los angeles airport waiting for her to call russell had one of these cars bulletproof capable of running at mph filled with the most advanced communications center imaginablein washington new york and los angeles they were a necessaryone could say vitalpart of his work a mobile office where more often than not he ate and slept while missions were running russell had an almost pathological dislike for being in one place for too long he had no doubt picked up this peculiarity from bernard godwin who had survived a kgb assassination attempt in his hotel room in bonn russell detested hotels principally because it was virtually impossible to arrange decent security inside them there were far too many personnel to vet too many passageways deliveries passkeys people going in and out at all hours of the day and night to make even a token stab at keeping a room safe the only thing in russells favor was that he had not gloated but had accepted her presence as a natural occurrence which once tori took the time to think about it said as much about him as she wished to know she had plenty of time to think on the flight back to washington russell had his own private jet of course there were so many antihijacking devices the mall was obliged to order a instead of a far smaller lear jet she wanted to sleep but every time she drifted off she was back in the same dream cycle in ariels house on russian hill on the couch when the explosion hit the pain recalled from the other explosion the one that had ripped apart her hip when she had stared into the hideous eyes of death she snapped awake each time her heart hammering in her ears she sat up straight watched russell sitting across from her as he sent and received faxes from the malls situations room buried far beneath the emerald virginia hills when she had known him he had smoked but now he confined himself to gnawing at the cap of a plastic pen somewhere over ohio or missouri they were served sandwiches and coffee for which tori was grateful she had no wish to return to her nightmare landscape locked in an endless circle of fear and pain when they were finished eating russell said you still hooked into japans version of la famiglia tori did not care for his sarcastic tone she thought of him sitting in his limousine so arrogant so certain that she would call him and capitulate that he hadnt bothered to board his plane she had the urge to hit him in the face instead she concentrated on her plan somewhere near dawn she had come to the conclusion that there was a way in which she could get everything she wanted for herself reinstatement in the mall on her own terms and revenge on russell slade for severing her what she would do to slade would be a far betterand more fittingfate for him than a mere broken face although the picture of slade with his jaws wired together did have a certain charm she smiled if youre talking about the yakuza yes i still have my contacts russell nodded almost as if she had passed some kind of test good he said because the yakuza are involved up to their bushy little eyebrows are you talking about ariel solaress murder russell pushed the swivel light away from him pressed the tips of his fingers against his eyelids his face had retreated into the shadows outside the clouds streamed by below them rent asunder by their screaming passage remember the yakuza assassins you and solares overheard in the argentine tunnels he said well theyre just a tiny part of what is coming our way and im afraid theyve got something particularly nasty in store for us tori said if the japanese are involved in a big way i can see why you came to see me yourself you need my expertise she peered into his face with mock concern that isnt flop sweat i see on your lip is it dont be ridiculous he seemed genuinely annoyed and tori was pleased she had found a nerve just how deeply are the japanese involved tori asked russell stared at her you know your japanese friends are infuriating they dont know how to play by the rules oh they play by the rules all right tori said the only problem is youre like every other member of american government you havent the slightest idea what the rules are he stared at her in the way someone will contemplate an enigmatic work of modern art with a combination of shock confusion and certainly a degree of anger before he could say anything more tori got up went into the lavatory to clean up and change she emerged twenty minutes later dressed in a natural mohair cardigan over a pale lace camisole she wore a short fawncolored suede skirt brown lizardskin shoes heavy dullgold earrings bit of a show isnt it russell said taking her in thats what la reminds you tori said perversely that all of lifes a show she smiled bernard will appreciate the effort even if you dont a thick mist was rising off the potomac when they landed in washington one of russells specialized limos was waiting for them on the tarmac beside the runway its powerful engine purring its blackened windows up as protection against the capitals humidity as well as an assassins bullet once into the virginia countryside tori slid her window down over russells protests i want to hear the birds she said just before they turned onto a fourlane highway five miles farther the limo made a left into a vast mall tori saw the stores typical of a mall nearly anywhere in the country sears jcpenney radio shack a huge chain drugstore outlet filenes the limo cruised through the mall entered an underground car park kept descending it stopped at the lowest level pulled up against the far wall painted concrete blank they waited while the limo was scanned when a green light appeared on a small console by russells right arm he punched in a tendigit access code a portion of the concrete wall rose and the limo slid through they were in a tunnel built around a twolane blacktop strip lights glowed orangeyellow on the far side of both lanes otherwise the road and tunnel were absolutely featureless ten minutes later the roadway sloped up and they once again appeared in the virginia countryside this time they were within the borders of a acre horse farm this was the true home of the mall bernard godwin was waiting for them at the entrance to central his face lit up when tori emerged from me dark confines of the limo he looked to her to be not one moment older than when they had last met a roman general with all the cunning and deceit of a master statesman she had never met anyoneincluding russell especially russellfor whom the mantle of power was so well suited she believed that bernard godwin actually thrived on what he had become he needed the power just as her mother needed to slip in and out of her guises strip him of his power and he would be dead within a day by god tori you look a damn sight better than when you left here a year and a half ago bernard embraced her warmly its good of you to have come back he said so softly that she was the only one to hear then he broke away russell youve done well to bring her home briefings were traditionally held in a plush suite of rooms which were insulated from and surrounded by the mails own electrical generators the entire complex was totally selfsufficient a prerequisitealbeit an expensive onethat bernard godwin had insisted upon when the mall was first founded besides anything else the placement of the enormous generators ensured that no listening devices could penetrate to the suite the rooms were furnished in the typical style of a mens club comfortable brokenin masculine which was in part why tori had chosen to wear so provocative and feminine an outfit she had not been back to this center of clandestine power in eighteen months and now that she was she wanted the men who ruled it to feel her presence in every way the three of them settled around a burl table sandwiches fresh fruit coffee juices were waiting for them and they ate while they talked tori found that she had lost the sense of whether or not she was hungry but she ate anyway out of force of habit she automatically helped herself to the blueberries they were one of a number of what was known in the mall as mission food blueberries had been fed to fighter pilots during world war ii they were filled with an enzyme that temporarily increased visual acuity tori looked at bernard but he merely said russell youre on russell slade opened a buffcolored file tori saw that it was imprinted with the title ice cream and had a scarlet band in the upper righthand corner signifying it contained eyes only documents the most highly classified in the mall they could not be photocopied or taken from the premises and one needed dcdirectors clearanceto access them russell cleared his throat said tori i told you on the plane that our adversaries had come up with something particularly nasty i wasnt kidding and i wasnt exaggerating this concerns the global transshipping of drugs cocaine russell and bernard godwin exchanged a brief glance yes russell said and no it was bad enough when the south american drug lords bribed their own governments into becoming witting accomplices to the growing manufacturing and shipping of cocaine but now an entirely new element has entered the arena and the implications are staggeringly dire for the united states he paused here to take a sip of orange juice russell was a good public speaker tori remembered his sense of timing was impeccable the first hint we had of something sinister russell continued was just under a year ago a washington kid died doesnt sound like much i know but the death got odder its implications more frightening as the investigation went on first off the kid was a girl of about fifteen a white girl from a socially prominent family that sadly was a break for us had the victim been an inner city kid her case most likely would never have come to our attention but this girls father has plenty of bread andand this counts for much moreclout he hires a forensic specialist a former new york city chief medical examiner whos off writing his memoirs this mes a smart cookie and he begins to dig he delivers his prelim report to the father whos so appalled he phones several of his government pals at this point a red flag pops up on our computer screen and i send someoneariel solaresout to interview the principals russell detached a sheet from the file slid it across to tori this is the mes report but i can summarize it for you this fifteenyearold white girl died not of a drug overdose which had been the original diagnosis but of chronic cocaine use there was silence for some moments and tori thought that russell had not lost his touch for the dramatic do you begin to see the conundrum we were presented with a fifteenyearold girl dies of chronic cocaine abuse but the me tells us it would take at least ten years of heavy usage to get her to that stage impossible yet we were all looking directly at the proof russells fingers fumbled in his jacket pocket and tori knew he was searching for a cigarette but he didnt smoke anymore so he poured himself some more juice instead it took the me the girls father hired six weeks to come up with the answer but the clever old dog got it it was cocaine the girl had been using but only for the last three months russells eyes locked onto toris in three months her body had deteriorated ten years worth how the answer lay with the cocaine itself it was cocaine all right but an exhaustive molecular analysis revealed differences they seemed at first subtle but when we recreated some in our own labs and fed it to mice the results were astounding this stuff is poison plain and simple oh it doesnt work like poison rapidly causing death in fact the high it brings to the user makes regular cocaine seem like sugar it is ultraaddictive and it destroys the body within three months taking it is tantamount to swallowing a time bomb tori considered all this then this is the lead ariel was working on in buenos aires yes she said the two japanese yakuza in the tunnels russell glanced at bernard then back to tori ariel had assumed they were part of the pipeline then according to his last report he began to uncover anotherand far more disturbinglink between the yakuza and the supercocaine wait a minute tori said are you saying that the japanese are manufacturing this supercoke that appears to be the case russell said where did ariel get this intelligence tori asked who were his contacts we dont know russell admitted he convinced me in order to get close to these people he had to be cut loose from all normal mall procedure that meant no daybyday control no timed deaddrop reports no backup no shield nothing he told me he was in a red zone that if they suspected anything russell stared down at the ice cream file but tori could see he was looking at nothing perhaps he was rememberingand regrettingariels death this is why we need you russell said you know the japanese culture and the people they cant invent anything but give them a prototype and theyll refine it better than anyone else on earth it isnt true that they cant invent anything you know what he means tori bernard said this isnt a synthetic drug the real thing is needed to metamorphose it into this most potent untraceable unstoppable weapon this is insane tori told them why would the japanese create the ultimate cocaine to make money yes thats understandable but to create such a thing as a weaponits monstrous i couldnt agree more bernard godwin said there are elements within our own government who feel strongly that for years the japanese have been waging systematic economic war on us that they will stop at nothing to defeat us he pursed his lips as he often did when analyzing complex data personally i dont believe this but youd be surprised at who does in the white house and on capitol hill he looked firm and resolute a leader still all that seems clear at the moment is the intelligence ariel unearthed that the japanese created the supercocaine we want you to find out the rest who is manufacturing it who theyre selling it to and why then we want you to shut the whole goddamned thing down you should try to be more tolerant of russell bernard godwin said hes a good man he fired me tori said yes indeed and he had my blessing your tori i trained you and i love you i brought you into the mall and i must say i knew the risks involved when i did so i was convinced that your extraordinary physical talents and your unique mind more than outweighed your rebelliousness your unpredictability your insubordination but the fact remains that the mall is an organization not so very unlike the military in ways you already are quite familiar with and like the military strict rules and regulations have been instituted for the benefit of the mall as a whole no one individual must be allowed to rise above those rules and regulations you tried to do just that and you reaped the consequences russell did what he had to do as director so stop blaming him they were walking out past the corrals where the striped wooden bars were set out to put the hunterjumper horses through their paces no one else was around and by a bond of unspoken tradecraft they kept near the trees and foliage natural barriers against electronic listening devices all right she said perhaps ive been unfair to him but i still want what i want and what is that to come back on my own terms thats too loaded a request for me to agree to outright bernard said tell me exactly what it is you want tori thought a moment i dont want to rise above the rules i just want them bent a little i want autonomy impossible you need me bernard turned and his eyes bored into hers lets not dance we know each other too well tori the fact is we need each other if you deny this i cannot under any circumstances allow you to come home because in deceiving yourself youre likely to deceive us not willingly perhaps but that possibility would be far more perilous for us you love the hunt the dangereven yes the blood being spilled so close to you no no dont bother to deny it we both know its the truth the dance so near death is your dance tori and you do it better than anyone i ever met there was silence for a moment broken only by the sound of a nearby woodcock if youd have allowed me to finish tori said at length perhaps youd agree to what im asking for i doubt it bernard said but be my guest they began to walk again they stopped within a copse of huge maples it was cool and dark within the eaves of the shade trees in the sundrenched distance they could see horses grazing nuzzling one another it was very peaceful i want directors clearance so if i need to i can get mail materiel without going through interminable red tape tori said and i want russell with me in the field the silence between them was momentarily so deep that tori could hear a horse snorting on the hillside a good six hundred yards away this was her revenge on russell slade to take the desk jockey into the warrens get him muddy let him see the face of the enemy and if she were lucky have him stare death in the eye she had not for a moment been swayed by what bernard said he was an exactor one of his talents lay in manipulating emotions with what he said but tori had grown up with such guile and she was by now inured to it a directors place is not in the field bernard said at last nevertheless i cannot allow it tori gave him a little salute then maybe ill see you in another eighteen months or so tori you need us as much as we need you she took a step away from him into the sunshine bernard reached out stopped her all right youll get your dc he closed his hand over hers ive never asked you for anything tori but i am now we do need you far more than russell was willing to admit back there hes only human hes got his pride he took her hand in his and perhaps you need us more than youre willing to admit to yourself damnit you know theres truth in what i say toris eyes held his she did not blink i want russell with me bernard why hes ultimately vulnerable here locked away on this impregnable farm in his bulletproof limos his terroristproof jets hes out of touch with the world you werent like that think back your experience encompassed more than the think tank and the communications center once in a while youve got to put your ear to the ground instead of to a wireless grill russell will be a danger to me if he sits here and runs me which is what hes got planned for me he ran ariel so hell run me let me bring him into the field he needs the experience and im going to need the help i m not sure this is the mission for him to get his feet wet now it was tori who impaled him with her eyes you mean you can afford to lose me in the field but not russell bernard said i cant at this moment afford to lose either of you but he seemed to be wavering neither can you afford to allow this new cocaine to begin flooding the country your own evidence shows that its already started can you possibly imagine where it will end if this mission doesnt get off the ground there may not be another one for russell to go out on how did she talk you into it russell slade said i know this couldnt have been your idea dont be impertinent bernard godwin said i sanctioned it russell grunted you always did have a soft spot for her with good reason bernard said it seems to me russell that you never fully appreciated toris talents to the extent thats so russell said its because ive never fully trusted her oh not in the usual sense but shes chronically unpredictable i know when you brought her in you thought shed grow out of her rebelliousness but you saw as i did that she never matured im not so sure mature is the operative word bernard said shes got a healthy hatred of organizations of any kind im beginning to see thats an asset in her line of work russell snorted derisively bernard said if youd put aside your personal antipathy toward her youd understand what i m talking about her hatred of organizations makes her one hundred percent secure do you think anyone could ever get to her to turn her not a chance in that sense shes pure and that free spirit of hers guarantees it be grateful for that all of this is bullshit russell said ill be goddamned if ill go into the field taking orders from her bernard godwin grabbed hold of the younger man listen to me russell youll do it and youll be a good sport about it because if you arent where you and tori are headed ill guarantee youll be dead inside of thirtysix hours theres nobody whos better in the field than tori nunn nobody shes asked for you as part of her negotiations for returning home and ive given you to her what else has she negotiated for leave that to me will you theyre just details now i want you to take charge of this japanese situation ive got more than enough on my plate with white star i cant believe youre still on that bernard russell said white star is our first real link to a coordinated soviet nationalist underground bernard said of course i m not going to let it go but how can you do otherwise even you cant get a dime in appropriations not when everyone believes youre walking into a similar situation to what happened years ago what a fiasco for the mall that underground movement turned out to be the kgbs operation boomerang must you continually remind me of that debacle bernard said testily im trying to protect you russell said the kgbs predecessors tried the same thing in the twenties creating the trust they made believe the trusts goal was the overthrow of lenin they did it so well in fact that they took in a load of soviet emigres who were lured back to the motherland only to fall into the hands of felix dzerzhinsky head of the ogpu who had created the bogus counterrevolutionary organization this is a pattern bernard and me kgb is known for repeating patterns white star this time i believe white star is for real bernard said it wants nothing less than a union of independent but centrally linked republicsmuch like our own states a true union of soviet socialist republics russell almost laughed no no not socialistand thats the point imagine russell white star envisions a democratic republic the true death of socialism in russia i am convinced this is the only way russia can become a viable prosperous nation in the twentyfirst century their very survival depends on change russia wantsand desperately needsto compete with the likes of japan korea taiwan for export dollars but socialism is tying its hands and feet it needs a freemarket economy just as surely as it needs to free its nationalist republics from their slavery to moscow the leadership of white star understands this but now the temptation is to move too fast when one does that one gains unwanted attention he waved a hand in dismissal but enough of white star we have more pressing matters to discuss bernard had appeared to gain strength during their walk he said now you may think im overly sentimental about tori nunn but youll soon change your mind believe me reviewing the files i see now that you rarely utilized her to her full potential your opinion its the only one that matters godwin softened his tone in this instance i happen to be more objective than you no matter how often you may deny it russell you hate tori nunns guts and i know why you know that if she had matured as you so inaccurately put it she would have been made director instead of you and shes right you know youre atrophying sitting behind your desk all too soon youll be no good to me or the mall neither of us wants that do we the two men resumed their walk they were approximately in the same place where tori and bernard had spoken but now it was later in the day and the horses were gone the hills seemed bare without them oh dont look so downtrodden bernard said youve a chance to rectify your past mistakes thats far more than most men are given still russell persisted i want some assurance the possibility does exist that you are wrong about her she may break the rules again and in so doing endanger us all true enough bernard said and thats another sound reason for you to take the mission on with her who better to detect a false word or move than you russell and if you are wrong oh thats simple bernard godwin said heading back toward central youre authorized to terminate her since our first stop will be japan russell said on the way to the airport ill need a crash briefing on customs current style idioms so forth were not going to japan tori said at least not right away but its the japanese who weve got to start at the beginning if were going to get anywhere tori said its no good us sticking our heads in at the middle because well never know which way to go upstream or downstream but the japanese are the source theyre the logical choice to begin logic is only successful in a laboratory maze tori said out in the world intuition bridges the gaps logic cant cross from central she had phoned estilo the argentine businessman who had befriended her asking him to meet them she had spoken to him for quite a while estilo talked about ariel solares he never broke down never actually said how much he missed solares but then he didnt have to tori understood just as estilo knew she would he had always said that she had the soul of a true porteno all right russell said where are we headed to machinegun city tori told him medellin russell said incredulously colombia thats right tori said as they climbed aboard the private the driver was stowing their luggage in the belly of the steel beast dyou know that where youre taking us is off limits even for american diplomatic personnel dyou know that down there it costs about eighty dollars to hire a mariachi band for the evening but only ten to buy a sicario for a hit russell was talking about the local teenage assassins that hellhole has the highest murder rate of any city not at war medellin is at war tori said she turned to him look russ japanese or no japanese down to bare bones its a cocaine pipeline were after so weve got to go right to the source yeah russell said taking a last look at washington he was already feeling nostalgic for his comfortable surroundings his daily routine right down the barrel of a semiautomatic medellin was in the westcentral area of colombia not far from the pacific ocean it was nestled into a deep valley within the lush pined ridges of the andes the was obliged to circle for what seemed an eternity as it came closer and closer to the tops of those formidable peaks and then breathtakingly dropped below them before landing tori and russell had a good look at the scenery as sundrenched and gorgeous as anything out of a travel agents brochure they saw the spectacular terraced orchid farms whose product was machinegun citys other export they waited on the runway while the flight crew shut down the engines tori went forward to speak to the pilot everyone on board was a trained mall operative fifteen minutes went by russell began to chafe he got up began to walk around the cabin lets for gods sake get out of here he finally said tori said you dont want to go into the terminal the sicarios who hang out there will spot your gringo face instantly and attach themselves like leeches so what are we going to do for the moment were going to do nothing tori said pointing out the window russell bent over saw two uniformed paisasnativesstriding officiously across the tarmac they clipclopped smartly up the rolling stairway entered the cabin let me have your passport she said to russell and he handed it over tori went to meet the paisas and russell could hear her softly spoken spanish mingling with theirs she did not sound like a gringohe knew he did even though he was fluent in spanish as well as several other languages tori had a peculiar facility for idiom and nuance that was beyond him she spoke like a native wherever she went russell saw packets of billsus currencypass from tori to the uniformed paisas she handed them a stack of passports hers russells those of the flight crew all were stamped a moment later they had left without even having glanced russells way tori nodded to him and they went down the moving stairs the uniformed paisas had already disappeared russell sucked in the air clean and crisp deliciously scented and without any of the usual oppressive humidity found in the cities at a lower altitude tori had a satchel of parachute cloth with her while they stood there in the shadow of the jet the flight crew was already in the process of refueling going through the myriad maintenance checks necessary between flights a blue fourdoor renault drew up she had asked for it because it had a larger engine and was heavier than either the mazda or the toyota that were available are you armed tori asked russell shook his head tori said go back into the plane and requisition something from the pilot hes also an armorer she climbed into the backseat of the car russell did as she suggested but he was annoyed he hadnt taken a good look at the pilot hed needed her to tell him who his men were he was beginning to regret his acquiescence to this madness but what choice had he been given none he told himself glumly bernard had seen neatly to that tori was already in the back of the renault when he returned huddling with the driver in front as soon as he sat down beside her the renault took off the driver a fitlooking man with silver hair and mustache wore wraparound dark glasses an openweave cotton shirt and linen trousers welcome to metralin senor slade estilo said he was using the only slightly tongueincheek slang that had given medellin its apocalyptic nickname machinegun city russell turned to tori why not use a helicopter he asked her the last people who tried that tori said were turned to cinders by sicario hijackers she shrugged its the gringo alternative the nativesthe paisas go the way we will go the renault was going very fast bouncing along a scarifying switchback road that snaked through the forested mountains russell sneaked a look at the speedometer considering the terrain he thought they were traveling at least twenty mph too fast he was about to say so when estilo said over his shoulder were being followed russell turned so fast his neck cracked out the rear window he could see a pair of chrome and black motorcycles gaining on them jesus he breathed so much for your security precautions he began to recheck the pistol the pilot had given him it was a large caliber weapon deadly at medium range absolutely devastating closer in try to lose them tori said to estilo and the renault rocketed forward hurtling this way and that down the winding road tires screaming in protest the world to either side had become a green blur and the lushly forested mountainsides ahead were coming at them far too fast in desperation russell turned to the rear window the motorcycles lagging for a moment were already gaining back the ground they had lost well never outrun them russell observed we werent meant to tori said to him she turned her attention to the driver slow down estilo he heard her say and then you know what to do estilo reached down between his legs are you insane russell stared at tori as she unzipped her satchel these sicarios will cut us to ribbons the motorcycles roared up beside the renault and now russell could see that each held two sicarios bristling with armament none of them looked over seventeen there were schools in the mountains surrounding medellin that turned out scores of these fearless punk killers high on cocaine and the peculiar frightening power of the killing lust russell caught a glimpse of a pair of sawedoff shotguns beginning to swing down two mac machine pistols being leveled in the direction of the renault explosions from the shotguns at that instant estilo stepped hard on the brakes and its rear wheels sluing back and forth the renault screeched to a halt while it was still rocking on its shocks tori had opened her curbside door and using it as a shield whipped her arms up in the classic marksmans pose the motorcycles had meanwhile overshot their prey and were obliged to make sharp uturns this maneuver meant that the sicarios riding shotgun could neither aim nor shoot until the motorcycles had swung around and were heading back toward the stopped renault they fired tori was holding some kind of longbarreled pistol that russell was unfamiliar with she squeezed off two shots and the sicarios in the leading motorcycle were slammed backward off the bike it roared erratically running off the road and smashing into the underbrush a gush of oily smoke rose into the flowerscented air the second motorcycle came on russell could see that their driver the man tori had called estilo was either unarmed or was making no attempt to draw his weapon perhaps he had frozen russell was in no such position he might be a desk jockey as tori had said but he got only firsts on the target range and he worked out in the unarmed combat dojo three times a week he raised his pistol went to lean out his window but estilo whirled in the front seat and putting his hand over the hammer of the pistol pushed it down out of sight orders he said laconically but the sicarios paciencia he said wait and see tori broke from the cover of the renault and slamming her door behind her took off down the verge of the road back the way they had come what russell twisted in his seat tori where the hell dyou he tried to get the pistol out of estilos grip but failed he heard the blast of a shotgun firing goddamnit let go you sonuvabitch shell be killed because now the remaining motorcycle had swerved off the center of the road and was traveling down the right verge in direct line with toris flight the mac was chattering the motorcycle was almost upon them in a moment it would zip right by their right side and then it would be too late to do anything to help tori russell redoubled his efforts to free his pistol but it was like battling an octopus and he was unused to unarmed combat in such restricted quarters the intervening back of the seat prevented him from using the throws and holds he had learned he could see the faces of the sicarios long hair streaming huge grins splitting their faces as they rode the wind the high their speed and their power brought them they ignored the renault and its occupants focused as they were on the woman who had killed their compatriots the mac resumed its thunder just as the sicarios were about to draw abreast of the renault estilo squeezed off one round through the open side window and at the same instant kicked his door open wide the motorcycle was far too close to avoid the obstruction and there was a wailing scream as it plowed into the steel door tearing it straight off its hinges at the same time the motorcycle rose into the air like a bronco spitting the bit the vehicle squealed as if wounded hurled itself over on its side estilo was out of the renault in a flash and russell saw tori racing back estilo kicked the mac from the dead drivers hand as he got out of the car russell could see the bullet hole in the side of me sicarios head a clean hit and he thought jesus what a shot estilo placed his left foot across the remaining sicarios wrist preventing him from getting to his shotgun there was blood running from his nose and one ear nobody said a word until tori came up russell noticed that she was not even out of breath tori knelt down beside the last remaining sicario and said who sent you the sicario spat in her face and she put the muzzle of her odd pistol against his right kneecap she pulled the trigger the sicario jumped as if speared his face went white and his eyes rolled crazily in their sockets tears of pain streamed down his sweat and duststreaked cheeks tori bent closer the next time i pull the trigger she said moving the pistol to his crotch it wont be your kneecap that wont work the sicario said one word cruz the bull then he began to shake as if he had contracted malaria the corrida was full by the time they got there they had missed the drug lords and their shotguntoting bodyguards lustily patriotically singing the colombian and medellin anthems but the first blood had not yet been spilled and that was a good sign they could get seats only in the sundrenched side of the bowlshaped arena and it was very hot the place smelled of old stone red dust and fight frenzy they were downwind of the redeyed bull currently facing a railthin matador can you tell me why the hell were here russell said to tori as the three of them settled onto the backless bench when ariel and i were in the tunnels she said we overheard a fragment of conversation between the two japanese yakuza this was before they discovered we were there they had just finished killing a man named rega who had seemed to be their local contact it occurred to me after the briefing you gave me that this would be a good place to start who was rega thats why i called estilo russell glanced over at the silverhaired man who is he estilo is a friend of mine tori said thats all you need to know it most assuredly is not russell said he hasnt been vetted they arent under discipline i dont know him from a hole in the wall but i do tori im warning you russell said if this mission deteriorates into another one of your personal go home russ tori said disgustedly i was wrong you dont belong out here go back to your desk in virginia and let me do my job the bull made a run at the matador who turned a magnificent veronica three inches from the beasts left horn i m here for the duration russell said grimly youre not running me out of here but this person estilo saved your life and mine back there on the road to the airport tori glared at him if you thought for a moment youd see that that was a far better test of his loyalty than any of your electronic vetting machines a roar went up from the crowd as the bull made another run at the matador who this time stuck a lance into the powerful muscles of its neck this is barbaric russell said like something from the dark ages its the art of death senor slade estilo said beauty and death is what medellin is known for there is no violence here in the corrida only grace and an honorable way to die this is why the people come this is what captures their fancy russell shook his head i dont understand estilo told me who rega was tori said continuing their conversation a paisa runner who worked for one of the machinegun city drug cartels these are all family run very powerful estilo cant understandand neither do iwhy the japanese yakuza terminated rega the japanese need the real stuff in order to manufacture their supercoke so why cut off their supply it doesnt make sense and until it does we wont be on our way but the corrida we have to find out who rega worked forcruz the most powerful of the medellin family cartels or the calibased orolas their rivals tori said well start with cruz because he was the one who sent the four sicarios after us weve got to talk to him and this is where he is she pointed to a fat man sitting in the section of the arena almost directly across from them in the border between sun and shade he was surrounded by sicarios wielding shotguns next to him was a beautiful woman with heavylidded eyes who kept checking her makeup in a compact mirror estilo turned to tori and indicating the woman next to cruz said medellin may turn out the most deadly men but cali where cruzs woman sonia was born creates the most beautiful women dont you agree it is said that when cruz has that caliborn body beneath him he thinks only of his enemies the orolas considering whats happened russell said i dont think this cruz wants anything to do with us sure he does tori said watching cruz and his party he just doesnt know it yet below them in the corrida the bulls energy was finally nagging it ran at the matador but its head was lowered and in triumph the thin man slid his blade as delicately and precisely as a surgeon just behind the back of the exhausted beasts skull piercing its heart the bulls eyes rolled its forelegs collapsed and it went down the crowd was on its feet screaming in delight and appreciation flowers rained down upon the matador who pirouetted slowly hands to the cloudless sky during this tumult tori kept her eyes on cruzs woman there was something odd about the way she kept looking in her mirror now she adjusted herself a little and tori saw a flash of reflected light a spotlight brighter even than the sun that illuminated the face of a darkskinned man tori leaned over spoke briefly in estilos ear russell could see estilo look in the direction tori indicated he nodded said something to tori that russell couldnt make out the two of them got up stay here tori said to russell but youll be all right as long as you dont move her eyes fixed his do you understand me russell nodded unhappily it was perfectly clear he was a gringo in the middle of a hostile environment he needed the lowest possible profile tori and estilo made their way laterally across the tiers of cheering aficionados the man who cruzs woman had been looking at had left his seat tori knew there was a need to hurry the noise was perfect cover but they could not afford to divert attention to themselves how do you want to do this estilo asked you go up behind him tori said ill try to get between him and cruz estilo nodded and the two of them split up estilo made his way up the tiers higher and higher working through the throng which was still on its feet applauding the beautiful death of the bull tori was now near enough to the darkskinned man to see the death stare in his eyes it was a look she knew well the mark of pure concentration when the environment narrows down to one focus point the kill in this case the victim was cruz estilo had identified the darkskinned man as a member of the orola drug clan cruzs bitter rival the orolas were from cali and estilo knew them all the darkskinned man was coming not with a shotgun or a mac machine pistol but with a smallcaliber handgun it was a suicide mission for sure but it was the kind of surgical strike the orolas preferred it was the medellin sicarios who loved to blow away half a city block to get their job done moreover there was an elegant sense of irony at work here executing cruz at the corrida in the tumultuous moment after the kill that was typical of the orola mind tori admired the strategy even as she worked herself into place to foil it she was very near the darkskinned man now and she stood still contracting her wa allowing his concentrated energies to pass over her he was aware of nothing but his target cruz he need not even concern himself with cruzs bodyguards who in any case were trained to look for weaponry because he did not have to think about an escape there was no escape the crowd was chanting roaring surging as the matador ceremoniously withdrew his blade from the heart of the beast a single line of blood ran down his sword tori waited until the darkskinned man drew his gun he raised it aiming at cruzs heart with a great kiai shout tori lunged forward the hardened underedge of her hand snapping the bone in the darkskinned mans extended forearm she was aware of cruz turning in a defensive crouch the contraction of the circle of his bodyguards their shotguns swinging down in concert screams from the crowd the beginnings of a core of panic from those bystanders nearest the incident there was no reason for haste now tori twisted the gun from the darkskinned mans trembling hand held him up as his legs gave way beneath him his head fell loosely in shock as she saw the vulnerable spot at the back of his head she thought of the bull lying in its own blood in the red dust of the corrida below her in this she thought estilo is wrong there can be no beauty no artistry in this death is its own realm it is finite and when it comes it comes finis cruz was shouting to his bodyguards and they nimbly stepped around the fleeing people all of them were focused on her cruz moved along the are of the tier to where tori stood holding the darkskinned man when she judged cruz close enough tori grabbed a handful of the darkskinned mans hair jerked his head up so cruz could see his face do you know this man cruz asked her in a voice made hoarse by the proximity to death and by his innate suspicion he is from cali tori said he was to be a gift from the orolas a final gift it would seem cruz said taking the gun from her he examined it then looked full into toris face he had to get close to use this he wasnt going to get out was he not today cruz put the muzzle of the mans gun against the back of his head and pulled the trigger not any day he said cruz lived in an enormous suite on the top floor of the monaco building a glitzy apartment dwelling in el poblado medellins choicest district his men patrolled the surrounding block and there were two guards armed with shotguns in the hallway of his apartment inside the living room was lined with bear and leopard skins flemish tapestries and his lieutenantsmore sicarios because he had summarily executed the orola assassin without first interrogating him tori had lowered her estimation of cruz but it would have meant a loss of face in front of all those paisas had he not killed the man immediately and his business would no doubt have suffered as a consequence he was not a badlooking sort though he was flatfaced his black hair came down in a widows peak he wore it slicked back very long against his neck but he scowled a great deal he had an overactive trigger finger and he was much feared in and around machinegun city certainly the orolas found him something more than a nuisance just about three months ago he and ten of his sicarios had ambushed the youngest of the orola brothers at the el cerrito tollbooth he had been making inquiries of cruzs contacts with the bolivian cocalerosthe coca farmers who grew the plant from which cocaine was ultimately refined cruz had not taken kindly to what he had seen as an act of war and he had retaliated in the only true language he spoke the fiveminute hail of bullets fired from the massed macs of cruzs sicarios had taken out not only their target but his three bodyguards a dozen human mules moving one hundred kilos of raw cocaine and four bystanders not to mention taking the concrete and tin tollbooth apart at the seams cruz had bragged about the kill for weeks afterward this was not the first attempt on my life made by the orolas cruz said as they seated themselves in his enormous living room but they are incompetent they do not know how to refine the art of killing he was bragging again but what the hell tori thought he was safe in the center of his own turf with the scalp of another of his enemies fresh on his fingers he was entitled tori made the introductions and cruz listened politely but she thought a bit disinterestedly she was prepared to do something about that but only at the right moment do you know what this country would be without me and the people like me cruz said fucked he laughed ask the economists if you doubt me the colombian economy is so fragile like the glass of one of my ming vases without cocaine trafficking to prop it up our country would be plunged into a recession so severe i fear there would be no end no no on second thought dont ask the economists theyre a bunch of maricones ask the people of colombia they will tell you the truth they do not want this internal war the president has pushed on the country they are sick of their government and i am sick of planting bombs in post offices and government buildings in my opinion the government of colombia is dead his selfpromotion was like a cheap perfume tori thought making everything around it reek she already felt contaminated by his braggadocio cruzs woman sonia was servilely making the rounds getting drinks for everyone tori thought she looked a little pale beneath her rich tan tori sat next to russell on a long sofa covered in pinto horsehide a chinese vaseone of several throughout the roomsat on the center of a lalique crystal cocktail table just in front of her she noticed that the brocade curtains half closed across the windows were lined with metal foil she wondered whether this made them bulletproof as well as soundproof do you know what youre doing russell asked her she said are you good at improvisation russ i hope so cruz grunted so now you are here his tone and manner suggested that this was all she was likely to get from him by way of a thankyou for saving his life an invitation to the great mans sanctuary he gave the impression that he was already bored with their company perhaps he had come to believe that he was immortal that her intervention had been irrelevant or just as likely his absolute power had corrupted him absolutely and he was now nothing more than a pig either way tori decided she was going to shake him this fat man cruz was not so different from others of his ilk she knew what made him tick power and sex in that order but for him as for the others like him sex was not so far away from power and often the two were inextricably entwined sonia was important to him when she ceased to be important cruz would see to it that she disappeared from his life she would be thrown into the gutter and made to stay there but for now he conferred his power upon her like a shadow and she in turn gave to him the aura of her sexuality and this aura of hers had about it a kind of magic like a dice shooter on a roll cruz was convinced he had luck on his side luck in the form of sonia this too made her his showpiece in bed as well as out there in the streets of machinegun city where he cut his deals cut down his enemies where he was king the paisas watched her coming and going and they envied cruz his ability to attract and keep this woman with the sultry eyes cruz was looking pointedly at his watch when estilo rose from the plush sofa and said are you sure its secure in here cruz looked up secure what do you mean by secure i was wondering about the orolas estilo said was that man the only assassin they have in medellin cruz snorted derisively are you crazy he pounded has chest like a gorilla only with a good deal less charm this is my heart my empire extends in all directions from this point the orolas are nothing they have always been nothing they do not have the cojones to worm their way into this building sonia excused herself and a moment later tori did the same quickly she followed sonia through the apartment as sonia closed the door to one of the bathrooms tori stuck her shoe in the doorway shoved the door open and stepped inside jesus the place was as big as a football field there were two of everything including sixfoot whirlpool spas and live palm trees tori could not tell whether there was more marble or mirror she locked the door behind her watched carefully the play of emotions on sonias face your days are numbered here she said to sonia any fortuneteller would tell you that in fact one already has sonia said with surprising candor her face was white when she told me sonia waited a minute trying and failing to get the measure of tori did cruz send you she seemed unafraid almost defiant tori laughed madre de dios no but youre a friend of his i want something from him thats not the same thing almost sonia said but no not quite her shoulders slumped a little as if she had been maintaining a pose youre just another business associate here to cut a deal maybe tori said but if i do it wont be with cruz she put her back against the door whose mistress are you she said it so abruptly and in such a different tone of voice that sonia started which one of the orola brothers do you sleep with you must be crazy tori said theres someone in here whos crazy but it isnt me i saw you signaling the orola assassin at the corrida what do you think youre doing this isnt a game of course it isnt sonia hissed her handsome face was twisted into a mask of hate the man who cruz murdered at el cerrito ruben orola was my lover when his brothers told me what i had to do i didnt think twice why should i what is left of my life nothing nothing but revenge i have a purpose now what kind of purpose tori took sonia by the shoulders faced her toward the mirror look at yourself youre a walking talking automaton nothing more sonia licked her lips i appear just as cruz wants me to appear the man is crazy so are a lot of people you dont understand this man is insane all the cartel heads are there is something in the air here or maybe its a byproduct of the power they lust after with their very hearts cruz is dangerousas much to me as he is to you when maniacs move you get out of the way period then you have to find some way to immobilize him sonia stared at tori in the mirror the moment cruz is dead i will put a gun to my head and pull the trigger tori spun her around is that so is your life worth as little as that punk assassin cruz killed as casually as a fly then why havent you killed cruz yet how many opportunities have you had lying beside him while he sleeps at night after we have made love when i hear his snores when i see the rhythmic rise and fall of his belly even then i am afraid to move his power paralyzes me his wealth surrounds me like a prison she shrugged but i dont expect you to understand what i am telling you but tori did understand better than sonia could ever imagine there must be a way for you to break his power you know nothing sonia said cruz is already dead he just doesnt know it yet but it is the manner of his death that is of importance to rubens brothers a public execution tori said like today why did you stop it youre no friend of cruzs he has information i must have tori said after i get what i want the war can resume i am not involved sonia gave her a cold smile but you are involved it is not a matter of choice wars are enormous things unwieldy difficult to stop you have gotten in the way now you and your friends are part of it when tori said nothing sonia continued tell me what you want from cruz and i will ensure you get it but in return you and your friends must help me kill him why should i bother this is your vendetta not mine tori said i can get what i want from cruz just by turning you in knowing you work for the orolas will shake him to his core hell be so grateful hell give me anything i want then you dont know cruz sonia took out a marlboro cigarette but did not light it she studied toris face much as a fencer will study her adversary before they put on their masks he takes but he does not give unless proper payment is presented youll get nothing from him she shrugged placed the marlboro on the vanity top slit it neatly open besides i am not the only plant the orolas have here one of cruzs lieutenants jorge works for them as well the orolas are freer with their money than cruz is jorge does not know about me but i know about him estilo was right tori thought there is no loyalty here but to money she said why should i care about you or the orolas you owe me sonia said you destroyed something that was mine cruzs death now you are obliged to recreate it for the first time her face held a measure of doubt and tori understood just how important her revenge was to her it might destroy her in the end but it was the only thing she could call her own she had already given up on herself sonia produced a sheet of rolling paper transferred the tobacco into it to it she added what tori recognized as cocaine base she rolled the mixture in the paper sealed it then she lit up inhaling the smoke deep into her lungs in a moment her brown eyes went opaque the pupils expanding tori wanted to help her to reach out and show her that she sonia still existed independent of cruz the orolas even the ghost of her lover ruben but she could see that it was useless she had no illusions that sonia was a good woman trapped in a bad situation at the moment sonia had agreed to the orolas plan she had sold her soul to the devil there was no turning back now and tori recognized that all she could do for this woman was to make her journey as painless as possible tori wondered to what degree she could trust anyone here for trust one needed people but there were none here only soulless husks driven by greed lust vengeance the sins of the damned the cocaineimpregnated smoke filled the room making her slightly sick to her stomach the stink of corruption was everywhere in flower all right tori nodded but the tiny hairs at the back of her neck were stirring this mission had become a twoedged sword as perilous a situation as was possible she might be helping out a woman in distress but she knew that she had also just made a deal with a demon you two girls have a good time in there cruz laughed what is it you do together men dont want to see each others pricks so what is it you girls want to see he was being deliberately crude baiting them still feeling good after the kill blood did that to some men actually tori said sonia discussed something important in there yeah the contempt was plain on his face what could that be the name of a more effective douche cruz guffawed and his lieutenants grinned like trained animals tori stood in front of him said sonia saw one of your trusted lieutenants signal the orola assassin at the corrida what youre a liar he yelled this with such vehemence that sonia jumped why didnt you say this to me right away she didnt really understand what she saw tori said intervening but when i began to question her it came out this is impossible cruz shouted on the contrary tori said thats how the assassin was able to get so close to you close enough to use the handgun cruz said nothing think its the only way the assassination attempt makes sense tori said the orolas have someone inside your organization cruz whirled on tori nevertheless he said with a great deal of menace why should i trust you besides the fact that i saved your life at the corrida i cant think of a single reason cruz leered at her perhaps you saved me for a reason eh chica he rubbed his thumb and forefinger together that makes no difference tori pointed out youve still got a lieutenant on the orola payroll so you say tori made a show of considering his challenge she said i think i have a way of proving to you that we can help you further she nodded toward russell senor slade here is our resident expert in moles in what cruz asked moles russell repeated enemy agents placed within your cartel ah yes burrowing underground cruz said i see he scowled at russell what do you do russell remembered what tori had said to him are you good at improvisation i hope so i find moles he said he got off the couch passed by each of cruzs lieutenants in turn he looked them straight in the eye some looked back curiously others were overtly hostile no one looked away cruz came over beside russell this is interesting he said tori said i will whisper to you the name of the lieutenant sonia saw signal the orola hit man at the bull ring without knowing what i have said senor slade will find your mole is that so cruz grunted tell me senor slade what do you do when you find these moles russell felt an overwhelming desire to look at tori but instinctively knew that even making eye contact with her now would make the paranoid cruz suspect they were working some kind of scam on him his mind was racing there was a soviet agent i interrogated him until he dropped that took nearly thirty straight hours but in the end the mole broke and gave us everything we wanted to know like what cruz said suspiciously like everything he knew about the operations of his own organization cruz shrugged i already know much of what is happening inside the orola cartel but it would be beneficial to know everything now it was cruz who was parading in front of his lieutenants scowling fingering an enormous hunting knife and just how did you discover this mole senor slade not any one thing russell said but many tiny mistakes they build up especially during an interrogation there are signs i am trained to see cruz nodded it is now almost four months since i executed ruben orola since then his brothers have tried three times to kill me the last one being today he turned to russell therefore i need you the mole hunter to track mine down for me here now tori stood beside cruz whispered in his ear russell went down me line of cruzs lieutenants he hadnt the slightest idea what to look for but he found it peculiarly exciting to pretend this expertise moment by moment he could feel the power slipping into his hands just as he could feel the tension and anxiety mounting as he spoke to each lieutenant in turn watched the cast of his eye the tic of a facial muscle the thin sheen of sweat on upper lip or forehead he came at length to the last lieutenant and knew that he would soon have to give cruz a name further it had to be the same name that tori had whispered in cruzs ear how was he to do that russell stood at an angle to the last lieutenant ostensibly to observe him better but at the same time he could now see tori out of the corner of his eye russell saw her left hand down by her side then he saw it move marginally her forefinger and middle fingers were extended the others curled into her palm like a baseball catcher calling for a curveball russell thought the second lieutenant russell completed his interrogation moved back up the line until he was behind the second lieutenant this is the mole he said without hesitation jorge tori said you see lavaperro dogwasher cruz screamed and grabbing the man both tori and russell had indicted slammed him back against the wall jorge was babbling his innocence but cruz was clearly not listening cocaine whether as an addiction or a product in which to traffic bred paranoia knife cruz said holding out his hand another lieutenant stepped forward slipped him a us marine kabar cruz took it slashed the blade laterally across jorges throat while the blood gushed onto him cruz pried open jorges jaws cut out his tongue the body slid to the floor cruz held up the tongue like a trophy tori could see that he felt like the matador in the corrida as he withdrew the killing sword from the bulls heart he said send this to the orolas and make sure you pack it good in dry ice i want them to get it fresh like at the best restaurant he erupted in a savage laugh im only sorry i wont be there to see their faces when they get it he turned to estilo you feel more secure now he had begun to strut again his old bravado returning he turned to russell and grinned i am grateful for your assistance what would you consider proper payment money cocaine a boat helicopter a plane perhaps this is medellin gringo nothing is impossible here his grin widened you are about to learn senor slade that here in machinegun city our shopping malls are open twentyfour hours a day and the price is always right we want none of these things russell said though we are grateful for the offer we need instead some information oh cruzs expression showed that he was not pleased with the sudden turn in the conversation what kind of information i am not an informer i dont deal information before his face darkened too much sonia stepped between the two men she stood very close to cruz and reaching between her breasts she drew out a stone on a gold chain she took his hand gently in hers squeezed it into a fist around the stone listen to me zo she said these people are lucky for us i can feel it can you feel it too now the stench of the orolas is gone and the sour taste of business since you sent rega to buenos aires since he was murdered is about to end these people are a sign of that change can you feel it o feel it now the rich taste of money is coming coming back tori who was the only one close enough to cruz and sonia to hear this exchange was both fascinated and repelled the tone of sonias voice the look in her eyes as they searched his was so intimate so blatantly sexual that tori could almost imagine they were making love right here in front of everyone but now she had one piece of the puzzle rega had been working for cruz then why did the yakuza kill him what had one of them said his use was at an end when the orolas killed rega cruz said the war began in earnest and war is profitable only for the armament suppliers cruz tori said the orolas did not kill rega he scowled at her what could you know of it i ran into regas killers in buenos aires in fact they almost killed me as well they were japanese gangsters japanese cruz laughed in her face then his scowl got deeper are you trying to make a fool of me im sure she isnt sonia said keeping his hand around her amulet think rega had a rich source a buyer flooding us with money thats why you sent hima lieutenant not a muleto buenos aires shes telling the truth corazon dont you see how it makes sense but the japanese cruz said why would they want so much coke thats what weve come here to find out tori said you see razo sonia said excitedly to cruz they are good luck for you russell said the question now is to find out why the japanese killed rega he was their connection cruz considered this only two answers are possible he said one they dont need supply anymore two they found a better connection they still need the cocaine russell said were certain of that could the orolas be giving the japanese a better deal tori asked all that product cruz shook his head id know about it right away if they have a new connection its not the cali cartel then who russell asked cruz shrugged it may be nothing you know how rumors are especially here but over the last several months there has been talk of a major new cocaine factory establishing itself in the llanos of meta province east of here just past the manacacias river its very wild there difficult to track even rumors like i said we had all dismissed the stories whose territory is that russell asked cruz shrugged not orolas not mine the colombian army is in and out of there all the time so is the das he meant the colombian department of administrative security charged with keeping the cartels and the shipments from the bolivian cocaleros under control they do a shit job but they can be dangerous nonetheless nomansland estilo said llano negro black jungle cruz nodded a land of only shadows one of the stories more persistent than most says that the army and the das patrol this area not to find this factory but to protect it he shrugged again but these rumors have a way of growing out of all proportion there is no way to tell the truth from the fiction but of course there was one way tori russell estilo and sonia all looked at one another without saying a word they had communicated everything they needed to know it was to this llano negro they would have to go to find the beginning of the bizarre yakuza cocaine trail less than twentyfour hours later the three of them were lifting off from machinegun city in one of cruzs bell jetranger iii helicopters just before they left sonia took tori aside without anyone seeing and said remember your promise to me you must help me destroy cruz i wont forget tori said when we get back when you get back sonia nodded sonia said something else but the wind was already in toris ears was it her imagination or did sonia have a doubtful look on her face they were all dressed in tropical paramilitary camouflage suits among the armament each carried was a machete a marine kabar knife a handgun and an uzi machine pistol with three extra loads it was dark inside the helicopter and the heavy vibrations penetrated to their bones russell was up front quizzing cruzs pilot who was set to pick them up twentyfour hours after he set them down if they didnt make the first rendezvous hed return the same time the day after estilo was stretched out asleep on the bench on the opposite side of the cabin tori put her head back against cold steel and closed her eyes dont look so worried senor slade estilo said some hours later we argentines have a saying when satan tries to walk on ice he falls on his face ice is not his milieu who is he kidding tori thought as the jetranger set them down in a minuscule clearing in the llanos of meta province she had a clear sense of foreboding llano negro the black jungle where only shadows dwelled where maybe the good guys rode shotgun for the bad guys she thought this territory isnt controlled by cruz or by the orolas so who does it belong to four moscow tokyo mars called irina at work and asked her to go to no gastronome on gorky street during her lunch hour to pick up some provisions for his parents which he planned to take to them on the following saturday he was in meetings all day could not go himself and he was afraid if he waited until tomorrow the fresh sturgeon would all be gone irina readily agreed she loved gorky street with its rush of sumptuously dressed tourists its myriad shops and huge hotels but she loved no gastronome most of all she felt like a child in a storybook allowed to wander through a wonderland of magical displays food stuffs from all over the soviet union as well as from foreign lands were stacked on shelves and behind glass cases there were always lines here but irina never minded standing in them because it gave her more time to soak up the atmosphere as mars had asked she purchased fresh smoked sturgeon several tins of caviar and on impulse a halfpound of smoked salmon all the way from nova scotia it was an extravagant purchase but she thought the exotic salmon would make mars happy afterward she strolled down gorky street in the wan sunshine happy merely to be out of her dim cramped office and in the fresh air of course one had to discount the traffic fumes but like all city dwellers irina was barely aware of the clouds of exhaust she was perhaps fifty yards from the druzhba bookstore when she saw valeri emerge from the entrance she raised her arm about to call out to him but he had already turned away irina hurried after him excited to extend her lunch hour anything to keep her from returning to her stultifying job she followed him up gorky street past no gastronome through the soviet square with its monument to prince dolgoruky moscows founder a few streets on he turned left disappeared into a small building with a green facade the old moscow arts theater where years ago stanislavsky had taught the method to soviet actors and thereby changed the face of modern theater forever chekhovs three sisters was playing and photos of the actors were posted just above the schedule of times irina went inside the interior was cool musty filled with hushed voices but she saw no one the lobby deserted she pushed through the door into the theater proper on stage a series of spotlights shone down on actors rehearsing a scene irina looked around saw valeri sitting near the back of the semidark theater she took two steps toward him then froze there was a stunning woman with him she had blond hair blue eyes and a nose irina would have killed for irina recognized her as one of the stars of the current production natasha mayakova irina could not move hearing in her mind valeri saying to her the joke is that it is you irina who has seduced me do you think that you are the latest in a long line of conquests for me no but what was she thinking of course this must be a business meeting or a visit with a friend but in the back of her mind a perverse voice kept saying no no no hes lied to you it is something else not business not friendship it is an assignation they were sitting very close their heads together she could hear valeri saying time is difficult to come by but not for you koshka and natasha mayakovas answering silvery laughter he called her koshka darling irina wanted to turn away to run but she could not she felt like someone watching an accident unable to avert her gaze caught by a perverse fascination observing their intimacy an outsider and all the while valeris lie felt like a slap across her face it was not until she was back in her office surrounded by the drudgery of her work that she realized how angry she was with valeri but why should i expect anything different from him she thought he lives a life unlike mine his coinage is intimidation coercion and deceit but this bit of psychological illumination failed to make her feel any better in fact it unaccountably depressed her all the more she tried to throw herself into her work for the rest of the afternoon but it was useless she was finished for the day nova scotia salmon mars exclaimed what a treat he impulsively gave her a kiss i should save this for my folks but it looks so scrumptious why dont you and i pull apart some black bread and dig in they were in the kitchen of marss apartment the lights were on although it was only just twilight outside you go ahead irina said without much enthusiasm im not feeling hungry but of course you must be hungry mars said taking down some plates from his cupboard its after eight and if i know number one gastronome the lines must have prevented you from having time for a proper lunch actually they werent so bad irina said i had time to get these mars took the small envelope from her opened it tickets to three sisters he grinned well you certainly are full of surprises tonight you dont know the half of it irina thought unhappily mars put the tickets down but why so sad irina did you have a bad day at the office no no dont tell me if you dont want to i know you like your privacy but come i see dinner at home holds no interest for you lets go out this was marss solution to all things eat be with people get drunk feel life in all its diversity flow like a powerful stream all around you until it began to seep through you then into you until the roof of your despair was made leaky and whether you liked it or not life began again to wash over you he took her to a tiny georgian restaurant he had discovered where they were happy to serve him even when it was near to nine at night and other larger restaurants had stopped serving hot meals it was a boisterous place filled with good smells the combined heat of the nearby kitchen and its cheery denizens they ate chicken tabaka drank pepper vodka and most important mars kept her talking tell me about your family he said what was your home life like lousy irina said my father was a secret drunkard you know weekends days off but he never missed a days work hes been dead now a long time he worked in nuclear engineering but he never brought his work home never talked about it i suspect he drank because he had watched his parents die in the siberian winter and i think he could never forgive himself for what for living when they had died he took the coat off his mothers body the shoes off his fathers feet he remembered the feet so clearly he said they were blue bloated and cold as ice it took him a half hour to get the shoes off he told me once that those items of clothing saved him from freezing to death but they couldnt stop him from remembering he was eleven years old when that happened poor fellow mars said but he had his whole life ahead of him i think a part of him died on the siberian ice fields with his parents irina said he was to be pitied then irina tried not to think she could hear a voice calling she knew what it was saying but she didnt want to listen kgb keep calm the siberian winter bars across the moon her country a prison hes dead perhaps it all would have been different if my brother yvgeny hadnt died irina said not believing a word of it and despising herself for dissembling he was killed not so far from here on the bank of the moskva on a cold clear night a night of the full moon he had fallen in with criminals and he was selling well i dont know what contraband of some kind surely he was knifed but whether by a potential customer or by a rival we never found out considering what my brother was up to the police were understandably resistant to spending manhours tracking down his killer frankly they just didnt care i got the impression they were glad he was dead and the family our family was so fragile anyway the relationships so close to cracking my father had already been dead for many years i think now that it wouldnt have taken much at all to send us spiraling down but his yvgenys murder was like a detonation in our kitchen our place of warmth and sustenance the place i remember my mother always being until the police brought us the news she disintegrated she ran out into the night without a coat or a care for herself she beat her breast tore her hair and on the spot where they had found yvgeny sprawled with the knife still between his ribs she wailed for her son i remember dragging her away from there she was hysterical screaming invectives i never suspected she knew i think she tried to bite me at that moment i dont believe she knew who i was mars allowed a silence to close over them the boisterous sounds of the restaurant seemed abruptly at odds with their own tiny world and irina found herself wanting to scream shut up shut up why are you all so happy at last mars said is she still alive only after a fashion irina said im sorry he took her hand stroked it with his thumb but words are so inadequate sometimes arent they irina looked into his eyes aware of some subtle difference it was like walking into a garden one had known all ones life and finding that one rock had been shifted ever so slightly but that this alteration had in some magical way transformed the aspect of the entire garden she said sometimes nothing more is needed than being there something had changed in her relationship with mars but what was it the following saturday mars asked her to go with him to visit his parents irina agreed although she did not really know why she suspected that she would be bored as it turned out she was wrong marss parents lived in a beautiful old creamcolored house on bolshaya ordynka street its front was shaded with lime trees it was quite near the yearold church of st nicholas of pyzhi whose architecture was so eastern baroque it reminded irina of a wedding cake marss mother and father were wonderful people warm and full of love for one another irina watched them covertly almost shyly and although they looked at each other or touched only rarely they seemed always aware of one anothers presence they loved the special foods she and mars had brought and mars went out of his way to say that the nova scotia salmon was a special gift from irina herself irina helped marss mother in the kitchen and found that they had an easy and almost instantaneous rapport that stemmed from cooking they shared suggestions then little secrets they had learned they laughed together near to dinnertime marss sister and her family arrived she looked like mars and was very beautiful but she seemed shy and when irina at length arranged to talk with her confessed to being unhappy with her thickwaisted heavylegged body i am just what the american magazines portray russian women to be like she said with a sigh her childrentwo boys and a girlwere wellbehaved and they obviously adored their grandfather who played games with them and loved tricking them then telling them how he did so often there were gales of laughter the childrens father marss brotherinlaw worked as an architect mostly he said he drew up plans for concrete housing developments which irina privately thought must be the height of boredom like driving a bus back and forth along the same route all day long he was an altogether ordinarylooking fellow whose face was transformed when he watched his children gradually as the afternoon turned into evening and as the evening became night irina found herself sinking into the warmth and homeyness of this familys life with the kind of bliss one feels when lying back on an eiderdown pillow for the first time in quite a while she found herself relaxed and then with an electric tingle she knew there was more to it than that she was content at that moment irina looked across the room at mars petrovich volkov in an entirely different light so what that the physical part of our relationship doesnt quite connect she thought he has so much more to give me he can share with me what ive always wanted with him i can be part of a family kasumigaseki the downtown tokyo district where honno worked meant shrouded gate big ezoe was familiar with kasumigaseki though not in the ways honno was he showed her places within the district she otherwise would never have guessed existed being in kasumigaseki was the equivalent of living underwater the lightwhat there was of it seeping through the steel and glass skyscrapershad that aqueous quality that skin divers know well and which can be approximated by peering through the bottom of a green glass bottle big ezoe had said kakuei sakata was a samurai so you and i must begin to think like samurai if we cannot put ourselves in sakatas mind we will never solve me riddle he has left you big ezoe had turned the key sakata had sent to honno over and over in his hand a businessman would have a safety deposit box in a bank a yakuza would have a lock box buried beneath the tatami in his bedroom what would a samurai have to keep his most valuable possessions safe honno had looked at him i dont know big ezoe had grinned at her but i think i do and so he had led her back to the heart of the metropolis to kasumigaseki the shrouded gate they were consumed by modern tokyo there was industrial grit beneath the soles of their shoes the exhaust of a half a million engines in their nostrils a smog of pollutants in their eyes and of course the dense night was dispelled by the nearby spin and sputter of gigantic neon signs running up the sides of buildings adorning entryways large enough to accommodate a conquering army squatting atop steel superstructures but hidden away on a side street dwarfed by the steel and glass monuments to the nations burgeoning economic success was a remnant of another older way of life when simple traditions not economic imperatives ruled japan this is where kakuei sakata came when he needed to be alone to contemplate or to invoke the kami of his world big ezoe said indicating the wood and lacquer shinto shrine he reached out pulled a cord and the clang of the bronze bell reverberated through the manmade canyons wake up spirits who inhabit the woods and the streams big ezoe laughed i wonder if there are modern kami spirits who live atop steel girders and neon signs that say sony who ride highspeed elevators to the hundredth floor his face crinkled i wonder if kami get acrophobia honno was not amused how can you be so disrespectful i suppose it comes naturally to me big ezoe said but honno did not know if he was serious or if this was just another of his endless jokes joking was alien to honno like being waited upon or having eikichi remember where she put his socks or where she kept the sugar nonsense she said when you were born you cried ate evacuated and slept these things were natural everything else you learned quite possibly big ezoe said with some amusement but then it would have been my granny who taught me to laugh at the world she raised me you see she liked to make fun of the world she said because it was such a somber place she otherwise would have committed harakiri long ago thats just what i mean honno said angrily im sure your granny harbored no such crazy notions well i think she did big ezoe replied and im in a better position than you to know it besides what makes you think laughing at the world is a crazy notion its either crazy or its wrong honno said no wonder you became a gangster big ezoe grunted i dont think one becomes anything least of all a gangster my family is yakuza that is what i am no honno said you say that as if you had no choice but you did its perfectly clear why you became a gangster youre in love with the life perhaps i am he said thoughtfully but thats more than can be said for you at least im in love with something i love my husband honno said immediately that birdbrain big ezoe laughed what is there to love in a drone like that i dont think its any of your business what do you know of eikichis world anyway more than you could imagine big ezoe looked up past the shinto shrines roof to the towering structures of kasumigaseki i know youre reluctant to talk to me any more than you feel you have to but im curious what do you see in eikichi kansei that attracts you honno did not want to answer him but she felt duty bound to defend her husband in the face of this mobsters insults there is great honor honno said also he needs me and there is a solidness about him that makes me feel secure security ah now we come to the heart of the matter by security dont you really mean submission isnt there after all a secret pleasure to be had in submitting to power to giving up ones free will just as there is surely a similar pleasure in the sacrifices a mother makes for the sake of her child big ezoe almost seemed to be talking to himself eikichi makes you feel secure no doubt because of his strict adherence to rules and regulations at home he barely talks to you when he wants you he calls oi hey he is your child you see big ezoe was still looking upward so he needs you yes he needs you to make his food for him to lay out his clothes in the morning and you are as we know a working woman how early do you have to get up honno to make sure your husbands needs are met it isnt like that honno protested oh how is it then tell me you are so good with words honno was so enraged she could hardly speak you twist them turn them inside out so they suit your purpose i am not that skilled he said are you familiar with the hagakure the book of hidden leaves yes then you may recall a key passage that tells of the clever samurai when he gathers sufficient experience he discovers much to his dismay that all the complex rules and regulations of society by which he has so scrupulously lived his life are nothing more than meaningless illusion the hagakure further counsels the samurai to hold his tongue once the truth is made manifest to him so that he will not prematurely reveal it to those younger and more ignorant than himself honno said nothing for a time her cheeks were unaccountably hot with shame how she despised big ezoe at this moment more than she ever could have imagined at last she recovered sufficiently to say how is it you know where sakatasan worshiped big ezoe contemplated her for some time you know mrs kansei you must learn to lighten your spirit burdens such as you evidently carry become insupportable over time he moved inside the wooden roof of the tiny shrine the answer to your question is a simple one i have many friends even more contacts more than one of them is a samurai no doubt sakata was seen here on a number of his midday pilgrimages is there anything you dont know honno asked sure big ezoe said taking the key from her what sakata was hiding with some difficulty he bent down lifted up the cloth draped over the center of the shrine he slid the key into the lock of a small door cut in the wooden side inside he found two books that looked like ledgers he handed them to honno who opened one leafed through the pages which were covered by a tight handdrawn scrawl the second ledger revealed the same the writing was not kanji or any other with which honno was familiar what is this honno asked big ezoe looking over her shoulder said im not sure but if i had to hazard a guess i d say it was some kind of code great honno said what am i supposed to do with these books i dont even know what they contain it was then she thought of giin and everything fell into place honno had met giin almost ten years ago before she had known that eikichi kansei existed at that time giin was highly placed in a ministry she was never quite sure which she was meant to have married giin she would have except for the fact that he like her father was an inveterate gambler she had been so young then still so full of mixed emotions about her father his death last year had changed that of course noborus memory was purer than noboru had been in life all the contradictory emotions honno felt for her father were swept away to be replaced by the overriding virtue of filial piety hinoeuma woman or not she was her fathers daughter but the one thing she would not do was to give her love to another man who gambled a man who more than anything else reminded honno of her father while it was true that giin was far more intelligent than noboru yamato ever had beenin fact he was a genius of sortsthere were other more telling traits they shared they both had obsessive personalities they were tyrants in their professional lives and they had an underlying weakness they loved to gamble in fact they couldnt stop it was an axiom of their personalities obsessive domineering certain they were always right and oddly their mounting losses did not disabuse them of their vanity quite the opposite they could not believe their losses would not recognize the danger as those losses mounted precipitously they were focused on only one thing their passion to win because winning was essential to their personalities they could not survive without it indeed noboru yamato had not survived his obsession but giin had just barely honno had heard that he was no longer in the public sector but whether that had been his choice or his masters she did not know he had been a roninan exminister looking for work in the private sectorfor some time before he had found a job that suited him he had become a professor of philosophy at a tokyo university which was either laughable or pathetic depending on your point of view he would have been the least flexible person honno had ever knownexcept for her father and considering that philosophy was a continual bending of thought tenet and ideologya living dialectic with the universe as it werehonno considered it odd that giin should end up teaching philosophy she insisted on seeing him alone although big ezoe wanted to come with her privately she would have been appalled to face giin for the first time in ten years with a yakuza oyabun at her side she met him in his office late in the day after his last class had ended as his secretary announced her honno felt a hollowness in the pit of her stomach the fluttering almost humiliating sense of being brought before a judge as if the first thing giin might say to her was well my dear what have you done with your life since you left me in fact he said nothing he was grading test papers when she was shown into his office it was no more than a cubicle really windowless almost airless it was jammed with books papers bound galleys gigantic reference works giin sat behind an anonymous desk he wore an anonymous dark suit his gray hair neatly parted his round wire spectacles shining in the glare of the overhead lights he did not look up when she came in and she thought that rude somehow this increased her sense of humiliation but by now honno had concluded that she felt as humiliated for him as she did for herself until this moment she did not appreciate how difficult this interview might be for him she had left him abruptly unforgivably after agreeing to marry him after he had made her an integral part of his life introduced her to his family and his friends and worst of all she had done so without so much as a word of explanation but how could she have told him that she refused to marry an inveterate gambler it would have been too shameful for herself and for him now looking at him in this tiny office grading papers of students who no doubt would never fathom the depths of his genius honno felt her cheeks burning she sat silently to meekly wait out his silence so that he could regain a measure of the face she had robbed him of ten years ago when at last he judged the silence to be of appropriate duration giin said so i understand that you have married are you happy of course i am honno exclaimed and immediately regretted her response that is eikichi kansei is a good husband for me first time giin lifted his head honno could see his eyes behind the lenses of his spectacles he stared directly at her and she seemed to wither so intimidating was his gaze for an instant she even wished crazily that she had allowed big ezoe to come with her but it was only anger and a hurt she knew she had no right to feel so she closed off both these emotions sealing them behind the facade all japanese learn to construct almost from the moment they are born it is good to see you giin she ventured it has been a very long time he said and she tried not to wince a lifetime for some how have you been honno was now dreading his every response giin raised his hands indicating his jammed cubicle this is how i am have you married there was no need to after you left i honnos nerve faltered in the face of his pain and anger what was there to say i am pleased that you have found a life for yourself giin said in a lighter tone you seemed so lost so confused when i knew you i tried to help you with these things but perhaps i did not know how to unlock the riddle of you he smiled and honno was reminded of the man she had once known thats ironic dont you think considering my expertise in solving problems but my work then involved cryptograms codes mathematical formulae complex matters to be sure but nevertheless cut and dried the truth is i was never much good at handling people or understanding them for that matter perhaps thats where we went wrong yes honno said lowering her head perhaps thats why i decided to come here to the university giin said sometime later here i am not only surrounded by people i am forced to interact with them i suppose it was my way of admitting my faults of trying to remake myself when honno said nothing he continued im glad you agreed to have dinner with me i know i was rude to you earlier but it was only my shock and my shame at remembering honno forced herself to look at him ive stopped gambling you see giin said eventually i came to understand how pernicious it was how utterly it had ruined my life it cost me my job some of my friends when i saw what i had been reduced to my first thought was of you and how grateful i was that you had left so that i could not drag you down with me i never would have forgiven myself if that had happened i dont know what to say honno said which was the truth giins abruptand unexpectedconfession had caught her quite by surprise her thoughts were in chaos and her emotions my god she thought the attraction is still there deeply buried but unmistakable she was utterly horrified by this thought but no matter what inner contortions she went through she was unsuccessful in suppressing it i am happily married now she reminded herself it did not seem to matter this was not what she had expected she could see the love in his eyes which he had never let die something unknown inside her was melting youre not required to say anything giin said gently you are only required to sit here so that i can look at you once more for as long as the night will last you did what big ezoe said i gave him the ledgers honno said i cant believe it it was the next evening honno had come to big ezoes warehouse but that was the plan honno said it was what i was supposed to do you were supposed to tell him about the existence of the ledgers see if hed agree to crack the code for us but he did agree honno said and stop shouting at me ill stop shouting big ezoe shouted when we get those ledgers back from him you should have seen giin he was so eager to get back to what he had been doing years ago thats why i gave him the ledgers right away your eyes are shining big ezoe said its disgusting honno laughed you have no right to speak to me that way and why should you care are you envious of what a beatendown old gambler he doesnt gamble anymore honno said somewhat stiffly big ezoes eyes narrowed where did you hear that giin told me himself he confessed big ezoe groaned and you you little lovestruck girl believed him of course i fool dont but you are a fool mrs kansei angry and confused now honno said would you kindly tell me whats going on its simple big ezoe said hes conned you no youre wrong honno said i know giin and i know gamblers they dont change ever they only say they do im afraid mrs kansei when it comes to human nature youve got a lot to learn if youd stop making generalizations honno said youd be far better off big ezoe shook his head i see you need to be convinced he said do you know where he lives and when honno nodded he ordered take me there now right now big ezoe said taking her arm and guiding her out of his office theres no answer honno said ringing the bell to giins apartment for the third time he must be out to dinner big ezoe grunted sure he is he extracted a length of metal from his pocket slid it deftly into the lock as he began to manipulate it honno said what are you doing what does it look like big ezoe said turning the knob and opening the door inward as they stepped across the threshold honno said isnt there a law against this sort of thing if there is big ezoe said im not aware of it he closed the door behind them turned on the light honno gasped big ezoe said shit giins apartment was in chaos furniture was upended drawers were thrown here and there their contents strewn around the floor cushions were ripped as were sections of the carpet the mess extended throughout the three rooms of the small apartment in the name of heaven what happened here honno said no giin no ledgers big ezoe said he looked at her theyre both gone honno was horrified now do you see how wrong you were to suspect him someones taken him along with the ledgers dear god what have i gotten him into giin could be hurtor worse her heart constricted there were tears in her eyes as the past for so long held in check echoed through her like a crack of thunder did you enjoy meeting my family mars volkov asked irina i hope you werent bored not in the least she said i adored every minute of it they were standing in the smokefilled lobby of the old moscow arts theater during intermission of chekhovs three sisters irina had recognized natasha mayakova the actress valeri had had the assignation with the moment she came on stage there was something about her makeup that made her seem somehow sinister like the marquise de merteuil the older woman in dangerous liaisons the film irina had smuggled back from america on videocassette irina wanted to burn this natasha mayakova with her eyes although she could not quite understand why she should be so enraged what could valeri bondasenko mean to her now nothing she told herself firmly nevertheless she had been tense all through the first act and when intermission came she embraced it with a profound sense of relief well my parents can be trying at times mars said although i suppose i would be the only one aware of it you look very much like your mother irina said there is a strength about her a sense of her family and of herself that i admire tremendously im afraid ill never get around to the one and im not very good at the other perhaps youre not one to settle down mars said i sense in you a restlessness of spirit they spoke for a time about mundane things the play the production the acting irina mentioned that natasha mayakova had played her namesake in the play wanting perhaps to discover if mars found her attractive but all she got was a noncommittal answer mars made a joke and irina laughed but she was suddenly very uncomfortable in a moment of sheer panic she realized that she had been contemplating blurting out her secret her involvement with valeri seeing him on the street with the actress natasha mayakova her feelings of betrayal what would mars think if he knew she was betraying him in much the same way but of course that was different she had not made any promises to mars nor had she claimed purity she had never lied to him although she had no illusions that sooner or later she would be compelled to do so what she was doing was for herself for irina viktorovna ponomareva or was it had she been doing nothing but rationalizing to herself about her betrayal of mars to valeri because betrayal it was it hadnt bothered her three days ago but that had been before mars had taken her home to his family before she had seen how little valeri thought of his relationship with her before it became clear how thoroughly valeri was using her now she thought everythings changed she looked at mars volkov as if for the first time drawing aside the scrims of her own anger selfishness and power lust what she saw was a very downtoearth man handsome desirable who despite his immense charm had to struggle in the politburo and the peoples congress against the immense power of valeri bondasenko a man who unlike valeri was not obsessed with power with imprinting his conception of the world on everyone around him with power as the only consideration or form of currency one day she thought mars would even be the head of his own family and that would be enough to make him content that idea made her feel warm and comfortable and with that truth came another one it wasnt her own freedom that valeri had offered her when he had enrolled her in his scheme to get inside marss mind but a chance to take on a measure of his valeris own sins chekhov always sets me to thinking irina said not only because it was the truth but because she was determined to cover her unease i suppose thats because his plays are like modern paintings they seem somehow unfinished or at any rate about such familiar themes they require your own participation to flesh them out but it wasnt really chekhov that seemed to interest you mars said it was the actress natasha something isnt it i dont know her name irina lied i was just curious shes a type men often find actresses appealing and i wanted a mans point of view too much makeup mars said as they were called in for the start of the second act i wouldnt know what she really looked like beneath all that paint the blue light from vosstaniya square filtered through the windows of marss bedroom it was deep enough into the night so that the buildings gastronome was closed and the cinema marquee below was dark the sky was low with thick metalliclooking clouds and although it was late spring there was a feeling in the air of snow that was somehow melancholy or perhaps irina thought as she undressed it was the play that has depressed me of course it cant possibly have been the sight of natasha mayakova she had been half hoping to run into valeri at the performance and now she wondered whether that had been her motivation for buying the tickets perhaps stanislavsky would know she thought wryly but he was dead she only knew that visions of her smiling at valeri while she was on marss arm had filled her head all afternoon now that it hadnt happened she felt deflated empty there was a bitter taste in her mouth as if she had somehow taken a bite out of the clouds wreathing moscow and she could not figure out why here she was with mars who could give her everything she ever wantedwell almost everythingand yet her mind was filled with valeri right now the man she wanted was valerishe wanted nothing more than to cleave herself to valeris musky body twine her thighs around his open herself to him she shuddered frightened at the intensity of her emotions it was as if she could no longer control her feelings did she love mars then how could she still be lusting after valeri how could she still be jealous of his relationship with natasha what was happening inside her when she got into this situation she had been certain of who was right and who was wrong she had allowed valeri to coopt her partly because oh he was so right about herhe had made her see that she was more than a drone one worker among many undistinguished unappreciated it was so exciting to feel wanted by such a powerful man as valeri bondasenko and then when he had so cleverly shown her that she could have more that she could share in his power she had been all too eager to do what he asked spy on mars but that was before she had m to know mars before he had begun to share his private life with her now he seemed to be a wholly different person from the one she had set out to seduce now she felt ashamed of how she was betraying mars to valeri and this shame caused her to be in constant turmoil as if she could not relax even for a moment she thought my god im headed for a nervous breakdown and that frightened her even more because then neither mars nor valeri would want her and she would once again become nothing in her utter isolation now she felt as if only sheirina ponomarevawas in the wrong which way should she turn to valeri or to mars god help her she did not know she felt mars behind her what is it with you and windows he said youre like a cat who loves to stare at nothing what is it you see out there that i cannot irina turned around i was just thinking mars searched her face this sounds serious its too late in me night to be serious koshka darling what valeri had called natasha mayakova dont you think that the darkness makes us more serious more melancholy sometimes i dont know mars cocked his head to one side she could see that he was curious about her train of thought i often do my best thinking at night there you see but its the quiet he said the intimation of sleep all around me and when at last you do sleep mars what is it you dream of electronic sheep he said powered by miniature nuclear reactors she could see then that he was making fun of her but gently trying to deflate her seriousness he gathered her into his arms whats gotten into you ever since we went to see chekhov you seem to have picked up his brooding soul is something the matter perhaps i can help id like to help you irina he put his lips close to her ear do you know that my family has disapproved of every woman i have ever brought home everyone except you my whole family loves you irina irina felt a tingling as if his words had galvanized her spirit she found that she was holding her breath she wondered if he could feel the thundering of her heart i care so much for you she felt weak in the knees as if he was saying in real life what she had dreamed about ever since he had taken her home to meet his family a family she thoughtwhat i wouldnt give to have a father a mother who knew and loved me she allowed him to draw her away from the window the kind of precaution against electronic eavesdropping he did without conscious thought he took her down the hall and into the bathroom he turned on the tub taps there was even hot water naked they climbed in together letting the hot water chum around them the background of splashing water had a soothing effect they sat face to face their legs around each other he laughed softly kissed the tip of her nose you see irina i have an overpowering urge to trust you thats a dangerous urge for one in my position in government someone who has such a powerful enemy in valeri denysovich but lately i find i want to tell you things id never dare tell another soul crazy isnt it his lips came down over hers crushing them opening them irina gave a little moan not crazy irina whispered her eyes half closed i think its perfectly normal behavior for a man in love but thats just it mars said for a man like me being in love is the most dangerous state of all why you will become my weak spot irina was aware of valeri telling her that it was just as well he had emerged from his marriage childless because in this terrible world a child could be used against him how similar these two men were she thought but how utterly different when one scratched the surface of their carefully prepared facades both were men who wore masks and masks within masks when they faced the outside world it gave irina a fantastic thrill to have penetrated beyond those masks to see the true inner workings of two of russias most influential men and now one if not born was in love with her she was abruptly suffused with the scope of her own power aware as if for the first time how in control she was how more in control she would be once she unearthed the secrets that surely these men must harbor she was not naive even mars was not a saint their power could not have been acquired without a degree of moral corruption the old irina would have quailed from such a notion but everything was different now the power had changed her she could see quite clearly that the rules for heras well as for valeri and marswere different than they were for everyone else irina looked into marss eyes and in that moment she knew that she would never tell him about how valeri had sent her to spy on him this was a measure of her power over both men and she would never give it up irina i will tell you a secret mars said something you must promise never to tell anyone i promise i can well imagine how valeri denysovich for one would chop me up for fish bait if he ever found out i harbor a secret affinity for the nationalist group white star irina watched him through the steam and her slitted eyes this was the last thing she had expected him to say and under the circumstances it completely disarmed her mars said you see irina valeri denysovich pretends at compromise with the baltics with his much publicized treaty but he gives them only token freedoms then with the other hand he comes down like a mailed fist against the ukrainians his own people imagine he stroked her hair you see despite all the monumental changes taking place in the outside world nationalism is still a dirty word inside the kremlina treasonable offense in fact there are some who believe that the president encouraged the prodemocracy spin in eastern europe to divert the increasing pressure the west was putting on us for holding on to the baltics mars took her hand in his i want you to understand this clearly white star if its legitimateif its not being run by fanatics and terroristsmust be recognized we must look to the poland model solidarity could not be denied its rise to power was in the end the will of the people our strength though our own government has yet to realize itis in our people the soviet peoples the longer we suppress their individual freedoms the more we keep them at arms length we imprison them rather than embracing them white star could change all that given half a chance i think its worth the risk to give them that chance irina looked into marss dark eyes it happens that i agree with you mars smiled i knew you would he wiped water droplets from her cheek now im certain youll agree to help me find white star and talk to their leaders me how on earth could i possibly help well it occurred to me that while you were on one of your trips to america you might have stumbled across a white star supporter or two it seems apparent to me that elements inside america would be only too eager to give what they could money arms whathaveyou to white stars cause that may be true irina said but i never met any hmm well it was just a thought mars said he smiled and wriggled closer to her ill just have to muddle along on my own then why irina reached under the water for him when we can muddle along together she said irina awoke with a start it was very dark in the room she could hear marss even breathing as he slept beside her she lay for a time watching a pattern of pale light spiderweb the ceiling then she rose without a sound and padded over to the window she thought deeply for some time her mind turning over the possibilities her power opened to her she took her time forcing back the desire to race ahead at last she came to the conclusion that she would indeed help mars in his quest to find white star the dissident nationalist organization seemed to loom with greater importance both mars and valeri were interested in finding white star each for his own reasons but mars wanted to help white star while valeri was most concerned with the smuggled hafnium and now she could feel white star exerting its own magnetic pull on her it was fate that mars had opened himself up to her tonight a sign i need to help him irina decided the way each man has reacted to white star has given me a regained sense of right and wrong and perhaps in helping the peoples of white star gain their freedom i will find the purpose in life that has been missing ever since i returned from cambridge she nodded to herself beginning at last to see a way out of her terrible dilemma she would continue to spy on mars for valeri but now it would be a facade her facade she would pass on to valeri only what she wanted to only enough to keep him from getting suspicious in the meantime she would work on valeri like an archaeologist at a dig she would find out all he knew about white star but first she needed some kind of insurance she did not delude herself turning on valeri denysovich bondasenko would be dangerous if she were not very careful it could have dire consequences for her she thought of her dream of the siberian winter and shuddered because she knew that valeri could send her there with no more than a wave of his hand no one would dare raise his voice in protest there could be no help for her no reprieve even from mars she was smart enough to know that there was a personal element in this decision to deceive valeri as he was deceiving her would in some measure make up for the hurt he had caused her by seeing another woman again part of her wondered why she should feel so hurt by valeri and why she felt it necessary to exact a measure of revenge after all it wasnt as if she did care for him was it insurance irina knew she would need it some kind of leverage should valeri ever find out what she was doing power was the only currency valeri traded in and irina knew she needed to make a deposit before she set out against him she would have to follow him valeri had claimed that he had no secrets irina was convinced this must be a lie everyone had a secret or two that he or she did not want made public why should valeri be an exception he had to have a weakness some crack no matter how tiny in the armor of his power but what could it be irina stared out the window into the blackness of the moscow night the air was thick and heavy almost as cloying as the atmosphere in the lobby of the old moscow arts theater and irina in sudden inspiration knew just where to start her name was natasha mayakova honno said what if giin is already dead then well hold a funeral big ezoe said looking into her face he laughed you know being in love does something to you i m not in love with giin if thats your implication honno said have you forgotten eikichi big ezoe said youre the one married to eikichi kansei yet you arent in love with him dont be an idiot she snapped anyway why are we talking about me when giin and sakatasans ledgers are missing because my men are doing everything possible to find both we have some time now just the two of us your tone is most offensive honno said do all yakuza deal in innuendo our stock in trade mrs kansei he grinned sit down if you keep pacing like that youre apt to get a heart attack honno stopped in her tracks she was about to say something acid realized how useless her sarcasm would be on him sat down instead they were in big ezoes office there was a great deal of activity outside in the warehouselike space honno hoped at least some of it was related to the search for giin and the ledgers she knew there were bodyguards around but suspected that she would never quite manage to spot them all honno had already spent two evenings out of the house and before eikichi got suspicious she knew she had to take some steps to ensure that she had uninterrupted time with big ezoe accordingly she took a few days off her job at michita industries she had to arrange for two women at michita to cover her work while she was gone eikichi often worked so late that rather regularly he went out afterward with some of his fellow prosecutors to eat drink and unwind but on the nights he was home at a more or less normal time he expected his dinner to be prepared and waiting for him when he walked in if it was not there and worse neither was she no explanation would be adequate consequently honno told eikichi that she was going to osaka for several days to visit her aunt who was taken ill eikichi knew that this aunt was honnos favorite relative the only member of her family with whom she had a normal relationship and he had not questioned her decision big ezoe shook his head you look even more nervous sitting down than you did pacing about he came around from behind his desk this isnt the place for us he touched his hip beneath his suit jacket i have a beeper as soon as anything breaks ill be notified in the meantime lets go somewhere where you can get rid of some of that excess energy he took her in his gray steelplated mercedes to the ginza not to the great wide avenues clogged with tourists and traffic enormous department stores and neon signs but to a quiet side street lined with ginkgo trees and wooden walls behind one wall honno found a minuscule garden immaculate with a stand of minibamboo mossladen rocks and a wellspring of tinkling water this was the home of tokyos most exclusive club on a street of exclusive clubs there was a great deal of bowing and deferential treatment from the staff and from the managing director himself who was immediately summoned from his inner sanctum on the second floor which overlooked a stunning diamondshaped atrium composed entirely of white marble slabs a man in a tuxedo was playing erik satie on a white concert grand piano an enormous spray of red peonies was artfully arranged in a white porcelain vase on the pianos top behind him a very modern combination of glass and rice paper and ash shoji screens gave way to an inner courtyard of water moss ferns and dwarf azalea all amid rocks that suggested mountains time and great distance they were taken downstairs in a stainlesssteel elevator there honno and big ezoe split up see you in the dojo he said honno was escorted by a woman attendant into a rich cedarlined changing room given a white cotton githe traditional martial arts attire loosefitting and comfortable she was shown where to bathe and afterward she returned to the changing room donned her gi big ezoe was waiting for her in a magnificent dojo the walls and ceiling were paneled in kyoki wood the space below the ceiling hung with banners of the ancient daimyo the feudal warlords of old japan the floor was tatami mats and the lighting was indirect making the dojo evenly lit wherever one happened to be on the tatami what do you think youre doing honno asked how do you know ive had any martial arts training im good at this big ezoe said trust me and when honno burst out laughing he said thats better lets get rid of some of your nervous tension hm he began to circle her watching her react to him as he did so jiujitsu he said some tai chi and judging by the way you hold your hands some aikido he moved in low and fast going for her knees but honno used a basic irimi a neutralization technique big ezoe countered this and honno automatically went into a counterattack as she did so she felt the expansion of her wa her central core of intrinsic energy it was a wonderful feeling a sudden release an elation like a balloon rising into the air currents or a big fish breaking free of a line that had hooked it thats better big ezoe said attacking again despite his girth he was light on his feet agile and frighteningly quick but honno soon had a handle on his strategy he liked to attack endlessly giving no respite figuring that eventually fatigue would cause his opponent to make a mistake soon after she discovered the flaw in his strategy the endless stream of his attacks left minute openings for a counter one had to be so quick as to anticipate his next attack or one would have no chance of getting through before its onset but it could be done honno bided her time using one irimi after another to neutralize him while dropping her earlier strategy of counterattacking she needed the extra time to try to anticipate his next move she found him in a series of attacks familiar to her and she thought now is the time she deflected the first the second then anticipating the third in the series launched herself at the gap as it began to open but when using the spirit of dawn she came through the opening in his defense she found him ready for her too late she recognized the trap he had deliberately patiently set for her she could only marvel at his expertise as he took her down to the tatami the callused edge of his hand against her throat he grunted came up pulled her off the that after himvery good mrs kansei but not good enough they met an hour and a half later at the clubs thirdfloor restaurant in the interim honno had been bathed oiled massaged bathed again she had found her clothes waiting for her cleaned and pressed in the fragrant changing room the restaurant was in cool contrast to the clubs white marble entrance below a sea of gray unpolished granite almost colorless but vibrant with texture a long line of narrow windows that ran its length overlooked the rigid grid of the city the restricted view refining tokyos geometrics into a pattern that was so intense it became almost abstract a kind of art has your office been in touch with you yet honno asked as she sat down opposite big ezoe you must learn patience mrs kansei he said a uniformed waiter poured chilled white wine into their glasses it was your lack of patience that betrayed you in the dojo honno put aside the elegant menu said i want to know whats happened to giin and i want to get the ledgers back big ezoe sipped at his wine contemplated her just so we get something clearbecause this is quite importantis it your late friend sakatas ledgers you care about or this professor giins life well both of course but if it came down to it and you could only retrieve one the ledgers or giin big ezoe said as patiently as if he were explaining this to a child which would you choose are you serious honno said or is this another one of your jokes i assure you i am quite serious but its an impossible question to answer it is not what kind of creature are you honno said angrily then all right theres only one answer possible giins life is far more important than a couple of books with chicken scratching all over them is that so big ezoe eyed her over the rim of his glass and what about your promise to sakatasan mrs kansei what about giri honno felt shame flood through her in her anxiety over giins safety she had completely forgotten about the burden of debt she owed sakata but of course this is a moot question she said hurriedly youre giving an imaginary example it doesnt matter how i answer oh but it most certainly does matter big ezoe put down his glass i have given you a zen riddle and if you think answering it is a pointless exercise or it is merely complying with a whim of mine you are gravely mistaken zen riddles mrs kansei are meant as doorways through which one may resolve the contradictions of ones own spirit i told you earlier that you must be prepared for anything you assured me you were you gave me your word now when we come to the first difficult fording of a stream you balk or give me an illconsidered reply this is not the way of the warrior mrs kansei what would your late friend sakatasan think of your behavior with that honno put her face in her hands and began to weep big ezoe watched impassively until her shoulders ceased to shake then he said why did you do that i was a fool to attempt to act out of giri honno said the weight of burden is not meant for a woman it takes a mans strength nonsense big ezoe said what the performance of giri takes is a warriors spirit and a warrior is bound neither by age nor by sex you have the warriors spirit mrs kansei i felt the expansion of your wa in the dojo i felt how fiercely you fought and i know just how much pleasure it gave you because i feel the same way but poor giin she whispered i cant stop thinking about him i cant stop worrying what if a warriors heart is pure big ezoe said it is forged in the crucible of combat in the vise of giri in the glory of honor these are all that matter giin is only a man but i loved him once and yes perhaps as you have said i still do but i love eikichi as well and i am married to him eikichi too is only a man but the warriors ideals are immutable perfect pure once you become one with them they are yours for all time there is no need to depend on anything or anyone else but i am married to eikichi honno said miserably i owe him my honor menand women too mrs kanseiare fallible they lie cheat steal betray it is human nature a way of life to depend on a manor a womanis to invite disaster a warrior avoids this and therein lies hisor herultimate strength these are just words honno said hollow words big ezoe regarded her for a long time at last he said youre perfectly right he picked up his menu and tonight i think its high time we turned them into reality first there was the moss garden verdant lush glowing like an emerald in the reflected light beneath the yellow and green cutleaf maples then there was the pool deep dark mysterious in whose depths from time to time could be discerned the speckled back of a lazy koi like the arc of a curve the kois back appeared and disappeared as full of meaning as the first brush stroke on rice paper black ink spilled across the white page a book yet to be written yet to be read mamasan reads the portents here big ezoe said as if divining honnos thoughts the koi dance and in so doing speak to her of the future so she says they had come to the northern outskirts of tokyo where there were still wooden houses from before the war like this one at this time of the evening the most extraordinary light existed in the bower beneath the carefully pruned maple trees fusing leaf and pond moss and butterfly making even time seem to stand still how do you know this place honno said is this where you come when you need sexual release it was that kind of place an outpost of the water trade the euphemism used to describe japans vast underworld of pleasure gardens where even the forbidden was accepted big ezoe smiled he led her away from the koi pool across the courtyard into the house mamasan was in the doorway as if she expected them she bowed to big ezoe and when he introduced honno she was warm and welcoming they took off their shoes which were stored in a beautiful kyoti wood cabinet in the stone and wood entrance fresh flowers were everywhere some almost hid the shunga erotic woodblock prints hung on the walls mamasan showed them into a sixtatami room dominated by a massive redpainted tansu chest with a great deal of intricate ironwork a simple porcelain vase held a single yellow chrysanthemum amid a spray of dark green leaves she had tea brought but almost immediately big ezoe excused himself does he come here often honno asked oh no mamasan said she seemed almost sad at the thought she had gray hair a round pleasant face she was dressed immaculately in the old fashion the edge of a yellow underkimono was visible beneath a kimono of spring green gorgeous wooden combs kept her hair in its complex pattern her face was white black and crimson with traditional makeup he almost never comes how do you know him mamasan cocked her head looking like a mockingbird on a branch my dear big ezoe owns this establishment she gave honno the tiniest most ingratiating smile tell me did he take you to his club in the ginza for lunch today his club oh most assuredly mamasans head bobbed and her expression was that of a mother proud of the accomplishments other son big ezoe owns many many things but he acquires nothing she cocked her head again do you understand im not sure well mamasan settled her hands in her lap the light from the next room filtered by the ricepaper shoji screens fell obliquely across her face softening it and at the same time making an abstraction of it so that honno was reminded of the restricted view of tokyo from the ginza clubs restaurant here is what i mean a man acquires wealth but of what use is wealth if he has no wisdom oh he may ride in the grandest mercedes have his clothes made for him abroad live in a house in kojimachi but if he owns no respect then he is nothing and his life is but coins sifting through his fingers this is how you define big ezoe but i wasnt speaking of him not in any direct way mamasan said i was trying to make you understand the nature of things events often shocking require an underlying logic so the mind can understand what the eyes cannot at that moment big ezoe reappeared we must go upstairs now mamasan the old woman bowed i understand have you finished she gave him an enigmatic look well the patterns shifted blackwhiteblack across her face as she moved there wont be a finish to this big ezoe watched as if suddenly wary then he returned her bow and gestured for honno to follow him there was a man standing in the hallway at the foot of the stairs he had about him the air of one of big ezoes men he looked studiedly away from honno as she followed big ezoe up the stairs where are we going she asked why are we here it was dark on the second floor their feet made no sound on the tatami mats sliding shoji screened off one room from another so that the place had a sense of communality that spoke to the heart of the japanese culture where individuality was an uncomfortable concept this is a sleepless place big ezoe said softly and yet it is just the spot where dreams are born he stopped in front of a shoji near the end of the hall he put his hand on the ashwood frame turned to her said trust mrs kansei is too often misplaced wont you see my words turned into reality he threw open the sliding shoji and honno stared into the room beyond there were two peoplea man and a womanentwined on the futon there was a crush of movement rhythmic primitive unmistakable then the man aware through the veil of his pleasure that he was being observed flung the woman off his hips the woman rolled out of the bedcovers and honno saw the woman was a man he sat up stared into honnos face all at once honnos blood froze she was looking right at eikichi her husband making love to another man it was inconceivable this must be a painting or a photograph honno thought it cannot be real she felt dizzy and then mamasans words flooded back through her mamasan had spoken of kojimachi kojimachi was one of tokyos poshest neighborhoods it was where eikicki had grown up where he went to high school it was where his parents lived where he aspired to live if a man owns no respect then he is nothing and his life is but coins sifting through his fingers mamasan in her oblique way had been trying to prepare honno for this scene honnosan eikichi screeched how dare you come here how dare you lie to me how dare you spy on me the look of contempt on his face was acid well why should i be surprised youre hinoeuma oh yes i know stupid you seeing the look of dread and shame on her face he was not about to stop now there was a kind of gleeful malevolence that seemed to bubble out of him like lava from the mouth of a volcano your father came to see my parents a month before our wedding he was concerned you see for their reputation their standing in the community he wanted some remuneration for his information and because i got to him before he had a chance to speak to my parents i paid him off myself why not his information was valuable to me although not in any way he could suspect the poor fool i saw it as a lever to keep you in line just in case you rebelled at some point willful girl that you are against my true lifestyle he drew the thin young man back to him lovingly embraced him now hinoeuma woman get out of here so i can finish what ive started honno wanted to cry out but she could not just like that with the thunderclap of eikichis voice reality was brought home to her she turned away too horrified too out of control to answer him she tore past big ezoe raced back down the stairs through the entryway out into the courtyard running barefoot into me darkness beneath the maples where the tiny sounds of the koi pool could comfort her where the lazy somnolent fish could soothe away the fever burning inside her then she turned away and to her horror vomited in a series of wracking convulsions she gave a little moan and crawling to the edge of the pool lowered her face beneath the water coolness surrounded her and she opened her eyes to the darkness the life beneath me water when she rose gasping from below she saw big ezoe sitting on the other side of the pool he handed her her shoes she was so humiliated she could not face him you bastard she said you knew about eikichi all along she was gasping for breath as if she had been running for a very long time how long has he been coming here three years big ezoe said nothing about meeting you courting you marrying you changed his schedule because i am hinoeuma born in the year of the husband killer honno said miserably big ezoe looked off into the night there were fireflies out and here beside the koi pool beneath the maples it was possible to forget all about tokyo the hypermodern superstructures the official bribery and corruption the race into the twentyfirst century which was the national task that the japanese had set for themselves now only the essence remained the hard cruel lessons of a far simpler time the time of the warrior for which yukio mishima longed about which big ezoe knew so much it has nothing to do with what you think you are big ezoe said it is him what eikichi kansei is a product of the times as mamasan tried to tell you she knows your husband far better than you do eikichis sadistic invective echoed in her mind the humiliation of her pathetic lot in life overwhelmed her and she thought she was going to be sick again she had been systematically beaten down at home first by her father and then by eikichi whom she could see now was the only kind of man she could have chosen to be her husband rigid brutal repressive how could she have mistaken such inhumanity for honor obedience had blinded her and as for her job now she understood her role there as well she served the same purpose as the wallpaper in the halls she was elegant soothing ever obedient this was not only the definition of what she was but what she would always be she had as much knowledge and schooling as the male executives beside whom she served daily but no one would listen to her opinions or ideas what place did a woman have in business kunio michita had given her the answer to that when he had ignored her idea for tandom polycarbon again she had been betrayed by her sense of obedience and she realized in a thoroughly disheartening moment that she had always known what her place was in business and at home home what home her childhood had been a cruel mockery and her marriage an absolute sham she felt as if she had just awakened from a long dream from a sojourn in a world where she must hold her tongue underutilize her brain instead look cool and beautiful be the whipping girl for her bitter father be an obedient automaton for michita and a walking billboard for eikichi honno at last gathered the strength to look up at big ezoe now i see there are worlds within worlds she said like this private bower within the city and worlds within those worlds like this koi pond within this bower which is the real world big ezoe sitting across the expanse of dark lapping water said you have just learned that lesson mrs kansei there is no real world there is only your world five llano negro on a tree at the near edge of the llano negro tori discovered a series of carvings they were crude yet powerful they depicted a baby a bent old man a man with no legs a man nailed to a cross a man with no eyes a dead man what the hell does this mean russell said myth estilo said i dont believe in myths russell said turning away he was scanning the immediate environment a quadrant at a time estilo said jorge luis borges our most famous poet wrote that myth is merely reality simplified to a point where it can be understood russell turned around and you believe that tori coming up to russell said softly its important to believe it here in the field especially here in the jungle we dont know its dangerous to assume that reality and myth are two separate entities because out here they serve the same purpose why do you always feel the need to show me how superior you are russell said because tori told him youre a man and im not so what so isnt that part of why you think i m unreliable youre out of your mind am i he looked at her for what seemed a long time its getting late they pushed on past the carvings through the trees and the encroaching underbrush until they were swallowed up by llano negro the black jungle toward midday they paused for a break it was hideously hot and humid and all of them were drenched in sweat they passed around food and water russell said estilo what did those carvings signify estilo grunted we are born we age are maimed are punished for our sins and die he chewed on some dried beans it was a warning i suppose there is a great deal of superstition among the campesinos out here this is the edge of the world as they understand it the llano negro defines the boundary of what is known and what is unknown who dyou think put the carvings there russell said estilo nodded in the direction they were headed whoever this land belongs to any idea who that might be why speculate estilo got up dusted himself off well soon find out they set out again and within the space of twenty minutes came to the bank of the manacacias river it was brown sluggish muddy downed trees a forest of branches clogged its flow and it was not difficult using these to ford the water according to cruzs flight jockey the cocaine factory shouldnt be far now russell said when they had gained the far shore estilo tori said quietly listen to me carefully dont move and dontdontturn your head she walked around so that estilo could see her she could see estilos eyes opened wide with fear look at me look at me theres a stone beetle on you estilos lips barely moved where he barely breathed it the base of your neck tori estilos eyes closed and a tiny tremor passed through him tori could see he was praying she could also see out of the corner of her eye russell walking up behind estilo without a word tori reached out caught him by the wrist just as he was about to pluck the stone beetle off estilo it was very large almost the length of her forefinger blunt and ugly its articulated carapace black and as shiny as chrome im just going to get it off him russell said if you try it estilo will die tori indicated the insect do you see those forward pincers theyre already buried in his flesh even if you were fast enough it would at the point of death reflexively release its poison she looked at him do you know why this is called a stone beetle its venom paralyzes the central nervous system of its prey its as if theyve turned to stone just like circes gaze russell said and when she did not answer i was thinking of the merging of myth and reality he looked at her what are we to do i have no experience with stone beetles theres only one way tori said dont move and no matter what dont make a sound she turned toward estilo contemplated the giant insect at the base of his neck it crouched there dark and deadly she could see its pincers with their lethal poison embedded in estilo she began to sweat she lifted her right hand and separating her fingers lowered the little finger toward the beetles back when the long curved nail was millimeters from the creature she paused a tremor went through her she knew she would have only one chance to paralyze the insect through the single chink in the armor of its carapace if she missed if she used too little or too much force estilo would die tori too said a little prayer she went into prana extending her breathing slowing down allowing her wa her intrinsic force to expand to explore the environment around her and to wash away her apprehension and fear then with a soft exhalation she slid her nail through the slit between the plates of the beetles carapace there was some kind of obstruction and she pushed on through it for an instant she panicked thinking she had gone too far and in its death spasm the beetle would shoot its venom into estilos bloodstream paralysis and death she took another deep breath in a moment she said estilo are you all right get that thing off me damnit tori almost laughed in relief the stone beetle was paralyzed she grasped its sides with her left hand and making sure to keep her fingernail in place pulled on the beetle she saw its pincers emerging from estilo with agonizing slowness at last the pincers were out in a blur tori flung the insect away from them into the underbrush its gone well done estilo said clapping tori on the back color was slowly returning to his face my god that was too close by half he kissed tori on both cheeks that was very impressive russell said to tori as they prepared to move out i didnt do it to impress you give it a break okay he said what you did took a lot of guts thats all i meant russell walked away from her he took point he had gone over the terrain with cruzs pilot but he also must have completely memorized the topographical map in the helicopter because he had not needed to refer to it once they were on the ground this way he said pointing into the emerald and black jungle and they pushed on through the dense foliage green light and darkness shadows lying in layers dense with mystery it was slow going because they needed silence more than speed now they could not afford to hack their way through with their machetes because the men guarding the factory would surely hear them coming they soon came to a huge tree again there was a carving on it this time it was very large it showed a man bound upside down to what appeared to be some sort of circle the black wheel of death estilo said endless pain eternal torment another warning russell said he took out his kabar knife and in three wide slices gouged out the carving this time its ours the first sign they had that they were close to their goal was a sight of an army patrol they were bivouacked in a small clearing in which a campesinos shack had been constructed there were twenty soldiers as the three of them crept closer to the perimeter they could see that groups of soldiers were taking turns going inside the shack it had been outfitted with a small generator a tv and a vcr the soldiers were watching a videocassette of apocalypse now absorbing several scenes at a time before emerging like blinded owls into the intense sunshine jabbering excitedly swaggering like colonel kilgore or blowing out their cheeks like colonel kurtz russell guided the others with hand signals and they gave the encampment a wide berth it appeared that cruz was correct about the armys use herethis detachment seemed to have no orders to patrol they were within five thousand yards of a major cocaine factory and they seemed happily on vacation who could command so much power tori asked herself as they headed toward the factory they encountered animals next chickens pigs goats enough to feed several hundred people then they saw the beginning of the compound russell crouched beside tori whispered jesus christ this isnt a factory its a goddamned city they counted a dozen long housesno doubt dormitoriesmade of corrugated tin beyond the jungle had been cleared to the south to make room for an airstrip a twin otter airplane sat on the runway being refueled as they continued to move around the clearings perimeter they came upon shedlike warehouses storing drums of acetone aviation fuel red gasoline ether the essentials of refining coca into cocaine and of transporting it out of the llano negro farther along three rows of massive generators hunkered in a huge shed cooled by the shade of a grove of trees other buildings housed washing machines shower facilities mess tables to accommodate a division they found the lab itself a long low structure with a zinc roof they moved on until they had identified every structure in the clearing the entire compound was dominated by the cloyingly sweet stench of cooking cocaine a combination of ether and cocahydrochloride which created its own kind of pernicious industrial pollution over this bizarre and scarifying jungle city what the hell have we stumbled onto estilo breathed this is more than we bargained for tori the size of this place youd need a couple of army regiments to close it down maybe tori said maybe not she led them back the way they had come twice they had to stop melt into the jungle as guards in jeeps thundered by semiautomatic rifles at the ready they were not soldiers but they had the bearing of armytrained personnel tori reentered one of the warehouses checked the contents more carefully when she returned to where the others were waiting she said in any case theres nothing more we can do now darkness is our greatest ally out here in the belly of the black jungle russell took the first watch tori and estilo sat together their backs against the bole of an enormous tree birds called to each other through the maze of tree branches and the whir of flying insects was incessant tori and estilo passed a canteen back and forth taking only sips at a time they ate some concentrated food estilo put his head back closed his eyes a long long time ago when i was a little boy he said i found a cat in the jungle he was sickyou could see he had no flesh over his rib cage and one eye didnt work right but my god he was a magnificent fighter i sat and watched him methodically attack kill and eat a sevenfoot adder so poisonous i wouldnt have gotten within ten paces of it when he was through eating he licked his paws and mewing walked over to me i sat still his eyes watched mine and i think that if i had made any move at all he would have attacked me but i didnt and he didnt and so we became friends estilo shrugged for many years he was my only friend my family lived with other german emigres and i hated them with their stiff formal ways their arrogance of superiority it was funny they assumed that their superiority stemmed from genetics but i knew the argentines better than they did and i knew what deference the germans were given was bought with their stolen nazi blood money estilo turned and spat into the humid black earth one day the cat was gone just like that i found him that night in a back alley near my house his neck had been broken a swastika had been painted on his forehead and then i knew who had killed him there was a set of twins who lived in the house next to mine they were bullies in school and in the neighborhood they always stood by one another so no one challenged them i knew they had killed my cat but i did nothing to let them know i knew i decided to study them and after a while it became clear to me that while they always provided a united front to the kids at school when they were alone togetheror thought they werethere was an intense rivalry between them i was convinced that i had found their weak spot but how to exploit it it happened that the twins were both wild over one girl she was a flirt and liked both of them or at least enjoyed the attention they gave her over the course of the next several months i secretly contrived to become her friend she wasnt very good in mathematics and i undertook to tutor her while i did so i drew her out so that she spoke about the twins when she had given me enough intimate information about them i used her to plant stories about how each of them was secretly trying to undercut the other in school at home with her as i was certain she would she passed on these stories it did not matter that they were false i knew the truth of the twins rivalry so the stories were believed i set one twin against the other until their enmity destroyed their connection their love for one another i drove them apart in the end they became business rivals and have spent their lives trying to bankrupt one another for a time there was silence in me jungle the drip of moisture off the foliage the whir and whine of insects an animal call in the distance tori wondered why estilo had told her that chilling story it occurred to her after a time that what he had been speaking about was not strictly speaking a catbut rather loyalty trust friendship and love she recalled their talk on the telephone when she had still been in mall central and she realized that this was as close as he could come to telling her how much he missed his friend ariel solares night in the llano negro was absolute there was no moon but illumination was provided by the factorys powerful arc lights it was eerie to be deep in the jungle and to see everything in terms of the powderwhite sodium lights there were no colors no grays only utter black and stalk white russell went with tori into the warehouse he said im not sure this is a good idea it doesnt matter tori said crouching down by the side of a barrel of acetone im the commander in the field russell pointed out youre nothing tori said you want to be a commander go ahead but youve got no one to command there was a small silence then he crouched down beside her i still think this is far too dangerous we could all die we could all have died in cruzs copter if the pilot had crashed tori said the idea is not to make a mistake she nodded held out a length of cord cut this for me will you russell did as she asked and tori dipped the cord into the acetone she looped it around the barrel and over to the one next to it that contained ether she opened the barrel then she backed up trailing the cord behind her ready not by a long shot russell said watching her light the end of the acetonesoaked cord then they got out of there the string of explosions began twenty seconds later the three of them set out on the run through the confusion of the compound the screaming of the jeeps tires the shouts of the personnel they had their uzi assault rifles at the ready but they made it to the lab without having to fire them with the entire warehouse going up no one was interested in them yet this was a shutended situation because the explosions would surely bring the army out of its apocalypse now torpor and those in command surely would begin instituting a buildingbybuilding search of the compound as soon as the postpercussion fire was under control tori estimated they had five minutes any more would be stretching it they hit the lab at once smashing in the door hearing bursts of semiautomatic fire and answering with their uzis six guards went down in a hail of bullets shards of glass wood and metal a dozen lab workers stood cringing with their hands on their heads the chemical stench was almost overpowering even though the line of windows at the back of the lab was open tori posted estilo at the open doorway where he could cover the workers while she and russell roamed up and down the aisles zinctopped trestle tables were filled with huge metal buckets of cured cocaine but all the cooking was being done in vats outside this was the end product on another table plastic bags were being filled with refined coke theres something odd here tori said at that moment estilo came up keeping his eye on the workers he said did you take a look at the guards tori shook her head no time theyre all japanese japanese russell went over to where two of the guards were sprawled he turned one over looked at his face japanese he confirmed then he pulled back the mans sleeve yakuza whats this all about protecting their investment estilo offered tori didnt think so she took a look at the irizumi the body tattoos on the man she saw from the intricacy of the irizumi that this man was an underboss he had been very powerful that wasnt the way the japanese yakuza worked the underbosses did not like to be so far from home hed be here only for the most vital of reasons coke was coke he could just as easily have checked it at his end of the pipeline or sent a trusted underling here to make certain of the quality then what was he doing in the middle of nowhere what was so important estilo gave a shout then opened up with his uzi a worker who had drawn a pistol was thrown backward against the zinctopped table where he had been stuffing cocaine into the plastic bags as he collapsed two of the tenkilo bags fell to the floor one burst open and tori made a sound deep in her throat she and russell went over to the opened bag within the coke something dark was just visible using the tip of her knife blade tori pushed aside the white powder what the hell is that estilo said a soft cell russell said what tori said its a method of smuggling unusual but invariably effective it takes a convoluted brain to think of it contraband inside an altogether different type of contraband she had uncovered a glassine tube it was filled with pellets they were of a metal that was almost black almost totally without shine what are they russell said almost to himself he took the glassine envelope hefted it heavy tori was already slitting open the second tenkilo bag in its center hidden by the powder was an identical glassine envelope filled with the same metallic pellets this must be why the japanese are here she said this isnt about cocaine smuggling at all russell was staring at the pellets no but what is it about at that moment estilo said theyre coming shit estilo shouted at the workers herded them out of the lab building he took a look into the compound the goddamned armys arrived russell looked at tori now weve had it he said tori said take the pellets lets get going gunfire began and estilo jumped away from the doorway began to return the fire forget that way tori said use the windows when you get out head for the airstrip they climbed onto me trestle tables launched themselves through the windows they emerged high up on the corrugated tin wall but the underbrush cushioned their fell immediately more firing started and the foliage around them began to fly apart estilo was nicked in the fleshy part of his arm shouted a curse in german pulled russell backward to safety behind a tree there were shouts and tori moved in estilo and russell behind her fanning out firing in short accurate bursts then they were through the hastily thrownup cordon of guards racing away from the compound toward me airstrip where the twin otter waited gleaming in the are lights like an oasis in the blackness of the night they were halfway to the airstrip when the firing began again a jeep was careening out of the compound heading toward them in a vector that would cut them off from the runway the driver gunned the engine and the two soldiers in back readied a machine gun on a swivel mount bolted to the side of the jeep christ russell said keep going tori called she stopped began to fire her uzi with the blunt shock jammed hard against her left side the jeep did not veer toward her as she had wanted it to but the machine gun swiveled in her direction it began to fire with her right hand tori pulled the pin on a phosphorus grenade tied to the bandolier she wore across her chest she ripped the grenade free lofted it toward the jeep the driver saw it pulled hard on the wheel the jeep screamed skittered on the rutted dirt track lurched bounced came down just as the grenade made contact the whitegreen explosion peeled back the nearside fender impaled the wheel on hot metal tore into the engine housing the jeep bucked shot upward passing vertical crashed down on its top no one moved underneath its bulk flames began to lick upward then the ammunition ignited ducking the flying debris tori ran in a zigzag pattern heading toward the airstrip where the others had gone and ran right into a pair of soldiers who had burst at a full run from the underbrush surrounding the back of the lab one hit the point of her jaw with the stock of his machine pistol the other kicked her legs out from under her she fell to the ground and one of the soldiers smashed the toe of his boot into her stomach tori doubled over gasping for air struggling for equilibrium then she was hauled over on her back and one of the soldiers placed the muzzle of his pistol against the side of her head his sweat dripped onto her forehead into her eyes he stunk from cordite and male sweat he grinned at her and she could see the gaps between his teeth adios puta he said tori heard the crack of the pistol and she jerked but when she looked up she saw the soldier with a stupefied expression on his face blood drooled from the center of his forehead then he toppled out of her line of vision and she rolled into the second soldier who had lifted his machine pistol tori unsheathed her knife drove it upward in a shallow arc into the soldiers lower belly he gave a cry his machine pistol sprayed the air then he fell to his knees there was plenty of life still in him he smashed his fists into her side and she grunted twisting the knife dragging it through his viscera he hit her again in the kidneys and her strength momentarily left her then gathering herself she drew the knife upward and across disemboweling him in a moment russell was at her side he put his against the soldiers head pulled the trigger he hauled tori to her feet you okay she nodded nice bit of shooting right between the eyes he had to help her a little until the running could work out the soreness in her abdomen and side her jaw still ached from where she had taken the shot with the stock of the machine pistol they caught up with estilo on the edge of the tarmac the twin otter sat waiting closer than ever they trotted out onto the airstrip the airplane loomed up and tori thought weve made it just then they saw another jeep careen onto the tarmac it headed for them at full speed machine pistols blazing around the other side estilo called get the plane between us and those guns they ducked beneath the wing of the twin otter but as soon as they did they could make out an advancing column of troops appearing from out of the jungle on that side of the plane they were caught in a tightening net the planes our only hope now estilo said weve got to get inside but the moving stair is on the other side russell said those machine pistols will cut us to ribbons if we show ourselves nevertheless tori said estilos right if we dont take off in this plane were finished she checked her uzi reload she said make sure youve got a full magazine okay she looked at their faces pale and grim in the reflection of the sodium are lights lets go they began to fire even before they came around beneath the gleaming belly of the twin otter the jeep was closer than they expected the fusillade from the soldiers withering already they could hear the poppoppop of semiautomatic rifles from the column of soldiers on the other side of the plane well never get the moving stair in place russell shouted over the din tori saw that he was right quick she shouted back in there she indicated the open cargo doors russell grabbed estilo shoved him into the cargo bay tori got off a quick burst at the jeep saw one of the soldiers slump back she covered russell still firing as he climbed in himself she shot off a final burst scrambled in closed the doors behind her the semiautomatic fire was like hail against the side of the plane shit shit shit tori forward of them was scrabbling at a plate in the ceiling she pulled her shot off the lock shoved the panel aside and light flooded downward she clambered up russell right behind her they ran forward there was no one on the plane and she said a prayer for their luck she slid into the pilots chair began throwing switches im not sure of the takeoff she said once were in the air ill be okay russell sat in the copilots seat went through the pretakeoff checklist the engines started up there was no problem except for the semiautomatic fire directed their way time russell said and they began to taxi down the airstrip faster and faster he fed the engines adjusting the mix then pulled back on the throttle and with a great rush they were airborne lifting slowly away from the llano negro the insane cocaine city the unknown enemy powerful plotting hidden beneath layers of deceit working the soft cell book two the hard machine perfection of means and confusion of goals seem in my opinion to characterize our age albert einstein six moscow star town ngels tokyo the next time irina saw natasha mayakova it was facetoface as it happened natasha ran an acting school for women there were four instructors and she herself gave one class a week irina had enrolled in this class she had to audition of course but oddly this had posed no great problem irina suspected that her recent work burrowing in between valeri and mars had made of her a fairly decent actor she found that she had no fear or trepidation at all she read from a scene in chekhovs three sisters which she privately thought was the height of irony she must have done well because the next day she was informed that she had been accepted into miss mayakovas class the class was attended by six women they sat in a dusty back room of the new moscow arts theater which irina did not like nearly as much as she did the old one where natasha performed five nights a week irina had not of course given her real name her goal was to discover what valeri was secretly doing with natasha mayakova and to find some way to use it against him so that she could get out of him the information mars needed on the nationalist group white star here she was katya boroskaya mars had been delighted to provide the false documentation irina needed for enrolling in the acting school it was too early to give him any information and he had not asked why she required new identity documents i want you to think of yourself as a free agent he had told her i trust you the first night natasha mayakova had told her students that this class would not have been possible before perestroika she said this with the kind of pride someone tells her girlfriends that her father has granted her the privilege of staying out past midnight irina thought the speech disgusting in its naivete frightening in its implied condescension here we will study such american playwrights as edward albee natasha continued i have chosen albee because in plays such as tiny alice and a delicate balance we can discern distinct chekhovian antecedents the characters existential terror is not so far from the despair with which chekhov imbued his characters in three sisters or the cherry orchard both chekhov and albee understood the dynamics of inertia and its ultimate power to affect an audience natasha asked them to do cold readings because she said i want to see what you can do when i throw you without warning into an icy stream she chose two students one of whom was irina to read passages from albees whos afraid of virginia woolf natasha asked irina to play martha the role acted by elizabeth taylor in the american film version irina had seen in a tiny cambridge revival theater irina remembered sitting in the dark surrounded by american students and the smell of popcorn and feeling as if she were swimming naked in a sylvan mountain lake she had felt so free and then the enlarged image of elizabeth taylor had sprung up in front of her her acting transporting irina away away away after class was over natasha mayakova asked her to stay behind irina was immediately terrified that somehow despite her precautions natasha knew who she was and was now prepared to confront her when they were alone natasha said do you have time for a glass of tea because it was fairly late they went to the night bar at the metropole hotel one of the few places in moscow to stay open past midnight muscovites often frequented the hotel because it had been a favorite speaking spot of lenins now it seemed faded worn almost shabby beneath the ornate gilt when they had ordered natasha said i wanted a chance to speak with you katya because your reading of albee intrigued me she stirred sugar into her tea watched the crystals melting its from finland this sugar did you know that i dont know why theres never enough sugar and never any milk here where does it all go do you suppose ive heard that white star hijacks the trucks and trains that bring these staples to moscow but its difficult to credit such stories irina said nothing sensing that natasha was merely musing not asking a question instead she dissected the other woman with her eyes natasha was indeed a beauty blond blueeyed with a dynamic face that might have been judged overly aggressive save for her mouth which was soft gentle inviting irina hated that face whos afraid of virginia woolf is not an easy play to decipher natasha said she took a sip of her tea wrinkled her nose not strong enough this must be for the tourists she gave irina a small smile that was at once so shy and so genuine that irina was taken aback and also the characters are so complex natasha continued perhaps also stupefyingly american she paused as if momentarily unsure how to continue you handled the character well very well indeed thank you irina thought natasha so glamorous with the actors natural ease and grace in all situations that she had begun to grind her teeth in envy and rage as ive no doubt you are aware martha requires a certain inner rage like a pot untended for too long simmering on the stove its contents about to burst out and scar the kitchen forever she looked up at irina and with the actors impeccable timing said but i sensed in you a very real anger a deep pool of rage from which you created your martha i wanted to speak to you of this anger because i wonder if you are aware how completely you are in its grip irina did not know what to make of this was she perhaps offended by it but then she thought of her recurring nightmare her living prison where even the moon was barred sometimes she awoke from this nightmare so upset that she felt nauseous could that be the result of rage she looked at natasha mayakova with renewed suspicion she had had friends for years who would never think to ask her such a personal and disturbing question is this more of your perestroika talk she said natasha gave her little laugh again and there was the shyness again playing around her face like an imp defusing irinas deliberate sharpness oh that foolishness well its what my students want to hear what they expect its harmless really but ive found it immediately puts them at their ease it isnt foolish irina said its dangerous talk really in what way what your harmless speech says is shouldnt we be happy now shouldnt we be content because today is the day we are allowed to run around daddys garden without a leash whats wrong with that its all wrong irina said because the leash isnt the issue woof woof were still treated like dogs natasha ordered vodka for them both and a platter of zakuskia kind of russian antipasto when they were alone again she said olga masha and irina chekhovs three sisters sit around for hours on end talking about how one day they will get to moscow they never do of course and by the end of the play weve discovered that they live only a few kilometers from the city i think this is what you are speaking of irina again felt overcome by the irrational wave of jealousy as if she wanted to shriek at natasha what are you doing with valeri bondasenko are you making love to him every afternoon before rehearsals or do you share his bed on the nights when i am not there ridiculous impossible yet why was she thinking it irina held herself together with an effort wondering again whether she was on the brink of a breakdown she said trying to clear her mind of its disturbing emotional clutter how smug you are you think you know just what you are and what youre doing you run your little school secure in the thought that youre preserving a better place in the state for women but the truth is youre blind youre part of the system and in a sense youre worse than the kgb everyone knows what the kgb is and what it does its no secret but you are one thing while pretending to be another you perpetuate the system by telling your students how well off they are now how grateful to the state they must be for their new improved status but what really is your message dont complain be happy do as youre told look how welloff you are look how free its bullshit you must want to leave my class then natasha said finishing off her tea no i dont i can put up with the bullshit just as long as i learn how to act it seems to me natasha mayakova said as the drinks and food were served that you wont need many lessons they ate in silence for some time irina was acutely aware of the tourists especially their clothes which she loved to look at and longed to wear in boston in a lingerie store she had tried on a silk charmeuse teddy and had almost passed out from the erotic sensation of the divine material gliding against her flesh she shot a clandestine glance at natasha how she wished she could share her decadent memory with someone her whole mind ached to open itself up to let the secrets piling up inside spill out to share to share in acting natasha said softly we learn to dissect the different personality types found in lead and secondary roles you have proved tonight that you already possess that talent she said it in such a way that irina found herself saying im sorry when she knew she could not possibly mean it dont be natasha said she wiped her lips on a paper cocktail napkin i imagine i deserved it i havent been carved up as skillfully since my own first weeks in acting class i had an instructor who was a marvelous actor but he was an absolute ogre in the classroom i worshiped him and nearly died of delight when he accepted me into his class from then on i burst into tears in front of him more often than not i used to lie awake at night replaying his murderous criticisms miserable as could be i could hear his rantings echoing in my dreams his words stalked me like an apparition until all i could think about was making him stop did you irina asked yes i became an accomplished actor natasha ordered more vodka thats all he ever wanted from me he saw in meas opposed to the majority of his other studentsa potential for greatness those are his words not mine he made certain i lived up to that potential by making you miserable by forcing me to look inside myself to find that potential and mine it for the precious ore he knew was there natasha paused while the empty glasses were replaced you see katya i was an orphan i was brought up in a state institution and i had inside of me a ball of ice a rage against an unknown source did my parents die or had they abandoned me i had no idea either way i hated them because they had rejected me their memory lived inside me like a living thing a malignant growth eating at me where did i come from my mother my father my grandparents most people know it seems in fact such an elementary bit of knowledge that nobody thinks of it its taken for granted for me it was like walking around with a wound that never healed a chunk of flesh that was forever gone for which no one could ever provide an adequate prosthesis i was different an outsider i was always aware of this but never more painfully so than during holidays when families reunited drank and ate together rubbed elbows laughed and told stories natasha was focused on something inside herself and her irises had gone very dark i remember i remember an actors curse to remember everything she touched her finger to the vodka when i was growing up more than anything else i wanted someone to tuck me in at night a mother to sing me a lullaby that she had learned at her mothers knee a father to tell me stories of wolves and goblins elves and princes natasha pushed her vodka away with such violence that it spilled across the table leave it she said when irina moved to mop it up she sucked the liquor off her finger its important to know its still therelike memory there was a murderous look in her eyes and irina was abruptly concerned strange how different people could be from how you imagined them natasha had seemed so content on valeris arm so in command on stage and yet here she was on the verge of tears admitting to being lonely and miserable for a moment irina forgot her own hate a mask dropped away and she leaned forward are you all right what makes you think im not natasha snapped you look as if youd like to kill someone thats interesting natasha said thats just how you looked this evening when you were playing albees martha did i irina was shocked she shuddered and she found herself thinking my god is it possible i came here to bury this woman and now i believe that she and i could be friends i believe that if i told her how i felt when i was in boston she would understand she would understand how miserable ive become here and she would not immediately report me to the kgb for having treasonous thoughts isnt it funny how despair can unite people how utterly odd and mysterious life is sometimes i believe ill have another vodka irina said softly natasha nodded i think we ought to make it starka this time she was speaking of the aged vodka that ran to proof and beyond they were on their second glass of starka still picking over their zakuski when natasha said the truth is katya i watched you playing martha tonight and i saw myself it was like looking in a mirror and being able to peer backward through time my god what a shock you gave me and i thought i must get to know this woman i have no family i have no one perhaps in time i will have her to welcome me at easter youre not married irina asked it was not merely that she was interested as in are you married and sleeping with valeri she desperately needed some guidepost she was feeling increasingly that being near natasha mayakova was like standing on the edge of a quickfollowing sea with each roll of a wave onto the beach the sand on which she stood was eroded further and further and without seeming to have moved she was being propelled away from shore toward the bluegreen deep natasha smiled the trouble is i was always far too beautiful for my own good i attracted men to me like bees to honey they came at me and i was never able to determine whether they saw anything beyond my beauty my face my body these are the things they responded to i knew there was more to me but did they that was the question i never seemed able to answer irina said but for someone like you with no family i would have thought marrying and creating a family of your own would have been most important i think it was because i had no family that i had so much trouble accepting the men who came my way you see i wantedi neededeverything to be perfect what if my husband left me what if i felt compelled to leave him i suppose the risk of perhaps repeating what my parents had done paralyzed me made me incapable of being happy or content in a permanent relationship i think when it comes right down to it i have no faith at all in personal relationships between men and women i have to admit that i dont either irina said men are such bastards yet we need them so much natasha sighed i often wonder whether we need them because they are such bastards she laughed and this time a surprised irina joined her but then like a prick from a hidden needle irina thought of valeri and her insistent memory dredged up the scene of happy glowing natasha strolling down gorky street with him after that first time irina had watched hidden as they met once or twice a week why was natasha with him unless they were having an affair and irina thought either natasha is lying to me or valeri powerful manipulative valerihas something on her which was the more likely possibility irina did not have to think twice about it twice a week mars volkov emerged from his office climbed into an official black chaika and was driven out of moscow to zvezdny gorodok star town this was the ultramodern highrise complex built to house and train russias cosmonauts there was surely nothing odd in this oftrepeated journey since marss constituency in the congress of peoples deputies was all of moscow including zvezdny gorodok and star town was very important to moscow in particular and the soviet union in general in star town mars did his obligatory moviestar turn charming everyone the bureaucrats who ran the minicity the technicians who thought they ran it the theoreticians who thought they ran the technicians and the cosmonauts who inhabited it all of star towns citizens were pleased to see mars save one and he was the real reason that mars made this trip twice a week it was with him that mars spent most of his time after the gladhanding of the bureaucrats the political smiles directed at the technicians the cogent but not too probing questions asked of the theoreticians and the backslapping of the cosmonauts in training came marss real work interrogation the of the disastrous odingalaktika ii mission the first attempt at a manned landing on mars had his own building in star town a city within a city within a city it was manned by its own battalion of scientists theoreticians doctors lab technicians and security personnel the place was like a fortress and deliberately so first because of the wishes of the hero second by order of mars himself cleaning up in the aftermath of the odingalaktika ii mishap had been marss responsibility and it had been no easy matter in fact twenty months after the event it was still very much an open case an ongoingthough highly secretinvestigation the heros building was a fourstory affair the basement was filled with generators that powered every appliance in the structure the first two floors were given over to laboratories and testing chambers where the doctors read through reams of twicedaily medical readouts on the hero heart rate respiration ekg beg stress and the like the top two floors were for the heros living such as it was as mars went through the elaborate security procedures that he himself had set up he considered that he had been coming here for more than a year now ever since this building had been erected yet the hero was still as much of an enigma to him as he had been the first day they met how this was possible mars could not imagine it was not that the hero was recalcitrant in any way he responded to interrogation with an openness even sometimes an eagerness that mars found commendable and yet mars still had no idea what went on inside the heros mind how he felt what he thought of anyone or anything it was as if they had shot a human being out into space and what had come back to them was some kind of an alien he had been changed of course there was the trauma to think of not only the sudden heartstopping death of the man he had trained with lived with lifted off withthe man who had his life in his handsbut also the shock of the damage to the spacecraft the certain knowledge that the mission had failed and the nagging fear that he would never get to see earth again and then there were the effectsstill unknown still being debated by the theoreticians and the scientistsof the seepage of cosmic rays through the fault in the heros eva suit all this had to be taken into account when one interviewed the hero and mars with great diligence did make allowances when trying to decipher his responses to no satisfactory conclusion where is he he said to tatiana one of the heros handpicked female companionguards as he gained the top floor in the pool comrade tatiana said is he alone lara is with him mars nodded the hero insisted on women and who was mars to deprive him of whatever pleasures were left to him heroes had earned the right to take their pleasures wherever they could find them increasingly it seemed the hero preferred water to land not surprising since alarmingly the scientists had discovered one of the effects of prolonged weightlessness was to weaken not only muscles but bones damaging the bones irreparably these days the hero looked something like the hunchback of notre dame by all accounts lara and tatiana the women assigned to him apparently did not find his physical appearance all that repugnant another mystery for mars to try to decipher he saw lara first her long muscular form clad only in a clinging americanstyle bathing suit stretched intriguingly over the edge of the saltwater pool as she fed the blue dolphin the dolphin had been installed in the pool about six months ago at first mars had balked at the outlandish request but then in her weekly debriefing lara had offered the startling opinion that the hero required companionship on a plane other than the ones she and tatiana could evidently provide mars heard the odd rhythmic clicking the dolphin used as its form of communication some weeks ago the monitoring had picked up two sets of this clicking in the dead of night and upon checking it had been discovered that the hidden microphones the concealed cameras could not penetrate the waterhad recorded the in the pool seemingly in verbal contact with the mammal lara turned when she heard his approach good morning comrade she said but she did not stop her feeding of the mammal as mars returned her greeting he saw the hero floating in the pool beside the dolphin it was odd and if mars were honest with himself a bit disquieting that there were so many similarities between the hero and the dolphin the radiation that the had been inadvertently exposed to in space had caused his skin to become slick and utterly hairless he dove and flashed through the water with the ease and apparent familiarity of one born to the sea he had even so lara had reported spoken to her about asking for an operation that would add membranes between his fingers and his toes mars did not in fact know whether or not he was serious the hero was prone not only to making bizarre requests but to playing eerie and disconcerting pranks on those who were observing and monitoring him once for instance he had placed his heart monitor over the dolphins heart instead of his own the hero mars had concluded may have been physically maimed in the event and as a result may or may not have been mentally scarred but he was still an exceedingly clever fellow mars had no illusions concerning the underlying reason for the pool the hero knew he was being observed listened in on monitored but in the water his time was his own and the cunning electronic eyes that followed him were blind there i am he often told mars like odysseus stranded on the island of polyphemous the first time to his delight and marss chagrin he had been obliged to explain that polyphemus was the name of the cyclops who odysseus by cunning and guile managed to defeat dont be embarrassed he had said with his poker face nowadays i have far more time to read than you do mars never knew whether he was being blandly pleasant or cynically ironic good morning viktor mars said how are you feeling today lousy the hero said and ive told you dont call me viktor i want no names connected with the event used here i should use it mars said sitting on the edge of the pool its your name he thought ah nothings changed ill tell you something which will no doubt come as a surprise to you the hero said i wont lie down i lived through a horror no man was meant to see let alone live through but the fact remains i did survive im alive and i will not go willingly into that unquiet night out there just because it may suit your purposes just because it will salve your embarrassment for me to be swept under the rug my comrades out there beyond these walls know im alive you cant hurt me and you cant kill me because theyll know the cosmonauts and theyll rebel you are afforded many privileges mars said softly lara tatiana the pool the dolphin especially the dolphin i brought them to you and i can take them away and i can stop talking the hero said to you and to everyone he looked at mars now what have we proved mars took a small fish from the bucket beside him dangled it over the water the dolphin stared at him then began a long series of clicks the hero threw his head back and laughed you know shes got a better sense of humor than the whole lot of you mars wrinkled his brow in annoyance what did the dolphin say her names arbat the hero admonished and she doesnt like you one bit mars bit his lip said as calmly as he could manage and did she say why first you dont use her name second she says youre not to be trusted mars made a sound of disgust it was intolerable that he should be forced into having a conversationif that was what you could call this farcewith a dolphin but he knew that in order to engage the hero he had to make the effort he said how would arbat know whether or not i can be trusted she wont even take the food i offer her a flood of clicking was followed by the saying if you give the fish to lara arbat will take it from her im disappointed mars said but he dutifully plopped the fish into laras palm immediately the dolphin dipped her head scooped the fish up swallowed it viktor mars said we must talk all right the hero stared up at mars but why must you insist on calling me viktor i told you not to use any of those names it was clear that he had once been exceedingly handsome but something inexplicable had happened to him up there in the heavens mars had seen photos of the hero before he had been fitted into the odingalaktika ii spacecraft and was launched into space this was not the same man oh surely the configuration of skull and skeleton were the same although he was far thinner now and walkedwhen he could walk at all rather than being confined to his special motorized wheelchairwith the lack of assurance and the brittleness of a man of ninety in fact that is what mars would have suspected happened to him up therethe answer to the mystery an unnaturally rapid aginghad it not been for the fact that the heros mind had not deteriorated one iota it merely had been altered and so the enigma continued to unfold like a complex origami in front of mars i call you viktor mars said because i must i have orders to do so he shifted to keep the floating man in sight if it helps i dont think of you as viktor but as the hero with a capital h a generic the hero said like a military rank i dont see it that way i dont think of you as the cosmonaut what can i do for you today volkov the hero seemed to have had enough of light banter and his change in tone put the dolphin on guard she was so mars had been informed extremely reactive to changes in the heros mental and emotional states arbat swam away from lara and her fish popped up beside the hero she started her incessant clicking mars had to keep a rein on his temper basic interrogation techniques called for a rhythm to be established once you got the subject used to answering questionsno matter how innocuousit was a much smaller step to get him to give you the answers you sought it was one thing to be interrupted by a colleague but to deal with the interference of an animal was too much he was about to shout when looking into the heros bland upturned face he began to suspect that this kind of disturbance was just what the hero had in mind the hero was not unaware of the principles of interrogation and it would be in character for him to use every method at his disposal to deflect his questions actually mars said i came here today to tell you that im tired of this little play weve been in its like being consigned to act in no exit for eternity some kind of bizarre purgatory im willing to call a beet a beet youve been put here more or less against your will but so have ii didnt ask for this assignment and i havent been happy with it as lousy as you feel day to day i feel almost as bad watching you suffer do you actually expect me to believe that shit id be naive if i did mars rose and walking about the room methodically disabled every listening watching and monitoring device lara stared at him with a kind of terror but the heros face was as bland as ever within thirty seconds they heard shoes pounding on the stairs and a clutch of the building personneltwo of them armed guardsburst into the room its nothing mars said i turned everything off go back to your posts but with the machines down one of the scientists complained we have nothing to do go have lunch mars said take a walk do what youve never done before enjoy the sunshine and the spring day with nothing on your minds i hope you have clearance for this another scientist said what youve done has serious implications get the hell out of my sight mars bellowed in an uncharacteristic display of temper and the clot of men disappeared in the silence that followed the hero said i want lara to stay as you wish and i want to come out of the water lara moved toward him but mars motioned her back he bent down gripped the hero under his arms brought him up over the coping of the pool lara went to get the wheelchair while mars propped the hero up began to pat him dry with one of a pile of enormous towels the hero wore no bathing suit when he was in the water and mars looked interestedly at his body his hairlessness was somehow fascinating and though he had to be pulled like a rag doll out of the damaged spacecraft upon landing his subsequent muscular rehabilitation had been remarkable and the color of his sleek skin which could only be described as a kind of pale silver like a star glowed in the indirect lights for the first time mars could sense why bent back or no bent back lara and tatiana found the hero sexually attractive together mars and lara maneuvered the hero into the wheelchair lara draped a fresh towel over his loins the hero disliked clothes perhaps mars surmised because they had become so damned inconvenient to get in and out of and they more than anything else in his daily life reminded him of his disabilities what name would you like me to use mars asked beginning the interrogation rhythm all over again i dont know but not viktor im not viktor of course youre not how about odysseus that blank face i promise i wont call you polyphemus mars waited a moment unsure whether this was a concession or another joke at his expense all right how are you sleeping odysseus i dont sleep the hero said at once this was a subject he liked i dream its not the same thing when you dream continuously youre not sleeping youre living but in an entirely different way youre in another state of consciousness mars had become used to this kind of talk and your dreams are filled with the wonder of space the hero said and of the stars i dream of the color i saw out there the color between the stars what color red green blue i cant tell you the hero said because its impossible to find words to describe it its not even as ephemeral a color as you know it what do you mean theres i dont know a substance to it a substance such as what like your spacecraft had substance no not like that at all there was a long pause during which mars glanced at lara she was sitting with her wrists on her knees gazing into the heros eyes mars wondered whether her loyalties were wavering then he immediately dismissed the thought he had chosen lara and tatiana himself he knew their backgrounds intimately so he knew where their loyalties lay it was just that he was paid to be paranoid nevertheless he told himself he mustnt allow the business of paranoia to become an obsession that would clearly undermine his current work the hero cleared his throat ive thought about this ever since i first awoke he said after a long time and i believe that what i saw out there was the color of god mars was interested in this why do you think that because its what the dreams tell me over and over in as many different ways as there are faces on the people of this planet lara mars said do you believe him yes the hero looked at her tell volkov what you would tell him if this was one of your weekly debriefings lara was clearly stunned and mars only a bit less so how did the hero know about the debriefings the hero gave mars a canny look lets call a beet a beet yes mars considered this challenge then he nodded at lara tell me lara looked from the hero to himi believe him she said her voice echoing out over the gently lapping pool where arbat was watching them mars took some time to work this through perhaps he said to the hero your dreams tell you that you are god a smile spread slowly from the comers of the heros mouth when it reached his eyes he said im not mad volkov to intimate so is futile and worse for you foolish i withdraw the intimation mars said immediately accepting this little defeat as gracefully as he was able you understand it was something i felt compelled to ask and i ask myself why the hero regarded him its not such a great secret although ill bet anything you think it is theres only one thing that makes this discussion meaningful volkov and its that like me you believe in god no dont bother to deny it know youre doing it for laras sake you neednt bother for one thing lara too believes in god so does arbat so for once were all agreed on one matter and a monumental one it is too for another thing lara belongs to you hook line and soul now isnt that ironic in a country that professes to put no value on the capitalistic notion of possessions i see your lips moving volkov whats that speak up heresy you say all right then we both have heretical thoughts you see youre no better than i am though i can hardly expect you to agree with me mars glared at the hero as if with his gaze he could burn out the mysterious alterations the void of space had worked on that mind the presence of god said the hero is something we all feel its what binds the four of us even though four more divergent creatures could hardly exist in one place or perhaps its our belief in him that has brought us together i dont want to speak about god mars said then by all means well change the subject the hero said sardonically i wouldnt want you to feel discomfited in any way he smiled although it was hardly a benign expression but before we do ill say one thing more ive got your weakness down pat mars found to his shame that his mouth was dry he longed for a glass of water but to ask lara to get him one would be unthinkable he could just imagine the hero laughing at him and what is that he managed to get out its essentially this you dont know what happened to me up there so no matter what stories i give you no matter what i say you cannot altogether disbelieve me because even though i dont think of myself as god in one sense ive become like god you know absolutely nothing about me youre a man just like im a man were both human beings nothing more but mars said this with far more conviction than he felt you know volkov the two of us remind me of a pair of rival spanish gypsies weve challenged each other to a duel were bound together by a sixfoot cord but weve somehow lost our stabbing knives our conventional weapons and now were desperately trying to come up with an alternate way inside each others defenses stalemate that smile hard as steel widening or is it have you figured it out yet havent you seen its shape emerging from the darkness hasnt our duel rather evolved into a war of wits were not on opposite sides mars said im not sure where you got the idea that i am your enemy the hero said nothing he was watching arbat in the pool what do you and the dolphin talk about mars said suddenly arbat arbat mars conceded we discuss the universe the hero said still looking at the dolphin the complexity of existence the diversity of knowledge we also contemplate the nature of death mars was staring at lara but apparently she did not think this exchange at all amusing or even odd mars abruptly felt an acute sense of dislocation what is going on here he asked himself one of us in this room appears to be mad but the curious thing is i dont know who it is what happened up there in space in odingalaktika ii mars said we lost contact with you the event took place i know it was a long time ago not for me the hero said it happened yesterday well i know in some circumstances it must seem like it happened yesterday the hero repeated he raised his hands cupped them into a hollow sphere because ive learned how to bend time in the same way youve learned how to bend light rays and that was another of his disconcerting dislocating idiosyncrasies the kept saying you instead of us as if he no longer belonged to the human race how many times in the past fifteen months since i came out of the coma have you asked me what happened and how many times have i told you too many to count mars thought the trouble was no one believed him how could they he said nevertheless id appreciate it if you would tell me again again the hero asked or one more time the two men grinned at each other and mars thought hes quite right this is a war of wits i must ensure that he doesnt win it we had put the mars module components together in earths orbit the hero began everything was going just fine we were working well together i guess in the end you were right in paring the crew down from ten to two we never would have made it in such a huge module it was very difficult putting together the sections of the smaller module you sent up in different payloads we blasted out of earths orbit into the mars injection trajectory we began the next phase of the mission we were well past the gravitational pull of the moon how incredible it was to see that satellite up close for those moments of the flyby i was a child again staring up through a clear winters sky and wondering whats it like up there now i knew and it was giving me the chills i was actually sick from the sight of it as if it were too much to take in as if i were moses approaching the burning bush but of course i was wrong that would come later we were in deep space mars was beckoning us like a red titan we slept like dead men we were told that would happen on a mission of almost three years day fatigue sets in because we were hooked up to mission control you knew just when we were awake and when we were asleep the funny thing was that i never dreamed i know ive said this over and over to the psychiatrists and they dont believe me because the hard medical evidence refutes it they told me your readouts showed i had rem every night cycle they insisted i dreamed that i just never remembered my dreams well i may have had rapid eye movement but i tell you that i did not dream i have always remembered my dreams ever since i was a little boy and i think now that one reason i didnt dream was because i felt as if i was dreaming while i was awake another thing is that the psychiatrists said i talk altogether too much about dreams they say im fixated on dreams but in the scheme of what happened to me up there im convinced that not dreaming is significant even if no one else does i know they think im lying or at least delusional about what happened during the event otherwise i wouldnt still be here and you wouldnt continue to interrogate me i know what youre like you hate a mystery youll tear apart heaven and earth to solve it the hero abruptly began to laugh continuing in a crescendo through his tears he gasped heaven and earth thats very very funny i dont know whats come over me before i lifted off i never had much of a sense of humor who knows perhaps being suspended between heaven and a living hell will do that for you mars felt he had to pierce the encroaching silence before it got impenetrable what happened to gregor he said no names the hero shouted he was extremely agitated goddamnit i told you i warned you but youre a thick sonuvabiteh you never listen now fuck off im sorry mars said i apologize i forgot like hell you did the hero turned away began an incomprehensible conversation of clicks with arbat mars looked at lara her face was calm firm did he see the hint of a rebuke in her expression he tried again what should we call your partner who died odysseus did you hear me menelaus the hero said without turning away from arbat all right what happened to menelaus he died the hero said suddenly he was outside we were both suited up although i was still inside the vehicle it was a typical eva planned way in advance everything was fine until he was silent for a long time what i think happened was that we encountered some kind of storm in the form of a shower of tiny particles like minuscule meteors i heard a hollow sound like someone throwing a handful of sand at the vehicles hull then i heard his voice it was already breaking up and i knew it was an emergency i put on my helmet got out of the airlock as quickly as i could what i saw his helmet had been pierced by the burst of cosmic storm we were hanging in darkness but there was this light all around i dont mean starlight thats separate and distinct i saw what had happened to him in the illumination of this light between the stars his visor had been riddled by the sand of space or of a far distant world who knows the truth we never will thats for certain all the atmosphere the pressure had been sucked out of his eva suit in the time it took me to get to him he was hanging there at the end of his umbilical the expulsion from inside his suit had created a force and he was spinning spinning his eyes were staring straight ahead and he was i dont know how to say this properly because it was so horrible he was smiling as if in defiance of the bruises and contusions that puckered his face like the seas of the moon then i had him stopped his spinning and drew him back toward the vehicle i knew he was dead i knew there was nothing i could do for him then i got a good look at his face it was as if i dont know something had blasted his eyes at first i assumed some of the cosmic sand had penetrated him but then i knew that couldnt be because only his eyes were affected silence again and mars was obliged to say what happened to menelauss eyes what did you see there the hero put his head down whats the use of going on you wont believe me because your forensic evidence contradicts my story no the evidence doesnt corroborate what youve told us that isnt the same thing forensics on menelaus were utterly inconclusive the truth is we could tell nothing from his corpse it was as if it had been wiped clean of evidence how did he die what happened to cause his suit to malfunctionor yours format matterwhat happened to him during those crucial minutes when he was on the eva when you were struggling to get to him of one thing were sure there was an interplanetary disturbance of some sort our telemetry went down during the event we had no monitoring capability we dont know the hero raised himself up in his wheelchair ive told you what happened yes mars said slowly you have but no one believes me frankly what youve told us makes belief somewhat difficult mars nodded yes there are some who think youre lying or have misremembered or are delusional the heros eyes locked on marss are you one of those he knew this was a crucial moment there comes a time in every interrogation when the pendulum begins to swing the other way when psychologically an enemy can be transformed into a friend this moment comes for many reasons the subject wants an end to isolation or he can no longer distinguish the truth from fantasy or his disorientation has become so acute he cannot properly recognize his own emotions the hero was far stronger and smarter man the average subject in his case he had asked the fatal question because mars had allowed him to see partway inside of him the hero required a kindred spirit someone beyond either lara or arbat who were both incomplete entities though in totally different ways mars knew immediately that the hero would sense a lie he was vulnerable but that only made him doubly dangerous mars would not fall into the trap that had destroyed many an interrogator mistaking vulnerability for weakness mars said the truth is i dont know what to believe the forensics are useless and those of us who stubbornly cling to scientific principles are i think missing the point he left his hands open and palms up as a subtle reinforcement i dont believe youre lying what reason would you have to do so and the chances of you misremembering are in my opinion too remote to consider but i might be delusional as you yourself said no one knows what happened to you up there all im certain of is we cant dismiss outright what youve told us which is why id like to hear it again not from a tape made a month or a year ago but from you now mars could almost see the heros mind turning over what it had just heard it was fascinating like watching a snake digesting its prey at length the hero nodded i remember this in the most minute detail it was his eyes menelauss eyes there were no pupils at all it was as if the irises had grown inward and outward it was as if his eyes were now all color and what color his eyes had taken on that color the color between the stars the color of god mars said he spoke to you is that right the corpse opened its mouth and no no the hero shook his head this isnt something out of a sciencefiction or a horror film he didnt come back from the dead nor was he animated like a zombie or a golem this was something else something that i think youd have to see for yourself to fully believe i still dont understand it even after fifteen months of contemplating it from all angles physical metaphysical philosophical religious it wasnt magic volkov im not a fool and it wasnt illusion the took a deep breath the truth of the matter is the corpse did not move its lips it did not speak to me but something communicated through it through its eyes do you begin to understand were not confronting any conventional method of communication as we know it not even telepathy nevertheless there was a message in those eyes in that world of unspeakable color mars was aware of lara leaning forward slipping her hand into the heros mars took his cue from her and what was the communication he asked gently the heros eyes were dark swirling with emotion he uttered a harsh russian expletive dont you people understand anything he cried thats what i meant by my being suspended between heaven and a living hell i was given a message but i dont know what it is it was a perfect day for arkhangelskoe cool crisp cloudless one arrived in the beautiful countryside surrounding the estate by taking the kutuzov prospekt out of the center of moscow picking up the minsk road making a right onto the rublevo road a left onto the uspenskoe road all the way to the right fork that took you across the moskva river and thence southwest into arkhangelskoe this was the route valeri bondasenko took he went once a week but never on the same day and never at the same time the estate consisted of a stuccooverwood late eighteenthcentury palace with its signature belvedere and a beautiful park on the verge of a vast pine and birch forest tourists flocked here in good weather to wander take photos and picnic valeri came here to partake of none of those pastoral pleasures instead he circumnavigated arkhangelskoe taking the narrow road that skirted the forest to the east and then curved north on the far side of the forest was a rather austere stone and mortar structure through whose forbidding gates valeri drove he parked beside delivery vans shabby volgas and zhigulis without windshield wipers inside the place smelled of disinfectant and in places vomit whitecoated nurses hurried to and fro thickshouldered sternvisaged here and there a male attendant with a truncheon on his hip could be seen peering through meshreinforced windows set in the doors at eye level to call this place an insane asylum would perhaps be harsh but it would nevertheless be correct valeri hated this place it reminded him of everything that was wrong with the world the dimly lit halls might have smelled of chemicals and offal but the place reeked of despair the personnel were just as much to blame for this as were the inmates this was a terminus point for them worse than a backwater a sentence to be served with the patience of the penitent except there was no escape from this place either by the inmates or by their wardens everyone here was serving a life sentence and their invisible secretions oozed through the corridors like putrefaction through a swamp when valeri arrived back in moscow from his sojourns here he invariably found himself stripping off his clothes plunging himself into an icecold shower scrubbing himself with tallowrich soap washing and washing what was he trying to get off filth was easy to wash down the drain but memories were another story altogether memory existed independently of conscious thought or so it seemed to valeri he was an ardent student of jung and had seen in several of his interlocking concepts a compression of time a commingling of pastpresentfuture that was fundamental to all human beings as if each culture were not in fact separate but rather a different quadrant of one gigantic spiders web and what was there glistening at the webs center but a central core a past that was true for all men this included mans abilityyes perhaps even a desireto be inhuman to his fellow man homicidemass murderwas such an inadequate way to describe over the course of history what man insisted on perpetrating against his neighbor especially his neighbor was it so very long ago that valeris uncle had been shot in the streets of kievthe capital of the ukrainefor daring to speak ukrainian a bulgariancan you imaginehad been the president of the ukraine then catspaw to the rulers in moscow and he had stated publicly that to sanction the use of the ukrainian language would be reactionary of interest only to a minority the kulaksthe ukrainian peasantswho broke their backs to harvest wheat for all of russia and the intelligentsia so a russian soldier one of so many in kiev had walked up to valeris uncle and put a bullet through his head guilty as charged your honor boom and what of valeris father it was valeri knew better not to contemplate his ultimate fate it was so very russian and so very terrible valeri shook himself as he stepped outside onto the shaded lawn his gaze followed the greensward as it ran down to the beginning of the pine and birch forest on whose far side invisible now as unimaginable amid this noisome clamor as a fairytale castle lay beautiful arkhangelskoe why these dark thoughts comrade kolchev valeri heard dr kalinins voice and he knew he tamed forced a smile onto his face nodded doctor its good of you to come dr kalinin said in much the same tone of voice one hears in a funeral home valeri was convinced that dr kalinin did not mean to sound like a mortician he just couldnt help himself it was this place or more accurately what inhabited this place that was to blame when one spent ones days and nights with the living dead one could not help but be affected in some way dr kalinin was a young man with thin light hair and eyes sunken into his cheeks valeri could not imagine what he had done to be consigned to this purgatory at so early an age and he had no desire to find out still he pitied the doctor you must get more sun valeri said indicating the cloudless day too much time indoors is bad for ones health ah the long winter dr kalinin said now that its spring things will be different but his morose expression betrayed him as it told the truth here it will never be different than it is right now valeri stuffed his hands into his trouser pockets led the way out over the lawn which was dotted here and there with chairs inhabited by mentally and emotionally shrunken creatures pathetic husks overseen by attendants looming in their frail shadows valeri needed to get as much space as he could between himself and the godawful corridors of the place he still had their stench in his nostrils and he felt like gagging that would be something to talk about he thought throwing up all over the good doctors shoes so sorry comrade but this place you work in turns my stomach you do understand dont you shes awake dr kalinin said broaching the subject they both knew was so fragile im sure shed be delighted to see you why does he keep doing this valeri asked himself why draw the veil of illusion over any of this and then he had his answer it was obvious really how else could dr kalinin live with himself in this hideous den of horrors some sense of normalcy needed to be imposed on the abnormal the heart of anarchy the eye of chaos otherwise the madness that crept through these corridors would one day curl around your spinal cord and infect you that explanation notwithstanding valeri would be goddamned if hed allow this man to impose his lunatic set of rules on him he said doctor my daughter hasnt been delighted by anything in her entire life she isnt capable of delight although god knows the poor thing certainly feels despair im aware of it as soon as i come near her its as palpable as the scent of a rose he thought it haunts my dreams perhaps these visits would become easier to handle if you could manage to come more often valeri stood stockstill his hands clenched into white fists do you understand me at all doctor he thought do you know that there are timeslike nowwhen id cheerfully shoot you between the eyes and never feel a moments remorse of course you cant know otherwise you wouldnt be standing here with that prissy superior expression on your face its true i pity you but i also hate your guts your daughter is normal and healthy and mine is i come as often as i am able of course you do comrade i was only making a clinical suggestion one that i think would be helpful for your daughter you idiot dont you understand that my daughter is beyond the help of your antiquated theories valeri wanted to shout but of course he could do no such thing he was here as a private citizen comrade kolchev a machinist with no ties to anyone in government let alone to the politburo in his positionwith so many enemies circling him at a respectful distancevaleri knew that his daughter could only be a liability a fatal weakness he could not afford her existence a pry bar to lever him out of power otherwise he thought why in the name of all thats holy would i have allowed her to be put in a backwater pesthole like this valeri said in a perfectly normal voice my daughter does not know who i am doctor it makes no difference to her whether or not i come to see her let alone how many times a week i come she absorbs nothing from her surroundings am i getting through to you its true that she has no manifest reaction comrade but can we really presume to know what goes on in her mind doctor youre a bug a worm a slimy toad valeri thought the way you look down on me makes me want to puke but you know what ill never let on thats how i feel through a complex set of circumstances even i cant undo youre in charge of my daughter and i dont want to antagonize you even a little because even with a mind empty of thought my daughter is precious to me youre right of course valeri said one mustnt give up hope must one dr kalinin smiled now thats the spirit why dont you wait here comrade as is your custom and ill fetch her for you thats very kind of you valeri said though he was quite certain that even one glance at his daughters blank face today would set him to screaming i appreciate all your help im glad to be of service dr kalinin said striding off purposefully back to his house of horrors valeri strolled farther down the lawn until he came to a large birch tree there was a slatbacked wooden bench facing it and he sat in it beside him a slender young man sat with his face turned up to the sun his hair was long and lank and he had a strawberry birthmark on his cheek have you heard the latest comrade the young man said the nationalist group white star has forced the administration to abandon its underground nuclear testing in semipalatinsk is that so valeri said i thought it was stopped because of the protests of a kazakhstanian environmental group hah the young man said government propaganda it was white star i tell you white star everywhere he went it seemed valeri heard the name white star he did not look at the young man stared instead at the birch tree he liked this spot principally he thought because the old birch reminded him of the one outside his childhood home in kiev but then seeping into his thoughts the gunshot his uncles blood staining the streets the russian soldier kicking the stillwarm corpse saying a lesson learned eh comrade and valeris father opening his mouth about to say something then turning away tears in his eyes how many times had his father told him that story until it seemed that he had been there at his fathers side holding his hand father how could they have done that to you far better not to think of what had happened so many years ago but as jung would say no time at all pain beat like a hammer on an anvil in valeris soul a russian as well as a ukrainian soul it never forgot five minutes later dr kalinin appeared by that time valeri was alone the young man with the strawberry birthmark having wandered away at dr kalinins side was a paleskinned young girl it occurred to valeri that it was impossible to tell his daughters age from either her face or her unformed body she was eighteen but her years on this earth had been nothing more than a dream a whisper of the wind a cry for help lost in the forest echoing so far away that valeri did not even know where to search looking at her thick golden hair her blue eyes her pristine beauty he resolved again to come to grips with the fact that she was beyond his help but more than anything in the world he wanted to communicate with her and he valeri denysovich bondasenko supreme pragmatist could not reconcile himself to this reality dr kalinin turned valeris daughter to face him and valeri said koshka darling and despite himself despite the presence of dr kalinin a tear leaked out of his eye ran down his cheek to drop at his feet my granny once told me a proverb strangers begin with your own family big ezoe said you would do well to remember that honno said there are only strangers in my world now she used the word hito which could be translated as people but always with a pejorative twist to it hito were never insiders they were always strangers i want to thank you for moving me out of eikichis house honno went on i have asked nothing of him except that i never see him again they were sitting on a sofa in an apartment of considerable size big ezoe was in a dark business suit honno in a pair of natural silk city shorts and long shirtjacket an outfit she had just bought lamps of various sizes and shapes illuminated a room filled with chic contemporary western furniture they had just returned from a long leisurely dinner in a rough smoky restaurant surrounded by sumo wrestlers busily consuming everything in sight outside the last vestiges of moonlight were about to be obscured by scudding storm clouds i trust youre pleased with your new accommodations big ezoe said spreading his arms wide its magnificent honno said she got up went to the windows i always dreamed of having an apartment that overlooked the sumida look moonlight on the river its like a woodblock print she felt as if she were seeing the city from an entirely new perspective she turned to face big ezoe im still in something of a state of shock and part of that i suppose is intimidation the size of this place is immense so very american big ezoe laughed its true that my american friends feel at home here they always feel so crowded and cramped in tokyo they tell me theyre grateful to stay here you neednt worry honno said immediately concerned i wont be here long big ezoe waved a hand stay as long as you need to he said i have many such apartments all across tokyo well theres the expense to think of why should you think of it big ezoe said i dont honno looked at him and he nodded now youre thinking why is he doing this what does he want from me and when is he going to exact his price no i its perfectly natural to have such thoughts first i am yakuza second you hate my guts you yourself said as much when we met again this is not a combination to inspire a sense of trust is it honno found it impossible to answer she had never before encountered anyone who had the temerity to be so direct to cut through the layers of ritualized fabrication that seemed an integral part of every conversation but the fact is that my interest is a simple one the evidence of wrongdoing your friend kakuei sakata left behind in those cryptic ledgers i have many important ties to the business community i dont know what sakata knew what he had gotten hold of but it is important for me to find out before anyone else does and leaks it to the authorities such as your husband but it is time to get on with things are you ready mrs kansei big ezoe produced a memo pad tore off the top sheet of paper handed it to her this is your itinerary for tonight please follow it i promise you will be neither disappointed nor bored theres a car waiting for you downstairs the driver has a copy of the itinerary and hes familiar with all the venues but what about giin and the ledgers ill meet you at the ginza club at six tomorrow morning and well discuss everything then big ezoe rose now i must leave you enjoy yourself tonight mrs kansei there was indeed a driver waiting for honno outside he bowed opened the back door of a pearlgray sel mercedes with tinted windows the night air was already heavy with hints of the coming bad weather honno ducked into the cool dimly lit interior found someone already in the backseat good evening mrs kansei a thin young man said pleasantly he wore his thick hair slicked back over his delicate ears a pair of wide masculine sunglasses was wrapped around his eyes he was dressed in an immaculate dovegray summerweight suit with a starched white shirt and a rep tie honno noticed gold cuff links and a ring that appeared to be a nugget of gold i am fukuda he said big ezoe asked me to be your guide tonight will that be convenient there was no interrogative at the end of the sentence and therefore it lost its usual meaning the enormous mercedes was already slipping effortlessly through the choked tokyo streets how it was able to do that honno could not imagine it was as if she had entered another world someplace that most people never knew existed let alone ever got to see a world where the natural laws of physics economics and social customs were void a world of smoke and dreams honno put her head back luxuriating in the feel of the german leather and thought of nothing their first stop was in shinjuku honno and fukuda rode the highspeed elevator to the fortieth floor he led her down a corridor filled only with the hushed whisper of the airconditioning fukuda produced a key they slipped through a small door just down the hall from a set of imposing double doors on which was painted one character in kanji kaga along with the corporate logo in threedimensional bronze which was as universally known as that of mitsubishi or panasonic the rooms through which they passed like ghosts were silent save for the battery of fax machines running now and again like arcane radios picking up the random conversation of the cosmos sending out their own messages in timed sequence to australia west germany me united states on and on a bizarre automated communication among masses of electronic circuits and silicone chips whole cities of a new civilization at length fukuda turned a doorknob and as he did so he put his forefinger briefly across honnos lips shhh honno found herself in a secretarys anteroom the window behind the empty desk had its blinds up and a brilliant shaft of light shot outward fukuda led her around to an area of shadow where they could stand and peer into the inner office assured of not being seen themselves inside a heavyset middleaged man was busy on the sofa with a woman who had her skirt up over her hips fukuda put his lips to honnos ear the man is kagas senior vicepresident of finance does the woman look familiar honno looked was stunned to recognize mamasan from the house that big ezoe owned where they had discovered her husband with his lover honno watched fascinated as the kaga vicepresident worked assiduously on his own pleasure it was odd she thought how incongruous even grotesque the act could appear without the elusive ingredient of sexual attraction the one true magic potionpassionwas the great leveler that cut through race religion even class honno considered it the most powerful force on earth how many great men had been laid low by their lust fukuda gestured and honno followed him silently back through the maze of offices the whining fax machines downstairs the streets were slick with moisture a kind of precipitation was falling on tokyo that could not quite be called rain it had picked up so much of the industrial pollutants in the air that it fell like sleet though the temperature was warm one day the japanese would find a term for it just as they would find a way to describe the automatic nocturnal conversations between faxes the purring mercedes took honno and fukuda onward through the nocturnal traffic deep into the heart of shinjuku dark with forbidden pleasures despite the sprays of brilliant neon shooting up the sides of buildings reflected endlessly in glass towers spreading like dye along the wet tarmac of the streets the mercedes slid to a stop in front of an udona noodle parlor fukuda took honno through the dingy steamy restaurant down a long dark hallway that echoed with the tiny sounds of the city seeping through the walls like sweat they entered what was obviously a yakuza gambling house long low tables were set out upon the floor around which were arrayed an interesting melange of men they were illuminated by wideshaded lamps hung by cords from the ceiling fukuda and honno kept to the shadows ringing the walls honno could see the irizumicovered yakuza their fantastically conceived tattoos given a life of their own by the movements of their bodies as they moved packets of money around the tables this was no local gambling house these were games played for the highest possible stakes and now honno began to concentrate on the faces that belonged to the gamblers the conservatively dressed immaculately groomed sobervisaged men men such as she had seen every day of her business week trooping in and out of kunio michitas office fukuda leaned unobtrusively toward her whispered the third man on your left the one with the pencil mustache and the largest bets in the house he is the senior vicepresident for administration for kaga honno watched as if enwrapped by a kind of enchantment as the senior kaga officer proceeded to lose yen approximately in just over an hour by that time his hair was disheveled his tie was askew there was sweat beading his pencilthin mustache and he was frantically writing out a marker for an equal amount the marker was passed from one yakuza to another until at length it arrived at the head of the table a bald man with the image of a dragon tattooed on his shining skull took the slip read it then he looked up pokerfaced with a little thrill honno saw that he was looking directly at fukuda fukuda gave an almost imperceptible nod and the man with the dragon tattoo pocketed the marker slapped three packets of yen onto the table had them passed to the kaga officer honno was wondering just how deeply big ezoes claws had penetrated the kaga conglomerate when they arrived at their third destination they were still within the precincts of shinjuku but this was the far side where sleazy streets were inhabited by all manner of nocturnal creature where it was often not safe to walk deep in the night when these creatures slithered out of their lairs honno had certainly heard enough stories of this section of shinjukuevery resident of tokyo had she imaginedbut she had never been near it have no fear mrs kansei fukuda said as if reading her mind you are with me they stepped out onto the rainswept streets it was now well after midnight there was a scent honno was not familiar with it was the stench of the effluvia of a large cityany citywhere a certain section of human wreckage congregated the psychologically halted the emotionally crippled the perverse and the perverted caged sent down inhabiting a nighttime netherworld in the bowels of the city the mercedes had stopped opposite a dark bridge over which rumbled an endless line of trucks which only had access to tokyos streets during the night fukuda did not lead honno across the bridge but rather took her down under it she could hear the lapping of the river against ancient wooden pilings and the stench of decomposition was very strong they went into a building honno recognized it as an akachochin an assignation bar where anything and everything could be boughtfor a price in the unpleasant crimson illumination of its interior honno saw beautifully clothed and coiffed women whispering on the arms of salesmen lowlevel businessmen who could not afford the more affluent afterhours clubs in nihonbashi or the ginza where even the price of one drink could take your breath away the man directly in front of you fukuda said unexpectedly the distinguished one with the thick gray hair is the chairman of kaga he comes here because of his sexual proclivities he is certain that no one who would recognize him would ever frequent such a dive but hes wrong honno said youve recognized him we are always wrong fukuda said cryptically big ezoe owns this akachochin you would be astounded at the wide range of information that may be acquired in places such as this fukuda nodded now watch as we walk past the creature who has the chairmans undivided attention honno kept her eyes on the beautifully dressed woman on the kaga chairmans arm as they passed the couple honno stifled a gasp of recognition the woman was a man a transvestite outside the akachochin honno breathed deeply she welcomed the rain pattering down on her how her perceptions had changed the night air filled with decomposition seemed almost pure compared to the atmosphere inside gravid with sinister lusts in the sanctuary and comfort of the mercedes they slipped across the river headed toward the bright lights the modern high rises of an entirely different tokyo in the akasaka district the mercedes sped them toward the capitol tokyo hotel in the origami coffee house fukuda ordered them the justly famous german apple pancakes honno found that she had no appetite she watched in a kind of numbed silence as fukuda ate his food then determining she had no intention of eating hers cut into her pancakes five minutes after he had finished as if on cue he turned toward the entrance to the restaurant honno followed his gaze saw to her amazement her boss kunio michita walk through the door he spoke briefly to the hostess who seated him at a table with a man honno had not noticed before now she did he was the finance minister of japan the two men bowed cordially to one another and began to talk in animated fashion they ordered only coffee but hardly touched their order minutes later they got up to leave fukuda paid the check and took honno out they followed the two men out into the semidarkness of the night all around them glittering high rises bespoke the enormous wealth of the new japan honno could find nothing strange in this assignation she saw only two men meeting for a friendly discussion it was then that she saw the buffcolored envelope pass from kunio michitas hand to that of the finance ministers it was quickly put away in the finance ministers inside jacket pocket the men continued their stroll their talk as if nothing had happened ten minutes later they parted fukuda and honno continued their walk through akasaka honno thought of the fantastic run of luck michita industries had had over the past year winning bids coming in at just the right time on governmentsponsored projects always being eligible for government incentives in new and emerging industries closing down divisions just before the ministries declared their product obsolete or nonpriority now she knew that luck had nothing to do with it no wonder it had not rubbed off on her all around them the superstructure of tokyo rose into the clouds and the rain the sky was so low it was bright with the citys efflorescence tokyo stood as a modern miracle of terraforming honno had always loved this city but now as if with a twist of a kaleidoscope she was seeing it from another vantage point she remembered at the beginning of this evening looking out the window of the apartment big ezoe had given her seeing the moonlight play across the bosom of the sumida river a dream of hers had been fulfilled but now she had been exposed to the opposite side of that dream a nightmarish world that harbored every form of perversion corruption and deceit and these two worlds were part of the same tokyo her tokyo my god she thought what ive witnessed is monstrous how will i ever fall in love with tokyo again fukuda led her into a small park there was one stone bench honno could hear the soft tinkling of a stream but she could not see it they sat on the bench which had a view of the parks lone tree a cryptomeria that leaned far to its right as if caught in a high wind i particularly enjoy this spot fukuda said as if to himself often i find the grid of the city overly grim like staring at a detailed blueprint for far too long its beauty is leached away by familiarity then i come here and look at this cryptomeria poor tree honno said it looks as if the hand of god has mauled it on the contrary fukuda said it seems to me that the cryptomerias beauty is transfigured made awesome by its pain look the stark contrast of its bark and needles to the backdrop of steel and glass and neon the twisting of its trunk arcs against the rectangles of the buildings whether nature or man is responsible for the trees form no one can say and then honno understood what fukuda meant it did not matter which was responsible for the trees form nature and man were here become one this was the purpose of the cryptomeria as if by its tortured appearance it could bring meaning out of the inchoate meaninglessness of the city yes honno said i believe i too would enjoy coming back here from time to time it was nearly three am their last stop was a bunkerlike building in shimabashi it was made of ferroconcrete and was absolutely featureless an ultramodern edifice set off by the older buildings that surrounded it inside was a world of semidarkness similar to what one found in the heart of a forest you may change in there fukuda said indicating a door honno went through stripped bathed clothed herself in a fresh white gi the cotton divided skirt the loose overblouse of the martial arts discipline she was alone in the dojo for several minutes it was very different from the one she worked in with big ezoe at his club in the ginza this space was darker far more forbidding she felt as if she were deep in the castle keep of the shogun ieyasu tokugawa fukuda soon appeared he was wearing a protective wiremesh mask and carrying two bokken the traditional wooden swords used in kenjutsu practice instead of the steel katana he also carried another mask how are your swordfighting skills mrs kansei fukuda asked as he threw her a bokken and the mask and began his advance all in one movement honno did not even have time to answer him he took her through the entire range of attack and parry strategies from firecut to fallen leaves from sealand change to crossing at the ford honno did her best to respond but she was unused to being up all night and this combined with the shocks she had received while walking tokyos seamy underbelly caused her focus to wander and consequently made this an inauspicious time to work on her kenjutsu however as she well knew one could rarely choose the time of battle and so one needed to concentrate within and through every conceivable type of situation so she gathered herself bore down a little harder with her mind and with her body and from this determination she discovered something interesting fukuda was toying with her she could sense it now that she was concentrating in the laziness of his parries in the haphazard manner with which he chose to move from strategy to strategy there was as a foundation of honnos curriculum in kenjutsu the necessity to unlock the secret of your opponents strategy with that knowledge one divined weaknesses as well as strengths now ones own strategy was quickly formed a series of attacks and parries building in a kind of crescendo to weaken the opponent bit by bit to strip him of his defenses and then to attack with the one swift fatal strike what was fukudas strategy his haphazardness made his intentions impossible to fathom but the real question was was he merely sloppy or was he being devious was he hiding his strategy or did he in fact have none honnos kenjutsu sensei had told her that it was far better to overestimate an opponent than to underestimate him with this in mind honno kept her concentration strong and slowly expanded her wa she did not seek in any overt way to take control of the match this she suspected was just what fukuda wanted her to do and in becoming careless to fall into a trap he had tying in wait for her she had not forgotten me lesson learned in her aikido bout with big ezoe and she was determined not to repeat her mistake to the untrained eye nothing appeared to have altered in the match fukuda was still dictating the random flow of strategies but the slow expansion of honnos wa was making its presence felt she attacked with more strength parried with greater swiftness counterattacked with more terror slowly she was moving the field of battle across the tatami mats of the dojo until fukuda was nearly backed up against the edge of the battlefield to step outside the perimeter onto the polished wooden floor would mean defeat now honno expanded her wa to its fullest and as she did so her body went limp the bokken dropped from her hands and as fukudas wooden sword slashed downward at her head she reached up caught it between the palms of her hands fukuda immediately stopped bowed to honno big ezoe was indeed correct about your warriors spirit but i am a woman honno said and history records so few women warriors fukuda took off the protective mask and honno gaped at the face beneath is that you honno whispered coming closer the real you the face that without lipstick behind a pair of mans sunglasses had seemed so handsomely masculine had now been transformed into a paradigm of feminine beauty and in that transformation honno saw the falseness in the concepts of handsome and beautiful with which she had been brought up she saw only the truth of the reality that fukuda had brought home to her perception of the world and how it was constructed was nothing more than a spiderweb of lessons absorbed with your mothers milk i too am a woman mrs kansei fukuda said i am sensei in sixteen separate martial arts her dark eyes shone not with pride but in reflection of the revelation she recognized illuminating honnos face i have defeated more men than i can count in the kind of kenjutsu match we have just completed i urge you to believe me when i tell you that the warrior spirit resides in us both now they left the dojo their field of battle their place of coming together and they showered together dressed together and went back out into the waning night it was close to five am and honno wondered what they were going to do until six when she was to meet big ezoe at his ginza club she soon had her answer the mercedes glided back toward the futuristic colossi of shinjuku the streets were emptying even of the trucks their rumbling across the bridges spanning the sumida came like distant thunder endless echoing through the deep canyons of the city in twenty minutes they were back in front of the udon parlor in the rear the gambling was still going full force honno thought they might have been gone five minutes rather than five hours the place stank of stale cigarette smoke and staler bodies the atmosphere of frenzy had not abated and with a quick contraction of her stomach she remembered her father how many nights had he spent on his knees throwing away money in just such a gambling house more than there were trees in the forests of yoshino his fate had been death by obsession a finding no coroner could ever make but it was the truth nonetheless the same shirtless yakuza knelt on the floor their fantastic irizumi sheened with sweat the same players pushed their packets of money onto the center of the low tables though the long night was near its end the players were not weary on the contrary their eyes were feverbright their nerves at hairtrigger level though their victory was still as far away as it had been when the night began they saw it as being closer than ever this was the dangerous delusion of their obsession the one that always took them down now soon or later it didnt matter because that one end would come inevitably tragically honno focused on the senior vicepresident of administration for kaga without fukuda having to tell her he had just lost another round and was scrabbling in his pocket he pulled out a pad wrote out another marker signed it how many did that make tonight how much money did the pile of markers in concert represent my god honno thought how often can he afford to do this the kaga senior vicepresident passed his marker and he followed it with his avid eyes as it made its way from yakuza to yakuza all the way down the table until it came to rest before the bald man with the dragon tattooed on his gleaming skull the dragon man did not even look at the marker instead his gaze rose to meet fukudas fukuda made no move she whispered to honno what would you have me do accept kagas marker or turn it down i havent any of the facts honno said theyre irrelevant fukuda said yes or no tell me i dont know what to do yes fukuda said you know as well as i do what must be done it is time you took the responsibility for it your warriors spirit needs responsibility in order to survive and to flourish honno stared from the dragon man to the kaga official she should have been thinking of her father of his terrible agony the suffering of his family and perhaps she was but hardly in the way she had expected she found that she harbored no sympathy for the kaga man this was his obsession and she knew from bitter experience that he was already too far gone to be helped besides she discovered much to her surprise that she had no desire to help him she saw her fathers obsession his fate now from a different window and like the moonlight being chopped to bits on the face of the sumida river there were other realities besides the one that she had been living all her life and in this last moment of indecision she understood everything she had seen tonight every cryptic sentence fukuda had spoken now nothing was cryptic all was revealed and there was no longer indecision take his marker the warrior with honnos voice said fukuda nodded and the dragon man pocketed the marker slapped three thick stacks of yen on the table they made their way to the kaga senior vicepresident who was already devouring them with his eyes the mercedes pulled up in front of the unobtrusive entrance to big ezoes club in the ginza at three minutes to six the rain had been blown away on a freshening breeze from the east dawn was already painting the sky high above tokyos towers a dove gray the exact hue of fukudas suit youre not going in with me honno said no fukuda said i have other work to see to now will i see you again the driver had come around opened honnos door that will be entirely up to you mrs kansei fukuda said the power is yours your fate is in your own hands and honno stepping out into the brightening tokyo dawn thought at last weve found him big ezoe said as honno walked into the graniteclad restaurant do you mean giin is still alive honno slipped into the chair opposite him has he been harmed big ezoe laughed your university professor is very much alive mrs kansei and quite unharmed he shrugged why shouldnt he be there was no one to hurt him i dont understand outside sunlight was spreading downward across the faces of shinjukus gigantic office towers the nocturnal denizens among whom honno had walked just hours ago would already be back in their lairs sleeping waiting again for the return of night she was reminded of that lone cryptomeria stark bent in pain an oblique counterpoint to the endless right angles of the city and she wanted to return to it to somehow pay homage to it so that its suffering should continue to have meaning your friend giin is a clever boy big ezoe said he engineered his own kidnapping big ezoe must have already ordered because breakfast arrived americanstyle orange juice eggs bacon corn muffins black coffee honno had never seen so much food at breakfast but she found that she was famished she should have been surprised by what big ezoe was telling her but somehow she seemed inured to surprise the warriors spirit having surfaced was now gaining ascendancy giin merely used the kidnapping as a way to disappear for a little while without you clinging to his coattails big ezoe continued when he had made his plans and was ready to implement them he surfaced in the middle of my world that was the easiest part since he was already something of an habitue big ezoe looked at her youre taking this news with a great deal more equanimity than i expected mrs kansei didnt giin swear to you that he had given up gambling that he had put his past behind him he did but then my father said the same thing to my mother many times you seemed more than willing to believe your friend several nights ago honno considered this it occurred to her that several nights ago seemed more like a lifetime ago she looked at big ezoe said he wants to sell back the sakata ledgers he stole from me yes big ezoe said and no i think he wantsneedsmoney very badly his debts in my gambling houses have mounted of late but i also think hes too smart to give up the ledgers for one score hes had a chance to decipher sakatas code thats why it took him this long to surface with an offer now he knows what the ledgers contain and he has no doubt discovered that theyre far too valuable for him to give up what does he plan to do figure it out big ezoe said it isnt so difficult honno thought for a moment hes going to try to take our money and give us nothingor perhaps just a littlein return big ezoe said like all amateurs giin believes that he can outsmart the professional thats a proven fact why else would he come back night after night to my gambling houses he has set up a meeting for eight this morning in the center of the nihonbashi bridge i will bring him the money and he will give me one deciphered page from the ledgers then when im satisfied as to their value hell give me an address where ill supposedly find the entire ledgers along with the rest of the decoded pages only they wont be there and hell begin the process of bleeding me dry but thats so terribly dangerous for him it certainly is big ezoe said but in a way he doesnt yet begin to suspect hes chosen to deal with me thats because he knows meor at any rate he thinks he does in fact hes very close to the edge and in danger of falling a long long way you see mrs kansei what giin hasnt counted on is you you loved giin once big ezoe said in the tone one would use when beginning a fairy tale but now your warrior spirit has shown you that it wasnt giin you loved at all but an image of giin an image your own needs desires and misconceptions created just as they created the eikichi kansei you thought you had married there too the truth was something altogether different honno and big ezoe were in his limo on their way to nihonbashi they passed through a city that looked as if it were waking up from a long troubled slumber what do you plan to do honno said i big ezoe looked at her i plan to do nothing at all the limo pulled into the curb and the driver got out in a moment honnos door was opening the driver handed her a slim attache it came as no surprise to this new honno she emerged into the busy street she said what is in the case but really it was a question to which she already had the answer she could hear fukuda saying whatever you want to be in there and the warrior with honnos voice repeated the answer out loud behind her she heard big ezoes voice saying i will remain here until the matter is resolved without a backward glance honno walked onto the bridge centuries ago the nihonbashi had been the starting point of the tokaido the main road between the capitaledo now tokyo and kyoto she recalled as a child seeing the stylized rendition of the nihonbashi in a woodblock print by hiroshige perhaps it was at that moment engulfed by the beauty of the artists work the point where myth and reality converged that she had fallen in love with tokyo eight oclock giin was at the center of the bridges are waiting behind him all of honnos beloved tokyo was arrayed like a set of runes whose meaning she had at last begun to decipher he saw her coming and his face went white he turned to run then he hesitated his greed gaining the upper hand and he turned back and honno was already there why did you run she asked turn why did you steal the ledgers you dont understand giin said hurriedly i need money desperately you could have asked me for money he laughed dont be absurd i need a great deal more than you could ever have how do you know that she saw giin pause you should have asked giin gave her a tentative smile he bobbed his head yes i suppose i should now that i think about it but it was such a shock to see you and iwell i found myself so smitten again it didnt matter that youd married i wanted everything to be perfect this time for you only for you honno thats why i need the money i need to get this behind methis emergency and then everything will be perfect honno seemed not to have been listening youre still gambling but i do not i told you why are you lying to me i swear youve always lied to me honno whats happened to you nothing she said she lifted the attache case that contained nothing money she said to give you your perfect ending giin nodded uncertainly he handed a sheet of paper to honno the information contained in the ledgers is fantastic i can hardly believe its true but it must be every entry is crossreferenced several ways look times places numbers of meets amounts transferred the ledgers detail an entire network of bribes extortion a web of corruption so wide its almost inconceivable but to what end giins smile widened he sensed that for all this womans new strangeness he had regained the upper hand ah that will have to remain a mystery until i have the money and you get the balance of the decoding i want it all now huh i want everything youve decoded honno said without warning she reached out brought giin toward her with such fierceness that his teeth raided youll tell me now before the transfer of money as an act of contrition for lying to me and for stealing what is mine youre mad giin said absolutely mad ive made my deal youll tell me what i want to know honno said or ill kill you right here right now as a public lesson a reminder to those who lie and cheat and steal i dont your particular obsession has ended right here honno stuck her forefinger into that soft spot just below giins sternum he winced collapsed into her saliva drooled out of his gasping mouth youve caused too many people far too much pain honno told him the finger jammed inward again and giins eyes opened so wide she thought the eyeballs would pop out im the one little honno who you thought so little of who you condescended to i am going to put an end to it once more the finger moved curling upward toward his heart to your own suffering as well since you are obviously incapable of helping yourself youre just spiraling deeper and deeper into deceit and selfdelusion honno brought giin so close against her she could hear the frightened beating of his heart her wa was fully expanded and there was a peculiar triumph burning like a fire inside her she thought of fukuda and transformations was she honno fully transformed by the warrior spirit not yet but soon i m going to break your back she said not kill you not yet you thought i was still trapped by your spell that you could con me yet again with your soft voice and your honeyed words but i know what you are now you have no effect on me and i want what i want but i dont know giins voice was filled with pain and tears ive oh no over the years ive lost my abilities to decode age was playing playing tricks on my mind so i found a protege he did the decoding he he has everything you you want name honno said tightening her hold address giin told her his head lolling on her neck like an infant and honno the warrior was abruptly disgusted by his weaknessjust as she had been disgusted by her fathers weakness she realized all these years she had been too much the good girl the honno her parents had raised her to be to question her own emotions to recognize her disgust with a cry honnos arms contracted she heard the snapsnap snap like twigs breaking underfoot as giins vertebrae popped then she threw him over the side of nihonbashi the symbol of a beginning into the sluggish waters of the sumida over whose pristine surface the moon had dreamily cast its light just last night then the warrior had picked up the empty attache case and walked calmly back toward the waiting limo in her minds eye she could see the lone cryptomeria and now truly she understood all the layers of its existence just as the curve of its trunk softened the pitilessly hard edges of the city surrounding it its strength lent meaning to her suffering the cryptomeria was proof that purpose could be found in the thickest fog the darkest night the deepest pain and with that the past melted away and only the future shining and limitless remained the cityher tokyopulsed on all around her its myriad streets radiating out in every direction beckoning but the warrior had already chosen her path the one that had led her to what she wanted most freedom seven machinegun city tokyo estilo was all for killing cruz the moment they landed back in medellin but russell said absolutely not tori had told them during the flight back to machinegun city of her promise to sonia dawn was breaking the heavy disk of the sun painting the clouds with golds and reds as if it had set them on fire we are not assassins russell said being his usual meticulously logical self reminding them point by point of how life must be led i do not want to involve ourselves with these people any more than we already are and i cant see any reason to do the orolas dirty work for them forgive me for saying so senor slade estilo broke in but youre missing the point it is a matter of honor this is no longer business otherwise i would wholeheartedly agree with you its personal tori glanced at estilo she had never known him to be so bloodthirsty before he was a chanta a slick operator pointing a gun at someones head and pulling the trigger was not good business ask cruz he had done that to ruben orola and just look what had happened almost assassinated twice stalked by his own mistress about to be betrayed by everyone on this plane not that he deserved anything less it was merely a lesson to be learned i m concerned with neither honor nor emotion merely with getting out of here in one piece said russell the pragmatist the medellin cartel has bought the local police the judiciary maybe even members of the colombian government and our own dea which was driven completely out of cruzs territory two years ago how about justice tori asked him without sonias help at cruzs apartment we never would have lived to get to the llano negro and the cocaine factory we never would have found this she lifted up the glassine tube filled with the dark metallic pellets the center of the soft cell they had discovered in the bags of coke fuck justice russell said this is colombia no one here ever heard of justice russell was reminded of how he had met bernard godwin it had been near the end of his graduate studies at wharton bernard had come to lecture on the nature of justice which he had contended was a wholly manmade concept and therefore subject to the distortions and rationalizations only humans could bring to something of their own creation in nature bernard had argued there is no such thing as justice only life and death russell recalled how taken he had been with the lecture and with bernard godwin years later he realized that godwin had come to the campus on a recruiting mission for the mall but even that knowledge could not diminish his admiration of godwins mind godwin had known russells background how his peculiar genius with logic and numbers had estranged him from his family as prodigies often will he had frightened his parents and had caused his brother to feel stupid were both people who are all alone bernard had said to russell people who can understand the depth of commitment to an abstract a concept an ideal like justice russell had said and bernard godwin had laughed put his arm around the young russell slade just so now sitting in a smugglers airplane on his way back from the llano negro russell could still hear bernards voice speaking softly seductively in his ear so much power hooking up with bernard had been like having a pipeline directly to god russell thought but so much has changed since then the cockpit grew warm as the sun lifting above the cloudbank to their rear streamed through the windows following them back to medellin tori broke off large chunks of a candy bar handed them around estilo manned the radio monitoring traffic speaking softly into the mike now and then have you forgotten tori said to russell that it was cruzs sicarios who came after us on the way in from the airport okay while were on the subject it was cruz who loaned us one of his helicopters so we could get to llano negro russell pointed out jesus estilo said tori said lets by all means kiss him on both cheeks the next time we see him i dont think youre seeing this situation clearly i made a promise to sonia and im going to keep it youll do nothing of the kind russell said you made one mistake but ill be damned if ill let you make another you had no right to promise that woman anything she obviously got to you on an emotional level but im ordering you to put aside your emotionstheyre far too dangerous out here in the field this is the end of your maverick ride tori like hell it is tori said if you wont help estilo and i will forget it russell snapped you signed on with the mall and youve got to learn discipline youd better start right now were back to civilization and my word is law if you think machinegun city is civilization senor slade estilo said youre dead wrong estilos words turned out to be more prophetic than even he could have imagined the plane was met at medellin airport by cruz and his cadre of sicarios none of them were shy about brandishing their macs the engines of the twin otter were still idling when cruz directed the moving stair against the airplanes side began climbing it tori went aft opened the door the three of them were waiting for him when he entered the cabin his sicarios piled in after him immediately beginning a thorough search of the entire plane cruz watched them carefully while he waited he said nothing no cocaine he said at last when the sicario leading the cadre returned shaking his head negatively then the sicario handed over the glassine packet of metallic pellets we werent there for the coke russell said deliberately ignoring the glassine packet ah then did you discover who is running the cocaine factory no we got something of a rude welcoming then you were inept cruz gave them a wide grin he hefted the packet but i see for all that you didnt come away emptyhanded russell said you mean this plane cruzs nasty laugh echoed in the confined space of the cabin he stared at the packet this must be very valuableto you he lifted his gaze but then everything becomes valuable sooner or later take information for instance while you were gone i received some it seems that sonia had been the lover of ruben orola the bastard i blew away last year now isnt that interesting of course sonia thought it interesting shed tell you so herself but sadly she could not be here with us today she met with an unfortunate accident she went for a walk in the wrong part of town and someone shot her foolish girl how many times was she warned in the silence that followed cruz stepped up to russell stared him in the eye i dont know what your game is but its ended now you have an hour to get out of medellin after thathe shrugged i can make no assurances concerning your safety wed be only too happy to leave russell said amiably just give his our package and but no cruz said i must exact payment for the use of my helicopter not to mention me inconvenience your visit has caused me that package is of no use to you russell said perhaps but this plane is cruz studied russell and it is enough to know that i have something you want in a few days i may throw it awaywho knows who caresbut it is mine to do with as i wish he turned was walking away when russell said i challenge you russells heart was beating fast and he felt a sick sensation in the pit of his stomach cruz paused without turning around he said youre a gringo why should i it was this gringo who found the orola mole inside your organization youd be dead without me russell grinned somewhere a voice inside his head was screaming for him to shut up but he would not he had to prove that he could pull his weight in the field along about the time when bullets were whistling past his head in the llano negro it had occurred to russell that bernard godwin had deliberately sent him into the field as a taunt a humiliation for not having come up in the mall in the same way bernard himself had russell was determined not to give bernardor torithe satisfaction of seeing him psychologically torn apart by field work besides russell went on your sicarios might wonder at the reason you wont listen to my challenge is it that im just a gringo or have you become afraid are you becoming soft and weak cruz whirled around his face was flushed with rage when i discovered what sonia had beenan orola spy shot her myself i castro cruz i put the barrel of my gun into her mouth and pulled the trigger i was looking into her eyes the entire time i watched the coming of death i saw it claim her does this sound soft and weak he walked up to russell and now i have to ask myself if jorge was indeed the orola spy you claimed he was or why you the spy hunter missed sonia i wasnt looking at sonia russell said in his mouth was the taste of metal bitter and nauseating take my challenge cruz glanced around the cabin his sicarios were watching him expectantly he gave a perfunctory nod then shrugged its your death he said the corrida was eerie silent and empty it lay sleeping in the heavy sunlight there was nothing going on in the bullring except on sundays when the medellin natives crowded its stands to drink in the contrast of life and death when man faced bull all right senor slade cruz said he and his men surrounded tori and estilo in the lower reaches of the stands you have challenged and i have answered cruz grinned down on russell who stood in the bloody dust of the corrida itself waiting i have instructed that my best bull be set loose if you handle him i will give you what you want if on the other hand the bull has his way whether or not i have this package will no longer matter to you youll be dead tori tried to read what russell was thinking by the expression on his face but he was too good for that she was thinking if he dies it will be on my head i will never be able to forgive myself russell she called out you dont have to do this cruz grunted but of course he does he nodded to one of his sicarios who pointed his semiautomatic at russell a man does not back out of a challenge oh but senor slade i forgot for a moment that youre not a man youre a gringo anything is possible for one such as you russell said nothing his attention was fixed on the huge ironbound wooden doors across the dusty floor of the corrida cruz raised his arm let it drop the wooden doors creaked open and they could see in the semishadows a huge hulking figure it snorted heavily then pawed the ground russell moved and the bull came charging across the corrida toward him doesnt he even get a killing sword tori said to cruz no the killing sword is for a matador only not a gringo he will have to manage on his own but he wont be able to tori said not with just his bare hands well i suppose thats the point cruz laughed then shouted ole gringo ole as russell whirled away from the bulls first charge russell felt the burst of sweat breaking out all over his body he had seen bullfights before but he now understood just how enormous these creatures were close up they were all muscle all rage chaos incarnate the smell of the beast was in his nostrils he had stared into the bulls red eyes had seen there a sight that had jolted him a kind of unthinking evil elemental and absolute in that first instant of recognition russell knew that there could be no middle ground here either he would kill the bull or the bull would kill him no other possibility existed in those strangely magnetic eyes the bull charged again his hooves thundering kicking up dust dark with dried blood its head was lowered and russell saw its long horns aimed at his stomach he could almost feel the agonizing rip of the gore could sense himself being jerked off his feet by the beasts inhuman strength the horn tearing through his abdomen as the bull flailed him along the ground or against the corridas wall the thing was it did no good to move right away the bull would just follow and since it was far faster than a man it would run him down russell knew he needed to follow the dictates of the matador and not move for as long as was possible to whirl away only at the last possible instant to constantly frustrate the beast and yet he told himself what good would even this do there was no one to cut the beast to continually wound it to wear down its prodigious strength to bring it to the point where exhausted and bleeding it lowered its head in the middle of its charge to receive the killing thrust russell waited as the bull came on he felt his muscles rippling with tremors over which he had no control his teeth were chattering the beasts huge head loomed rushing toward him at appalling speed he whirled but he cut it a bit too fine and the bulls outflung hoof caught him on the ankle he staggered fell into the dust the bull snorted so close that russell could feel the damp heat on the back of his neck the foam of madness overflowed its lips the tip of its horn scored the wall just above him the scent of the beast defined his world in the stands cruz and his sicarios were straining forward fascinated sensing that the dance of death was nearing its end even the guards posted high up in the arena were concentrating on the imminent death of the gringo no one yelled ole now they were rooting for the bull tori leaned over whispered in estilos ear he nodded as she knew he would estilo was as fearless as he was loyal she counted silently to six saw out of the corner of her eyes estilo doing the same then she launched herself over the barrier in the stands down into the corrida at the same time estilo slipped the handgun from cruzs holster pressed the muzzle against me side of his head dont move he shouted to the sicarios if you want to keep your leader alive youll just relax in the corrida the bull had flung out one hoof it was meant for russells head but russell had had the presence of mind to curl up and the blow struck him on the shoulder instead he grunted began to scramble away that was a mistake the bull charged after him its head already down its horns darting this way and that tori landed on her feet and reaching down slid a knife from its sheath against her ankle she leaped atop the bulls back and plunged the knife to the hilt in that spot she had seen the matador find for his killing thrust between the massive muscles of the beasts shoulders and neck she was certain she heard the bull scream it shuddered as a fountain of blood shot up and its convulsions threw her off she hit the wall came down hard then russell had scooped her up and the two of them were making for the doorway through which russell had been shoved onto the floor of the corrida as they reached the door they heard the unmistakable sound of semiautomatic fire fearing for estilo tori turned around and had a brief glimpse of the guards stationed high up in the stands then russell had pulled her through from the intense sunlight of the corrida to the darkness beneath the stands someones shot cruzs guards she shouted at russell they raced around the semicircle came up into brilliant sunlight headed up the tiers of empty seats but the gunfire had ceased none of cruzs people were left standing instead estilo and cruz were surrounded by another set of men the orolas its all right estilo said as the men trained their weapons toward the oncoming figures theyre friends are you all right tori asked estilo he smiled jerking on cruzs collar as you can see torero he was referring to her bravery in the bullring what the hell is going on here russell demanded estilo said to one of his men search them carefully especially the woman she is capable of many tricks then he turned his attention to russell i took the liberty of ensuring the outcome of our little adventure i radioed my people from the plane on our way back here your people russell said who the hell are you anyway i am toris friend estilo said thats all you need to know tori came up to him once that was all i needed to know estilo but now everythings changed are you certain schatzie nothing has changed not really not for the two of us tori saw the love in his eyes but beneath that she could discern something foreign and her stomach tightened in a kind of precognitive warning because it was the hint of fear she saw in estilo an emotion she had thought him incapable of feeling she could already feel him slipping away from her and she knew that neither of them would ever be the same estilo nodded so be it finding the cocaine factory in the llano negro came as no surprise to me why would it i own it you the word came out and almost choked her she could hardly think straight estilo smiled didnt you think it a bit too convenient this twin otter refueling just as we had need of it he laughed heartily just like in a james bond movie i dont believe it but i do russell said the whole escape from the factory was so easy i should have seen it estilo ignored him friendship does that to people schatzie i think in your heart of hearts you are not so surprised you knew that some of my business was not altogether legitimate but cocaine only a sideline for me schatzie estilo said the soft cell remember i never would have told you but this pig cruz stuck his nose in where it didnt belong he took the hafnium pellets i could not allow you to be killed over them the hafnium comes from you russell said estilo nodded very astute senor slade the metal pellets are what im really exporting the japanese buy the hafnium from one of my concerns in west germany i transship the hafnium down here and they oversee the soft cell making sure its stuffed into the coke but dont you know what the japanese are doing with the coke tori said theyve made a supercocaine one that kills in a matter of months so tori you know me better than that estilo said im a businessman pure and simple im motivated by profit not ideology or politics i thought you understood that the real horror was that tori did understand she had known all along what estilo was and what he was capable of they had become friends despite that knowledge what did that say about her isnt hafnium used as some kind of damper in nuclear reactors russell said i sell hafnium estilo said i dont research it who are you selling it to tori asked which japanese bastard tell me theres something else i d like to know russell said was it you who ordered the hit on ariel solares ariel was a friend of mine estilo said stiffly i still mourn his passing he sounded as if russell had insulted him if you didnt kill him russell said who did you know i should kill you both estilo said that would be the smart move the businessman in me says i should get rid of you two before you do me more damage man youve already done he looked at tori but you are my schatzie and i could never harm you i dont understand tori said what youre doing is despicable youll sell anything for a profit with no thought of the consequences forgive me never but i forgive you schatzie estilo looked at her sadly that is the difference between us i accept you tori all of you the good and the bad i am the true friend you never had before but of course you cant see that perhaps in time he shrugged said to one of his men they have a personal jet waiting for them at the airport see they get there and that nothing happens to them at immigration or customs see them off and tori when you get to japan which ive no doubt youll do go see your old yakuza friend hitasura what do you know of hitasura wrong question estilo told her its what does hitasura know tori stared at him a long time so many emotions were running through her she did not know where to begin to comprehend them she knew that estilo had protected her and russell and he had in a major way helped them with their mission then why couldnt she forgive him for having a part in the supercocaine smuggling or was it simply that he had lied to her about his business dealings could her hurt stem from something so personal as that estilo said adios senor slade auf wiedersehen schatzie i have much to do now i must see that justice comes to this pig cruz and i will see that sonia is given a proper burial he took one last look at tori perhaps youll say a prayer for her for her tori said as she and russell were led away but not for you do you want to be alone tori looked up at russell standing over her the at feet was whispering along yes but when he turned away she reached out for him no sit with me she put her head back sighed it was good not to be alone to put an end to the solitudethe isolation she had imposed on herself from the moment they had taken off from machinegun city next stop tokyo russell looked at her i hope we havent been sent by scylla into the maw of charybdis what do you mean russell shrugged if estilo is any yardstick by which to judge your friends this yakuza oyabun of yours hitasura might be waiting to blow our heads off if estilo wanted that for us hed have done it himself speaking of estilo tori whyd he do it from the moment you called him from my office he must have known what you and i were looking for he was it or part of it anyway why did he allow us to get so close find out about his operation and even more interesting why did he get involved himself i dont pretend to have all the answers tori said wearily but estilo knows me he knew once i sunk my teeth in i wasnt going to give up and i think he wanted in some way to ensure my protection he figured if he was along he could do that also estilo was in a fundamental way lying to us when he said hes nothing more than a businessman underneath hes the last of the adventurers there are those who think the worlds gotten too small for people like him he gets a kick out of making fools of them by slipping through the international cracks they dont know still exist she shrugged but maybe im wrong he went with us protected us exposed his operation to us but god knows its clear now that i never fully understood estilo on the contrary i think you understand him all too well russell said mainly because you two are so much alike youre wrong about only one thing tori estilos not the last of the adventurers you are tori turned her head stared out the window at the colorlessness at feet she looked upward past the intense blue of the shell of earths atmosphere and thought what did greg see in the darkness up there what did he think when he looked behind him and saw the totality of home theres something else russell said and she turned back away from the home of the angels why in hell did estilo tell us about the hafnium what sort of devilish game is he playing i dont know tori said but knowing estilo as i do he told us because he wants us to know perhaps he was lying it could be the pellets are something other than hafnium no that isnt estilos way he merely would have kept his mouth shut those pellets are hafnium you can bet on it russell opened his hand smiled in it wrapped in a small plastic envelope was a small dark metallic pellet i dont have to bet he said i have my own private sample he pocketed me evidence frowned what if estilo did order the hit on solares he said he didnt no think back what he said was that ariel was his friend that he still grieves for him he gave us no direct answer with estilo its the same thing tori said its a matter of honor ariel was his friend estilo could not have ordered him murdered russell grunted but he did not argue with her well then its on to japan he said youd better brief me whos this other friend of yours hitasura hitasura is the youngest of the tokyo yakuza bosses tori said he made his bones by leading a bloodless coup against the old oyabun of his family there was a scandal the old man was involved in and hitasura used his influence among the young bureaucrats of his acquaintance to hush it up the elders of the family were grateful so grateful they installed him as the new oyabun since then hes expanded his familys influence threefold his chief rival is an oyabun named big ezoe a real sonuvabitch this is the yakuza were talking about russell said theyre all sons of bitches tori nodded thats more or less true she said its the less you need to concentrate on once you do you find some fascinating personalities hitasuras one anyway hes in my debt so you dont have to worry about his loyalty russell waited for her to tell him how hitasura happened to be in her debt but when she wasnt forthcoming he asked her himself its none of your business russ she said you dont ask questions like that theyre too personal russell could see that she was already reverting to her enigmatic japanese personality the one that drove him to distraction when he had first worked with her he wasnt going to let that happen again this is different its business he said its my neck thats being put on the chopping block along with yours under me circumstances dont you think i deserve an answer no tori said russell leaned forward look tori do i have to point this out if hitasura is involved in the soft cell russ he stared at her i dont care if he is in your debt th possibility remains that if estilo didnt order ariels murder then hitasura did lets not get ahead of ourselves shall we russell could see she was angry he couldnt blame her both estilo and hitasura were her friends one had already betrayed her how much would it take for the other to betray her as well tori stood up excuse me ive got to go to the bathroom russell watched her go down the aisle he wondered why he could never win an argument with her several minutes later it occurred to him that they hadnt had an argument merely a conversation then he began to wonder why he saw their conversations as skirmishes and worse why it was he found it necessary to win them all something stirred inside him he felt again the torn edges of the end of his life blood covering his eyes the stench of the great bull filling his nostrils the corridas red dust coating his mouth the taste of death choking him russell had already given himself up for dead he had been sucking the dust into his lungs his vision clouded there had been pain in his shoulder his ankle the bull was towering over him ready to inflict its damage on his body his mind could see it coming his death it was as if in that moment he had seen how out of focus his life had been up to that point he rose went down the aisle to the door to the head he knocked on it tori his hand twisted the turnplate and the narrow door opened inward he saw tori hunched over the stainless steel john her body racked with dry heaves when she turned to look at him her eyes were filled with tears get get the hell out and leave me alone she managed to say one of the mall flight crew was coming up behind him and russell stepped inside quickly shut the door oh god he knelt down beside her held her head and shoulders while the spasms went on and on at last she collapsed against him and he winced as pain shot through the spot where the bulls kick had caught him he reached up managed to get a paper towel soaking wet he gently wiped her face her lips her neck she used the water he gave her to rinse out her mouth russell could feel her heat her softness combined with the peculiar tautness she possessed he felt a stirring inside him the accelerated beating of his heart and cursed himself for being a fool how could he let this happen she was soft and vulnerable lying meekly in his arms strong capable tori nunn he had her just where every man would want her but that wasnt it not at all what he was feeling was something else something new and because he was already at war within himself as to the nature of it he was at a loss as to what to do he was aware of the cloudlike swirl of her golden hair still matted here and there with the blood of the terrifying beast she had brought down he could not put aside me memory of her vaulting over the barrier into the red dust of the corrida he was aware of the delicate curve of her cheek so likeyet so unlikeher mothers her lashes fluttered against the bare flesh at the hollow of his throat her breathing the beating of her heart the heat of the insides of her wrists so close to his own merging he had seen the glint of the long knife as she had vaulted atop the beast as she had plunged the blade with a matadors unerring skill into its skull jesus but he had been frightened he had never known the meaning of terror until that moment and something he was certain had happened to him then in the instant when he was showered with the beasts blood was assured of its death and in consequence the continuation of his own life he had come to understand what ten thousand sleepless hours closeted in the mails operations room could not provide at last he knew what it meant to have his head thrust down a hole black dank menacing and in that horrific darkness come face to face with himself so close to death the veneer he had worked so assiduously to apply to his life had been stripped away he had always considered that veneer to be a perfect confluence of sophistication urbanity and cunning the exact mix required for the complex dance of quid pro quo the director of the mall was required to perform but now he saw that he could no longer live with the true nature of the life he had built for himself the dense macabre a malevolent minuet designed and dictated by bernard godwin the man to whom he paid constant homage the man who owned russell slade completely and at last he came to the core of it all he had been certain that he had challenged cruz to prove bernard godwin wrong to prove himself to tori but in the end he understood that he had faced death for himself because he could no longer stand himself the old russell slade boy genius perhaps but a man filled with insecurity at not being part of the veteran network presided over by godwin a man on the outside forever cut out of the field operatives loopisnt that why he had been so intensely jealous of tori yes russell slade had been just the man bernard godwin could subtly manipulate in almost any way he chose the horrific truth was that by appointing him director of the mall godwin had made it possible for him to continue running his own agendas while giving the appearance of having moved back into an advisory capacity russell was filled with shame he felt toris arms around him her fists clutching him and something inside himself gave way he put his head down much as the beast in the corrida had done for the matadors killing sword and his lips sought hers it was not a conscious gesture dazed by the ramifications of his revelation russell hardly knew what he was doing his lips came down over toris he felt hers soften and searched for her tongue with his then her mouth broke away no she gasped no please their eyes locked and russell was shocked not by how beautiful her eyes were but by how he had never really noticed their beauty before they were like misty jewels translucent luminous a blue that was not truly blue a green that was not quite green and that special color appeared to him now like a doorway through which more than anything he longed to step tori russell i the moment had seemed so right but now he recognized how wrong it had been he had the strong sense that if he insisted she would give in he had felt her melting against him but if she did acquiesce he knew that he would never know why was it vulnerability despair a need to be close to someone after two terrible losses or was it something else a feeling perhaps that at some point she would not be able to control it was of paramount importance for russell to knowand for him to be assured that tori too knew what she wanted otherwise what was the point russell rose pulled her to her feet he did not say he was sorry because he wasnt he left her without a word went forward to speak to the pilot and go over their route to tokyo feeling it was important for him to be aware of these things in case anything went wrong along the way he always liked to know where he was which was ironic considering the whirl of conflicting emotions flooding him when he returned to the main cabin tori was back in her seat he ordered sandwiches and hot coffee and when they were served he and tori consumed it in great quantities while she briefed him on her expertise the tangle of modernday japan the central issue in understanding the japan of today tori said is to keep in mind that no one person is ultimately in charge of the country absolutely no one in america seems to get this not the president nor anyone on capitol hill in business or god knows the pentagon theyre all so mystified by this new japan that they had such a major hand in creating and so selfrighteously pissed off when nothing much happens in response to their requests putting aside for the moment the fact that theyre not asking the right questions what theyre all looking forand not findingis a place where the buck stops the truth is that no one in japan will take responsibility for the buck stopping because more often than not buckstopping is synonymous with loss of face japans society is unique in all the worldin all history for that matter it is a country governedalthough thats too precise a term for so amorphous a conceptby a loosely knit organic conglomerate of entities including the prime minister and his ruling party the diet the samurai bureaucracy the corporations of the business world and the yakuza the death of the great tokugawa shogunate at the dawn of the meiji era in the late s the nineteenthcentury intervention of the western world and the postworld war two macarthur constitution made certain this uneasy alliance would continue into the twentyfirst century russell watched her while she talked he wondered what she must be feeling how deep the facade she presented went she appeared quite herself now as if the incident between them had never happened but could that be so could anyone be in such iron control of their emotions he had to admit to himself that he found tori nunn to be a complete enigma she was like a code to which he was increasingly drawn yet could not break being close to her working with her in the field had given him no insight no new understanding of her underlying psyche instead he had merely bedazzled himself his attraction to her was suddenly so strong it had the potential to become an obsession up until now russell slades sole obsession had been the mall when he had been appointed director bernard godwin had taken him to dinner during the course of which he had said now you ii know what it means to have a mistress one who occupies you heart and soul i trust you will be up to the task of managing her russell thought that because he had uncovered some of the lies his mentor had so easily told him he had bernard under control but just the opposite was true bernard godwin had attached invisible strings to himjust as he had to toriand he had been pulling those strings all along of course tori and i fought like brother and sister russell thought bernard made certain that both of us saw him the same way as a father figure we were both bred to please him and now watching her explain to him the inner workings of japan he knew he wanted to draw closer to her still he saw how she still idolized bernard how she would do anything he asked russell feeling his heart filling up with emotion wondered when he would cut the strings bernard had so painstakingly attached to her he knew he must begin by telling her the truth about bernard that he was ready to sacrifice her if it came to it but not now tori was not yet ready to hear anything negative about bernard godwin her spiritual father besides russell thought on a purely selfish level there were more important matters to resolve in the electric moment when he and tori had been closeted together everything had changed a door had been unlocked and once opened it could never again be closed the world was different now at least the world as russell slade knew it and in the coming days he would have to determine just what he was going to do about it tokyo they had traveled almost nine thousand miles on the transatlantic route touching down for refueling in cartagena santo domingo and frankfurt they were only through japanese customs and immigration and russell was already feeling like an alien the japanese had developed the uncanny ability of being extremely polite while firmly keeping you at arms distance and by so doing they neatly managed to lock you out of anything of importance everything here was form there was no substance it was as if the entire country were in the process of enacting a gigantic kabuki play smiles without meaning cardboard bows saying yes when they meant no an obsession with minute detail while talking around the edges of major issues could there be a more unfathomable people a more opaque culture on the face of the earth russell asked himself on the long trafficchoked drive in from narita airport well the chinese yes of course but in a fit of selfmutilation the chinese had dealt themselves out of international play for years to come so they didnt count we going directly to hitasuras russell asked no i think it would be advisable to learn a bit more about hafnium first if hitasura is estilos buyer i want to go into the first meeting with him with as much armament as i can for once russell found himself in agreement with tori and much to his surprise it wasnt an altogether disagreeable feeling this guy deke is a little weird tori said russell glanced at her how weird you tell me tori said as she led him down the steps into a grimy tattoo parlor somewhere in the incomprehensible tangle of shinjuku the sun was out but youd never know it this deep in the heart of tokyo there was only reflected light here a colorless illumination bounced off ten thousand panes of glass russell peered at phoenixes dragons lissome seminude ladies spiders serpents warriors out of history and demons out of myth all were on display in astounding detail on the walls of the shop which was lit with sodium lamps giving it the appearance of a highway or an industrial park a japanese who improbably seemed to be in his late teens looked up when they walked in he made no sign of recognition returned to his work on the back of a very heavy individual he had a punks spiky haircut and a laborers inkstained hands he wore sandals longlegged dayglo surfer shorts and a tshirt cut off just above the navel that had pepperdine u volleyball team emblazoned across the back greetings from tokyo general dudette he said without looking up howzit deke bitchin deke dipped a small circle of needlesharp wooden picks into colored ink applied it beneath the skin he was an artist with his canvas as ever tori stood behind him got a problem for you solutions my middle name dudette tori displayed the dark metal pellet in its plastic envelope a to z when he nodded she slipped it into the pocket of his shorts one hour he said i just opened deke opened for business after noon worked late into the early hours of the morning he dipped the picks into the ink applied it go get a milkshake or something you dudes are making my client nervous when they returned just over an hour later there was no one in the tattoo parlor whered this weirdo split to with my evidence russell said suspiciously dekes space goes all the way to the next street tori told him in the back of the shop is his lab isnt this kid a bit young to be running sophisticated diagnostic tests i mean he might set his diapers on fire tori smiled deke is young she said but hes also brilliant dont let his age prejudice you in japan its often best to keep an open mind at that moment deke appeared he had on thick rubber gloves a heavy apron and was grasping the pellet at the end of a pair of metal tongs around his neck was a filtering mask he peered at tori you still playing vball dudette we got a bitchin game going this pm im a little short on play time this trip tori said catch you next she nodded at what he was holding first you scope the traces of white shit on the pellet colombian mon happenin premium stuff deke smacked his lips mmm mmm good is that all what else were you expecting tori glanced at russell then said to deke lets hear the rest cool deke said this heres a pellet of hafnium he said nodding at the pellet good quality shit he looked at tori you have any more of this stuff to sell not in the business russell said tersely can you give us some background on hafnium tori said before russells american aggressiveness could get them into trouble no sweat deke said he plopped the pellet into tons hand hafnium is a byproduct of zirconium mining its used to make control rods for nuclear reactors these rods are like dynamic controllers meaning they move in and out of the reactor core so that they can like absorb more or less of the neutrons given off by the atomic reaction you like control the power output that way usually boron is like used for the control rods but boron wears out and new rods have to be fitted hafniums advantage over like boron and the other similar control rod substances is that it has an enormous capacity for absorbing neutrons see like the neutrons bombarding it change it into another substance which also has the capacity to absorb neutrons because of this property deke continued hafnium is used most often in like the nuclear reactors of submarines the longer such a reactor can go without replacement the longer the sub can stay underwater without refueling what kind of time are we talking tori asked boron would give you like maybe six months deke said but with rods of hafnium in your reactor you could stay underwater like over two years okay russell said you said control rods but these are pellets does this mean what we have here is raw hafnium solid choice deke nodded but wrong he looked at russell what you gave me to analyze isnt raw dude its the refined finished stuff yet its not a rod this must be some special stuff russell said uhhuh now youre in the loop dekes eyes gleamed this heres something better than a rod its a fixed poison meaning its like part and parcel of the reactors core itself which means that this kind of core is something new id sure like to get my hands on it youll have to get in line tori said i hear you dudette russell said what would you use this kind of new reactor for deke shrugged hard to say a sub could stay independent for like five years maybe more any other possibilities tori asked deke thought for a moment well with like a fixed poison of this kind of hafnium i suppose it would be theoretically possible to construct a miniature reactor of a much higher potency than what we already have how potent russell asked deke scrunched up his face in concentration if you got the right brains together i imagine you could come up with a backpacksize reactor that couldwell it could like power just about anything care to name your poison dude christ on the cross russell said sometime later one murder has taken us from a mission involving cocaine running to a multinational conspiracy to create the ultimate portable power source tori imagine it an atomic reactor you could carry on your back think of the possibilities i am tori shuddered and in this context theyre all monstrous another bit of interesting news russell said according to the tests deke ran the cocaine being manufactured at estilos colombian factory in the llano negro is normal not the killer stuff the japanese are manufacturing so at least hes not involved in that side of it small comfort tori said they were sitting at a window table at a secondfloor kissatenone of thirty thousand such coffee shops in tokyooverlooking the trendiest street in the trendy roppongi district the decor was highly futuristic both inside the kissaten and out in the street red neon strips hidden by pink lacquer sconces that ran the length of the interior of the coffee shop lit stainlesssteel sculptures of bonsai trees waves cranes in flight old symbols in a new medium it was as if the japanese in stepping boldly forward into the future were dutybound to drag their past with them outside people passed like peacocks their clothes so outlandish they could be considered costumes russell noticed that the futuristic domes were almost colorless black white putty simple hues that allowed the fantastic cuts and shapes of the blouses skirts and jackets to take center stage and like sculpture to make their own impact in the purest state tori russell said why is it that everything in japan is a symbol thats not so hard to figure tori said the japanese fixation on symbols is merely a reflection of their culture say one thing act another way too many people in too little space and because of chronic earthquakes the traditional housing construction was of wood and papereasier to rebuild after a quake has leveled your house but both these factors made for an acute lack of privacy did you ever try to tell someone a secret in a room whose walls are made of rice paper dont bother in japan everyone shares everyone is part of a series of groups so it was natural that an elaborate system of politeness and protocol should arise the obsession with symbols is an outgrowth of these things a symbol is easily identifiable for groups something happily embraced by many im with you so far dudette russell drawled and they both smiled but if you take the time to look behind these symbols you find that they have no meaning right and that makes sense too if you can learn to think like a japanese what is on the surface is to be admired but not necessarily adhered to as long as form and protocol are outwardly satisfied what difference does it make whats really on your mind or in your heart under these circumstances its far better for the symbols to be meaningless that way theres no chance of an entanglement that could cause shame and loss of face tori thought i am so japanese yes all the while im expounding like a professor on their culture i am part of it a living symbol i am talking hearing myself talk but that is only the surface the gleaming shell all that im allowing russ to see to show him more would bring me shame a loss of face tori was trying desperately to come to terms with her own emotions ever since she had seen russell in the medellin corrida about to die something had changed inside her she knew deep down that it was not merely a sense of decency or even guilt that had motivated her to leap into the corrida climb upon the bulls humped back and later in the on the way to tokyo when he had burst in on her had held her while she was racked with the pain of the trust she had lost in estilo she had been so certain that russell would reprimand her push her face into the uncertainty that now loomed before her could she trust any of the network of friends she had so slowly so painstakingly nurtured cultivated relied on her network was her eyes and ears on the clandestine movements of the world and now that that network had so clearly sprung a leak now that she was bleeding was the time for the russell slade she knew to hit her hit her hard so that he could at last wrest the reins of control from her because she had been convinced that this was russells weakness he was a control freak and the fact that she had her own way of running a mission drove him crazy and yet russell had not acted in character just the opposite in fact he had been gentle kind understanding all traits she could not reconcile with the russell slade she had known in the past the fact was she had gotten a great deal of pleasure from driving russell crazy and the fact that she was so obviously successful with her unorthodox methodology should have shown him his own weakness as clearly as if it were a mirror it hadnt she hadnt counted on his stubborn streakand the depth of his weakness control was everything tori had promised herself on the day he had severed her from the mall that one day she would create a laboratory experiment where russells sense of control was stripped from him this new mission had presented just the opportunity she had been looking for since it was clear russell and bernard were desperate to have her back she had decided to exact her revenge on russell the field was the greatest laboratory she could hope to find there was no control in the field where one was continually bombarded with the randomness of life the only problem was that she had herself forgotten how random a mission could be and events had not gone as planned for one thing estilo had betrayed her for another russell had turned out to be far more clever and resourceful in the field than she ever could have imagined she had maneuvered bernard godwin into ordering russell into the field with her just so she could show him up as the desk jockey he was to send him back to mail central humbled and defeated by his incompetence but tori thought thats not how its turned out she had been increasingly impressed by his expertise his bravery under fire both psychologicalat cruzs apartment and physical at the cocaine factory in the llano negro and then in a stunning display of courage he had challenged cruz throwing himself weaponless into the corrida in machinegun city my god she thought sitting across from him in the secondfloor coffee shop in roppongi this cant be happening i dont know this man at all russ has been my rival my enemy who does bernard love most me or russ thats the way its been ever since russell came on boardat least im convinced thats how hes seen it bernard godwin the malls eminence grise has been our surrogate father and like disputatious children weve been yelling choose me choose me at the top of our lungs staring at russell across the table watching him drink his tendollar cup of coffee tori could no longer see him as the man who had outsmarted her at every turn at mail central im supposed to hate this man she thought havent i hated him from the moment he severed me i hate him i dont i cant possibly but she could not even think it and with an inner convulsion she turned her thoughts in another direction any direction to distract herself she remembered a time at dianas garden in la late in the day when the shadows grew long and as dark as plums her favorite time lazing by the pool after a ninetyminute workout on the board and in the water she was in her second year of junior high and greg was a sophomore in college home for easter she was staring up at the glazed sky greg was at her side she could feel him his coolness close to the heat of her own body she liked that he was always cool always a contrast to her warm skin because often when she looked in his face it was like staring into a mirror two pairs of identical angel eyes reflecting her workout had not been enough to calm her on that particular day and greg had caught her crying whats up tor nothing youre crying over nothing he grunted thats stupid im not stupid i know she looked up almost shyly im having a hard time in russian i cant seem to understand it at all dont give up on it its important to him that we know russian uck it had always seemed an enigma that her father so desperate to be part of american society in so many ways also wanted not to lose his russian heritage it was he who had insisted she take russian instead of french the elegant language most of her friends took russian classes were filled with nerds with cokebottlebottom glasses thick necks and pimply faces she hated them and she hated the language in which nothing seemed to make sense she thought shed rather study martian you have a test today greg asked midterm i got sick and threw up before i took it i think i might have failed it youve got to apply yourself greg said stretching into the last patch of sunlight on the coping its easy if you try everythings easy for you maybe for you too were not so different as you think but i dont understand a thing she wailed ive gone to every class i take notes but i dont know what it is im writing maybe its the teacher then whove you got having graduated the same junior high six years before greg knew everyone mr broker broker sucks greg said ill go have a talk with bob hayes the principal tomorrow after classes hayes knows what a prick broker is peter borachovs the best russian teacher ill get you transferred to his class ill still hate it dont be a dope its neat youll like it i promise really really gee great and just like that toris insoluble problem had been solved it had taken greg to come up with the answer greg always had the answers all of a sudden that afternoon was so peaceful so perfect but not for long greg laughing rolling over reaching out taking her with him into the pool down down down into the water gregs wide powerful hand pressed against the top of her head keeping her deep in the water while the air running out burned her lungs and a kind of animal panic gripped her so that she flailed out with her arms and legs and at last as she began to cry feeling the weight come off her greg lifting her upward into the air and the light stop stop stop dont ever do that again she could remember him peering into her face while she wept and gasped until she said why are you looking at me to see your face change greg said how did my face change tori asked wiping away her tears this was an altogether grownup conversation and she had already forgotten her fear and her anger i cant tell you greg said but i can show you he put her hand on his head push me down into the water dont let me come up greg dont be stupid why should i want just do it tor he thundered his eyes alight with energy so that tori was helpless to do anything other than comply she pushed his head under the water it took both her hands her arms rigid her legs fluttering back and forth in the water for added power her head was just above the surface of the pool she could remember how the sunlight cut a last dazzle on the water and then sinking below the tops of the palms left the pool in blue twilight the pumps had cut off and the water was utterly still crystal clear tori looked down at her brother submerged as terrifyingly she had been moments before was this some kind of test she wondered a way to improve his breath control she liked being made part of his program loved the sense of tori and greg versus mom and dad his strength added to hers another layer of callus to keep out the parental intrusions they were alone in dianas garden alone in the cool water just the two of them taking part in a mysterious process like an ancient rite of which tori had no knowledge and the not knowing somehow added to her excitement as if she were participating in a really adult thing greg trusting her as if she were already grown up and she thought it was worth being terrorized by him for moments such as these time passed ripples on the skin of the pool a string of tiny bubbles leaking from the corner of gregs mouth she could feel him trying to rise and she fluttered her feet harder gaining purchase and leverage at the same time pushing down to meet the increased pressure and then a bluebird swooped down from its perch in a nearby tree skimmed the water as if wanting to see what lay below and tori thought what am i doing i am holding my brother underwater and i dont know how long hes been unable to breathe she felt a shiver of fright with a convulsive gesture she took her hands off the top of gregs head dove down pulled him back to the surface his face was white his eyes oddly dark he looked like a different person as if the proximity to death had somehow changed him something strange and cold crept through toris veins there greg said gripping her shoulders hard to be certain that she was staring directly at him do you see i couldnt tell you but ive shown you havent i tori sitting opposite russell slade in futuristic roppongi asked herself why she had recalled that specific incident perhaps it was because the emotions gripping her heart were so disturbing that she had to conjure even more disturbing thoughts to try to block them out wasnt it that moment seeing gregs changed face when toris feet were set upon her path that she knew she would not be satisfied until she stared death in the face tori thought she wanted to explore this horrific idea further but the essence of russell kept insinuating itself into her consciousnessthat new side of him she had glimpsed in the corrida when he had been near death when later she had been so vulnerable such an easy target for him and instead of making the most of his advantage he had gathered her into his arms tori in tokyo now recalling tokyo then ten years ago when she was ever so young ever so smart ever so vulnerable she had walked a different road then she had been cocky so sure of herself of her abilities the thought of defeat was merely a dream the contemplation of her own death inconceivable greg had flown in one of the few occasions he had had the time to visit her in japan it was odd their worlds were so different and yet so alike they both trained vigorously both had a kind of monodirectional bent that allowed them to concentrate on the flood of information they had to learn then translate it into action they were masters of both the cerebral and the physical learning what a valuable commodity the combination could be though they were in touch infrequently and saw each other even less they still remained close perhaps it was their parents that made them so an unspoken mutual need to band together against the enormous pressures at home in dianas garden in tokyo they had gone out drinking it was a recreation neither had the time nor the inclination to pursue on a regular basis their lives were so disciplined so regularized so military that the chance to kick back and break loose was irresistible it was also toris firm beliefa very japanese conceptthat real truths the full heart not the empty symbol could only be expressed while drunk everything could be forgiven then there was no loss of face no shame at becoming sentimental or showing weakness they had gone from bar to bar and as the night wore on found themselves in darker and meaner sections of the city they were not unaware of this rather they welcomed the proximity of danger there was about the entire night a sense of machismo that ton was unable to understand until she looked back from the perspective time gave her at first she had believed that greg nasa pilot astronaut in training had been responsible for that febrile aggressiveness but then she realized that much of the machismo had stemmed from her and greg was following her lead that had been a switch she had followed greg in everything sports mathematics school teams the works that had been their fathers doing ellis nunn had wanted to ensure that she was prepared for the hard competitive world she would one day be thrown into if you can compete with your brother you ii be ready for anyone he had told her dont complain and dont try to weasel out im doing you the favor my father never did for me but of course she was doomed to failure at every turn greg was the golden boy superb in sports mathematics excelling in each school he attended not that she didnt do her best to exceland succeeded most of the time she just could not match gregs level he seemed to revel in the milieu ellis nunn threw him into she despised it so in the end she ran away all the way across the pacific to japan as if she needed to get as much distance as she could between herself and the life she had been forced to live but her flight was more than away from pain it was toward a lifestyle that in its enigma drew her steadily on like odysseus on his arduous quest tori could hardly have done anything different she was made for japan and it was made for her for one thing the stringent asceticism at the martial arts school she joined was such a welcome relief from the opulence and endless money her parents insatiable appetite for acquisitions that she nearly wept for joy the first week at the school alone lying on her simple futon bed after a full days mental and physical work staring up through the garden at the moon and the stars tori had at last known a peace she had once thought could never be hers for another thing there was sensei a small quickgestured man who nevertheless moved with a deliberation so profound it actually seemed to be the opposite his stratagems appeared to be inadvertent haphazard wholly unexpected this is more difficult to achieve than you as a westerner could possibly imagine he had told her when she had reached the fourth of his six levels of training this is not a racist remark merely the truth you see we japanese abhor randomness nature in its pure unadulterated state frightens us which is why we have created deities such as the fox goddess to reinforce that fright but sensei look out there tori had said pointing to the exquisite garden you are always surrounded by nature i dont understand sensei had smiled i urge you to look again at the garden on which i lavish so much attention is it nature when we wander the lush hillsides of yoshino that is nature when we climb the alps to the north that is nature but this garden no it is a product of my imagination everything is made dwarfed bonsaied controlled by me or by one of my students this garden is what i want it to be nothing more certainly not nature not yet the perfect garden torisan is a simulacrum of nature it merges with nature to become one with it but there is no such thing as a perfect garden and there never will be the result though we work all our lives toward it is too frightening a prospect because if it ever came about we would by definition lose our control over it and that can never be allowed facades and a sense of control these were the principles of japanese gardens microcosms of the japanese culture itself and these were what tori thought of the night she went carousing the wild side of tokyo with greg because she was at last tired of both sake was a good antidote to regimentation something quite strong was needed to blur the lines the grids the bars of the life of an acolyte because that was just what she and greg were acolytes she had joined the samurai religion of the past he the scientific religion of the future the two of them met here at this moment in time amid the neon burning of a tokyo night in the primitive jungle within the worlds most civilized city bound in the present they were creating or so tori had thought until they hit a place called the lemon crush it was at the wrong end of shinjuku a kind of akachochin an afterhours joint posh and potent where the price tags were hot and the action even hotter they were by this time two liters into sake and tori felt as if an electric wire had been slipped into her veins gregs eyes crossed at intervals and he couldnt keep the sweat from glistening in his short blond hair wow he had exclaimed when they had taken the lucite elevator down to the main floor of the lemon crush i dont ever want to leave this place greg had always been prone to theatrical overstatement a trait he had unconsciously picked up from their mother they had been given a table on the upper level that circled the main floor blue and yellow neon rimmed everything floor tables steps railings and on the gigantic screen of the ceiling projected origami were continually unfolding like exotic flowers in yet another display of the japanese trying to control nature tori and greg were on their second round of sake soaking up the sights the sounds of heaven singing fascist groove thang at teethrattling volume when tori sensed gregs attention wandering she followed his gaze saw him staring fixedly at a beautiful young woman tall lissome exotic as the origami unfolding overhead hubba hubba greg said and slipped out of his chair before tori could do anything to stop him this was japan but greg had no conception of what that meant especially in his current state damnit greg but he couldnt hear her as tori watched him make his way down toward the beautiful young woman she thought of the kind of place this was and what that said about its habitues drug dealers and sex peddlers were only the tamer elements wending their way through the yellowandbluelit throng the lemon crush it was whispered was a favored hangout of the yakuza tori had never met a yakuza and even through her sakeinduced buzz she thought that this was not the night to do so macho was one thing suicide quite another greg would not understand this tori did not think they had enough time together for her to adequately explain the inner workings of the yakuza mind to him now she could see greg talking to the woman could see her smiling in return greg was so handsome he had never had trouble getting girls just the opposite in fact tori could remember when he was in high school there were too many girlfriends to make life simple and at one point gregs afterschool and practice life became something of a slapstick farce complete with slammed doors lightning changes of clothes and at least on gregs part ironman stamina tori had had an active part in this playingin laura nunns parlancethe straight man who stooged for the star making sure no two girls would catch him in the same room at the same time and recalling this seeing him laughing with the beautiful exotic japanese tori discovered that it wasnt only apprehension she was feeling it was anger she and greg saw each other so infrequently she thought it insensitive of him to go off and leave her like this and from the secure distance of the future tori was able to see the truth she had wanted to spend the night with her brother matching his macho with hers at last on her turf showing gregand ellis nunnthat she could compete on his level could she really be jealous of this creature tori had asked herself then yes yes as she slid through the crowd moving toward them tori was still some distance away when she saw the tall squareshouldered young man heading on a collision course with her brother and the woman he was a japanese dressed in a stylish suit his hair was shorter even than gregs almost a military cut there was something in his direct gaze that disturbed her even before she was close enough to feel the power of his wa that was when the fright took over by that time she had had more than enough training to know a dangerous opponent when she saw one the young man was heading straight for greg his gaze fixed steadily on him tori watched him move through the crowd it was like seeing a hot knife slice through butter he did not have to fight his way through did not have to elbow people aside no one was disturbed there was no ripple to mark his passage then abruptly shockingly he reached out and the sleeve of his jacket rode up his arm exposing a wrist covered with an irizumi demon spitting fire and toris heart lurched oh my god she thought gregs making a move on the girlfriend of a yakuza she and the yakuza converged on greg and the woman tori had just enough time to say greg lets get out of here before the yakuzas hand clamped down on gregs shoulder greg spun shoving the hand off him greg was in a semicrouch the standard first position of the sort of unarmed combat taught by the united states government agencies it would mean nothing to the yakuza unless greg pulled a gun and shot him dead the yakuzas skills would quickly overpower anything greg could throw at him greg grinned hey i dont want any trouble he said suddenly coming out of his crouch he put up his hands no law i know of against talking to a beautiful woman the woman belongs to me the yakuza said he had gone very still one arm was out from his body rigid the other one was close to the lapel of his suit jacket greg said youve got it all wrong pal slavery was abolished almost a hundred years ago the world doesnt belong to america the yakuza said yeah well it sure doesnt belong to japan the yakuza grinned not yet greg come on tori said we didnt come here to debate cultural differences stay away woman this does not concern you the yakuza growled curtly dismissing her like hell tori said for the moment forgetting everything she had been taught when you threaten my brother you threaten me the yakuza slowly turned to her said in the most condescending voice youre cute you know that he produced a snubnosed automatic but thats all you are so at that point tori jammed the stiffened fingers of her right hand into the yakuzas solar plexus his eyes opened wide and he was jolted backward greg lunged for the automatic and the yakuzas left hand chopped down on his forearm as if in slow motion tori saw the yakuza turn his gun on greg she went for the nerve cluster in his right arm and using her own left arm as a brace bent the yakuzas gun arm backward until she heard the snap his savage kick caught her on the edge of her pelvis she cried out in surprise and pain slammed into him again and almost simultaneously heard the report of the single shot the yakuzas face went white he said something unintelligible in all the electronic noise and commotion then slipped to the floor blood a dark flower spread its lethal petals tori bent touched him on the side of the neck then she grabbed greg and pushed her way through the throng farther and farther blue and yellow mutating the shadows all around the origami unfolding unfolding the strained faces now so alien to her outside in the spangled night she said come on lets go greg hesitated but that guys wounded he might die i think we ought to wait greg hes dead he had no pulse the only thing that will happen if we wait is well be killed that guy was yakuza a gangster of the most dangerous sort greg seemed bewildered but we can explain theyll understand the only thing his family understands is giri obligation and their obligation now is to destroy us for the love of god come on pulling him away from the lemon crush even if we run therell be trouble who had killed the yakuza with the demon on his wrist tori greg or had he himself pulled the trigger by accident no one would ever know the simple fact was that he had died as a result of the bullet wound that was really something greg exclaimed later they were sitting in a cheap dive somewhere in the sludge pit of kitasenju ive never seen you defend me tori its always been the other way around it was a stupid incident tori said sourly it never should have happened but it did the happenstance of life its like why i came here to a place i d never been to before a culture i know nothing about like fate karma wouldnt you say it never should have happened if you hadnt no no it showed me something something i was supposed to see i dont know what the hell youre talking about she was still angry with greg still partly in shock over what had happened she had never liked guns now she liked them even less but staring at her brother across the dirty table she saw another kind of light in his angel eyes it was the same disturbing darkness she had seen that late afternoon years before when he had risen from beneath the water of the pool in dianas garden where she had held him as the air had leaked out of him it was as if the shooting had galvanized himno that word wasnt quite right it was more like it had elated him but that could not be possible tori told herself over and over her brother the golden boy the nasa astronaut couldnt harbor such an antisocial such an amoral emotion no not greg but she was facing the incontrovertible evidence dont you but you must understand youre the mystic in the family tori thats why you came here to study isnt it me im the pragmatist the mathematician the pilot soon to be the man in the moon i hope but first ive come here to see you he looked at her you dont understand no greg nodded okay after how you defended me i guess you deserve to hear this and anyway were far too drunk to have it make a difference he took a deep breath i imagine you always thought i loved the pool the diving well sure tori said confused you were always so good at it not always greg said you see i never wanted to dive never never dad made me he shamed me into it i was afraid to get on the diving board so one night he made me go with him to the ucla olympic diving complex dad had done all their new outdoor lighting so he had access to everything on campus he took me by the scruff of the neck and climbed with me all the way to the top of the highdive board by this time i had a good idea of what he was going to do so i was crying even after all this time im ashamed to admit that i was so frightened i almost wet my pants dad took me to the edge of the board he pushed my head down forced me to look arc lights on the water it was such a long way down my teeth were chattering and he had to hold me up go on he shouted at me the only way youll learn to dive is to dive but i dont want to dive i protested youre too young to know what you want he shouted do as i say and with that he shoved me off the end of the board greg shuddered christ but it was a long way down i remember the wind whistling in my ears and the world turning turning i think for just an instant i saw him standing at the end of the diving board smiling or maybe i just thought i saw him i dont know the lane lines painted on the bottom of the pool were rushing up so goddamned clear i was sure there was no water in the pool then i hit the water and all me breath exploded out of me dad came and got me i was limp as a noodle but he just lapped me on the back a couple of times to make sure all the water was out of me and up we went again this time i gritted my teeth and went down on my own by the fourth clumsy dive i ached all over and i was ready to listen to his instructions gregs eyes were bleak as he looked at tori that was how i learned to love diving but it was horrible how could you ever have loved it after such an introduction that greg said is what ive been asking myself ever since then tori russell slade said in the present of futuristic roppongi across the kissaten the bank of quotron machinesfree use to patronsflashed their minutebyminute update of the progress of the stock market where have you been these past several minutes i tori made an effort to come fully back to the present i was thinking of what deke said about the hafnium why am i lying to him she asked herself all the terrible possibilities given the kind of minds the evil out in the world yeah well theres no use dwelling on nightmares russell said wed just better make sure the nightmares never occur where is this hafnium ending up thats what weve got to find out the question now is will hitasura help us lets go find out tori said getting an audience with hitasura was approximately as difficult as finding the treasure chamber inside the pyramid of cheops he was a cautious mansome said paranoid but these were his enemies and their envy evidently distorted their judgment there had never been an assassination attempt made on hitasura and this spoke volumes for his strategy and caution this was not to say that he was inactive on the contrary hitasura was a handson oyabun he was as yet perhaps too young to feel comfortable with delegating power to his lieutenants just as well in the three years since he had come to power he had already found it necessary to execute two lieutenants whose loyalty was to the yen rather than to himself tori had met hitasura ten years ago when she and greg had been hiding out from the members of the yakuza family who had sought to avenge the shooting of the man with the firespitting demon on his wrist that family was the chief rival of hitasuras family and hitasaraa mere lieutenant thenhad taken it upon himself to protect tori and her brother some years later hitasuras sister had been kidnapped by members of that same family on an unrelated matter of giri and it had been tori who had penetrated the stronghold where she was being kept the family had thought themselves clever stashing hitasuras sister in a western brothel where they were certain hitasura would never come because he would stand out like a peony in a patch of dandelions in the process of getting her out tori had killed four yakuza of the rival family and had been wounded in the left shoulder at that moment hitasura had sworn eternal friendship the giri he felt toward tori was immutable absolute it would be unthinkable to question his loyalty tori made half a dozen calls all from different phone booths on the streets and in hotel lobbies before she got the response she had been seeking twenty minutes later a red bmw swooped them up in the ginza they were squeezed into the front seat while wax plugs were put in their ears from behind and they were blindfolded the bmw stopped and they were transferred to the roomier backseat it accelerated into the city neither of them spoke tori had cautioned russell against any untoward word or gesture just sit back and relax she had told him let whats going to happen happen russell had not protested yet another sign that the new side of his personality that had emerged in medellin was gaining dominance now he sat with uncharacteristic calm while they hurtled through the innards of tokyo a sense of acceleration the centrifugal force generated by turns and the passage of time were the only clues left to give them an inkling of where they were being taken tori had an intimate knowledge of the city but this was like trying to back down a mountainside in a snow storm calculating vectors and distances was next to useless memory and feel were the only things that mattered where would i be if i were hitasura somewhere on the streets tori started at this point and let her intuition unravel the puzzle while one part of her brain was busy with time turns and speed the other part was occupied with solving the mystery of where they were being taken she knew of three of hitasuras bases but she had to take into account that she might be a year out of date it could be very useful to know where hitasura was taking them especially if he had no idea that they knew this was basic tradecraft knowing where you were at all times whether you were with friend or foe still tori had another motivation one that disturbed her profoundly after estilos betrayal she was unsure of everything and everyone caution was one thing but fullblown paranoia could paralyze you you had to know which way to jump at any minute or not knowing sometimes trust if trust was gone only a great black chasm remained yawning below her waiting for the moment when she would fall the bmw came to an abrupt stop and tori and russell were bundled out of the car tori could not shake the odd feeling that they had gone around in circles but she knew that the ginza was not hitasuras territory so that was out or was it they were helped up a short set of stairs and kept bent almost double ushered through what seemed like a tunnel then they were allowed to stand up they were pushed backward until they felt something soft behind their legs they sat at last their earplugs and blindfolds came off at the same instant a muffled roar of a diesel engine sounded a moment later the unmistakable sensation of motion of course tori thought a vehicle we had been driven in a circle to confuse us to make us think we had gotten to another part of the city when all along this van had been waiting around the corner as soon as hitasuras men had determined that she and russell had not been followed they had called for the van tori looked around blinking in the dim light they were in what appeared to be a miniature living room they were sitting on a sofa upholstered in an oriental cotton print of blues greens and deep yellows there was a brass coffee table chinese ginger jar lamps on matching mahogany side tables a pair of dark blue upholstered wing chairs even a couple of pleasant wellframed landscape prints on the walls no windows however it was surprisingly comfortable nonetheless where in the hell are we russell said a moving van a deep rich voice said they looked up saw hitasura a tall slender darkskinned japanese enter the mobile living room one of many in my fleet he smiled warmly should the need arise for you to move one of these vans will handle everything in one load you here in comfort while below and behind you your containerized possessions are safely stored fumigated and sanitized hitasura sat across from them in one of the wing chairs it was large enough to accommodate his height tori it is good to see you again he might have been a handsome man but there was no moderation to his features he had hard eyes a sharp nose and an unforgiving mouth there was a teacolored melanin birthmark on the left side of his neck that ran up his jaw and encroached on the lower portion of his cheek hitasurasan tori said formally this is russell slade a friend mr slade hitasura inclined his head perhaps you will forgive the melodrama when i tell you that these rather elaborate precautions were necessary whats happened tori said picking up on his tone hitasura sat back made a bridge with his fingertips i hardly know where to begin it may be a war is brewing torisan though i hope i am overreacting he looked at her my only brother is dead how he was murdered hitasura said much more than that i do not know it happened sometime shortly after midnight his apartment was broken into some things perhaps were stolen although we can rule out robbery as a motive his money and valuables were not touched tori said have you any idea whos responsible nothing conclusive hitasura said the pain was apparent in his dark eyes in the new lines in his face the pressure of being an oyabun was massive but yesterday morning early a woman hurled my brothers mentor a university professor named giin from the parapet of the nihonbashi giin had been teaching my brother his method of deciphering codes who killed this man giin fukuda that would have been my guess since fukuda works for big ezoe and he is my chief rival but the odd thing is that fukuda was busy elsewhere at the time of guns demise another female assassin tori said doubtfully who youve come back to me at a most propitious time torisan hitasuras eyes were burning i have begun to mobilize all of tokyo to find out we have a fix hitasura said with the receiver of the mobile phone to his ear on who tori said you have no description of the woman who killed giin and you cant even say whether it was she who murdered your brother we know where fukuda is hitasura said fukuda knows we must persuade fukuda to tell us what she knows who is this fukuda russell asked did i hear you right shes some kind of female yakuza assassin thats right tori said the anonymous moving van rumbled through the streets of tokyo hitasura was on the mobile phone getting the latest information on the citywide search for his brothers murderer but i thought the yakuza had no use for women russell said generally speaking thats true tori said but fukuda is an exception in many ways hitasura added he had cradled the phone receiver fukuda has aoh shall we say a history in yakuza lore tori grunted what hitasurasan means is that she broke her way into yakuza society forcibly she made the yakuza oyabun notice her and accept her some hitasura corrected others will never accept a woman doing a mans job better than most men can do it tori said hitasura glowered at her then abruptly laughed torisan too is an exception i do not hold her sex against her he said this in a tone of voice that indicated he should be congratulated for his insight if i read hitasurasans thinking right tori explained he feels sure that if there is another female assassin working she had to have been trained by fukuda fukuda is the key wait a minute russell looked from one to the other even if you manage to capture her what makes you think that this highly trained assassin is going to tell you anything hitasura glanced at tori russell said immediately what am i missing he looked at hitasura but the oyabun turned away tori ton said nothing instead she took his hand in hers placed the flat of it over her left hip it was an extraordinary gesture full of echoes of the past their meeting in the library in la when he had come to rerecruit her and had touched her there how does it feel but there were also intimations of the future an intimacy about which neither of them was at the moment able to speak it was in some sense a tribal gesture a tremor of intent primitive powerful a symbol full of meaning in a land composed of meaningless symbols fukuda broke your hip it was a whisper but tori winced as if she were experiencing again the bright bluewhitegreen flash searing her eyes singeing her brows and fuzz of hair on her arms feeling anew the weird sense not of falling but of floating in the subway tunnel far below the streets of tokyo feeling nothing for an instant and then as if the percussion is hitting her all over again the agonizing teethgrinding pain as the shock dissipates then the extreme heaviness of her own body as if it now weighs tons crashing to the tracks the shining steel coated with a hot sticky substance dark running out of her in a stream and fukuda pausing a moment in the semidarkness of the subway tunnel her face alight with triumph i told you not to get in my way but you didnt listen you took from me something that was very precious now that youii pay with your life perhaps you will understand just how precious the gloating is cut with her rage and her hate you backed the wrong horse sooner or later weii take hitasura down just as weve taken you down no big thing easy does it then she had disappeared and in her place was the rumbling of the oncoming train sweeping around a curve its startlingly brilliant headlight firing the steel tracks the light racing toward tori who lay on the tracks immobile tori tori russell was shaking her are you all right whitefaced tori turned her head toward him no she said her voice a hoarse whisper her eyes locked with his they were dark swirling with emotion ive come full circle russ i beat death once now i see ive got to do it all over again eight arkhangelskoe star town moscow tokyo comrade have you heard the latest news theyve done it again whos done it again valeri said white star the young man with the strawberry birthmark said their elite cadres are better armed more welltrained white star is no longer merely a ragtag guerrilla organization made up of disparate dissident minorities they are a fullfledged army now and elements of this new army have attacked the kyshtym industrial complex it is entirely destroyed valeri bondasenko was sitting on the bench overlooking the large birch tree outpost of the forest on the other side of which were the grounds of arkhangelskoe on one side of him was the young man with the strawberry birthmark on the other his daughter silent imperturbable at their backs up the sloping incline bulked the almost victorian exterior of the insane asylum is that so valeri said i had heard the story differently i had heard that there was a lowlevel nuclear event at the complex but that it was under control kyshtym for almost fifty years had been the site of the soviet unions main military atomic reactors three years ago a massive overhaul of the aging units had begun but only after a series of scrupulously unreported eventsleaks explosions and the likehad killed onethird of the people who worked at kyshtym and who lived in a nearby city so secret it was without a name the young man laughed where do you get your information comrade tass he chuckled shook his head in disbelief when he spoke he looked ahead never at valeri really the gullibility of some people he seemed to have drifted off and was talking to himself and valeri began once again to consider the enormous miscalculation the president made when he began to replace the central communist party with his own handpicked people cults were dangerous if anything in russias recent history had been made manifest it was that the president had needed some form of stability to hold the center together while he gathered his cult around him and he had most unwisely chosen the military to aid him in return for their help he had promisedand deliveredmore and more money to the generals annual budget this had created a serious shortfall in the other national sectors in dire need of money now the president was paying the fearful price of consolidating his power in the form of strikes local uprisings the disintegration of the economy the appalling western characteristic of the polarization of the classes and the concomitant rise to power of white star valeri shivered trying to free his mind from its turmoil he slipped his hand into his daughters as if this could reassure her that he was here with her he wanted so much to see even the slightest hint of a reaction a sense that there was the spark of consciousness in her mind that she might be thinking i know youre with me daddy and it makes me feel better but then the young man spoke directly to valeri no no comrade it was white star they blew apart the concrete lake prison labor helped pour they exposed cracked reactor cores defective rods that caused partial meltdowns and enough carelessly dumped plutonium sludge to irradiate all of siberia im told the entire area has been evacuated the officials wont get any more idiots from the city without a name to come in and clean up like they did after the disaster of fiftyseven within two years over a thousand people had died of radiation poisoning within ten years twentyseven hundred more died of cancer almost everyone who had been brought in the for the cleanup in exchange for promises of extended vacations the young man laughed again but this time there was a disturbing edge to it the workers got vacations all right only they were a bit more extended than they had bargained for valeri gripped the white hand of his daughter all the tighter the tracery of blue veins beneath the translucent surface of her skin reminded him of the skein of birch branches bare traced with snow pale against the dark ukrainian sky in winter the stars valeris father had said during the last nights of his life perhaps our salvation lies in the stars the stars look cruel i know but valeri denysovich i know they are not here is where the cruelty reigns in kiev in the captive ukraine valeri had stayed with his father until his nights became hours then minutes and at last his eyes closed for the final time a moment later the red sun rose over the snowcovered roofs to the east bloodying their tops valeri sitting next to his only child in this pastoral almost peaceful setting near arkhangelskoe could not remember his father without also conjuring up the dreaded specter of solovki in the late s and early thirties the solovki islands in the white sea had been turned into one of the most infamous of the russian death camps into the forbidding universe of solovki had been thrown the socalled antisoviet elements chief among them the rebel ukrainian kulaksthe peasants valeris uncle had been a kulak but after he had been shot by a russian soldier in the streets of kiev for daring to speak his native language valeris father decided on another course of action he joined the army not just any division mind you but the fiercely independent first siberian cavalry corps he had seen that as his revenge against the russians but instead it proved his undoing six months after he joined in the autumn of the corps was overrun by russian loyalists who were sent by moscow to punish the unit for spreading antisoviet propaganda the truth was the first siberian had gotten too powerful it had made moscow nervous in a nervous time and moscow had acted accordingly valeris father was imprisoned for a short time then sent summarily to solovki there was no trial no chance to refute the charges in fact charges were never read to him he never knew what he had been accused of that scarcely mattered to valeris father he was ukrainian that alone was enough to mark him as a potentially dangerous criminal thats just what the russians had made me he would tell valeri many years later a dangerous criminal in solovki valeris father and his fellow inmates were fed when they were fed at allon nine ounces of moldy black bread and a bowl of something akin to hot water with a lump of frostblackened turnip floating in it clothes were out of the question as was any form of heat save the occasional fire a week after his father arrived in solovki there were already so many inmates that the overcrowding became intolerable as a consequence inmates were herded out in order to be sent to another camp valeris father watched with bleak eyes as his fellow criminals pushed shoved clawed and fought each other to be chosen anyplace the reasoning went would be an improvement over solovki his father was chosen in the last batch herded out but in the turmoil he managed to slip away secrete himself beside a mother and child blueskinned and stiff dead for a day and a half he had no desire to be trekked to another place he knew nothing about better the devil you know he told himself than stepping out blindfolded in the dark it was two months before he received word through the camp grapevine as to the fate of those who had left solovki they had been sent to siberia marched up the narrow iceclogged vasyugan stream they had been left on the ice fields and the barren bogs without food or clothes all of them had died his father spent just over three years in solovki though he lost two fingers and four toes to frostbite though he lost sixty pounds he was a survivor he stole food from the dead ate the flesh of the odd guard dog that died of exposure and eventually learned how to snare fish from the icy waters he escaped finally one moonless winters night with the snow falling eerily on the water the guard dogs barking frantically the darkness aflame with automatic gunfire he was wounded but managed to escape it took him six weeks to make his way back to kiev and by that time he had lost the feeling in both his legs in order to save his life the legs had to be amputated do it do it he had shouted at the surgeons shaking with rage at the indignity of what was about to happen whats the difference i only have six toes anyway thats not so much to miss but solovki had done more than take his legs it had dehumanized him living with the dead eating frozen dog meat watching day by day as his fellow ukrainians wasted away or were shot by guards bored drunk or both had scarred his soul he could never again think about his country in the same way just as the murder of his brother had caused a violent reaction in him so had his time in solovki but instead of turning his burning rage outward now his isolation had turned it inward it had been his son valeri who had saved him from taking a pistol and putting it to his head valeri had said the only thing that would make his father want to keep living i want to learn father i want to know what it means to be a ukrainian and i can only do that from you now i am the father valeri bondasenko thought sitting beside his mute unthinking daughter on the wide lawn of the asylum near arkhangelskoe i want to teach her what you taught me father but even if she hears me she isnt listening does this mean theyve won father the russians who systematically beat us stripped us of our culture our past who have entangled us in hopelessness who have tried their best to exterminate us no no no i havent forgotten what you taught me how to bury my hate so deeply no one would ever find out what was in my heart no they havent won the russians but they havent lost not yet not yet another day another visit to the man who would be god mars volkov thought as he drove up to the heros fortresslike complex within star town he did not immediately get out of the chaika limousine however but instead listened again to the tape recording he had made of his last conversation with the hero i dont know whats come over me before i lifted off i never had much of a sense of humor who knows perhaps being suspended between heaven and a living hell will do that for you it had been a rather nice touch mars thought to make such a theatrical display of disabling the monitoring equipment in the heros living quarters of course it was quite real mars had actually shut down the system and he had been correct not to inform the dolts downstairs their display of genuine pique had put the icing on the cake no amount of acting no matter how expert would fool the hero or his idiot manque arbat there are some who think you re lying or have misremembered or are delusional are you one of those all in all mars thought the last interrogation had gone well mars was far too clever to try to fool the hero at this late stage it would he knew be another mistake to underestimate the hero now even though he mars had finally gamed the high ground in their battle of wits marss own sentiments about being fed up with playing their nowin game had been real as well but he was not as much the maverick as he had led the hero to believeit was far more convincing to tell a semblance of the truth than to try to put over a lie consequently mars had come prepared to his last meeting he had been wearing a body mike attached to a portable microcassette recorder the same was true today the corpse opened its mouth and no no this isnt something out of a sciencefiction or a horror film he didnt come back from the dead nor was he animated like a zombie or a golem this was something else mars reached over shut off the tape what had happened up there between the stars he was becoming consumed with this puzzle he sat for a moment longer lost in thought then he got out of the chaika went through the laborious but necessary security procedures to allow him entrance to the heros complex inside the hero was with tatiana she was a short blond woman with a ruddy complexion and wideset direct gray eyes she had the wide shoulders narrow waist and hips of the athlete she was as attractive as lara though in an entirely different way good morning comrade tatiana said when she saw mars enter the pool area her swimsuit was quite shockingly brief cut very high around the tops of the legs in the western manner and mars made a mental note to order different more modest suits for his guard girls he nodded to her said where is odysseus arbat surfaced sped across the diameter of the pool spewed water all over mars tatiana put her hand over her mouth tamed her face away but not before mars caught a glimpse of her laughing hes in the shower she said when she had recovered she brought him a towel mars glowered making quite sure her face was solemn what the hell does he need to shower for mars said tightly hes in the goddamned pool all the time anyway he never goes in the pool without showering first tatiana said a buzzer sounded and she went across the room she opened a translucent glass door and mars could hear the shower cut off then she reappeared carrying the hero in her arms odysseus said nothing until tatiana had deposited him into the pool he slid from her arms as if he were a slippery eel his sleek hairless body so pale and unearthly in color was sheened as if with oil as well as water arbat immediately began a series of clicks to which the responded briefly he turned to mars youre early good morning to you too mars said sourly the hero bobbed in the water eyed him did you fall into a puddle i dont believe its raining the dolphin out of the corner of his eye mars saw tatiana stifle a laugh it was your bloody dolphins idea of a joke oh not a joke odysseus said when arbats clicks had ceased it was her way of saying hello comrade dont be idiotic youre trying my patience and you odysseus said have been trying mine he smiled that makes us even though not in any way youd understand but maybe you still feel at a disadvantage youre wondering im willing to bet what it is that odysseus sees in being in the pool all day am i right before mars had a chance to answer the hero had pressed on so heres your big opportunity comrade volkov take off your clothes and join us see firsthand what its all about when mars hesitated the hero said still undecided lets give you a hand in making up your mind arbat the dolphin leaped up and at the top of her arc spat a long stream of water into marss face when she landed she did so broadside sending a wave over the side of the pool inundating mars guess you dont have much of a choice now comrade odysseus said clearly delightedmars in an inner rage resolved to do nothing outwardly to show the hero he had won this round but simple human dignity dictated that he say i have no bathing attire thats a quaint thought the hero said i dont need bathing attire why should you mars could think of no appropriate answer so instead he stalked across the room to the shower area and disrobed he wrapped a towel around his middle reemerged welcome volkov odysseus said to the isle of polyphemus the cyclops grimfaced mars approached the pool and deliberately ignoring tatiana who was already bobbing alongside the hero dropped the towel and slid into the water arbat made quite a fuss clicking and diving for a moment mars was uneasy it suddenly dawned on him that he was in the creatures domain what would the dolphin choose to do to him nothing it seemed but click and dive arbat never approached him its easier here in the water the hero said in the silence after the dolphins last outburst what is mars found himself asking life odysseus said staring up at the arched ceiling alight with reflections from the water i thought that would be selfevident once you were in here his gaze lowered his eyes mars saw were the color of gun metal today and seemingly just as hard but perhaps i have overestimated you i hope not mars said well see mars said id like to return to something you spoke about last time the unspeakable color you saw in menelauss eyes after he died mars had almost forgotten the name the hero wanted him to use menelaus another of the greek chieftains who took part in the sack of troy and so homer would have us believe odysseuss alter ego the color of god so you said im interested to learn why you used just that term surely there are others that would do as well are there odysseus said if so its clear you wouldnt know them youre in the dark here all of you im the only lamp to guide you thats true mars conceded but god were back to him im afraid odysseus said and you said you no longer wanted to talk about god ive changed my mind really well thats mighty adaptable of you im impressed the hero closed his eyes for a moment all right god do you know that dolphins believe in god arbat has quite a cogent concept of him much more sensible than the clumsy versions humans have been able to come up with there it was again not we but humans as if he was no longer human i chose that phrase the color of god because it was the only one that is appropriate the hero said we return to albat to dolphins in general their minds dont work like humans volkov arbats mind works in a kind of wave pattern and beyond that spirals linear thinking is unknown to her interesting no his eyes popped open so god to her is time not day and night dolphins dont conceive of such categorized sections time as in movementthe movement that has extended before life that extends through life and will extend after life has been terminated mars tried to absorb this circumlocution and what has this to do with the color in menelauss dead eyes they werent dead odysseus said oh yes menelaus himself was an empty husk embalmed by the winds of space but his eyes had become a conduit what precisely did you see in them that the hero said is the fundamental mistake youve all made i didnt see something in them i saw through them it was as if they had become a telescope of fantastic power i saw elsewhere i saw elsewhen mars closed his eyes pressed his fingers against the lids he was getting a headache the essential problem was that he couldnt tell whether this discussion was too profound or too laughable for him was he confronting a madman or what what had happened to the two men of odingalaktika ii during the event when all telemetry and monitoring went down that was what mars had been ordered to find out had the hero in some way been transformed or was he merely pulling everyones leg amusing himself at the states expense as some kind of sick reparation for his disabilities the truly frightening thing mars thought now was that there was at least the possibility that the hero had been transformed by the event in that case what had he become can you give me even a hint mars said at last of what elsewhere and elsewhen mean odysseus held out his arm tatiana he said would you come here tatiana obediently swam in his direction so that she was in front of him then the two of them swam forward until tatianas body was pressed so firmly against marss that he could feel her hard breasts the slight swell of her stomach the press of her pubic mound what bear with me comrade odysseus said firmly and dont back up this is all in the name of socalled science he peered into marss face i want you to imagine that still being you you feel tatianas breasts as if they were your own you feel her sexual organs as well as yours swim in the pulse of her blood as well as your own wander through her thought patterns can you do that volkov no i suppose not he let tatiana go but that is what i meant when i said elsewhere this means mars said slowly taking it a step at a time that in menelauss dead eyes you sense the presence of another entity yes and during the event you merged with the entity not merged the hero said it was more as if i was allowed in for just a moment to take a look around i want you to be absolutely clear about this mars said by entity do i take it you mean an extraterrestrial i cant think what else it might be this is rapidly becoming infuriating mars thought hes so clear about this that im beginning to believe his madness perhaps im coming here too often can madness be communicative no impossible but then he reminded himself that if odysseus were indeed mad it was an entirely new form of madness which the scientific team had yet to identify let alone begin to define all right mars said lets leave the issue of elsewhere for the time being what about elsewhen in an odd way thats simpler to explain the hero said because it more directly relates to the color between the stars the color of god god is time and time is what i saw not the present or the past or even the future now youre talking in riddles mars said testily einstein proved that einstein was wrong odysseus said matteroffactly his mind brilliant though it was was human and therefore bound by certain limitations but when it comes to time there is only past present and future not so volkov the hero said what i saw was all three at once past present and future merged not three streams but a continuum it was like coming to the edge of a dense forest and beyond walking down a shoreline to a vast ocean that i never before imagined was there now mars felt a peculiar crawling in his belly an icy fear gripping his bowels for as he spoke the heros face had become transfigured odysseus said there i was wading in it in time and i came upon existence i saw myself existing in pastpresentfuture all at once they were the same not different there was no younger or older there was no death age and death are myths volkov but they re not the only ones he reached down plucked at his sleek silvery flesh the body too is a myth its what inhibits us what gives rise to the myths of age and death without the body we can step freely into the ocean of time mars experienced once again that vertiginous sensation that comes with the proximity to madness but he still did not know which of them in the pool was mad you dont believe me odysseus said i can see it in your face he shrugged well you asked for the truth dont blame me if youre unable to accept it he gave mars a pitying look however i cant in all good conscience blame you you werent there how could you believe mars took a long time thinking over what the hero had said at last he said one thing disturbs me only one odysseus said sardonically from what you claim you experienced during the event it would seem as if you would have returned to earth in a kind of state of grace in possession of a great peacefulness yet if i remember correctly you have said that you are suspended between heaven and a living hell and its obvious you have a great deal of rage that you barely suppress how do you explain these discrepancies odysseus turned to tatiana i want to get out immediately she launched herself onto the coping still dripping she went off are you going to be patient volkov arbats head bobbed upon the water looking inquisitively between the two men tatiana returned with the heros special wheelchair then she bent down lifted him out of the water arbat began a long series of clicks her nose bobbing incessantly as if she were distressed when tatiana had settled the hero in draped the oversized towel across his loins he said wait here for a moment comrade talk to tatiana im sure you can benefit from her insights he threw the wheelchairs engine into gear motored off across the huge room mars at the edge of the pool crossed his arms over one another on me coping he gazed into tatianas face for a long time before saying what do you think is going on here what you want to know tatiana said is whether or not hes mad in a sense mars conceded i have to know whether or not hes telling the truth did he come facetoface with an extraterrestrial or has the cosmic radiation he was exposed to affected his brain oh yes tatiana said unhelpfully he could be telling the truth as he knows it and also be quite insane her tone was so like the one the hero used that mars was momentarily nonplussed by the time he recovered the hero had returned he stopped at the outer edge of the coping and looking down at mars in the water said rage and a sense of a living hell he threw down a packet of photocopied papers this should answer your question marss hands were dry and he leafed through the pages as he did so the icy ball in his stomach expanded what he was looking at was a limited distribution kremlin report that not only should not have been copied it should never have been known to exist the document was so top secret fully twothirds of the politburo were ignorant of it mars saw that his hands were trembling and he immediately fought to gain control of himself how in gods name had anyonelet alone the hero locked away in this fortressgotten a copy of this document he thought again of the hero knowing about tatiana and lara and their weekly reports to him how the hero had known about the extent of the monitoring and had used the pool to give himself a measure of freedom he stared up at the hero as if seeing him for the first time holy mother he thought what have we let in among us marss mouth was dry and he had to swallow several times before he was able to say you never should have seen this it was futile asking the hero where he had obtained the copy mars knew he wouldnt divulge his secret just as he knew he could not force the hero to tell him the thing was to somehow get the to tell him of his own free will but i did see it odysseus was saying its a report detailing one of the experiments done during the odingalaktika ii mission funny neither menelaus nor i were ever told of it no one else was either is that supposed to make me feel better that we werent the only ones in the dark odysseus cocked his head as if he were listening to a voice only he could hear but we were the guinea pigs he roared so abruptly that tatiana flinched below him mars fought for control he was acutely aware of how vulnerable he was floating naked in the pool while the hero sat above him you set up cosmic ray experiments odysseus continued built into our eva suits was a kind of filter to expose us to a minimum dosage of cosmic rays no youre wrong mars cleared his throat this plan was discussed but it was never implemented youre dissembling comrade odysseus clucked his tongue against the roof of his mouth think about it mars said would the americans have ever let us perform this kind of experiment they have an almost holy reverence for their space program your exposure to cosmic rays was purely accidental something went wrong ill tell you what went wrong odysseus thundered we were never meant to make it to mars the odingalaktika ii was meant for this cosmic ray experiment alone no no no mars was shouting himself now but he could not seem to stop were not monsters why must you persist in seeing us that way whats happened to you you know very well whats happened im irradiated with cosmic raysat your instigation the heros expression was withering at last all his pentup rage was being played out youve made me into a fucking laboratory experiment all because some of your people got the idea that minute dosages of cosmic rays could counteract the damaging longrange effects of weightlessness the heros fists were clenched tight do you have any idea what youve done to me he shook his head whats the difference even if you had a clue you wouldnt care would you youre all heartless bastards no heart no soul thats what the dolphins say did you know that his right fist opened heres a little present for you something glowing dropped from his hand into the water beside mars a little plutonium christ jesus christ mars heaved himself out of the water you are mad youre homicidal he began to shiver no one made a move to hand him a towel and he was too paralyzed with fear to move he felt the racing of his heart his guts had turned to water and he was certain he had begun to involuntarily urinate before he made it out of the pool he was only too familiar with the fearful effects of radiation poisoning relax odysseus said looking at marss white face its just a marble i coated with a harmless radium paint he seemed calmer now arbat gave out with a short burst of clicks the hero smiled thinly arbat says you peed into her water gave you quite a fright didnt i now perhaps you have some sense of what you did to me but we didnt save it odysseus said swiveling abruptly away for another day end of interrogation in the aftermath of what she had doneunleashing her rage murdering giinhonno dreamed suspended between sleep and consciousness she dwelled in the shining field she had been taught to search for and to make her own and she once again walked the path of her awakening when honno was eight years old she overheard a conversation between her parents it was night and she was awake being in the midst of a fever that had left her so painridden she could not sleep for a while she stared out her window the moon was full the mountains of her home which she loved to climb were visible stark sentinels in the blue light once she saw lights in the mountains moving as if of their own accord and because it was said that gods lived there she was certain that they were the source of the light often she would pray to these gods to release her from her curse it was summer and the fusuma from her parents room out to the garden was open cool moonlight slipped into their room and through the translucence of the ricepaper shoji walls honno could make out her parents as silhouettes their movements throwing shadows against the rice paper oversized slightly distorted as if they were characters in a theater play illuminated by stage lights i had a dream honnos mother was saying it was about our daughter i do not want to hear anything more about honno her father noboru said but you must the hand of one silhouette reached out grabbed the sleeve of the other this was a significant dream i dreamed that it was the dead of winter snow covered the ground in every direction but curiously the trees were as black and bare as if they had been set on fire there was no snow on them at all as i said it was winter we lived in a desolate place i cant say where honno awoke she was ill as she is now and needed to defecate i took her outside in the snow dont ask me why she squatted down and i watched her as protective as could be then out of the corner of my eye i saw movement there was a stoat staring at me with redrimmed eyes she was as black as the blasted trees and as gaunt she had never grown her white winter fur and i could see her swollen teats hanging down from the loose skin of her underbelly but it was her face that terrified me honnos mother went on her muzzle was dripping blood and i knew that she had slain her mate so that her cubs might eat now she was looking hungrily at honno i looked from the stoat to honno and to my horror i saw that what was spilling out of honno was not feces but blood it soaked into the pure white snow the stain spreading farther and farther hinoeuma the husband killer noboru said foolish foolish woman for not taking the proper precautions we must do something honnos mother said my dream was an omen a warning of evil what would you have me do take her honnos mother said to the man of one tree the man of one tree was so called because he lived on an island off the southern coast of japan it was a singular place rocky bleak lashed by wind and rain in the summer wind and sleet in the winter the island seemed to be built not upon bedrock but rather the gigantic root system of the ancient pine tree that overspread ninetenths of the island having made the journey south with honno noboru had hired a small boat which had deposited them on the rockstrewn beach of the man of one trees island the man of one tree was a hunchback with a head far too large for the rest of his monkeylike body and his appearance frightened honno she hid behind her fathers legs while he addressed the man of one tree my daughter noboru said is hinoeuma having had the misfortune to be born in the sixtieth cycle of the year of the horse my wife and i fear that she is destined to murder her husband the man of one tree peered at honno with his frightful opaque pitchblack eyes it was said that he was indonesian or in any event had emigrated many years ago from that mysterious archipelago now he produced five shards of halfblackened tortoiseshell he threw them onto the ground three times after which he squatted down his thick brows knit tight as he read the runes inscribed on the insides of the shells he looked up at noboru his wrists on his knees accentuating even further his simian aspect you could kill her he said in a high quavery voice honno whimpered and noboru put a protective arm around her holding her tight to him are you mad he said this is my flesh and blood whatever she may be she is my child i would not have her harmed the mail of one tree nodded sagely as if he had been presented with the correct response or he said you can leave her with me for how long noboru asked the man of one tree stood when she is ready she will come to you but my wifei must be able to tell her when she can see honno tell your wife the man of one tree said to forget she has a daughter tell her to turn her mind to other matters she will not survive the separation otherwise honno had cried bitterly when her father had left she had run onto the beach the sharp rocks slashing through her thinsoled shoes cutting the bottoms of her feet daddy she had wailed daddy but noboru had already turned resolutely away as the boat took him out over the gray sea toward home honno collapsed at the edge of the water weeping uncontrollably then she was aware of being lifted into the air and opening her eyes saw to her utter astonishment that the man of one tree had hefted her in his arms as easily as if she were a sack of rice why do you cry little one he said this is a new beginning for you a chance for life instead of death i want to go home honno had cried i understand the man of one tree had said home is where i am taking you it took honno less than a year to think of the island as home but then children are so much more adaptable than adults noboru for instance would never have been able to make the adjustment the thing about the man of one tree was that he was so interesting even when honno could not quite grasp everything he said she filed it away to ponder over late at night when she was alone staring up at the stars glittering through the overarching branches of the one tree and that was another thing that surprised her she enjoyed being alone having time to listen to the rhythm of the surf on the rocks the crying of the terns and gulls the rising and falling whisper of the sea wind through the tangle of the one tree the ticking of her own mind thought takes time the man of one tree had told her early on in her stay and it takes effort because you must decide which thoughts will improve you which will impair you you must think of your mind as a garden that needs constant attention you must study and discuss your studies to feed it you must regularly seek the silence and isolation essential for periodic weeding honno used the stars as her focus they were so far away that even her wa which each day she and the man of one tree worked to expand could never reach them but stretching over such a distance allowed for the deepest weeding in the night honno recalled her lessons for the day turning them over and over as if they were jewels of great value which she must observe from every facet in this manner she absorbed everything she was taught she proved to be an extraordinary pupil her memory was prodigious and as long as her interest was piqued she never grew tired or unresponsive the man of one tree instructed her in the basics of zen and shinto for he felt strongly that religion was the backbone of any successful education from there he moved outward in what he saw as concentric circles to the tao and the philosophy of laotse now came the warlike more secular philosophies of the master strategist sun tzu and the master swordsman miyamoto musashi concurrent with these mental studies were the physical exercises tai chi jiujutsu aikido karate kenjutsu one might think of this as a rather traditional curriculum and it was for a young boy studying the martial arts it was totally unconventional for a female in addition the man of one tree added to honnos studies the somewhat more esoteric philosophies and physical disciplines he had acquired during his years crisscrossing the indonesian archipelago you will never be a woman in the traditional sense the man of one tree said to honno one night it was six years since she had come to live with him she had breasts now and the place between her thighs was covered with fine black hair she had bled for the first time that evening just as the sun was sinking with the colors of a peacock into the turbulent ocean she had known what the blood flow was and what it meant but some other part of her the hinoeuma child hanging on had remembered the horror of her mothers dream how she had squatted in the snow and under the baleful gaze of the starving stoat had squirted blood i am still hinoeuma she had said in despair to the man of one tree she was trembling and her callused hands were rough and red from scrubbing herself i am still unclean to which he had replied you will never be a woman in the traditional sense he took her to the center of the one tree where its trunk was as large as a house where even the stars could not be seen and sat her down with her back to the rough bark but that is all to the good i have done my best to cleanse your spirit never mind your body it will only betray you it will never betray me honno had said naively he spread his arms wide when you return to the mainland all this will fade in time no no it will come to seem as a dream the man of one tree persisted that is only natural it is the way of life you will continue to mature until you become a woman then will your body betray you and you will want what every woman wants a husband a family a home but your path leads in other directions for you normality will bring to the fore your hinoeuma and only evil can ensue therefore i counsel you to be strong within yourself when you feel the urge to fall in love to marry return to that place in your spirit i have taught you to find for only this will nurture you and protect you from the fate of the hinoeuma the husband killer honno opening her eyes in the present stared out into pale sunlight except she was still seeing the body of the young man whose larynx she had crushed had it been only hours ago it felt like years but yes it must be only hours in her minds eye she could still see his blood fresh on her hands and behind her big ezoe saying almost gently mrs kansei i have the sakata ledgers and their decoded pages its time to go now irina and natasha mayakova went to dinner almost every night even on those days when she wasnt attending natashas acting classes in the back of the new moscow arts theater irina met natasha after her performance of three sisters often in fact they did not have a proper dinner they preferred to stroll through the streets and parks talking endlessly talking they would stop eventually for a bowl of cabbage soup in some tiny neighborhood shop filled with steam and gossip then move on drifting through their city a part of it yet somehow apart creating their own world now more than ever irina was burning with curiosity about natashas relationship with valeri she could not be seeing him at night unless they met very late and as irina was coming to understand an actor could allow neither drunken days nor sleepless nights while she was working at the same time irina found herself feeling guilty at having lied to natasha about her name it was no longer exciting to hear natasha call her by the name of katya boroskaya instead she longed to be called by her real name yet she could think of no way to tell natasha that her name was irina ponomareva what excuse could she give for her falsehood besides despite her growing friendship with natasha she was loath to give up her reason for contacting her in the first place to find the link with valeri it was so incredibly wearying to be a spy and to be feeling close to the person on whom you were spying often on their walks irina forgot why she was there and for a brief time would luxuriate in her newfound friendship then reality would intrude and in some subtle way that disturbed and depressed her she would withdraw from the shared intimacy with natasha at night in bed alone irina would think of her relationship with natasha it seemed terribly unfair that her one chance at true friendship should be tainted so distorted by lies and deceit her nights with valeri became more fevered fueled by a kind of desperation pulled from irinas very core their lovemaking was increasingly wild animalistic exhausting so that afterward irina would plunge into the most absolute slumber from which valeri was obliged to shake her awake in the morning then over his protestations she would climb upon his naked body spread her legs across his loins moving until she felt his response then engulf him with her mouth until he arched off the bed exploding in an orgy of selfdestruction she could no longer tell the difference between lust and love and valeris groans of sexual arousal and release would haunt her all day echoing in her ears while she watched him talking intimately with natasha mayakova until tears of hatred and selfpity clouded her eyes irina irina irina she would recite her name silently as if it were a prayer or an enchantment that would ensure she remembered who she really was the trouble was she no longer knew who irina ponomareva was somewhere along the line her identity her self had been misplaced or covered over so thoroughly that she had forgotten where to look for it at marss apartment after he fell asleep after their tepid lovemaking she would stare at the ceiling and before she herself fell into a shallow troubled sleep she would promise herself that tomorrow would be the day when she would confess everything to natasha so that they would have an opportunity to start all over but she awoke each morning knowing that she could never go through with it what was done was done she could never go back sanitize the emotions that were sure to be raised by the truth would natasha forgive her for using her or would she never want to see her again with a profound sense of foreboding irina knew that she could not take the chance to find out her relationship with natasha was already too precious for her to jeopardize it in any way and yet she knew that she was jeopardizing it every time she and natasha were together when there was a possibility that she might slip or that someone she knew would recognize her and use her real name worse she suspected that she hated natasha as much as she cared for her despised her for her relationship with valeri the unknown nature of which irina found increasingly maddening irina had begun to experience an odd sense of fragmentation as if her life had been an eggshell that had abruptly been struck against a stone turned into jagged bits all with their own structure but each with far less than the whole some essential truth was missing and had been she realized for some time even before she had met valeri irina knew that she had been given a glimpse of that truth that heart of things that when she understood it would come to mean more to her than anything elsein america in boston she had watched the kids pouring out of the universities she had walked the treelined cambridge streets with them had eaten pizza and coke alongside them had bought clothes where they did had listened to their music first in snatches from passing cars then in jukeboxes in the pizzerias then in the dance clubs late at night one evening she had been invited to a party along with everyone elseincluding the chefof the local pizzeria she had of course declined but moments later thought why not it was as close to allout chaos as irina had ever been the noise level was tremendous her glass shook in her hand and her teeth ached from the vibrations it was wonderful as liberating in its way as sitting in the darkened movie theater watching elizabeth taylor being martha in whos afraid of virginia woolf but different so different everything was spontaneous from the laughter to the comings and goings of people from the informality to the wide range of conversation topics kierkegaard on the meaning of death woody allen on the meaning of life tom cruise on the meaning of sex it was dizzying wild captivating irina had not wanted to leave there was a young man there with hair the color of a bears pelt he wore it short on the sides long and flowing on top so that he was continually brushing it back from his forehead he had watched her drifting slowly from group to group in the party with a shyness that made irinas heart ache at one point when she was standing on the edge of the crowd and he was dancing with a thin sandyhaired woman he had accidentally brushed against her spilling the contents of the glass over her oh im sorry he said im so sorry its all right irina said its only club soda and then because he obviously could not take his eyes off her shouldnt you get back to your dance partner she ran into him again in the kitchen it was late and the crowd had begun to thin out irina was putting a slice of cold pizza in the microwave and he had stopped her dont you know anything he said you cant use foil in there itll pop all over the place he put the pizza on a paper plate shoved it in turned on the microwave they shared the slice youre the russian arent you the young man said yes your english is excellent i wish my russian was as good how good is it irina asked him in russian only soso im afraid he said in the same language you need to speak more thats all irina said switching back to english she found that she wasnt in the least nostalgic for anything russian all of a sudden the young man leaned forward kissed her on the lips ive been wanting to do that all night he said in a rush did you think id be offended i had no way of knowing and in that one sentence he had summed up for her the disquiet she had been feeling there why was she so comfortable so free in boston why did she not feel homesick for moscow had no way of knowing tacked away in russia she had had no way of knowing what america would be like let alone boston or this wondrous cambridge area delightfully oldfashioned yet at the same time so excitingly avantgarde a world within a world within a world all scrupulously hidden from her by her government oh how she had wept that night when at last she had crawled into her bed because she would never feel the same about her home anymore doubts so fundamental that they questioned her entire way of life had crept into her consciousness and once there they could never be dispelled the very worst of it was that as soon as she got back to moscow it all seemed like a dream the silk charmeuse teddy she had swooned over the magnificent martha brought to life by elizabeth taylor the endless pizza and cokes the equally endless curious minds the shocking music and even more shocking clothes the young man at the cambridge party who had loved her from afar who had dared to kiss her who had said to her had no way of knowing all were swept away on the gray tide of minutiae that was her daily life a dream thats what it had become she would dreamwhen she was released from the recurring prison nightmareof cambridge and would awake weeping as if it were as lost as camelot or as mythic as avalon so painful had this sense of loss become that even irinas feelings for mars could not quench them sex with valeri was an inadequate opiate and more and more often she would seek the only solace she had ever known kneeling before the altar at the church of the archangel gabriel there she prayed for guidance and for some measure of peace which she now suspected was beyond her and then one evening in the midst of a sleety rain that had driven them off the slick moscow streets the miraculous occurred natasha said do you know that my greatest moment on the stage came not in moscow not in russia at all in fact but in the united states i was asked to perform at lincoln center in new york city do you know it ive never been to new york city irina said with her heart in her mouth she knew this was the time to mention boston but she could not they were in praga a restaurant on arbat square it was a touristy place so the food was good and because the owners knew natasha the service was too irina stared out the windows at the people hunched over hurrying along the rainswept street she found to her utter amazement that she felt no connection with those people it was as if she were now separated from them all the time by this plateglass window as if she were here safe and dry while they were there cold and wet but if they were here in moscow she asked herself then where was she hi some kind of terrible limbo or purgatory serving out her sentence in the prison that barred even the moon katya natasha put a hand over hers whats the matter you look as white as winter irinas depression was so intense that she completely forgot who katya was and for an interminable moment stared blankly into natashas concerned face katya yes yes irina said breathing again in out in out everything quite normal now and yet not normal at all im fine i dont know what came over me for a moment i was so dizzy its passed now nevertheless natasha said firmly its a glass of starka for you my girl and for gods sake eat you havent touched a thing later after the plates were cleared and the strong dark tea had been served natasha said america is such an unusual place how i wish you could see it so filled with delicious sights sounds tastes quite naughty really she chuckled there was for instance the divinely decadent french bustier i wore the night that texas financier and i she stopped abruptly waved a delicate hand but no i think ive already shocked you quite enough for one evening i dont think im easily shocked natasha laughed oh but of course you are youre such a naif katya after all education in this country is so appallingly primitive in some ways im afraid were still not much better than all those thirdworld countries were always professing to help it often seems to me that were the ones who need assistance natasha sipped her tea let me tell you something darting when i was in new york i met edward albee he had come to watch me perform can you imagine my god what an opportunity and do you know what i made the most of it id be damned if i was going to talk with one of the most brilliant theater minds of this century while my flock of kgb babysitters was hovering all around eavesdropping i took albee and we ducked away lost them all what i learned from him i could never have gotten from thirty years with my russian acting teacher he spoke in truths his language was a kind of music that i seemed to absorb through the pores of my skin i felt as if i had never before been alive had never known what it was to don a persona and walk out on the stage he showed me how to speak not only his words but all words natasha poured herself more tea and as she stirred in the sugar her eyes shone with an inner light we talked all night what a risk darling but what else could i do it was hell to pay ill tell you when i got back to the hotel but who cares i have a guardian angel who watches over me irina wondered whether that guardian angel was valeri my whole point natasha continued is your rage it was my acting teachers point of view that rage is frustration stifled the older i get the more i am inclined to agree with him she took irinas hand your rage is such that sooner or later you will be unable to control it then it will boil over and well who knows what the consequences might be that night in new york city edward albee showed me what i was meant to be and that knowledge has made me a different person he opened up the world to menot only his world but mine oh darling dont you see what im saying she searched irinas eyes one day you will meet your albee and he will change your life utterly the answer for you is to seize your moment as i did mine you must say to yourself damn the risks and plow straight ahead believe me there is a time to consider the consequences and a time to ignore them do you understand me katya you have no idea how frustrating it is mars said to irina two nights later knowing that somewhere out there the leaders of white star are going about their daily livesand i cant get to them he turned to her have you gotten any leads not yet irina said they were in marss apartment on vosstaniya square it was very late at night the streets were deserted every so often a military truck or troop carrier would rumble by irina thought i even miss the traffic in cambridge the blasting rock n roll the kids swinging their hips laughing drinking their cokes eating their pizzas these days hardly an hour passed without some memory of cambridge surfacing like a fish through the ice appearing like a specter pulling her further and further from her own world there was a tautness inside her like a steel cable singing with vibration it was always with her disconnecting her further from everyone and everything around her once she had even found herself unable to breathe as if she were stuck in a black airless place irina felt guilty having indulged her appetite for friendship rather than exploiting the closeness that had developed between her and natasha mayakova but what was she to make of her relationships with mars and valeri she had no idea now what she felt for either of them she felt as if she could not now exist without them as if theyand natashawere her only lifelines she loved and hated them at the same time not yet understanding that her sense of them was distorted by the turmoil writhing inside her like a live thing she felt trapped on the other side of the mirror in a place where there were no signposts to tell her which way to go or how to feel the situation seemed far too complex for her to untangle she was in over her head and now she appeared to be drowning in an alien sea beyond her understanding mars grunted perhaps my trust in you is misplaced dont say that isnt it true i have given you everything you wanted false papers a private car leave from your work when you need it to careen around god only knows what sections of moscow and for what have you anything to show for it irina thought i have all these things from valeri too but i can never let mars know that i wont ever give up an ounce of my power over these men but i want to give mars something i know hes counting on me and i dont want to disappoint him i have to stop procrastinating i can give him valeri because after all its valeri mars is interested in valeri and his hunt for the nationalist dissidents of white star yet still she hesitated as she had during the weeks she had followed valeri and natasha she did not want to be sent back to her unutterably boring job her previous drab existence she knew she could never bear that now yet she lacked the courage to plunge all the way into her new exciting life mars was studying her carefully as i thought he said as if he were passing sentence on her i think you should return to your job at the ministry of education he shrugged clearly disappointed too bad under the circumstances it would have been extremely helpful if you had made some progress i have made an excellent beginning at finding the leaders of white star but now i need to move faster because there seems to be some sort of deadline now where white star is concerned what do you mean marss face in the warm lamplight was a patchwork of shadow i have learned there is a major counterstrike being mounted against the nationalist group by the kgb what kind of counterstrike i dont know mars said that sort of information is classified even for me and if i began to ask questions or pull in favors im afraid i would attract the wrong kind of attention if valeri bondasenko should hear what does bondasenko have to do with this kgb initiative irina asked mars said valeri denysovich is kgb you must be mad irina said she thought she was going to throw up kgb no it couldnt be everyone knows who valeri denysovich is his career is an open book deliberately so yes most deliberately so mars agreed but have you ever wondered why let me explain something to you two years ago the head of the kgb came out in the congress of peoples deputies as saying that his organization should follow the american i model and be regulated by the congress consequently the kgbs modus operandi has had to change now the kgb does indeed operate like its american counterpart on the surface it pays lip service to the constraints put upon it by political committees while clandestinely going about its business as usual its the same kgb that it always was irina it will take more than perestroika to change the kgb the only difference is that now its chief operatives work behind efficient smokescreens like valeri denysovich bondasenko irina shuddered my god it was her worst nightmare come true the icy winds of siberia the bars over the moon her country as one huge prison everything mars reached over leafed through the report he had been reading he came to the page he wanted showed it to her you neednt take my word for it and there it was typed across the page irina was holding an original document stamped with the red cyrillics of the politburo master files she had occasionally seen on some of the other documents mars had left lying around valeri denysovich bondasenko colonel second chief directorate komitet gosudarstvennoi bezopasnosti is hereby granted the authority to create and or redesign a department to be under his control this department here in after referred to as department n will consist of approximately people including administrative personnel the chief of department n shall report directly to the chief of the kgb the chief of department n shall have powers including but not limited to the selection of personnel from other departments within the second chief directorate access to all sections of the kgb master files including those limited distribution dossiers under the control of other directorates the ability to call upon the advice and services of personnel within all other directorates at his discretion he may commandeer any and all hardware he deems necessary from the border guards directorate irina could read no more the letters were blurring before her eyes shaking as if with the ague she heard again down the long corridors of her memory those horrific words kgb keep calm this is the charter mars said taking the paper from her hand for valeris counterintelligence initiative against white star he put it carefully back in the report fortunately valeris new department needs appropriations just like any other its covered in the congress of peoples deputies budget hearing under baltic reapproachment but through a stroke of luck i was able to get my hands on the real charter kgb keep calm irina rose suddenly walked unsteadily to the window she could not breathe she threw open the sash and the damp night air blew in she shivered in the cold then she felt mars behind her strong solid warm you see koshka the kgb has set a time bomb for white star i cant find a way to warn their leaders because i cant find them but the existence of this strike against them proves that valeri already knows where they are then he was turning her around cradling her he pushed her hair off her face youre trembling so he said whats the matter you couldnt possibly know irina said she took a deep breath she could hear again the tromp of the military jackboots the pounding on the front door awakening her in the middle of the night i remember she began the moon was obscured by cloudswhat an absurd thing to remember i can hear my mothers voice raised shrill with fright and peeking out of the doorway to my room i see a man in a black leather trench coat his face obscured by the wide brim of his hat kgb keep calm my mother is screaming as the uniformed men under trench coats command drag my father from his bedroom what do you want with him my mother cries hes done nothing kgb keep calm the uniformed men are beating my father as he begins to resist them this must be some kind of mistake my mother is shaking as she moans youre making a mistake kgb keep calm the rubber truncheons are lifting and falling lifting and falling and i cant ever forget the awful thick sound they make as they strike my father on his shoulders his back his upper arms his head he does not say a word but i can hear his involuntary grunts with each blow of the truncheons the uniformed men start to drag my father toward the door and my mother steps in front of them i see her eyes opened wide with panic they are filled with a kind of primitive terror i once saw in a rabbits glazed eyes as it was caught in the beam of my flashlight you cant take him my mother sobs i wont let you the man from the kgb reaches out and in an almost lazy arc slams the back of his hand into the side of my mothers face she staggers back one leg collapses under her and she crashes into a side table a lamp shatters and she screams i can still hear the rage and tenor in her voice tears stream down her face kgb keep calm the man in the black leather trench coat drags her out of the path of his men and they take my father away my mother offers no further resistance she does not even take a last look at my father as he is manhandled down the stairs of the apartment building her eyes are blank the man from the kgb is about to leave but at that moment his head turns he had heard something me he moves slowly through the small apartment until he finds my room i hear him coming in coming closer i am curled up in bed hugging my pillow he is across the room in one long stride he pulls the covers back exposing me irina he says little irina i cant understand how he knows my name i am so terrified i dont know what to do or think his black leather trench coat is billowing around him like the wings of a gigantic bat i can feel my heart beating painfully like a triphammer his white hand closes over my ankle so that i am stretched out across the bed how old are you little irina he whispers the wide brim of his hat hides his face completely so that he seems to be a part of the shadows of the room a shadow that holds me fast eight i hardly know how i squeezed that one word out his hand moves up to my thigh he touches me there between my legs take care of your mother little irina she needs you whatwhat did you do with my daddy i asked him forget your father the man from the kgb says straightening up hes dead irina had recited this horrific tale in a dispassionate detached voice but as soon as she uttered the words hes dead she broke down sobbing hysterically into marss chest he held her gently swinging her back and forth as a mother will comfort a child with night terrors until at last her sobbing subsided irina he said gently tell me did the man from the kgb force himself on you you mean sexually despite her best efforts her voice cracked yes she shook her head no after a moments pause she said but in a way what he did was just as bad it made my flesh crawl and when years later my first lover touched me there for the first time i screamed just as if he had thrust a knife into me my god mars said what a nightmare mars was right she thought though the nightmare was continuing in the present in a way he could not imagine her first instinct was to break off with valeri then almost immediately she saw why she absolutely must not break with him in the first place she saw quite clearly that she must not give valeri any reason to suspect that she had been spying on him or that she knew what he really was if she broke off with him now with no good reason he would undoubtedly become suspicious she knew well that paranoia was the kgbs middle name in the second place she thought valeri is evil just as the man in the black leather trench coat was evil theyre one and the same and if i run from valeri ill just be giving them another victory over me i dont want that i d like nothing better than to give them back a measure of the pain they gave my father and mother id like to finally free myself from this nightmare she came to her decision ill give valeri to mars of course that means implicating natasha but perhaps that wont be so bad what could natasha mean to mars if i give him valeri thats all hell focus on i may have found a way to track white star she said abruptly it concerns valeri bondasenko what mars frowned is this how you have been spending your time koshka his frown deepened i know i told you that valeri denysovich is also looking for white star but you see he is dangerous too dangerous for she said theres a woman valeri bondasenko secretly sees during the day aha this clearly interested mars a chink in the iron mans armor irina said he obviously cares for this woman so there is an obvious weakness there i believe i can exploit if i can find what valeri denysovich and this woman are up to i think i can use it against him get the information you want in return for my silence mars looked dubious i know what i m doing irina said and i m doing it well no irina i cant let you continue your surveillance of him especially now that i know your background you think i havent the nerve but youre wrong irina said i see now this is something i have to do i have to face my fear of the kgb in order to overcome it if you think me weak mars no i dont think that he smiled otherwise i never would have allowed you to follow your instincts in trying to find white star he nodded so be it koshka well done the sudden look of admiration on his face flushed her with warmth my little dove he said using the common russian slang for a female spy he embraced her kissing her on both cheeks as she had seen red army generals do when they greeted one another within the precincts of the kremlin valeri said i hope youre not falling in love with mars what an extraordinary thing to say is it he eyed her he took you home to meet his parents irina was startled are you having me watched only when youre with mars valeri said and only to make sure nothing happens to you what could happen to me valeri turned down the stove burner how much more bearlike he seemed to her now almost like a titan the implied strength in his massive shoulders chest and upper arms so much more intimidating because he had the infinite power of the kgb behind him when it comes to women valeri said mars can be dangerous mars can be dangerous irina thought holy mother how he can twist the truth she was sitting in the kitchen of valeris apartment watching him prepare breakfast he said do you know even i couldnt get peppers or zucchini at the street stand yesterday i had to settle for cucumbers and they looked none too fresh to me he poured the contents of a frying pan onto a platter the toshiba computer was on and he regularly consulted its screen while he was cooking how do you find time to get all those recipes in memory she asked because she was uncomfortable now talking with him about mars i get some help valeri laughed theres a ghost in the machine of course irina had a great deal of expertise with computers that was one of the reasons she had been sent to boston now she was in charge of the new computer system at the ministry of education it was rudimentary by american standards but still it made life so much easier valeri said i hope youre going to eat better than you slept indeed for the first time since she stayed with him she had not slept well in the middle of the night valeri had reached over put his arm around her irina had gone rigid how could she possibly make love with him now and yet when he turned toward her and she felt his heat against her his central core of hardness like a bar of iron pressed against her tower belly she melted it was as if she were two women one who was now terrified by valeri the other who had found something deep inside him something not only tremendously exciting but also in a way she could not fathom redeeming valeri was so gentle so tender as his lips covered her body moving from the hollow of her neck to her breasts her stomach by the time he reached her thighs she was trembling in anticipation her mind was on fire no she realized later not her mind for she had put her rational mind on hold locking away for the moment her terror and her shame while her heart seemed to merge with her sex at that precise moment valeris tongue found her open and wet she moaned reached back holding onto the brass bars of the bedstead while her head whipped from side to side when she felt on the verge of exploding she reached down ran her fingers through his thick hair to pull him up mindlessly she guided him into her arching up hard against his groin so that not one millimeter of him was left outside she was wild wanton so abandoned that she could not remember later what she had said or how long it had lasted it had seemed like forever an endless moment ripped from the cloth of time when the both of them hung on the brink of ecstasy their muscles tight and jumping at the end valeris lips sought hers kissing her as the delicious aching febrile end came as she groaned into his open mouth tasting him as she cried out their twined bodies spasming on and on and on and in the long silence afterward with valeri still inside her with her licking the aromatic salt from his shoulder she could not help but think of mars beautiful handsome mars and wonder why sex with him was so uninvolving so disappointing she had fallen asleep on top of valeri his hulking body her bed and when she awoke at dawn when her rational mind was again in control she wept silent bitter tears at the weakness of her flesh now as valeri set their breakfast on the table irina found that she had no appetite valeri watched her toy with her food said i want you to break off your relationship with mars irina felt her heart skip a beat i cant do that she said you not only can you will valeri tore off a chunk of black bread took a bite of it thats an order irina looked up at him why are you doing this i made a mistake valeri said its as simple as that dont lie to me he raked some of the sauteed cucumber onto his bread dipped it into a pool of pale yellow yogurt irina said whatever your motives are for wanting me to stop seeing mars volkov theyre far from simple i dont know whats going on in your mindi never dobut its sure to be convoluted i dont want you getting involved isnt that simple enough for you nothing convoluted there you sent me off to mars to get involved i did no such thing his outburst was so vehement that irina jumped dont you understand anything he said in a more normal tone of voice i wanted him involved with you not the other way around now i think ive made a fundamental error in sending you into the lions lair i think irina that the lions had you for supper youre judging me unfairly you think im weak a pushover for whomever mars petrovich isnt just anybody valeri thundered irina could not bring herself to look into his face she felt disoriented by this conversation valeri her protector no no he was kgb he was lying always tying she steeled herself i can take care of myself she said perhaps from your point of view he said not from mine but my point of view must have some validity she cried you cant think of me as just a method to unlock marss secrets of course i dont he finished off his bread and cucumbers wiped his fingers thats why i want you away from his influence its clear to me that you havent the willpower to resist his moviestar charisma thats a typically male thing to say women dont fall in love with men just because theyre handsome charisma valeri said is more than skin deep he grunted take it from me its my business to know such things well whatever you may think im not in love with mars volkov then what have you been doing with him fucking his brains out and thats all irina stood up why you she was trembling with rage but could not find the words to hurl back in his face sit down irina valeri said in a softer tone of voice i havent called you a whore no but i imagine thats next valeri watched her it seems to me that you enjoy it when we make love irina sat back down i do she said it sickened her to think that it was the truth irina i dont want to fight with you what is it you want then cant you see that im trying to protect you protect me if she were not so afraid of him she would have laughed in his face from what mars volkov is the enemy he wants to destroy me i think perhaps youve forgotten that i have forgotten nothing she said angry despite herself irina whats happened to you nothing im just with a chill that froze her soul she realized how dangerous valeri could be and knew she was taking the wrong tack with him im tired thats all the strain of keeping up pretenses of lying to mars of having to remember through layers of identities has frayed my nerves sometimes im not sure who i am anymore valeri nodded you see your own mind is telling you that you werent cut out to be a spy and thats all the more reason for you to break it off with him now do you understand me irina i see that i gave you more than you can handle and im sincerely sorry for that now i want you to forget all about mars volkov ill think of another way to get to him im not about to sacrifice you nothings that important not even volkov now irina had no choice but to look at him she could barely think straight what are you saying valeri pushed his plate away you must know how i feel about you havent i made it perfectly clear every time we make love valeri i i care for you irina his hand enfolded hers i made a terrible mistake in trying to use you against mars petrovich my overwhelming desire to destroy him put you in grave danger and im ashamed of myself for doing that thats why i must take you out of harms way nowimmediatelybefore youre in too deep for me to get you out his voice was so soft go gentle that irina felt her disorientation return she felt her original desire for him rising and with it her own power waning again she had to remind herself of what valeri really was behind this compelling seductive mask the specter of the papers mars had shown her revealing valeris true identity rose up towering over everything and irina shuddered inside clamping down on all feeling concentrating on what she must do to help mars destroy valeri i have not told mars natashas name irina said to herself so i have not betrayed her she was standing on a corner later that day concealed within the shadows of an ornate doorway she was watching valeri and natasha mayakova talking in the lobby of the old moscow arts theater she no longer felt the intense jealousy she once had at their clandestine meetings but then she no longer felt the same way about valeri bondasenko now he revolted her or did he then how is it she asked herself that you adore him when he makes love to you irina had tried all morning to answer that question there seemed an essential paradox in all her relations that she was not understanding or seeing it nagged at her she felt as if her thoughts were spinning around in circles she understood dimly that she no longer seemed capable of distinguishing right from wrong good from evil it was wrong to continue sleeping with valeri knowing what she knew about him she had told herself that she did not want to go back to him and she had meant it yet the moment she did go back to him the moment he put his arms around her her insides turned to water and the sexual hunger inside took over did that make her evil as well even her devotions at the church of the archangel gabriel were no longer of any solace in an intense spasm of guilt irina imagined valeri in a black leather trench coat and thought you are doing a firstrate job of scaring yourself but she was also frightened for natasha did she know what kind of man valeri was did she know that she was kissing a colonel in the kgb when she met with him once a week in the afternoon the last time they had met irina had followed valeri when he had left her but he had merely returned to his office staying there the rest of the day except for when he appeared at the congress of peoples deputies irina watched valeri now saying goodbye to natasha i care for you irina i made a terrible mistake in trying to use you against mars petrovich he had said more lies if she were going to be truthful with herself irina had to admit that she could not read valeri at all how did he really feel about her why had he seduced her what was it he wanted from her did he care about her but no that was impossible she concentrated more deeply she wanted to think like a spy to prove him wrong when he had told her she wasnt cut out to be a spy so she worked at getting inside his head he seemed to be a bundle of contradictions if he had picked her up in order to use her against mars then why had he suddenly ordered her away from mars had something changed was she missing a step in the equation she could not say she only knew one thing she did want a measure of revenge on the kgb for what they had done to her father to her entire family irina had never before dreamed she would be in a position to exact revenge but her relationship with mars had changed all that she saw clearly how she could use his power to destroy valeri some kind of evil animal was whimpering inside her recreating the scents the emotions of sex how can you think of destroying all this the evil animal said are you mad irina blinked how long had she been standing here she took a step out of the shadows then immediately retreated across the street natasha was emerging from the old moscow arts theater she glanced at her watch now thats interesting she thought rehearsals arent half over with yet where can she be going irina set off after natasha watching as she headed up gorky street through the crowds at the last instant natasha ducked into druzhba the freedom bookstore irina waited a moment then followed her inside the bookstore was crowded with tourists but irina did not see natasha she went quickly through the store and out the back caught a glimpse of natasha turning a corner irina hurried after her and found herself more or less back at the old moscow arts theater there she saw natasha getting into a black zil which pulled immediately out into the street irina turned away as the car passed then ran to the anonymouslooking blue volga that mars had procured for her from god only knew what government stockpile while it had been parked someone had stolen the windshield wipers which were in short supply and consequently in great demand by moscow motorists she cursed herself for forgetting to take them with her irina followed the zil through the city then out of it forty minutes later they were entering the environs of zvezdny gorodok star town when mars saw the blue volga he had loaned to irina parked across from the heros compound he ordered the driver of his chaika to pull over fifty yards away he sat in the darkened interior and watched the volga with the kind of suspicion one reserves for the broken lock on ones apartment door across from where the volga sat a shiny black zil was parked in front of the entrance to the heros building as mars watched natasha mayakova came down the steps ducked into the backseat of the zil and it began to turn around mars got out of the chaika and as the zil drove away he came up to the volga he pulled open the door stared down into irinas face white with fear and said what the hell are you doing here mars irina put a hand to her throat you scared me half to death he smiled im sorry koshka but you gave me quite a turn when i saw you here in the volga are you interested in cosmonauts now irina stepped out of the car why is it she said that there are no peppers or zucchini to be had in all of moscow but there is always plenty of money for cosmonauts and rockets to the moon he frowned to mars he corrected weve already been to the moon he shrugged the system has been around for over seventy years and it isnt yet perfected but were getting there rockets or food is that it irina said there was a silence for some time when she saw that he wasnt going to answer her sardonic question she decided shed better switch topics actually im working she said marss frown deepened working how so ive been following that zil all the way from moscow natasha mayakovas car what on earth for you know her certainly mars said i know everyone who goes into that building isnt that where the hero lives and when he nodded she added how does natasha know him the more pertinent question mars said is why you are following natasha mayakova all around russia then he snapped his fingers she isnt the woman valeri has been seeing irina nodded good night mars said now theres an intriguing thought are you going to see the irina asked id love to meet him im afraid thats out of the mars hesitated he looked at irina but why not he thought what more perfect way to assuage the heros burning animosity than to let him talk with irina she was ingenuous enough to appeal to him more than intelligent enough to keep him engaged and since she was his friend she might in some way offset the damaging effects the limited distribution report on the odingalaktika ii cosmic ray experiments had had on the interrogation the bond of trust that had been forming between himself and the hero no matter how tenuous had been ruptured mars decided that irina being here at this moment was just the stroke of good fortune he needed though he did not altogether believe in omens this seemed to be as close to one as he was likely to encounter all right he said taking her by the elbow if thats what youd like im sure it can be arranged irina heard the lapping of the pool first then the siren call of the dolphin my god she exclaimed what a magnificent creature she went to the edge of the pool knelt down held her hand out to touch the dolphins bottle nose whats your name handsome irina said then gave a tiny startled scream as the heros head burst up through the water her names arbat odysseus said laughing at the expression on irinas face whats yours irina forgot all about the dolphin she stared wideeyed at the hero at his chiseled features the pale almost phosphorescent skin the wideapart eyes and what eyes pilled with allcolor nocolor she saw and didnt see in their depths colors she never suspected existed his eyes were absolutely translucent like scrims across the front of a stage at once revealing and concealing what lay behind them irina was utterly captivated she could not take her eyes off him as if she could devour him absorb into herself the timeless wavelength that she felt emanating from him the long lashes of his eyes were the only hair on his face there was not even the shadow of a beard on his cheeks or lips but rather than making him seem effeminate the smoothness somehow increased his aura of sensuality it was almost irina told herself as if she were face to face with a merman some mythical being half human half dolphin there was a playfulness about him that seemed similar to arbats but irina could sense a darkness that the chattering mammal did not possess and it was this darkness at noon this anomaly this black hole in his human horizon that drew her inexorably until he was the only thing of which she was aware she heard natasha saying one day you will meet your albee and he will change your life utterly the answer for you is to seize your moment you must say to yourself damn the risks and plow straight ahead irina my name is irina someone with her voice whispered over the water welcome irina the hero said pulling her into the pool with him so that irina felt surrounded by the sun the moon the stars a universe of strange music was washing over her making her vibrate with an unknown excitement from the inside out call me odysseus honno staring out over the vast grid of tokyo thought how much the city resembled a pachinko board sunlight coruscated across the tops of the massive forest of high rises steel and mirrored glass behemoths leaving their middle floors in the pale filtered light of an undersea world their lower floors in deepest shadow she thought i have only to open my hand flick the ball of my wamy intrinsic energyoutward set it careening through the gutters and trenches i see down there just like pachinko how far she had come how distant her other life seemed to her now a set of fading photographs illlit slightly out of focus best packed away in some duststrewn attic forgotten another persons life surely mrs kansei who is mrs kansei honno thought as she watched a sp silver in the brilliant sunshine begin its descent into narita airport miles away i want another name honno said abruptly turning away from the glittering enthralling grid of tokyo isnt there something of a custom for yakuza to take a new name big ezoe nodded sometimes yes he was watching honno carefully trying to absorb the changes firing through her each moment she seemed to alter flickering like a series of dynamos being switched on one after another illuminating the darkness of the night koi honno said at length i like koi the name she had chosen had many meanings besides the magnificent species of japanese carp it meant variously dark strong the power of the imperial throne even as a verb to change ones clothes all these meanings seemed in some fashion to fit this new honno koi big ezoe said from his seat behind the massive black rosewood desk a kind of freeform sculpture which americans would recognize and cherish as retro your samurai friend kakuei sakata had good reason to commit ritual suicide he shuffled the papers he had taken from the apartment of asaku hitasura giins protege these are the complete translations of the ledgers sakata kept he was a meticulous man everything is here details of corruption bribes extortion ministerial appointments for private profit and professional gain this is a veritable catalogue of sins greed lust envy gluttony pride you name it its certain to be here and the trail goes from the industrialist kunio michitayour former boss and sakatasall the way to the ministry of international trade and industry and what do you know the one link between them all the gobetween was not your friend sakatathough he served that purpose as a facadebut my old enemy hitasura hitasura koi said running her fingers over kakuei sakatas ledgers which she had liberated isnt that the last name of the man i killed last night for a moment big ezoe said nothing he was astounded by the matteroffact tone in her voice had she felt nothing at all when she had crushed asaku hitasuras windpipe well good fukuda had done her job well then but big ezoes finely tuned sense of wa sent off a distant alarm this woman is an addict he thought she devours power in the same way others consume food she cannot help herself she needs it now simply in order to exist for one such as she there can be no such thing as honor or giri she is bound on the wheel of her addiction as surely as a heretic was bound to the rack i pity anyone who is foolish enough to get in her way asaku was the oyabun hitasuras younger brother big ezoe said hitasuras people are already becoming meddlesome combing the city for a clue to the identity of asakus murderer let them look honno said no one knows what happened except you me and fukuda ill say one thing about asaku big ezoe said he was a genius at cryptography he was arrogant koi said he dismissed me because i was a woman he laughed in my face that was because he was so angry at how easily you got into his apartment you scared the shit out of him thats not all i did to him koi said big ezoe thought of the moment when honno or koi as she now wanted to be called crushed asaku hitasuras windpipe he had seen in her face the image of a mask in a bunraku puppet play it was the mask of a godthough which god big ezoe could not now recalland it had been cleverly painted with features that managed to exhibit both ecstasy and despair he had marveled at that mask how he had wanted to meet the artisan who had so masterfully created it and yet big ezoe had never inquired afraid that the man would turn out to be mundane altogether dull not at all what he had pictured in his imagination then last night he had magically found that expression reproduced on the face of a human being how absolutely extraordinary big ezoe who loved and admired rarities had decided that koi was the rarest of the rare he had sought to transform her to make heras he had fukudainto an extension of his psyche fukuda had come to him essentially as koi had emotionally maimed peopleespecially women big ezoe had discoveredwere peculiarly vulnerable when they were bloodied blood meant wounds that had not been able to heal a flaw in the psyche until last night when he had seen the godlike expression on kois killing face he had considered fukuda to be his crowning achievement it was then that big ezoe began to suspect that koi would far outstrip his first model and later when he had taken koi back to the apartment he had given her he had watched her while she took her cleansing bath he had rolled up his sleeves had covered her with soap then sponged her down spraying her with cool water watching the suds spiral down the drain uncovering in sections her hard unblemished body big ezoe had caught himself eyeing her enviously after hosing down the tub to get rid of the residues of dirt and soap koi had filled it with steaming hot water lay back to soak and spoke the first words since her second act of murder she said i was taught that women enter this world already bearing a guilt we can never fully rid ourselves of we are unclean our bodies regularly run with blood proof of the evil passions we cannot control she stared at big ezoe how much more fully this applies to me a hinoeuma woman born in the year of the husband killers big ezoe had said nothing he was content now to watch and to listen as he had done the night of the bunraku play as if he were again one of many sitting in the darkness of the huge theater koi had raised her arms bringing her hands out of the water her clear skin was steaming gleaming in the bathroom lights center stage water dripped from her fingertips and for the first time big ezoe noticed that her nails were lacquered the color of blood but now koi had said now i know i have the power to exercise my evil passions as i see fit i can exploit them as i did tonight or i can make them lie quiescently by my side like a slumbering lover she put her head back her eyes closed as she slipped lower into the water so that to big ezoe her body already seemed insubstantial its outline wavering the choice is mine and today she had chosen her new name koi like stepping out of old clothes into new darkness depth power no one knows koi said again now big ezoe came around from behind the desk stood with her as she surveyed the city the sky had already clouded up pollutants turned the pristine morning blue sky to a sickly yellowgray fujiyama the great mountain that symbolized japan was swallowed whole in manmade mist but hitasura will suspect my involvement big ezoe was acutely aware of koi as he stood beside her aware of the enormous power of her wa and he felt as gratified as an artist with his masterpiece it is only inevitable sooner or later he will come and when he does he will not be alone so let him come that extraordinary expression was reforming on her face the confluence of ecstasy and despair that had about it now an air of expectancy the air around koi seemed to alter as it does just before the onset of a storm i will welcome hitasura with open arms with an enormous sense of satisfaction big ezoe could see what happened he had made of koi a warrior whose scars he had annealed by his own form of cauterization until unlike fukuda koi had absolutely no room for the soft emotions of pity sympathy or compassion and big ezoe giving a tiny shudder thought with enormous satisfaction yes you bastard hitasura come i have a surprise for you i want you to meet my darting creation my hard machine nine tokyo tori was once again studying the photograph of ariel solares as he stood smiling into the camera lens in the tiny park near his house in san francisco she kept studying the people in the backgroundthe man and farther away the coupleas if in their faces she could discover what it was about the photo that ariel had found so significant but she could not make them out she turned the photo over saw the date it was taken digitally printed on the back march of this year was the date important not according to the eyes only dossier on me manufacture and distribution of the japanese supercocaine she had been shown at mall central russell and bernard godwin had been desperate to bring tori back into the mall because ariel had determined that the japanese had created this lethal new form of cocaine and were beginning to disseminate it bernard wanted her to find out why but tori saw now that this was not the only question she needed to find an answer to the new coke was in some way bound up with the hafnium pipeline when the coke left the factory in the llano negro of colombia so did the hafnium but what happened to the soft cell when it reached japan and who was manufacturing it from dekes tests of the residue on the hafnium pellet russell had taken from the llano negro factory it was clear the coke being refined there was clean if estilo was telling the truth about hitasura being the buyer of his soft cell then ariels intelligence was correct the killer coke was being manufactured here in japan and hitasura would know where and why tori closed her eyes went into prana deepening and strengthening her breathing slowing her pulse she had to admit to herself that because her trust in estilo had been shaken her big fear was discovering that hitasura was involved in what the mall had termed ice cream the supercoke if that turned out to be so another important link from her past her network would have proved unreliable she knew that russell must be impatient for her to begin interrogating hitasura on the subject but the crisis of hitasuras imminent war with big ezoeand the reemergence of fukudawas providing tori an excuse for procrastination part of her wanted more than anything to steal a moment to take hitasura aside to get it over with and find out the truth but it was not only her fear that made it impossible this was japan and the iron dictates of custom made such a direct western approach unthinkable tori knew that she would have to find just the right moment just the right way to approach hitasura russell came up to her while hitasura was receiving lastminute information on the mobile phone isnt it about time you told me the origins of your blood feud with this female assassin fukuda she tried to kill me once tori said but russell only stared at her its only fair i tell him everything she thought do you remember what i was doing for you when i got hurt russell nodded sure you had picked up the improbable rumor of a joint japaneserussian venture hidden from even the ubiquitous japanese bureaucracy to be frank i thought it was a waste of your time and the malls money to keep you on it but bernard insisted you know how fanatical he is about the subject of the soviets even more so now if thats possible he looked at her out of his penetrating blue eyes i wish i had held my ground on that one youd still have both your hips tori studied him for a moment as if she could not make up her mind about him thats kind of you to say but the fact is i wouldnt be able to do physically what i can do now without the aid of the japanesedesigned prosthesis so you see in a way you did me a favor she gave him a tentative smile as if she were afraid to allow himand herselfto see what she was really feeling anyway it seemed there was something to the rumor of the japaneserussian venture she said though i ran into fukuda before i got in deep enough to find out what exactly was happening how did you happen to meet her there was a man tori said he was no more than a boy really just twenty but there was something about him both personally and professionally i had heard of him through deke who said he was tsukuruhito a maker in street slang that means a gogetter someone who is admired who has great hara great inner strength which the japanese prize above everything else was this young man yakuza now that was the most interesting part tori said he wasnt and yet it seemed because he was tsukuruhito many yakuza sought his advice in complicated affairs of business i suppose in ways to circumvent international law because the tsukuruhito was an international lawyer he called himself yen yasuwara though it seemed to me he had taken that first name as a kind of joke yen was like that sardonic always laughing at the world through which he moved with such ease though always in a dark way he despised convention an odd bias for a japanese and he hated burying his true nature beneath the countless layers that convention required him to form in order to survive in japanese society but yens goal wasnt to survive it was to succeed to blaze like a shooting star across the firmament of the japanese business community i use those words because of their poetic nature yen used them and its essential you get a complete picture of him yen once confided in me that his dream was to put together an international deal of such proportions that it would stand all japan on its ear like maybe a japaneserussian deal tori nodded thats why i went to see him what this country needs is a swift kick in the ass he told me after i got to know him well and im certain he meant it just how well did you get to know him russell asked dont get ahead of the story tori told him yen worked at budoko associates an exclusive tokyo law firm it isnt large but its prestige is firstrate yen came from the right familyhis father and budokos senior partners were born in the same honshu village he went to the right schools and got the right grades in short until the moment he was hired by budoko yen was the very paradigm of japanese convention then he told me when i got where i wanted to go i started the process of fomentation fomentation russell said what the hell did he mean by that i to not certain tori said but making an educated guess id say that yen wanted to in some way undermine the modern system of japanese society like the author yukio mishima who committed ritual suicide to protest what he saw as the softening of the powerful japanese martial culture yen saw the problems hidden within the astounding economic successes of modernday japan i think he saw the japan of today as complacent i think he was sickened by the sight of his countrymen running all over the world buying out tiffanys freds cartiers ungaros you name it gathering up real estate building resortsminitokyosall over hawaii unwrapping their endless rolls of money to snap up anything that caught their fancy the japanese yen said to me are the technologyrich ugly americans of the fifties the oilrich arabs of the seventies now we are no better than the rednecks of any culture progress has made a shambles of us christ just what was this philosopher turned international lawyer up to russell said now youre beginning to see the attraction tori said but there was another side of yen that you wouldnt be able to see he was enormously charismatic in a physical sense i didnt count on that when i first approached him i did it in the prescribed method i manufactured a seemingly accidental meeting while he was away for the weekend in kyoto i did my homework and contrived to bump into him on the bullet train he was exceptionally charming he had this way of engaging you in conversation that was actually a twoway street he thrived on dialogue not as is true with so many people in telling you what he thought he was on his way he told me to the kokedera the famous moss temple whose magnificent garden is composed of forty varieties of moss unless youve been there you cannot imagine the peacefulness of that place the mist dusting the pellucid lake the sunlight filtered through the tall cryptomeria and black pines spreading a light like fairy dust over the lowmounded emerald moss its a heavenly spot and a holy one as well when youre at kokedera its impossible to imagine time moving its as if the temples reality is so powerful it defeats even times march i dont expect im describing this adequately tori said but i suspect that the effect of that singular place had something to do with how quickly i was drawn into yens universe understand there was nothing boyish about him save his looks and even then the lack of lines in his face only served to keep at bay the hardness that sooner or later life inflicts on most countenances at that moment in that spot yen seemed perfect just as the moss garden was perfect almost as if he were an extension of the spirit that pervaded the place he was irresistible tori oh russ dont tell me its never happened to you havent you ever found a woman irresistible not while i was on the job tori automatically thought of ariel and the legacy he had left to her safekeeping you mean pushing the papers around your desk im hardly surprised thank you very much sorry she said you dont deserve that but the old russell slade the one i used to know was so judgmentaland thought himself so perfect god no never perfect but thats just the mask youd put on did i russell was surprised it seems youre describing another russell slade tori looked at him in a way thats true it seems to me he died somewhere in machinegun city in the red dust yes tori looked at him i never told you how you surprised me that afternoon at cruzs apartment when you took the lead and won him over by being the famous mole hunter russell laughed and tori joined him for the first time realizing that she was enjoying his company and then in the jungle and in the corrida i thought youd fall apartthats why i coerced bernard into ordering you to come into the field with me i was sure i could humiliate you his blue eyes had turned dark just as i humiliated you when i severed you from the mall for my own selfish reasons it almost seems as if bernard deliberately set us against one another and she was suddenly aware again of estilos story of how he had set the german twins against one another destroying their intimate bond but this was so different of course bernard hadnt meant her or russell any harm yet it was odd how the story seemed to remain in her mind russell seemed to think about what she had said for some time he was about to say something abruptly changed his mind its funny the curves life throws you he remarked no matter how organized how ready you are youre never prepared for what happens yes tori said thats what happened to me with yen she waited for him to make a comment but he was silent we had a glorious afternoon she went on and then we parted company but not forgetting why i had made contact i doubled back and followed him it was twilight near the dinner hour at that time of the year and i followed yen into a restaurant in kyoto someone was waiting for him dont tell me it was fukuda yes she and yen were having an affair dear god youre not wide of the mark tori said once i determined the nature of their relationship and that yens real purpose in coming to kyoto was to meet his girlfriend i backed off but i got some background on fukuda and i began to worry the more i found out about her the worse the situation seemed to be i already knew enough about yen that i realized i couldnt let him go if there was a japaneserussian connection surely it was flowing through him but how was i going to avoid fukuda back in tokyo i contrived another ploy i approached yen again this time as a client remember those dummy corporation papers i asked you for yeah russell said they put our myths department in a snit they worked straight through the july fourth holiday for you i tried to keep our relationship strictly business tori said but yen wouldnt let me he even admitted to seeing fukuda he said it didnt matter he wanted me and no one was going to stop him sensitive guy the odd thing was he was sensitive ton said just selectively so he was like a searchlight whatever was illuminated by his attention was so well taken care of but as soon as the beam moved on the subject was left alone in the dark like fukuda tori nodded yen said the affair was winding down at least as far as he was concerned it was fun he admitted getting off on the danger until it got too intense perhaps that was his way of giving me a warning for what i might conceive of as our future together in other words there wasnt to be any russell said not necessarily i think he was saying there was going to be a future only if he wanted it nice but isnt that typical of men tori dont start most women have minds of their own too yes but its whats been drummed into those minds that troubles me she shrugged anyway as far as yen was concerned he wanted us to start where we left off that afternoon in the kokedera i did my best to dissuade him ill bet all right part of me wanted to be with him ive never aspired to sainthood what possible good would it do me im only human from this confession can i assume that you allowed the affair to continue tori was silent for some time in a matter of speaking she said after a while youre going to have to do better than that russell said but there was no edge to his voice for which tori was grateful the affair continued she said only under my conditions which were that we not be seen in public together and that i never under any circumstances come to his house and it worked for a while i continued to mind the business aspect hoping at some point to hint to him my interest as an investor in unconventional multinational deals i never got the chance to make my pitch a territorial war erupted between hitasura and big ezoe fukuda was recalled from kyoto where she had been managing a large complicated arms deal for big ezoe and that was that within twentyfour hours of fukuda setting foot in tokyo she knew yen was seeing someone else within fortyeight hours she had discovered that that someone was me efficient bitch russell said you dont know the half of it tori said she methodically tracked me down she had more contacts than i had and a great deal more obsessiveness in the end it was deke who warned me but by then it was too late fukuda was locked on to me and i couldnt shake her what happened russells expression showed that he was plainly fascinated by this dance of death tori described the confrontation in the tunnels below tokyo when the explosive she threw tore open my hip fukuda knew i was helpless then she heard the train coming and she left me on the tracks to die stupid of her yes hitasura got to me before the train did thats too bad for fukuda russell said tori couldnt help laughing at his bravado even though she knew that where fukuda was concerned nothing was amusing then he said damnit you should have told me all this at your original debriefing you wouldnt have listened tori said at that point in time you werent interested in my views about anything that judgment wasnt for you to make its the truth you were under discipline russell said the truth has absolutely nothing to do with it he was right of course but tori was damned if she was going to give him the satisfaction of eliciting an apology from her hitasura is coming big ezoe said in fukudas ear i can see the vehicle now she said into the pinpoint mike wrapped around her head where are you at the kinjito fukuda said it was amazing she thought what the new fiber optics could do big ezoe sounded as if he were inside her head instead of some miles away good the voice in her head said everything is ready you are the guide yes fukuda said she could see the moving van coming her way and she stepped inside the glassdoored entrance to the kinjito that is what you trained me to be hitasura has an ally from your tone of voice fukuda said im sure its someone i know tori nunn there was an exhalation from fukuda soft but with an instant sense of forewarning in that event she said dont bring koi in too quickly i want my chance last chance big ezoe said not mine toris hitasura said were here wheres here russell asked the moving van had pulled over to the curb and hitasura was ushering them out of the mobile living room he pointed upward as they climbed off the rear of the van they were parked in front of a massive postmodern structure that soared upward in pyramid fashion an artistic chunk of twisted chromium steel orangerusted iron all dominated by enormous greentinted windows at this time of the night the building acted like a mirror reflecting the spectroscopic patterns of the citys skyscrapers neon lights the movement of its traffic in odd skewed angles this is the kambata museum hitasura said but for obvious reasons everyone calls it the kinjito the pyramid he began walking toward it its new since you were last here tori it houses quite an amazing array of martial arts antiquities he glanced at the entrance its monday the museums closed to the public this is where fukuda was last seen russell asked its where she is hitasura said then shes here for a reason tori said hitasura nodded youre the expert on fukuda do you think theres any chance shes been tipped off that were after her russell asked tori looked at hitasura who shrugged in the end it doesnt matter she said moving up the granite and steel front steps weve got to go in and get her but russell right behind her caught her shoulder spun her around youre wrong tori he said it matters a great deal if she knows were coming theres a good chance shes prepared for us knowing that should change our strategy okay tori said how should it change id like to get more people here for one thing tori shook her head weve got to make as little noise as possible the more of hitasuras people we call in the better chance we have of bringing the tokyo metropolitan police down on us russell thought about this for a moment as his eyes searched hers at last he said so that only tori could hear him i dont like being involved in vendettas theyre invariably unhealthy from any point of view tori gave him a brief nod i understand then for just a moment her expression softened and she said russ did you ever have an itch you couldnt get to tell me what would you do if you suddenly got a chance to scratch an itch like that russells hand fell away from her shoulder well he said at least youll have me to look after you tori grinned at him and the three of them went up the steps the front doors were closed but unlocked russell looked briefly at the lock to see if it had been jimmied open there was no damage that he could see had fukuda picked the lock or did she somehow have a key clandestinely russell checked his armaments caliber colt lightweight titaniumhandled boot knife garroting wire with wooden handles everything checked but somehow he did not feel all that much better this fukuda sounded more like a ghost than any woman he had ever met he could feel the fear emanating from both hitasura and tori and it worried him tori leading them slowly into the interior of the kinjito was thinking of sun tzu if you cannot choose the ground for war he had written make certain you choose the time tori wondered whether she would have that option not she knew if fukuda had anything to say about it they were moving through the vast hall that made up the centerpiece of the museums main space enormous slabs of greentinted glass hung suspended three stories over their heads their intervals and angles brought to mind a futuristic version of the assembly of war banners arrayed in the great rooms of medieval castles on either side of the central aisle down which they made their way the hall was filled with exquisite examples of armor from as far back as the tenth century all the way to the early nineteenth century tori hitasura and russell moved through this thrilling yet somber reminder of japans past a unique entity in which the lines of history and myth were often blurred and more exchanged places tori paused she could hear what at first sounded like the rough soughing of a storm wind through pine boughs then as she listened more closely as the sound built guttural throaty it became the noise of the stalking lion a great predatory beast about to open wide its jaws as it came upon the exposed flank of its prey what in gods name is that russell said the short hairs at the back of his neck had begun to stir shes here somewhere hitasura whispered yoibuki tori said to russell in karate there are two forms of breathing yoibuki is the hard aggressive style used in attacks i never learned that in the virginia courses russell said naturally tori did not take her eyes off the interior of the hall stretching away from them isnt that why youre out here in the field green light saturated the hall in degrees thick swathes deeper or lighter depending on whether at any given place the glass slabs overlapped one another the effect was spectral in some ways sinister as the thick unnatural illumination highlighted cuirasses of iron here or there an ancient ornate kawara corselet of layered leather scales cured to the hardness of metal these magnificent suits of armor were pieced together with intricate laces of differing patterns and colors whose styles over time had been the way samurai differentiated between clans and rank within an army now tori could see in the dimness ahead of them the hiodoshi suit of armor of the empress jingo known as red lacing because of the dark crimson laces used to tie the pieces together as she watched she saw the headpiece move the mask below the high horned helmetdark the old leather stained with the blood of enemiesturned in their direction at the same time the empress jingos suit of armor came down off its pedestal the sound of the yoibuki filled the hall echoing through the centuries of battle attire beside tori russell was already in his semicrouch tori saw the colt in his hand yelled no but he either didnt understand or didnt care russell had his own ideas of protecting her from being embroiled further in her blood feud with fukuda he pulled the trigger tori had an instants glimmer of the suit of armor being thrown backward by the impact of the bullet before the hall was lit up in a blinding glare the percussion hurled them off their feet tori felt as if a gigantic hand had been slammed into her chest the noise of the percussion rattled her eardrums making them ache then in its aftermath filled them with white noise fukuda was an expert in miniaturized explosives tori had thought that her story had made that evident to russell but apparently not as she struggled to regain equilibrium tori knew that fukuda would not have been foolish enough to attempt a frontal assault on them but the rigging of the armor told tori a great deal for one thing fukuda had some forewarning of their arrival so her network of contacts must be stronger than ever tori and russells entrance into tokyo had been highly clandestine for another thing fukuda had chosen the kinjito this pyramid as her field of battle tori knew they had to be doubly careful how many more surprises did fukuda have lying in wait for them tori knew fukudas strategy she loved the convoluted the oblique forms of assault what she could not abide was a direct frontal attack tori would keep this in mind tori rolled over heard a groan russ the groan came again and tori drawing herself onto her knees pulled russell into a sitting position are you okay he nodded but his eyes still looked slightly dazed tori looked around but there was no sign of hitasura amid the rubble christ she thought whats happened to him she got to her feet russell beside her stupid russell said what remind me not to go off halfcocked like that very funny they made a careful search for hitasura but they could find no sign that he had ever been there russell looked at tori dont say it she said i wont believe that hes betrayed me too i hope youre right russell said but the evidence suggests that he led us straight into a trap they moved off heading farther into the dimly lit interior of the hall soon the hall narrowed into a corridor the deeper they got the darker it became russell took out a pocket flash handed it to tori she flicked it on played it in a shallow arc ahead of themand immediately stopped in her tracks the concentrated beam of the flash picked up a shining strand a thread like a spiders webbing strung across their path tori touched russell pointed wordlessly the monofilament was strung approximately at waist height even at walking speed the monofilament would cut deeply into flesh tori went down on her knees then lay on her back russell followed her lead using the flash pointed upward she began to slither beneath the deadly monofilament she was halfway past it when she felt a pressure across her shoulders her scalp began to prickle and she felt a line of sweat snake itself between her shoulder blades she tried to turn her head but she could not see what was directly in front of her russ she hissed im stuck get up here he began to slither up on her right but she stopped him with a guttural noise get on top of me she whispered whatevers stopped me goes from shoulder to shoulder russell moved scrambling over her tori felt the comfortable fit of his body on hers looked upward into his face what do you see another monofilament he said softly i guess it was meant to get you at the ankles or stop anyone alert enough to have seen the first monofilament what do you want to do russell asked i can easily drag you backward no tori said i can feel an odd tension that came into the monofilament as i stretched it i think theres some kind of trigger that will go off when the tensions broken okay russell slithered forward and using toris body as a base passed over the second monofilament then he reached back dont use your fingers tori warned the monofilament will cut right through your skin right russell lay on his stomach took out his knife slid the blade between the monofilament and the hollow at the center of toris back carefully he brought the blade back toward him until it took the monofilament to the same tension it was at against toris shoulder blades move russell said now tori moved gingerly away from the monofilament and russell immediately felt that odd tension transferred to his arms it was like being near an electric current then tori had scrambled across the monofilament and had joined him on the other side she crouched down beside him whispered in his ear im going to get behind you on my signal take the blade away from the wire what dont worry trust me russell closed his eyes for a moment the sweat was burning on his face and he could feel his hands beginning to tremble with the task of maintaining just the right amount of tension on the monofilament a moment later he felt tori gripping his ankles im going to count to three ready ready one two three now russell breathing a prayer jerked the blade from its position against the monofilament at the same time he felt himself being slid backward hard and fast there was an ugly breeze against his face a blur in front of his eyes as the monofilament flew to his left and he heard a soft thock tori played the beam of the flash along the right wall and they saw embedded there a shuriken a miniature steel dart a thorn dark with an unknown substance on its tip this is one mean woman russell said wiping the sweat off his face yes tori said clever too id say diabolical russell stood no wonder hitasura split you picked one hell of a nemesis karma i must have sinned like a sonuvabitch in a previous life russell grinned at her time for atonement tori came close to russell her eyes glittering i think you should stay here youve come far enough this is between fukuda and me like hell russ try to put your male ego aside for the moment theres no sense forget it he said curtly how would you have come through back there without me id have found a way he gripped her shoulders tori i told you my feeling about vendettasthey have a way of eating people alive everyone who gets involved in them nevertheless i know fukuda and you dont im afraid that from now on youll be more of a liability russell sighed then nodded go on he said he put his hand on her hip as he had in the library at dianas garden which now seemed a lifetime ago i understand the need to pay her back for what she did to you thanks tori kissed him quickly on the lips then she was gone swallowed up by the darkness russell stood quite still for a moment then he said bullshit under his breath im going to protect you whether you like it or not when tori left russell she removed her shoes tying them to her belt then she went very fast down the corridor her steps were utterly silent across the marble squares it seemed as if she were barely touching the floor in fact she was using only the extreme outside of her soles never putting her full weight on either foot the principle was akin to the way in which fourlegged animals ran at times all their hooves were off the ground at once because they were able continually to redistribute their weight as they ran their center of gravity rotating away from each leg as it struck the ground at length the corridor ended and tori found herself at a bank of elevators she could see that they were all shut down to her right was a wide flight of sculpted marble stairs curving upward in the classical style that in this venue seemed wildly out of place tori mounted the stairs the way to ascend under these circumstances was with her back to the wall the idea was to put herself in fukudas mind and try to outthink her one quarter of the way up tori paused she could feel a kind of grit on the stairs otherwise the marble was immaculately smooth just in this spot tori squatted down another shuriken in the feeble light she saw the glint of the miniblade not two paces in front of her stuck between two squares of the marble wall she examined the blade it too was dark with some kind of herb toxin tori reached down beneath her feet picked up some of the grit on her fingertip rubbed it fukuda had cleverly carved out a slitlike niche for the blade in the grout between the marble slabs keeping her fingers away from the darkened tip tori carefully pulled the blade from the wall took it with her now she went directly up the center of the stairs peering intently ahead as she wound her way up to the secondfloor gallery she was almost at the top of the stairs when a ball of darkness came hurtling down at her it struck her folly on her chest and she crashed backward down the staircase until she landed painfully against the curved marble wall hot breath in her face claws digging into the flesh of her shoulders she had no space in which to work and worse her position left her no chance to use either momentum or her greater weight against the creature she saw the red eyes of the akita knew immediately it had been trained as a guard dog it was utterly silent all its efforts directed at subduing her it was very powerful and she was still slightly dazed from its initial attack she knew she had to disable it quickly or its teeth would eventually find her throat she jammed her elbow far back into its mouth reached down for the poisoned blade she had taken from the wall slammed it all the way into the akitas belly the paws scrabbled at her but their fall power was already waning tori threw the creature off her scrambled over it gaining the secondfloor gallery silence then a slight singing as of a draft through a grate or a cord being vibrated tori looked around there was something odd about the bank of elevators as soon as she moved cautiously toward them she saw that one of the doors was open revealing a gaping shaft the source of the singing tori could see the main cable moving against the auxiliary one gripping either side of the doorway she looked down and could just make out fukuda already below the firstfloor level descending the cable tori leaned out and gripping the cable wrapped her legs around it down she went it was not easy the cable was thick coated with grease she put a great deal of tension in her thighs knees and ankles it took her several moments to get the hang of it but then she was making good progress she had just passed the main floor when she felt the cable grow taut beside her the auxiliary cable began to move and soon she saw the counterweight soaring upward past her and knew what was happening fukuda was sending the elevator car down tori trapped between the main floor and the basement looked up saw the car plummeting down on her its shadow was already covering her and she could feel the kineticism in the cable she was gripping so tightly she realized there was only one thing to do released her grip with ankles knees and thighs and using only her hands to guide her shot down the cable without the grease coating she knew the friction would have flayed the flesh off her palms as it was she felt the abrasion building but the elevator was still gaining and in the instant she raised her head to glance at its progress she missed the basement level shot on past heading for the subbasement here there were no doors and the shaft ended abruptly with mounting honor tori looked down at the concrete bed of the elevator shaft a dead end shadows descending a hot wind on her neck she felt the encroachment of the oncoming car thought what have i to lose and let go completely she dropped the last fifteen feet willed herself to relax she landed in a ball on the oilstained concrete rolled came out of her tuck took a great leap sideways behind her with a whir and a whine the elevator settled into its bed tori heard swift footfalls echoing in the chamber of the subbasement she turned headed in their direction bare bulbs burned in sockets along the walls by their light she could see that the subbasement of this new building was far from finished rough concrete walls were interspersed with spackled wallboard on which hurried instructions for electrician or plumber had been scribbled she put on her shoes the floor was poured concrete filthy with oil and debris but often gaping holes opened into noisome trenches strung with enormous bundles of cables the lifelines of the kinjito tori leaped over these holes moving farther into the buildings interior abruptly she came to the far side of the kinjito the end of the subbasement there was no wall but rather a vast space opening onto the japanese solution to the utter lack of parking space in tokyo an automated parking tower had been incorporated in the design of the kinjito it was made up of a kind of vertical ferris wheel of steel slots onto which cars were driven then parked which were then rotated like a dry cleaners rack to get to the car needed tori turned briefly back the way she had come but she could neither see nor hear any sign of fukuda she stepped onto the steel slot of the parking tower and it immediately began to move upward behind her through immense green glass windows tokyo glittered like a toy city within a glass ball tori looked above and below her but she could not find fukuda it seemed unsafe to stay in one spot so she began to climb from slot to slot this was not difficult as the slots were immense gridworks of iron and steel affording ample hand and footholds to be the master of your enemys fate sun tzu wrote one must be as unknowable as one is silent fukuda is doing a good job of it tori thought so far she is leading me in circles up down up why is she doing that tori looked down past the gridwork of the parking tower past the skeleton of the kinjitos subbasement into the deep strata below tokyo itself and she knew up down up down thoomp her head jerked up at the sound she had just enough time to glimpse fukuda in the center of the parking tower where the machinery was housed before her grinning face was blotted out a black sphere expanding as it approached tori saw immediately that the spheresome kind of gaspropelled and inflated projectile that fukuda had inventedwould fill the entire area of the slot on which she stood by the time it hit there was no time to climb upward tori leaped downward onto the next slot but by then with the movement of the parking tower she was again level with fukuda thoomp the sphere exploding expanding toward her leap down onto the next slot thoomp the sphere exploding expanding toward her leap down onto the next slot she had a vision of sisyphus rolling his burden up the hill only to see it roll down again thoomp the sphere exploding expanding toward her and tori coiled into a ball leapt backward kicking out at the last instant the soles of her shoes crashing through a window panel she extended herself reaching out and backward simultaneously gripped a horizontal steel rim glass cut her hands and she gritted her teeth blood ran down her wrists she was alone in the night hanging from the sloping side of the pyramid of kinjito wind brushed her cheek she could hear the sounds of the city a vast engine humming on like a star spinning endlessly in its orbit it seemed so far away but at least she was off sisyphus hill the dreadful treadmill that fukuda had devised for her tori refused to look down she did not want to know how high up she was how far away the pavement was from where she hung the weight on her shoulder sockets was increasing with every moment she stayed in one position carefully she felt for purchase with her feet she encountered nothing but smooth glass her only chance was to curl upward so that her thighs were pressed tight against her chest until her feet were over the sill of the steel window rim in her contorted position she could barely breathe she was sweating profusely and her heartbeat was dangerously high she hung on a moment more going into prana her deep controlled breathing then having marshalled herself she gave one final heave felt herself launched upward and forward toward the building her backside cleared the steel rim and she let go with her hands flew back through the rent window the parking tower had ceased its movement and tori climbed through one slot into the center of the conveyance where she had seen fukuda she threw the switch to start the engine then climbed aboard a slot for the ride down she pulled out the small shuriken blade she had used to kill the akita sliced strips from her blouse bound her bleeding palms as she did so she saw a small cut on the middle finger of her right hand what differentiated it from the other cuts and abrasions on her hands was the flesh surrounding it it was dark and swollen tori flexed the finger motion was restricted and when she touched the cut she felt no pain nothing she looked down she was almost back at the subbasement she saw to her surprise that russell was standing at the edge of the parking tower looking up at her tori he called jump she shouted coming abreast of him what the hell jump damnit russell jumped down landing on her slot they passed below the level of the subbasement tori knew where they were headed she had known it the moment ascending sisyphus hill she had looked down past the subbasement into the tunnels of tokyos subway tori and russell jumped off the parking tower at its bottom before their slot began its ascent this is the place shes chosen tori thoughtthe place where she left me to die now shes intent on finishing the job what the hell happened to you russell said taking her roughly bandaged hands in his i tried to fly she said trying to laugh it off but i didnt quite make it she was thinking of her numbed middle finger the knife thrust into the akitas belly her hand slipping in the blood riding up the tiny hilt of the shuriken onto its blade fukudas down here he said i saw her riding that thing you were on i know where shes headed tori said leading him into the tunnels this is approximately where she left me the last time the subway tracks russell looked around but these tunnels are obviously longabandoned at that moment they heard a rumble felt the vibrations coming up through their feet russell looked down underneath us tori nodded this is madness he said i warned you i told you to stay behind but this is personal it has nothing to do with what were supposed to be invest it has everything to do with it tori snapped as long as fukuda knows im in tokyo shell give me no rest do you seriously believe shed allow us to continue with our investigation her eyes were almost black as if they had absorbed the darkness of the tunnels through which she and russell now crept one thing you can be sure of one of us is going to die here karma fuck karma russell said hotly that nonsense is only in your mind you think so i told you you wouldnt survive here without an open mind i meant it i could knock you out put you over my shoulder and carry you out of here he said then do it hotshot think tori youre reacting emotionally and fukuda is counting on that dont get in my way russ i wont back off russell stood very still he was livid with rage but he also recognized that most of his anger was displaced fear he was so frightened for her that he did not know what to say or do one thing you can be sure of one of us is going to die here finally he nodded karma and he thought if your final meeting with fukuda is meant to be tori then my presence here now is part of it my karma and yours bound together when this is over who will tell them apart they pressed on and almost immediately came upon a poorly shoredup section of the ground here wooden boards had been hastily placed over a length of track bed that had fallen through to the next level russell got down on his knees peered through a gap in the boards christ its a long way down thats where she is tori said he looked up at her the determined expression on her face nodded ill go first he pushed the boards apart produced the garrote wire and jammed one of the wooden ends into the gap between the boards where it narrowed to a crevice he unspooled the wire into the abyss lowered himself until his shoes hit the other wooden end using it as a foothold he slithered down until he was hanging at the end of the wire tori lowered herself after him and locking her legs around him moved slowly down his length she climbed down his body dropped finally off his ankles onto the track bed of the subway system from somewhere beyond a connecting wall she heard and felt the passage of a train she reached up said now and softened his fall as his bulk hurtled down at her which way russell said fukuda will tell us the more she shows me her strategy the more i learn about her russell said im beginning to like this concept of karma less and less tori gave him a thin smile wrong approach you cant like or dislike karma you accept it that seems to be something of a paradox russell said thoughtfully is this acceptance supremely pragmatic or supremely delusory russ remember our talk about the merging of myth and reality yes but how does that apply here when you can tell me tori said then you will understand is that a zen riddle you mean a koan tori laughed despite herself in a sense i guess it is a rumbling filled the tunnel this track russell asked next one over he relaxed somewhat its only a matter of time before a train comes through this tunnel well let fukuda worry about timetables and schedules tori said as they moved off down the tunnel shes so good at it privately russell thought this was a mistake he could not understand why tori was refusing to take the initiative he had been taught to attack whenever possible why was tori allowing fukuda to dictate the pace of the encounter all this esoteric talk of strategy made little sense to him ive got to find a way to end this quickly and finally he thought ahead of them they saw a light train tori shook her head she had one foot on the rail and there was no vibration fukuda she said they had at last come to the killing ground sit tight russell said so unexpectedly that when he pressed tori back against the damp tunnel wall she made no resistance russell keeping to the shadows gun drawn ran quickly and silently down the extreme edge of the tunnel toward the light russ you idiot tori thought heading after him i thought id persuaded you to give up being my protector didnt you promise that you werent going to go off halfcocked again tori heard the crack and almost simultaneously russells sharply indrawn breath as she came up to where he had been she saw the cleverly disguised hole beside the track bed he had fallen into it had stumbled to his right onto the tracks catching his right ankle between two rails where they branched into an adjacent tunnel dont touch him a voice cried and tori stopped on her way to try to free russell she stared at fukuda who was standing not fifty yards down the track her hand on a chrome lever this is the manual override to the automatic switching fukuda said if you dont do as i say ill put this lever and crush his ankle tell her to shove it russell said frantically searching for his pistol which he had dropped when the ground had given way beneath him he cursed his stupidity thought of what his impetuosity had caused he sat up tried to free his ankle christ but it hurt tori said what do you want you know the answer to that fukudas hand was curled menacingly around the lever i want you to die she beckoned with her free hand this way tori moved toward her thats enough fukuda commanded yes tori thought shes still afraid of me she doesnt want me too close a useful bit of information she had a few weapons at her disposal but she suspected now that they would not be enough her right hand was at her side surreptitiously she flexed the fingers the middle three were completely numb she still had some feeling in her thumb but her little finger was a mass of tingles tori thought dear god shes already won one doesnt often get a second chance in this life fukuda cocked her head as she stared blackeyed at tori i cant tell you what a wonderful feeling it is to see you down here again i knew youd get past the shuriken and the dog but how you outmaneuvered me in the elevator shaft and on the moving carpark ill never know she laughed but you see it doesnt matter because here you are and here youll the in just the way i want you to shes gloating tori thought shes human after all tori began to breathe again there was no point in formulating a strategy the place the time the circumstances had dictated what she must do in any case karma and as she launched herself toward fukuda she found herself wondering if russell would at last understand the nature of acceptance she saw fukudas eyes open wide in shock saw the tension come into her left hand where it grasped the manual override saw the lever begin its descent the squeal of the rail behind her a harbinger of the pain russell would suffer then tori was on fukuda her left hand the fingers stiffened like a bar of steel chopping down in a percussive atemi breaking fukudas hold on the override tori and fukuda crashed as one onto the tracks tori had several advantages beside surprise fukuda would be reluctant to let go of the lever since it was her primary hold on her that meant she was stationary and essentially onehanded fukuda was also afraid of her which would slow her response time to any sudden attack and her aversion to frontal assaults made her hesitate a fraction more before reacting just time enough for tori with the help of her artificial hip to reach her fukudas wrists were crisscrossed against toris throat in the cloudmaker her own pulse beat wildly in toris ears and tori fought for breath she used her knee against fukudas thigh bending it outward then drawing up her foot stamping down fukuda grimaced as the tendons connecting her thigh to her pelvis strained then as tori delivered another foot atemi they snapped but she did not release her grip rather ignoring the attack she pressed tori back against the rails pressing down on her windpipe tori struggled for air her entire right hand was numb the wrist feeling like it had bloated to three times its size pain was lancing up her arm she kicked again felt and heard the bone pop dislocating out of its socket in fukudas hip fukuda began yoibuki the aggressive hard breathing from deep in her throat in order to block the excruciating pain it was then that tori understood that nothing short of death was going to get fukuda to release her hold blackness an acute sense of dislocation threatened to engulf tori she was insensate on a black wind beginning to float away and it was with a supreme effort that she drew her drifting mind back to her predicament hang on she commanded herself hang on and then against her back she felt the vibration come into the tracks and she knew with an acute sense of deja vu that a train was on its way russell had screamed when he felt the increased pressure on his ankle bones oh christ he thought he was panting and the sweat was rolling down his body he heaved with renewed effort to free himself in fact he had made some progress when the squealing rail had caught him in its grip out of the corner of his eye he could see his gun glinting dully in the work lights of the tunnel it was ten feet away but in his position it might as well have been ten miles all right he told himself as calmly as he could forget the fucking gun how can i help tori he didnt know he took out his knife wedged the blade between the rail and his sock tried to pry himself free the blade bent and when he felt the tension building in it he gave up there was no point in having it break off he could see tori and fukuda locked in what looked like a mortal embrace he could discern no movement it was as if their bodies had turned to stone and they were grappling with the force of their wills and their hara then something made him look past the two antagonists light streaming at first pale but brightening rapidly until it was thick as lacquer pushing back the darkness along the curving outer wall of the tunnel the train was coming mother of god russell thought we are all going to be killed myth and reality were blending in toris oxygenstarved brain thoughts flashed like lightning in a darkling sky random energy losing direction for greater and greater periods of time she had no memory of what had taken place surely her body following the commands of her autonomous nervous system was keeping on with staying alive but that task was becoming more and more laborious there seemed to be a better way a sinking into a quieter time a pool of silence where the seconds stopped their ceaseless ticking wake up tears of silence enveloping her and the dark comforting and warm cradled her darkness is death so what tori she awoke to see fukudas face horrific with the effects of her efforts to kill her before the pain of fukudas dislocated bone rendered her unconscious drifting away tori awake again and thinking russells shouting keeping her from going under something about fukudas face what so hard to think like walking in quicksand not worth the effort slipping tori fukuda what about her that face so close to hers look it was full of desperation fukuda was almost as near her end as she was almost or more up to me tori thought she brought her knee up into the place where the bone was protruding from the inside of fukudas thigh kicked as hard as she could fukuda screamed and for just an instant relaxed her hold on toris windpipe tori already had her hands in position inside and beneath fukudas cloudmaker and now she used an aikido immobilization blocking fukudas right arm with her left then crossing her own right arm over grabbing fukudas wrist the problem was immediate she had no sensation in her right hand so as quickly as she could she jammed the heel of her left hand against fukudas elbow rammed it upward until she heard the bone break fukudas jaws snapped shut and tears of pain squeezed out of her eyes she tried to counterattack slipping through toris guard with her good left hand but tori blocked her with a series of rapidfire kites to her rib cage tori sucked in air in deep bursts put all her weight into a foot atemi against the right side of fukudas pelvis fukuda passed out tori almost spent lowered her forehead against fukudas chest then she was up the tunnel was brilliantly lit by the headlight of the train as it roared around the curve tori ran to the manual override but the automated switching was in progress and the lever refused to budge but she saw that it was no longer partway down the switching had reset itself to the position it had been in before fukuda had threatened russell with moving it she ran to where russell sat grimacing in pain she was so dizzy now she could barely stand he had managed at last to extricate his foot from the track and they held on to each other as they limped to the nearest of the worker niches that lined the subway walls at regular intervals so that the maintenance men could get out of the way of trains the train shot by them rattling through the tunnel its whistle screaming when it had passed they emerged and tori headed for the spot where she had left fukuda the track was clear she looked around then shouted as a hand grabbed her leg from the side of the track bed she saw fukudas twisted painfilled face black and white ribbons of soot streaking her pale skin devoid of blood the face more like a mask striped like a giant cats opened its mouth and tori saw her own death mirrored there the tiny metallic dart about to be shot out of its mouth tube tori tried to pry fukudas fingers from her flesh but they were like iron bands pulling her down to the track bed fukudas mouth raised her cheeks hollowed to expel her final deadly breath the noise of the explosion magnified by the confines of the tunnel made tori jump fukudas mouth closed with an audible snap her body convulsed and tori saw the bullet hole flower blood just over her heart tori began to snake sat right down where she had been standing russell hurried up to her limping on his good leg he pointed the gun at fukudas head as if for a moment he could not quite believe that she was dead come on he shouted cant you feel it another trains on its way tori did not move she was staring at the blank face of fukuda it seemed in that horrific instant that she saw her future black and bitter there the end of the path she had set out on when she had discovered that in some way she needed to confront death again and again tori goddamnit get up your vendettas finally over russell knelt down beside her he picked her up carried her back to another worker box shoved her in crawled painfully in beside her the darkness was electric with sound and vibration shes dead russells voice was hoarse he was shivering with shock and pain i hope youre satisfied he was trying to examine her but the lack of light made it impossible how badly are you hurt if you hadnt kept calling to me tori whispered i would have been the one left lying on the tracks she put her head wearily on his shoulder felt his arm come around her she closed her eyes but that only made her more dizzy she felt unutterably sick russell your leg the tunnel was lit up as if by a display of fireworks and they were shaken by the trains rumbling passage when it was gone and semidarkness had descended again russell said everythings all right well make our way out of here now but when he pulled tori to her feet she immediately collapsed and seeing her stricken face he said tori whats the matter youre wrong russ its not over tori thought again of her hand slipping in the akitas blood sliding up the narrow hilt of the shuriken knife that she had removed from the stairway wall being cut by the blade i cant move she said showing him the swollen wound black as death on her middle finger fukudas damned homemade toxin has poisoned me book three the zen policeman it is always with the best intentions that the worst work is done oscar wilde ten tokyo star town moscow arkhangelskoe that bastard hitasura big ezoe standing in the wet subway tunnel beneath the kinjito looked down at the broken body of fukuda he saw the blow tube still gripped between her teeth noted with sorrow that the tiny steel shuriken had not been launched on the other hand her ferocious expression not unlike a tigress about to strike its prey filled him with satisfaction she had died a warriors death that bastard hitasura still he did not like losing a member of his family especially one as valuable as fukuda had been the rumble of the subway trains in adjacent tunnels filled the flickering semidarkness building to crescendos then dying away in echoes that bastard hitasura came in here with his troops and did this koi the hard machine who had once been honno kansei knelt by his side her fingers touched the crepuscular flesh of fukudas cheek hitasuras men didnt do this her voice was cool detached before she was shot she went one on one with someone someone better than she was tori nunn big ezoe spit out the name thats why at the first sign of the trap hitasura escaped the kinjito to get his men he brought them back into the museum down here into the subway system where fukuda had lured tori num he risked the metropolitan police for that woman shes teamed up with hitasura again thats bad news for me no koi said rising its bad news for her the first streaks of sunlight pressed like orange pulp through the gunmetal gauze of the clouds filled the eastern sky when they struck the curve of the sumida river which big ezoes apartment overlooked the sluggish water was transformed into a ribbon of molten lead koi stared out and down at the increasing dazzle broken now by the pewter bow wave of a fishing boat heading toward the tsukiji fish market there were so many shades of gray on the river in the long shadows along its banks that koi kept counting them as if there was a lesson to be learned in attempting to measure infinity we have several tasks before us big ezoe was saying first i want us to find a way to usurp hitasuras deal with kunio michita michita must be paying hitasura a fortune for his gobetween work the breadth and depth of the political corruption sakatas ledgers revealed is breathtaking the tapestry of bribes they recorded is priceless why should he have his fingers in that pie and not me but it will not be easy as you know there is a gap in kakuei sakatas ledgers the physical connection between the two hitasura and michitais never mentioned is it because of ignorance or by design second we must punish hitasura for his transgressions against members of my family third we must destroy tori nunn for her part in all this she murdered fukuda there was a gull on the river koi saw whose body incorporated every shade of gray in its environment as it passed from shadow to light to shadow again i am like that gull koi thought i am every shade of gray i am my environment i would have liked she said to have had more time with fukuda i was looking forward to that big ezoe stared at her she was lit from behind by the early morning light coming in through the windows her features cloaked in darkness seemed unreal to him so much like the god mask at the bunraku play that for a moment he was transfixed for he could not tell one from the other then she moved and orange light brushed her cheek warming her flesh illuminating one dark eye and with a shock he saw in there the hint of some mad thing a black force like a maelstrom still far off on the horizon of night and it made him shudder for he suspected that it would be a struggle for him to control it big ezoe pushed these disturbing thoughts aside said in a businesslike voice i want you to think back to when you were working for kunio michita can you give me a list of names important clients and associates he saw with some regularitysay more than three times a month koi began just as if she were a computer sorting through vast files of course she said reeling off more than a halfdozen names but thats not counting the kaga people involved in the joint venture with michita she said what kind of joint venture a combined research and development laboratory koi said but i dont see how that could be of interest to us big ezoe looked at his watch made a quick call when he hung up he said i think its time we went to breakfast bathe me first koi said her eyes were glittery with hunger then we will go and do what must be done big ezoe was unused to being ordered around he found that he did not much care for it he opened his mouth to protest then closed it again deciding that at this point it was far better to humor koi than to oppose her with fukuda gone he needed koinot that he could ever afford to let her know this but with the manner in which fukuda was disposed of if he did not retaliate quickly and successfully his loss of face would be devastating to his authority over his people so he acquiesced as obediently as if he were a woman the bath was modern primitive an sshaped curve of translucent glass blocks created a wall of aqueous green light that shimmered its diamondlike reflections on the gushing water outside the geometric grid of tokyo was reduced to smears of gray an incomplete template for a city of the future which koi would through the force of her will perfect rare ainu fetishes hung on the wall opposite the glass bricks the stark faces of dark gods now consigned to myths already forgotten but for koi in these hard visages of the gods of japans indigenous ethnics lived the souls of the clouds the rain and wind which for centuries had scoured nippon carving it into its present image here were the keys to the kingdom the real japan lying in wait with its breathless heart beneath the modern iconographic facade where image and symbol were melded to create a new language devoid of significance naked koi climbed into the steaming water sinking down until she sat in the lotus position the hot water streaming onto the top of her head surrounding her in spray now at last i see beyond all the lies to the buried truth she said she was not looking at big ezoe nor at anything in the room being born hinoeuma was a blessing not a curse because i was hinoeuma i was taken to the man of one tree and there learned the ways of the warrior but when i returned to the outside world i was thrust once more into the caldron of my family and i was obliged to suppress much of what i was taught by the man of one tree i learned to fit in to be the model daughter as preparation for being the model wife i was no longer afraid of being hinoeuma because the man of one tree had given me the strength i needed to combat it he told me that i was now strong enough to decide not to be hinoeuma but he was wrongor in the end because he was a man he lied to me here is the truth i am hinoeuma and being so gives me an altogether different power my evil passions my bloody nature is a divine gift and with this she rose up out of the bath the water purling down her taut muscular body a darkhaired leviathan opaleyed and omnipotent emerging from the deep on the tokyo waterfront mist was rising off the sumida it was already too late in the morning for the daily fish auction at the tsukiji fish market but the stalls were busy as the citys best restaurateurs continued to buy provisions for the afternoon and evening meals big ezoe and koi emerged from the gray steelpaneled mercedes walked across concrete slick with water sluicing away fish entrails they went to a little row of stalls numbered through entered the tiny restaurant in the middle of the row it was more a coffee shop than a restaurant a tiny kitchen behind a plain counter fronted by no more than a dozen stools in a sixteenbysevenfoot area there was only one customer at the counter a middleaged executive with a pencil mustache wearing a regulation dark gray threepiece suit appropriate for corporation work with a start koi recognized him as the senior vicepresident for administration for the kaga conglomerate the man she had seen lose so much money at big ezoes gambling house the one she had had a hand in sending into debt the two men nodded to one another but otherwise there was no traditional greeting no names were exchanged and big ezoe did not in any way seek to explain kois presence koi got the eerie sensation of being back in kunio michitas office because for this moment she had ceased to exist big ezoe ordered asari a soupy dish made with a ladleful of fresh baby clams white and briny koi asked for oyakoni a hot dish of eggs and browned onions and three slices of toro sashimi big ezoe said there is a great deal of money outstanding i cannot pay principle the kaga vicepresident said big ezoe nodded i understand i will be satisfied with a payment of interest this exchange sounded to koi as if it were a rote call and response nevertheless the kaga vicepresidents head seemed to sink between his shoulder blades but he nodded koi could not see his face big ezoe said your company has a joint venture with kunio michita what does it involve the mustachioed man seemed to consider this for some time at length he said our people stumbled upon a technology about two years ago they thought it was a dead end until kunio michita showed up and began talks with them how did michita know about kagas technology koi asked the mustache twitched good question we are still trying to find the answer i have no idea how michita did it perhaps like your friend here hes got a spy inside kaga and yet koi said thoughtfully michita must have obtained the information from someone in any event the kaga vicepresident went on as if this point were of no concern to him it seems michita had a use for this technology even though it involved nuclear devices we did not want to give him the technology but we could see no conceivable use for it it seemed logical then for the two companies to form a joint venture i see big ezoe worked a tiny clamshell around his mouth until he had gotten all the delicious juice out of it then he spit it out so this joint venture isnt research and development at all no the kaga vicepresident said its a manufacturing setup what is it manufacturing i dont know all im aware of is that we are getting illegal shipments of hafnium into the joint company big ezoe said what the hell is hafnium the kaga vicepresident told him about hafnium being used to manufacture control rods for reactor cores and how hafnium kept absorbing neutrons long after other materials became saturated and had to be replaced it seems evident that the setup must be manufacturing parts for some kind of nuclear reactors the kaga vicepresident concluded nuclear reactors big ezoe shook his head this wasnt turning out as he had expected kunio michitas business doesnt include atomics i guess it does now the kaga vicepresident said who is selling him the hafnium a west german firm owned by an argentine named estilo koi said does estilos company manufacture the hafnium how should i know big ezoe looked at her and she said i know of this west german company its had a number of dealings with kunio michita estilo is a middleman a broker for all sorts of hardware and esoteric raw materials like hafnium koi thought for a moment then she looked at the kaga vicepresident who does estilo buy his hafnium from i have no idea the man said i doubt that even tensan knows he meant fumida ten the chairman of kaga the vicepresident shrugged i dont even know anything about this west german company except that its represented in this country by budoko associates that law firm is huge big ezoe said who at budoko is handling the transactions i dont know i shouldnt even be aware of budoko normally i have to approve all corporate bills before theyre sent on to accounting but these were routed around me i only came across one by accident big ezoe finished his asari making smacking sounds of satisfaction is there anything else that might be of use to me i cant think of anything the kaga vicepresident said he had not touched his breakfast he looked at the food wistfully as if he could recall a time when he had had an appetite well the only thing was i dont think michita was the original instigator of the joint venture talks he brought an american with him a businessman i dont think so no the american was introduced to us as mr smith what does that tell you big ezoe nodded threw some yen on the table and he and koi left the coffee shop they strolled for some time amid the thinning throngs at the fish market it was a good place to talk big ezoe said now there are some intriguing new players to the game it isnt just michita and hitasura were chasing its kaga and someone in the largest law firm in tokyo and where does hitasura fit into all this it seems were no closer to finding the link between him and michita not to mention this mysterious american do you remember a mr smith or any likely american who did not fit the typical businessman mold being in touch with michita no lets leave that for the moment big ezoe said why were you so interested in where the hafnium is coming from im not sure koi said but it seems to me that none of this quite hangs together do you think our mans lying no hes too frightened of you to lie but i dont think he knows whats really going on neither do we yet what were beginning to get a look at is flesh without any bones its not yet making sense they walked in silence for some time while big ezoe digested this at last he said does anything else occur to you yes i think we should put the deciphered pages of kakuei sakatas ledgers to good use lets use them as leverage to find out what hitasura is up to big ezoe was already shaking his head i cant be certain that hitasura doesnt already know what the ledgers contain after all it was his brother who did the deciphering i cant take the chance of losing face then use the ledgers against kunio michita perhaps at some point but not now the ledgers are all we have i resist the idea of shooting a gun with one bullet if i can achieve the same result merely by aiming the weapon koi considered this a moment then nodded theres something else she said when the kaga vicepresident mentioned budoko associates it rang a bell i didnt think of this before when you asked me about people michita saw with some regularity but now im beginning to see its significance there was a young lawyer yen yasuwara hes now a partner in budoko associates have you heard of him yes but its interesting that you have as well big ezoes mind was racing yen yasuwara had been at the heart of the blood feud between fukuda and tori nunn fukuda had been seeing yen yasuwara primarily because big ezoe had been given information that yasuwara was somehow involved with the sort of deals big ezoe would find attractive big ezoe had sent fukuda to find out what she could in any way she saw fit that she had decided to open her legs for him had not presented big ezoe with a problem that she had not been able to discover what yasuwara was up to had then tori nunn had arrived on the scene and that particular line of inquiry had been blown because as it turned out fukuda had some personal feelings left after all now it seemed that yen yasuwara was tied in with kunio michita could he be the link missing from kakuei sakatas ledgers what was yen yasuwaras business with michita i dont know koi said thinking back michita never met yasuwara in the office in fact i never made the appointments i wouldnt have known who yasuwara or budoko associates were except for the fact that during the particularly difficult negotiations for the joint venture with the kaga conglomerate michita left me the same number each time he left the office when there was a hole in his daily schedule i remember he had asked me to keep the hours of two to three open of course i didnt ask why but when the kaga negotiations were at a crucial stage i had occasion to call him several times and the phone number he left you was for budoko associates well that was the most intriguing part koi said each time i called a woman answered but it was obvious from the way she spoke that she was no secretary and the call was not routed through a switchboard i assumed it was a private residence but i was wrong one afternoon when michita was out papers arrived by messenger from kaga they were so important that they did not come over the fax the envelope was sealed with red wax in which was imprinted the kaga logo i phoned michita at the number he gave me and told him what had come in he told me to come right down he also told me to take the subway not a company car koi paused a moment i assumed he was concerned with trafficthe subway was far faster than sitting in a car trapped on a crowded street but now im convinced his main concern was security he and yen yasuwara were at a private club in shinjuku the woman who answered the phone presided over their private room like a hawk with her young she was a mamasan who had owned her own akachochin this job she told me was far more lucrative she looked after special clients for whom the need for absolute privacy was paramount this puzzle is becoming more fascinating by the moment big ezoe said whatever michita and yasuwara were working on was so secret they had to keep it from their respective offices he thought a moment how was it that michita trusted you with knowing where he was to be honest koi said it never crossed his mind i was so good at what i did that i was next to invisible he thought of me as a computer with hands nothing more certainly not as someone who might possess independent thought big ezoe grunted more fool him yen yasuwara lived in a sleek modern house in hiroo in minatoku apparently he was undisturbed by the influx of trendminded foreigners opting for the flash the nouveau riche the world over seemed to prefer it was important big ezoe reflected as he guided the mercedes up the treelined street for those who were new to money to show how much they had to as many people foolish enough to take notice insecurity that made big ezoe happy he thrived on other peoples insecurities big ezoe nosed the mercedes into the curb pulled to a stop but he didnt cut the ignition he said over the purr of the idling engine will you recognize him yes he didnt doubt her he didnt doubt anything she said koi it appeared was totally unconcerned about the need now and then to lie she seemed in fact totally oblivious to other peoples reactions to what she said or did this was to a large extent an enormous advantage but her disconnectedness continued to concern big ezoe koi was like a tap gushing water that was all well and good for as long as one needed the force but what happened when it was time to end the flow and the tap would not close it was just after eight in the evening the sky was the color of bronze burnished by the ten billion lights of the city there seemed to be no night at all they had spent the day trying to get close to hitasura and tori nunn but even with big ezoes vast network of informants they could not even find out where they were a day that had begun in a most promising manner had turned aimless and frustrating on the other hand big ezoes lieutenants had assured him that one way or another an answer would be forthcoming before midnight as to the whereabouts of hitasura and tori nunn until then big ezoe knew he must content himself with what was about to happen koi slipped out of the car walking toward a young man in an impeccable threepiece suit who was approaching the front gate of yasuwaras house she had not said thats him but had moved on her own as if once having been given the objectives by big ezoe she was now making her own way toward them without seeking his counsel big ezoe again thought of the water tap that would not turn off koi stopped yen yasuwara he did not seem pleased to be intercepted koi said something to him and big ezoe saw the young lawyers face go white big ezoe smiled a moment later koi had put yasuwara into the backseat of the mercedes slid in beside him youre a very handsome man mr yasuwara big ezoe said as he threw the mercedes in gear pulled out into the street you must attract many women who are you people yen yasuwara said in a tense voice what do you want big ezoe noticed that yasuwara could not take his eyes off koi all the better he thought i want to remain as invisible as possible its kois job to take the heat of any fallout that might result from this interview big ezoe said it is my opinion mr yasuwara that being handsome is something of a gift it shouldnt be taken for granted what nonsense are you talking yen yasuwara was trying to seem angry but he only succeeded in sounding more frightened next to him koi hooked a bloodred fingernail jabbed it into the center of his cheek yasuwara yelped jumping in shock and pain but kois left hand was already clamped firmly on his shoulder she twisted her fingernail in yasuwaras flesh you he wailed you what is this its a picnic mr yasuwara big ezoe said in a jaunty tone at least it is for us were out for a little fun koi slit open the lawyers cheek so that blood ran down his neck soaking into his neat white shirt collar eventually it began to dribble onto his blue and cream tie beading on the expensive silk like tears oh god yen yasuwara said this might be an appropriate moment to begin our talk big ezoe said talk is that what you want to do why didnt you say so at the beginning big ezoe said we wanted you to understand the seriousness of our intent mr yasuwara i make money from information and today you are going to make me rich i think youre mistaken you must have the wrong man these things happen big ezoe ignored him you are doing business with two men kunio michita and fumida ten chairman of kaga is that not so youre yakuza arent you he stared in morbid fascination as koi lifted her bloody fingernail in front of his face it was as curved as a hawks talon it makes no difference who we are big ezoe said especially to you now i have asked you a question i expect a prompt answer yen yasuwara said let me go i dont know either of those men kois fingernail again buried itself in his cheek this time she did not wait to drag it all the way down now there were two bloody parallel furrows along his right cheek they could hear his gasping breath in the car big ezoe said michita and ten they are clients of yours yes yen yasuwara said immediately his eyes were almost crossed in their attempt to keep sight of the bloody talon what do you know of a west german firm owned by an argentine named estilo look yasuwara said i could get into trouble if i answered that big ezoe laughed mr yasuwara you could not be in more trouble than you already are but you dont underst his words were cut off in a scream as kois fingernail pierced his flesh just beneath his right eye yen yasuwara gave a reflexive jerk but koi held him fast yes yes he cried his right eye was bloodshot and tears were streaming from it all right estilos firm employs me to facilitate moving unusual cargo from place to place by unusual big ezoe said i take it you mean illegal by place to place i take it you mean across international frontiers without being monitored by customs yen yasuwara said nothing until koi dipped her fingertip into his blood smeared it across his dry lips then he whimpered said yes in a voice made hoarse by fear when koi said where does estilos hafnium come from yen yasuwara jumped perhaps he had not expected that she could speak please please please he said koi leaned toward him and yen yasuwara began to tremble estilo buys all his hafnium from a french firm named la lumiere dor he said it is a privately held french company but its parentage is american koi said immediately is the american who accompanied kunio michita in his dealings with kaga the owner of this french firm i dont know but he might have been i dont think so yen yasuwara said i could tell the american was in control although the two of them took pains to disguise the fact im far too knowledgeable about such things for me to have been fooled no la lumiere dor is simply the conduit through which the hafnium flows this man you could see was not a businessman koi was thinking that yasuwara was the second man who had said the mysterious american didnt give the appearance of being a businessman the kaga vicepresident had made the same observation in a moment she said does kaga buy the hafnium outright from estilo no thats part of why i was retained michita buys the hafnium from the west german firm by withdrawing funds from a blind offshore trust held at a bank on the caribbean island of monserrat i found a way for michita to be involved without him having any connection with the account what do you mean big ezoe said he has to make the deposits he doesnt yen yasuwara said the sweat was streaming down his face mixing unhealthily with the coagulating blood that is taken care of by a third party yeah big ezoe said who yen yasuwara hesitated only long enough to see kois talon come up to the level of his eye he blinked furiously swallowed hard hitasura he said it as if it were a sigh and all the air was escaping from inside him there it is big ezoe thought the link no one wanted to admit to the one even kakuei sakata had not dared commit to print in his ledgers big ezoe looked at yen yasuwara in the rearview mirror the lawyers terror filled the interior of the mercedes like a perfume he said to koi can you believe this hitasura michita and kaga are all in on this sweet deal he turned his gaze back to yen yasuwara why he said carefully are michita and hitasura using illegal offshore profits to fund the manufacture of nuclear reactors no one knows about because of the strict laws here against atomics yen yasuwara said also theyre building them for export selling them to the highest bidder right no its on consignment for a single vendor there was a weariness now in yen yasuwaras voice as if he had seen the future and understood that it held nothing for him i put the deal together so i should know the items are being shipped to russia to an antirussian underground organization there known as white star the lights had gone down in a simulacrum of night but in the starless darkness irina could see odysseus all the better it was as if his skin luminous during the day picked up a phosphorescence in the absence of light irina comfortable in the saltwater pool with the hero and his blue dolphin scissorkicked slowly languidly i have to warn you odysseus said ive been irradiated i was exposed to cosmic radiation while i rode between the stars do you mean to tell me even heaven has its pitfalls the gave her an ironic smile youre not concerned why should i be irina said lara and tatiana certainly arent its their job to be with me odysseus said seriously theyre prepared for the consequences irina touched him im sorry i was so flip dont be she could see his smile widening and it was like the sun striking water i miss humor so much here im afraid that is a failing of marss she gave a little squeal as arbat the blue dolphin raced between her treading legs she likes you odysseus said odd id have thought shed be jealous arbat surfaced clicking furiously and irina put her hand on the bottle snout she knows i dont want to take you away from her yes odysseus said she knows waves lapping all around them the scent of salt and phosphorous irinas mind in proximity with this astounding human engine had begun to unfold in skeins stretching itself like a hermit at last emerging from her cave what else does arbat know odysseuss eyes were pale against his pale skin did volkov tell you to ask me that no why would he there was a silence for a time even arbat was quiescent no reason odysseus said at last you dont like him much lets not talk about comrade volkov odysseus said the subjects so tiresome irina tried to accept this tell me how you know natasha mayakova in the early days after my return from space there was no pool no arbat i was bored so i was taken into moscow often to the theater i saw natasha in the seagull i was quite moved and asked if i could go backstage to meet her i was taken with her right away yes indeed irina said i thought at first that i was going to dislike her but then people have a way of fooling you once you get to know them and others the hero said only fool themselves irina swam closer to him is there anybody here with us volkovs gone lara and tatiana are sleeping theres only us and of course the monitors but they cant pick up anything that goes on in the pool except for arbats clicking and the technicians cant make heads or tails of that i think its awful that you have to be monitored irina said join the line ill ask mars if he can do something about it odysseus threw his head back and laughed you do that he said i only wish i could be there to hear his reply why do you laugh mars has a great deal of power you know him well if you can persuade him to call off the dogs id be very grateful dont you get tired of this pool irina asked dont you get tired of russia he said mimicking her tone is that a joke not in the least i dont consider freedom a subject suitable for humor yes irina said i do get tired of the life here well thats a step in the right direction she longed to say more to tell him all about cambridge the students the cokes and pizzas the rock n roll but the words got stuck in her throat odysseus floated for a time in silence he was staring up into the darkness as if he could see the stars through the roof through the dull cloud cover over zvezdny gorodok as if his eyes were beacons or radar dishes irina was getting used to his silences it did not mean that he wasnt listening to her on the contrary his silence was a sign of his intense concentration it came to her after a time that his silences were not like normal gaps in conversation but if only one knew how to listen contained their own form of communication what was it irina said now that you left behind up there in the space between the stars odysseus went very still his eyes much like the dolphins glittered in the bits of electronic light that here and there were scattered throughout the pool room how did you know that there was astonishment in his voice i dont know i knew irina seemed as bewildered as he was i heard something in the silence or perhaps it was an image i saw odysseus said i was thinking of the part of myself that did not come back to earth with me which part was it i dont think its definable like a leg or a hand odysseus thought for some time grappling with finding the right words a piece of what i had been was burned away during the event i know that for a fact but something new was added and then a piece of it was taken away again and that is far more terrible to live with is this making any sense to you as much as anything in the world makes sense irina said odysseus said carefully but what im talking about is not from this worldor any other you can conceive of irina said nothing she was acutely aware of floating hanging in a phosphorescent space detached more apart than ever from the people around her it was as if a moat had been added to the pane of glass that separated her from the people in the moscow streets as if now she were moving through an altogether different mediumand without knowing it had been for some time let me try to explain odysseus continued because i want so much to share this with someone other than arbat and comrade volkov is incapable of any real form of understanding he licked his lips if i tell you here is a flame put your hand in it you would fully expect to be burned but what if you werent burned if i take you to the top of a building and say walk over the edge you would fully expect to fall to the ground but what if you didnt it is six in the morning time for sunrise but when you go outside there is no sun all these are answers to what i was given up there in the space between the stars but they are only partial answers he stirred beside her if the universe is vast then the inculcation of ideas is even more vast and the only thing that is infinite is the inception of reality because reality encompasses even time reality is so unimaginably huge so pervasive that it defies even the dictates of time irina pondered this for several minutes then she said in an odd way youre a refugee arent you something happened to you up there as if you stepped through a doorway into a new reality and now you no longer belong here odysseus said thats it precisely something that had been hidden or absent before had come into his face softening it giving it more of a human scale instead of the massive intensity of a fiftyfoothigh image i shouldnt be understanding this irina thought but i do isnt my own sense of a changed reality whats at the heart of my discontent i am like odysseus a displaced person living in one reality while inside being part of another it all makes so much sense although i doubt if i could say why to an outside observer she shivered thinking i hope we are alone here what would anyone else make of this discussion probably that we were both mad as czars there were tears in odysseuss eyes you cant know how i despaired of ever finding someone who would understand he kissed her cheeks her eyes her lips he laughed and to think its volkov himself whos provided me with my salvation irina who had begun to shiver when he had touched her now quaked beneath his kisses she felt consumed with fire not only in her body but in her mind as well it was as if the line of communication they had together threaded had now sewed their souls into one combined whole space is a harsh mistress odysseus said irina could feel his words as well as hear them it draws you like a magnet a siren until you have no choice but to open up your soul to it and then he put his head into her neck and then you step into the black waterthe silence between the starsand find that there is no bottom you disappear into that silence only to find that it isnt silence at all but a riot of communication you have been too dullwitted to comprehend she felt his teeth on her flesh his words in her ears in exactly the same way immersed in a thunder of communication your sense of humanness slips away its importance diminishing to a point on the new horizon now comprehension is all that matters understanding and being understood an end to isolation a chance to become one with the angels irina was dizzy with sensation the sensuality of his body was combining with that peculiar silent communication of his to create a whirlpool toward which she was being all too willingly drawn concentric circles f reality time energy seemed to surround her pulsing in the darkness of the pool heating the water she swam in the air she breathed oxygen was being forced into her lungs as if through a bellows there was a singing in her blood instead of a pulse the world disappeared in its place irina hung suspended like a star in the blackest of heavens and there was odysseus beside her part of her in her sliding in as easily as if he had always been there irina filling up with him felt the moat disappear the wall of glass dissolving an end to isolation a chance to become one with the angels her own isolation was at an end as if her making love to the hero was more than a physical act as if it were emotional as well as symbolic she had at last found the strength to embrace something with every cell of herself unequivocally unreservedly accepting it all wanting it all the good and the bad the light and the darkness because she was no longer terrified of the darkness inside herself because in embracing odysseus she was also accepting all of herself even the part that she had hated feared had tried for so long to disown her breasts crushed against him her erect nipples brushing his smooth smooth flesh her arms surrounding him feeling the odd shape of his curved back but not being afraid accepting that as part of him her eyes opened to watch his face lovingly startled when his amazing eyes opened and she stared into their pewter depths seeing behind them the images in which he had been immersed ever since the event in the nonsilence between the stars irina saw what he saw felt what he felt she was aware of their two hearts beating in unisonsurely an illusionthe ticking of a cosmic clock in the dark sea of reality time energy her muscles were tensed as her hips moved as her breath came in hot excited spurts but beneath that her bones had turned to liquid as if she has been somehow transformed from human being into a creature of another design as if the places where her bones were had been turned into conduits filled with an alien fluid pulsing with the beat of their two hearts and in that shocked instant when her hips speeded up but felt heavy with lust and longing irina saw knew sensed what it was that odysseus had encountered in the space between the stars the entity that had given him the tantalizing glimpse of its world time reality a doublepumped engine like a heart liquid bones beneath muscle as hard as a carapace sense organs in a starshaped cluster in what might be called a head but with a body shape that was incomprehensible because it slipped back and forth between two and three dimensions odysseus was not mador perhaps he was mad and she was mad as well but if so then this madness was a state of grace and irina was grateful that it had come to her this thought exploded in her mind like lightning as her body spasmed as the exploded inside her so deep that she felt him hard against her inner core and this set her off again moaning and thrashing against him hearing his own deepfelt groan in her mind as well as in her ears ripples black in the starless darkness that immersed them held them fast protected them from everyone and everything purled outward from the engine of their bodies filling the waters surface with purpose at the other end of the pool arbat floated still silent feeling the ripples wash endlessly against her happy because the hero was happy content because the was content after a very long time odysseus slipped from irinas warmth but strangely she did not feel the emptiness the sting of sadness she usually did at that moment she was left with the image of what she had been exposed to what she had become she reached out touched him wondering if instead of calcium there was fluid running in the conduits of his bones odysseus laughed not yet he said reading her mind though maybe one day irina was still trembling waves of emotion rippled through her but it could not dissolve the dark undercurrent that left a bitter taste in her mouth and she thought ive lied to valeri to mars even to natasha i cannot lie to him she clamped down on her dread of the repercussions said actually mars did want me to find out something the hero was silent arbat moved closer watched irina with a peculiar disconcerting intensity irina swallowed hard in sudden panic she wanted to turn back time but instead she pressed on he wanted to know where you got some papers you showed him a topsecret file watching odysseus she held her breath she could feel the blood pounding in her temples are you angry with me on the contrary odysseus said im grateful you told me irina put her hands on him it was wicked of me not to tell you right away was it i dont want to ever lie to you he smiled thats a wonderful ambition he said it as if he meant impossible instead of wonderful i want she stopped abruptly marshalling her thoughts i need someone i can trust someone i can confide in you mean comrade volkov isnt the one this is it irina thought i want toi must tell him i know he will understand and taking a deep breath she stepped off the edge of her world i have spent some time in america boston she said the cambridge area is filled with students from many wonderful universities i got drunk on the atmosphere and the variety of opinions at least i thought i was drunk but when i came home and sobered up i realized that i had left a piece of myself in cambridge i had fallen hopelessly in love can one fall in love with a place why not but ever since that love has been like a stone in my heart drifting arbat close listening it seemed too now i know just how shakespeares juliet must have felt love and pain are sometimes inseparable yes odysseus said it is true that sometimes memories hurt memories of paths not taken memories of what might have been irina watched the play of light across his face tiny crescent reflections off the surface of the water she could not decide whether she saw the sadness in his face or felt it emanating from him after a time she said are you here of your own free will that sounds like a metaphysical question he said i dont know if i m qualified to answer it she cocked her head inquisitively she was getting the knack of manipulating silences the question of free will is an important one odysseus said carefully we all may believe that there is free will but i doubt now that its the case we arehave becomewhat we have been made into what has been implanted in us in an unconscious a subliminal sense at a very early age and as adults the way in which we respond to people and to situations is determined by the nature of that subliminal information we may not even know is there as he spoke irina felt a tiny shiver race down her and she sought to be closer to him as if so near his presence she could beat back the unpleasant truth that seemed so uncomfortably near now she had seemed so close to freedom when he was inside her but now the old sad irina was trying to reassert herself dont think about it she told herself i wonder odysseus said whether you hold me as you hold all your men are you jealous of mars already irina said she had meant it humorously a light touch to a conversation pulling her ever deeper into the heart of her own darkness jealousy has nothing to do with it odysseus said of course one of my men is kgb yes you know irina was startled the kgb knows many things odysseus said but i know more his eyes were light she could see pinpoints dancing in their depths i know how we are joined there can be no deceit in such openness just as there can be no duplication of it with another no irina i am not threatened but i am concerned by your dependence on men what are you talking about but her heartbeat out of sync with his accelerated painfully as if she already knew what he would say nothing there was so much sadness in his voice that irinas heart broke wont you talk to me about it no odysseus said ill talk to you about space the final frontier isnt it he laughed but there was an unease to him that irina found unnerving arbat splashed nervously near them but what have i said to offend you not a thing then why do i suddenly feel cut off from you you are cut off from yourself odysseus said you can help me then if i try ill only succeed in plunging you deeper into the woods in which you are lost irina on the verge of tears said i dont understand arbat swimming fast beneath the water surfaced at irinas side pushed her head against irinas hand as if she could feel irinas distress arbat irina whispered what am i to do but she was staring into odysseuss dark eyes arbat chattered in her high dolphin voice and irina said sadly if only i could understand what youre saying ill translate odysseus said she says life is short but lessons are not quickly learned is that true of dolphins as well i wonder odysseus looked at her dolphins have no lessons to learn he said except when it comes to dealing with man i believe mr yasuwara that we are finished with you big ezoe said just like that just like that big ezoe said youre going to let me go oh no big ezoe said how can i youve lied to me from the beginning but you would have me believe that hitasura kunio michita and fumida tenall of whose profit motives are highly honed are putting together an organization to make some kind of nuclear reactors and then they are shipping them into russia a country so poor it has to buy wheat from the americans to feed its own people what do you take me for it simply isnt logical but its the truth i swear it yen yasuwaras eyes were bulging his hands vibrating with his terror for a start why would hitasura sink capital into such an insane venture ask hitasura or michita i dont know of course you dont big ezoe said then to koi kill him wait yen yasuwara closed his eyes his face was completely devoid of color and he was whispering dear god over and over his eyes opened his tongue brushed his dry cracked lips theres a way to prove ive been telling you the truth oh mr yasuwara big ezoe said how can you expect me to trust anything you tell me he watched koi edge closer to the lawyer please it was a croak there was a wild look in yen yasuwaras eyes more telling than if he had been hooked up to a lie detector big ezoe waited turning the emotional screws before nodding you have one chance mr yasuwara i do hope youll make the most of it the old wooden slats were drawn across the windows and the acrid smell of iodine and sickness filled the room like dead flowers irina stood on the threshold of the oneroom apartment in an unlovely massive postworld war building in sadovochemogryazskaya and for a moment her mind was blank she could not even remember what time it was or how she had come here then she stepped into the room she could see the form sitting upright in the ladderbacked rocker that for years had belonged to babushka wan light fell across the silhouette in thin damaged strips illuminating a scrawny shoulder here a gnarled finger there irina took a deep breath said hello mother is that you yvgeny its me irina irina said coming to kneel beside her mother yvgeny youve been away so long the old woman said you bad boy why have you stayed away mother its irina your daughter my daughter the narrow head moved and light lit up its features ravaged wasted by time and memories that would not fade have i a daughter the head moved slowly back and forth i cannot remember irina reached across to the windowsill took down the tin of dusting powder her mother loved so much softly gently she applied the duster to the translucent skin of her mothers shoulders that smells nice yvgeny i am reminded of my mother she used to smell of boiled potatoes and cabbage even after she bathed she smelled of boiled potatoes and cabbage i wanted never to smell that way no never her eyes fluttered closed so nice then her eyes flew open and her false teeth clacked together mother of god yvgeny what have they done to you there is blood on the snow her voice was rising in pitch oh yvgeny dont leave me dont leave me im here mother irina said her palm stroked her mothers brow nothing can take me away from you yes the old woman was calmer now yes thats the way it should be of course a boy needs his mother beside him to take care of him to protect him from the harm others might do to him my yvgeny her eyes closed again and in a moment she was asleep her head nodding soft and warm against the palm of irinas hand irina stared at her sleeping mother for a long time in slumber she was so peaceful her face suffused with the carefree peace of a child how much like a child she was now in her old age the circle closing for an instant irina allowed herself to come back from behind the mirror from the blackness of her other reality into the all too familiar horror of this reality and she saw in the curve of her mothers lips the line of her nose and brow the qualities she liked in her own face but she did not see her own destiny there the ending of her life instead she became acutely aware of the branching of her fate she saw how she had stumbled off the path that had been set for her and then less clumsily had begun her journey to the other side of the mirror the flesh may be the same she thought but the desires that animate us are so disparate she thought then of what natasha had said where did i come from my mother my father my grandparents most people know i know irina thought but it makes no difference i am like natasha an orphan now my mother no longer knows who i am i am dead to hereven worse i have never existed irina could remember her grandmother splashed with thick lemon light bustling about a kitchen warm with heat and good smells there was always a bit of food on the tip of babushkas finger for irina to taste and when irina begged for moreas she invariably did babushka would laugh scoop up some more blow on it to cool it sufficiently before offering it to her granddaughter irina remembered her grandmother as a strong woman in the way soviet peasant women are strong stolid beefycheeked hands as hard as concrete with all the life sparkling in her eyes irina did not remember her as smelling of boiled potatoes and cabbage even when she was rocked against her grandmothers ample bosom when her belly full of babushkas delicious cooking she fell asleep to songs from babushkas youth in the summer there was an emeraldgreen grasshopper who lived by the hearth irinas father was forever trying to kill it but babushka kept it safe or so she told irina grasshoppers are good luck especially in the kitchen babushka had said they talk to you yes its true little one grasshoppers tell you when its time to sow and when its time to reap your crops grasshoppers are very valuable when babushka died everything changed irinas father was transferred to a more modern nuclear plant so the family moved to moscow irina who had made something of a pet of the grasshopper who lived by the hearth had tried to take it with her but it had not survived the trip but then again in moscow there were no crops to sow or reap the afternoon sunlight was red as it squeezed through the slats in her mothers oneroom apartment the young student whom irina had hired to take care of her mother came in from shopping the lines are so long one might as well camp out in the streets she said piling her meager packages beside the sink and then the shops are out of anything one wants to buy she shook her head theres really little point in shopping anymore shes worse irina said dont blame me the student said stowing what food she had bought in the tiny refrigerator and cupboards her medicine is in short supply she began to boil water for tea but to be truthful i cant see that the pills are doing her any good its clear she has no idea where she is or whats happening around her if you ask me shed be better off dead no ones asking you irina snapped i only meant that this is no way for a human being to live the student said hastily she poured boiling water over loose black russian caravan tea waited for the cut leaves to settle to the bottom have you ever eaten a pizza irina asked impulsively what she looked into the students dull face trying to see any hint of the spark she had seen in so many of the young faces lining the streets of cambridge nothing she said drink your tea its all right i dont blame you shes just worse thats all everythings worse the student said turning away and irina glancing from the student to her mother nodding in the rocker thought of the grasshopper that had lived by her hearth i am in a vise she thought that is slowly squeezing the life out of me i must take some action before there are no seasons left for me to sow or reap the revelation hit her like a rifle shot all at once she understood why it was so important for her to find white star it wasnt to help mars and it wasnt to get back at valeri although those motivations were still in play she needed to get to white star for herself irina knew the answer to her feelings of imprisonment freedom freedom not from people but from the oppressive life in russia which despite all her attempts to lie to herself she could no longer abide and for her freedom could mean only one thing white star the underground nationalist movement was her one chance to find her way to america to cambridge where every form of idea theory and philosophy was freely expressed embraced or rejected as the individual saw fit it was white star and white star alone irina saw now that could get her back to paradise there she is mars volkov said from the interior of his black chaika pick her up he was speaking into a mobile phone and when he gave the order three plainclothes men stepped out of the shadows two moved to either side of natasha mayakova pinioning her wrists the third moved behind her what is this natasha said astonished what do you want kgb said the plainclothes man behind her keep calm mars watched natashas eyes go wide with fear when the man whispered in her ear there was a measure of satisfaction to be gained by that as if fear were a form of energy that could be ingested like food marss men brought natasha to the chaika the door opened and with a stiff hand behind her neck they pushed her inside one of the plainclothes men sat in the back so that she was sandwiched between him and mars the man who had whispered in her ear climbed into the passengers seat in front and the chaika took off mars natasha said struggling to gain her equilibrium you neednt have been so melodramatic where are you taking me the lubyanka it was interesting mars thought to see how her brave face began to crumble they all did it in different ways his subjects but like a catalogue of petty sins there was an underlying correlation that bound them all together youve been a bad girl natasha im quite cross with you what gives you the right to speak to me as if you were my father this gives me the right mars said sending the back of his hand across her face in a stinging blow that sent natashas head whipping back against the seat back my god she gasped you animal were both animals natasha mars said you and i he watched the blood seep from the cut in her skin just below her cheekbone he thought the flash of color did her good you are gnawing at the underbelly of the state but there are rules to be observed the state demands obedience from one and all i as well as you if one day i am found wanting as you have been i too will wind up in the lubyanka what a load of shit natasha said you and i are like night and day you are kgb are you surprised i know the hero told me but how he knew i cant imagine locked away like a prisoner or a laboratory experiment surely you didnt tell him mars youre far too devious for that youve been hoping to be his kindly uncle havent you put your head on my shoulder old son and tell me everything thats more your style but you havent fooled the hero and you havent fooled me the foul stink of the kgb is all over you no matter how you try to hide it beneath cordiality and greasepaint like all the other members of the secret police you enjoy all the perquisites your thoroughly corrupt nature can gobble up oink oink comrade volkov i see mars said nodding as if to himself i imagine that you are still under the misapprehension that the same guardian angel who protected you when you made such a dangerous fool of yourself and us in new york city will extricate you from this situation put such fantastic thoughts from your mind natasha i am in the process of stripping your guardian angel of his power he doesnt know it yet but he is ready to take his fall from grace and as he is about to learn it is a long painful way down the black chaika turned a corner came gliding into dzerzhinsky square natashas last look at the outside world was of the place on the corner of kirov street where once had stood the church of our lady of grebvev demolished like so many houses of worship as the communists rebuilt areas of moscow in the lubyanka the kgbs fortresslike prison across dzerzhinsky square from detsky mir the worlds largest childrens store natasha mayakova was divested of her possessions stripped searched given threadbare prison togs delivered to a cell that measured eight feet in each dimension there was no window but a large light protected by a metal grill protruded like an exophthalmic eye from the center of the ceiling it was off when natasha was placed in the cell but some time afterward when she had lain down on the board that served as a bed it went on she turned toward the wall put her hands over her eyes but she could not block out the light it was very cold in the cell and natasha began to shiver she thought she should be hungry but she was not the cold made her tired but the light cut inside her closed eyelids as if prying them apart her mind refused to let her sleep but when she sat up she was abruptly dizzy and had to hold on to the board to keep from pitching headlong onto the stone floor she put her back against the wall closed her eyes she could hear the accelerated beating of her heart was aware of the blood pulsing through her veins she tucked her feet under her in an attempt to keep them warm the light went off she drifted into a light sleep an instant lateror so it seemedthe light came on again but she could not shake herself fully awake instead she lapsed into a kind of limbo that sapped her of more strength some time latershe had no idea how longshe was pulled from her cell it was done during a period when the light was out so that she was pulled out of sleep she was taken three floors up led into an interrogation room mars volkov sat behind a scarred wooden table an open dossier in front of him there were two wooden chairs in the room mars was sitting in one natasha sat in the other one stand up mars said what i said stand up he shouted so that natasha jumped to her feet you do not sit until told to do so bullshit natasha was regaining a semblance of her selfpossession she sat almost immediately she screamed leaped out of the chair as a jolt of electricity shot through her she looked down saw the wires coming up out of the floor enwrapping the chair legs i thiink youve got the seating arrangements wrong natasha said sit mars told her if you feel you have to natasha remained standing do you see he said smiling hungrily how easy it is to get you to do what i want i dont have to use electricity or rubber truncheons or even threats natasha sat its a miracle you can live with yourself she studied him no i was wrong its not a miracle its an abomination are you hungry mars asked he seemed absorbed in the open dossier in front of him and his refusal to engage her directly had the effect of making her will seem nonexistent where is your uniform colonel natasha said pressing on because she suspected that to be silent now was tantamount to giving up mars ignored her if you do not answer my question i will assume that you have no use for food are you certain you wouldnt be more comfortable with the kgb rank boards on your shoulders no food then mars ticked off a box on the top sheet of the dossier turned to the next page what is your relationship with valeri denysovich bondasenko valeri is my brother mars looked up he seemed genuinely startled your brother did i say brother i meant lover mars frowned which is it brother or lover both mars put aside his pen folded his hands one over the other natasha with the kind of heightened sense that often comes in such lifethreatening situations noticed with revulsion how his small ears made him look more like a beast than a movie idol natasha mars said carefully i assure you that talking with me will be far more preferable to the alternatives my alternatives natasha said are life or death now mars smiled out there in the streets of moscow i would be inclined to agree with you but you are here now with me and please believe me when i say that there are other alternatives to answering my questions all of them are extremely unpleasant unpleasant i take it is the current kgb euphemism for painful why are you bent on making this difficult for yourself natasha said i am only doing what i have to do i can see in your eyes natasha how frightened you are oh yes im exceedingly frightened but that will hardly change my mind mars stared at her for some time what is your relationship with valeri denysovich bondasenko valeri is my brother or my lover or both mars flipped over another page and what is your relationship with the hero oh theres no doubt there im fucking his brains out the vulgarity hardly suits you natasha now now mars your prudishness is showing are you providing the hero with access to official government limited distribution documents i m an actor mars not a spy natasha do you know what the penalty for spying is if its being incarcerated in this shithole for the rest of my life id rather die thank you very much mars nodded all right he said ive done what i can you certainly have mars pressed a buzzer on the underside of the table its time for the hard man he said to no one in particular natasha was so frightened she had been on the verge of vomiting throughout the interrogation she had always known what consequences her actions might bring she thought she had been prepared for them but like the death of a parent she reflected now one can never truly prepare for the reality of this kind of nightmare it was odd she thought how disorienting being without a semblance of time could be without watch or clock without a window to know whether it was dark or light let alone the hour with the random switching on and off of the cell light she had already lost an important guidepost to reality she had entered a new realm where time did not seem to exist had she been picked up an hour ago or half a day she tried to work it out but could not and this loss frightened her even more but she knew that she must never show her fear to mars if she did she knew with a profound conviction that he would eat her alive here comes the hard man natashas head snapped up and she saw to her horror an ugly darkhaired man approaching her with a hypodermic needle no she cried but the needle had already pierced the flesh of her arm the plunger was depressed and a moment afterward an uncomfortable icy chill slipped through her like a wraith natashas spirit convulsed as if already in torment kunio michitas not at home yen yasuwara was in a panic he put down the receiver of the car phone perhaps thats the way you planned it big ezoe said no no yen yasuwara threw a fearful look kois way i know i can find him his brow furrowed why dont we try kaijin both big ezoe and koi were familiar with kaijin they knew yen yasuwara meant kaijin ni kisuru which was the full name of one of tokyos most exclusive tea houses it was an afterhours place but unlike most akochochin it clung tenaciously to the older more sedate term so that a facade of respectability could be maintained nevertheless its name loosely translated meant to be reduced to ashes to burn to the ground which had nothing at all to do with drinking tea kaijin was in shimbashi and without a word big ezoe turned the mercedes around headed there like most of japans exclusive and expensive clubs kaijin had a wholly unprepossessing exterior all that was visible in fact was an oversized door made of thick vertical kyoki wood slabs bound in handbeaten iron though the door was obviously very old it glowed bespeaking the care lavished on it local legend had it that this was the original door from the first shogun ieyasu tokugawas castle keep in fact the truth was unknown as was typical of a country where much of its history was oral japanese scholars found it impossible to discern fact from myth stone steps were guarded by a pair of gnarled dark green hinoki cypresses trimmed to resemble fantastic creatures a buzzer one pressed sounded deep within kaijins heart and it might be many minutes until the door was opened and then unless one was known by sight or was accompanied by a member one would not gain entrance thus were the elite of japan guarded against any unwanted intrusion keeping a handkerchief to the side of his face yen yasuwara rang the buzzer waiting impatiently on kaijins doorstep when the front door at last opened inward a voice from the darkness inside said welcome mr yasuwara two guests this evening yen yasuwara nodded mumbled something unintelligible as he stumbled over the threshold the kind of silence that enfolded the interior of kaijin was sepulchral almost holy as if one had entered the innards of a church lights were few what there was of them created indirect pools across whitewashed stone walls on which hung scrolls so ancient they depicted landscapes from china rather than japan this stark rather cold shell was in direct contrast to the furniture in the rooms which was sybaritic long leather couches with sensuously curved backs plush chairs wide enough to accommodate two luxurious chaise longues across which were thrown animal peltsall contributed to the bizarre almost schizophrenic interior design mr michita is expecting us yen yasuwara said to a heavyset man with a scar on the lobe of one misshapen ear the man looked from the young lawyer to his two companions and back again then he nodded this way he said beckoning to them mr michita is taking tea in the green room each environment within kaijin was named for a different color which corresponded to either its design or location the green room happened to be set as a traditional tea house overlooking a minuscule but dense interior garden though the garden was surrounded by walls on all sides its design and tiered lustiness fooled the eye into believing that one was at some countryside ryokan where in the distance wooded slopes stretched away into the distance they were led down a hallway with polished wood floors the walls were painted a molded pewter and beige to resemble the plastercracked walls of an ancient villa more facade to fool the eye koi noted that they were taken past seven ricepaper and ashwood fusuma doors all were closed she paused outside each one pressed her fingertips against the rice paper to see if she could pick up any minute vibrations that either movement or conversation would impart she felt nothing and yet she fell farther and farther behind once she glanced over her shoulder what was bothering her perhaps it was that the man with the misshapen ear had made no comment concerning the condition of the side of yen yasuwaras face perhaps it was because he did not seek the identity of yasuwaras guests but most of all she did not trust yen yasuwara the three men had stopped outside the sliding fusuma to the green room and koi hurried to catch up when the man with the misshapen ear put his hand on the door koi stopped him ill do that she said and before he had a chance to refute her she whipped the fusuma back and slammed the heel of her hand into the small of yen yasuwaras back catapulting him into the green room nothing happened the man with the misshapen ear stared at koi and turning around inside the room yen yasuwara did the same big ezoe ignored them both he was looking at kunio michita who sitting crosslegged on the tatami mats had twisted around what is the meaning of this michita said in a voice of flint ill tell you big ezoe said as he stepped across the threshold koi heard the soft phut saw big ezoes body stagger backward into the hallway he fell to his knees his eyes were turning upward in their sockets and there was blood on his chest where his frantically pumping heart was sending it through the hole made by the bullet from the silenced gun koi did not step into the trap so carefully laid out for them she saw that she could no longer help big ezoe grabbed the man with the misshapen ear pushed him hard into the green room and took off back down the pewter and beige hallway behind her hitasura stepped carefully over big ezoes body smiling on the corpses opaque eyes in his hand was a beretta one shot he said thats all it takes to silence anyone then russell slade was beside him saying ive got to get back to tori hitasura nodded three of hitasuras men rushed from the green room down the hall thats right hitasura told them still staring at big ezoe with satisfaction track her down then make quite sure you kill her but it was clear that he had already found the most important measure of his revenge comrade volkov is incapable of any real form of understanding what did odysseus mean by that all of a sudden it seemed important for irina to find out she felt like methuselah stirring from a centuriesold sleep her brain still not at full speed still partly cobwebbed moving through a world she had not made of which she would never be fully a part using the key valeri had given her irina let herself into his apartment on kirov street it was silent there was the smell of boiling cabbage down the hall and irina quickly shut the door behind her she went methodically through the apartment looking in all the rooms in the closets as well feeling somewhat foolish but less anxious for all that when she had determined the place was empty she paused at the bedroom window that overlooked the church of the archangel gabriel she knelt then bowed her head made the sign of the cross she said a little prayer then rose turned away am concerned by your dependence on men seeing the future as the past irina thought of the devastation visited on her family when her father had been taken away by the kgb how are we to live her mother had wailed holy mother protect us irinas mother did not sit around the house for long however a week after her husband was taken from her she dressed in her best clothing went out day after day irina assumed she was petitioning the state for the release of lrinas father later when her father did not return she assumed her mother had found a job as it turned out irinas mother was far more pragmatic than irina could have imagined because one day she came home with a man and introduced him to irina and yvgeny pavel was a short glowering man of partial lithuanian descent he was a hod carrier and his bulging muscles and hulking posture frightened irina pavel was only recently widowed irinas mother told her and he was very sad irinas mother had determined to provide pavel with a new family though irinas mother said nothing of this irina understood immediately from her mothers demeanor that it was vital that they all do their best to make pavel happy and content so that he would not leave them yvgeny older than irina by four years reacted badly to another mans presence in his fathers house he was twelve an age of rebellion yvgeny was by nature a rebel anyway and pavels presence merely served to drive him further along that path so that he began to disappear evenings staying out most of the night irinas mother was so visibly distraught that once or twice pavel went out after yvgeny bringing him forcibly back but after yvgeny set fire to pavels shoes in the process almost burning down the apartment pavel gave up hes not my son he said with a shrug why should he listen to anything i tell him but he will get into trouble irinas mother said wringing her hands hes already in trouble pavel said but you cant chain him to the bedpost dear god he needs his father pavel got up and left the room irinas mother and pavel were married some weeks later that event hardly helped matters with yvgeny who did not show up for the ceremony during the next months irinas mother spent more and more time at church praying for her son irina found pavel to be kind but dullwitted he had no ambition seemed unaware in fact that a world existed beyond the confines of moscow irina remembered him coming through the door each night white with concrete dust she used to watch him at the kitchen sink while she was preparing his dinner meticulously washing the flesh beneath his fingernails free of ground red brick his hands were so large they seemed swollen and when she ran her fingers over his palms they felt like slabs of wood he was invariably gentle with her though he spoke very little mumbling something unintelligible when she set his dinner before him irina would watch him eat longing for him to say something or even look at her but he seemed totally absorbed with eating as if he would die if he did not cram every bit of food on his plate into his mouth as quickly as possible one night when irina was alone with him she chanced to pass the bedroom and saw pavel undressing through the partly open door he had his back to her and as he raised his shirt over his head she stifled a gasp the ridged muscles of his curved back were disfigured by the crisscrossing of many scars they were not new but the cuts had been so deep that they never healed properly hearing her pavel whirled around stared hard irina was terrified that he would be angry at her but instead pavel sat down on the end of the bed held out his hand to her irina walked hesitantly into the bedroom she saw her mothers wood and gilt icon on the wall over the headboard the cheap prints of the russian countryside her father had loved so dearly the rocker that was always babushkas when the family had lived outside moscow pavel took irinas hand in his scarred callused ones have i frightened you koshka i am sorry i am not a handsome man i know i am lucky to have found your mother most women would not look at me my first wife used to mock me but i like to think she loved me nonetheless he frowned do you understand this no perhaps not he shrugged well it has nothing to do with the scars on my back except that when my father used to beat me hed say you beast you monster you cannot be mine what nightmare did you come from oh how awful irina had cried in a way it was pavel said softly but only in a way you see i was happy to take my fathers anger because i knew that then he would leave my mother alone on the nights when he would come home drunk and couldnt find me hed start on my mother i can still hear her screams oh but they were terrible they would make me weep my brothers would huddle together in the far corner of our room but i would go out into the hall because i had to help her pavels eyes were turned inward and at last there was a spark in them one night i couldnt stand it anymore i ran into the kitchen grabbed a carving knife and you killed him irinas eyes were opened wide pavels eyes returned to the present focusing on her no no koshka my father took the knife out of my hand and whipped me oh how it hurt but i had stopped him from beating my mother and that was a good feeling i cant describe how good what happened to them my parents my father died of a liver disease brought on by his drinking but that was three years after my mother had died that time must have been bad bad yes very bad pavel looked at her then impulsively hugged her to him but do not think of these evil things koshka i am here to protect you and your mother pavel had kept his promise for as long as he had lived but he it seemed like irinas father was in a hazardous profession he developed acute emphysema from the quantities of harsh dust he inhaled each day on the job by then yvgeny was dead and the family spinning helplessly out of control fell apart irinas mother was not good at taking care of himshe was not even capable of taking care of her own children irina stared now at the church of the archangel gabriel where her mother had taken her so often abruptly it too seemed alien part of another time another place a sanctuary for another irina not this woman who stood here at last breaking free of her memories her rage at the helplessness of being a child and far worse a female child set adrift in a world made for men all this emotional baggage seemed removed a distant report like thunder booming far off diminishing with each moment white star irina turned back into the apartment somewhere in here she thought there must be some hint of the information valeri held on the nationalist group she crept carefully through every inch of his closets looking in the pockets of his trousers and suit jackets opening unmarked boxes sifting through piles of linen old photographs at his desk she leafed through official papers personal correspondence blank paper her exposure to the films of james bonda favorite of the students she knewwhile she was in america had taught her to look behind pictures hung on the walls inside the medicine cabinet in the bathroom in the living room she unzipped slipcovers got down on all fours running her hand around the bottom part of the furniture frames she ended up in the kitchen peering inside metal canisters of flour sugar and tea to make sure there wasnt some bit of paper secreted there all her sleuthing came to nothing she sat wearily down in a dinette chair stared blankly at the dark screen of the toshiba laptop an hour and a half of combing through valeris apartment and nothing to show for it sitting here alone reminded her of all the mornings she had sat in this very spot watching valeri prepare wonderful breakfasts in the winter it was always warm in here as it had been in babushkas kitchen the mouthwatering smells irresistible it was difficult if not impossible for irina to reconcile this image of valeriand the one of the man so tender and loving in bed with the knowledge that valeri was a colonel in the kgb she recalled his saying that the kgbs new accountability to the congress of peoples deputies had changed nothing it had merely swept kgb operatives further underground she shuddered the computer screen witness to everything repository of all truths sat silent and dead mocking her all of a sudden she recalled an american film called charade she had seen in the small cambridge art theater and she began to look for anything in plain sight that would be so familiar the eye would automatically pass over it then her eyes focused and jumping up irina whispered my god it has been visible all the time she turned on the toshiba she was familiar with the software valeri had had installed quickly she got a list of the directories on the hard disk but nothing looked sinister in fact all that came up were recipe files she looked for macroshidden strings of commands activated by a double keystrokebut could find none her excitement faded well naturally she thought sourly this isnt a movie of course valeri could have the white star material secreted on a hidden floppy disk but she had been all through the apartment without turning up anything then a fragment of a recent conversation surfaced how do you find time to get all those recipes in memory she had asked valeri and he had replied i get some help theres a ghost in the machine irina approached the computer again and this time pressed the reveal codes key nothing she frowned she had been so sure that valeris ghost would have been in reveal codes an invisible mark held in the text text what an idiot i am she thought she cleared the screen retrieved the first text file in the directory a menu for southern fried chicken came up irina hit the reveal codes and there it was hanging at the very top of the screen three consecutive signs for underline that had no business being there she went back to the text then holding her breath she hit the underline key three times in succession nothing damn now what those three underlines must mean something she returned to the reveal codes screen hit the underline key three times the please wait message appeared in the lower lefthand corner of the screen that meant the computer was pulling an unusually large file out of the harddrive memory irinas heart skipped a beat a moment later the computer began to spew out an enormous list of food menus the file kept scrolling until irina hit the scroll lock key then the screen held steady irina studied the menu but could find nothing amiss with it it was what it appeared to be a menu for some kind of frozen dessert in disgust she depressed the scroll lock key but instead of continuing to scroll the screen went black and again the message please wait appeared times dates places names when the new text came up on the screen irinas heart leaped in her chest because she was looking at what appeared to be the inner workings of white star with hitasuras men all over the city looking for us i cant afford a facetoface rendezvous big ezoe had said early that morning there is a way to get information from my informants its safe and utterly undetectable koi was in shibuya it was just after eleven at night still she was surrounded by such masses of people that she could not see the street the sky was a yellowgray the air as opaque as miso soup and it came as no surprise when the electronic pollution billboard near the nhk buildingone of fifteen in tokyomonitoring the levels of carbon monoxide nitrogen and sulphur oxides began to issue an alert advising children the elderly and the infirm to stay indoors i refuse to sit in my office or in my car waiting for a hitasura hit team to blow me apart big ezoe had said hitasura is not so oldfashioned that he will kill me only with his own sword thats for the old days and the old days are alive only on movie screens not his sword koi thought his gun what a world she thought if honor was dead what use was living outside the seed building koi stopped at the public message center this was her third pass since she had come here by a circuitous route she had doubled back many times using the subways and the crowds in the streets to keep herself free of the hit team hitasura had sent after her the public message center consisted of six ctr monitors connected to a sophisticated interactive computer program using an electronic pen she touched the box marked read the screen changed showing a list of four functions she touched number which read message to your friends with secret word the screen asked her to enter the code word on each pass before this nothing had happened she wrote kami with the electronic pen the code word big ezoe had told her about and the screen changed once again this time a handwritten message appeared it said deke the tattooer shinjuku koi immediately touched the eraser bar and the message disappeared into the electronic heart of the machine a moment later koi too disappearedinto the electronic heart of the city the first thing i want to ask you the said when irina slipped into the pool with him is whether volkov is with you he had taken her out to the middle of the pool where the listening devices could not pick up their speech i came alone this time irina said staring at him do you know where volkov is no he doesnt tell me everything the looked at her curiously for some time what is it irina said uncomfortable beneath the intensity of that otherworldy gaze i am wondering what you see in him in mars yes irina noticed that arbat was restless but she swam back and forth at the other end of the pool as if she had no intention of coming near them i said that i wouldnt lie to you irina said and i meant it i have no family mars does hes made me part of it and i like that it makes me feel secure i dont understand wasnt i making myself clear the shook his head its just that i cant see any way that the kgb can make you feel secure oh youre talking about valeri valeri who irina laughed valeri denysovich bondasenko colonel in the kgbs second chief directorate chief of department n in charge of counterintelligence against the nationalist underground organization white star for a breathless moment nothing seemed to move not arbat not the hero not the water in which they floated in the silence that built itself like a spiderweb in the room irina imagined that a black abyss of immense proportions had opened up beneath her and that she was in the process of falling into it what have i said her heart beat on seemingly the only motion in a place where even time had given up the ghost at last when the silence had become so agonizing that irina was about to scream the hero said who told you about department n why mars did and he said that comrade bondasenko was in charge of it no mars showed me a document it was a charter i think department ns internal kgb charter it named valeri as the departments chief you dont know the hero closed his eyes mother of god arbat perhaps in response to his inner turmoil popped up next to him but she wisely kept silent she looked at irina with what could only be described as astonishment what is it irina said in a strangled voice the hero looked at her and irina did not know whether she saw pity or anger in his eyes perhaps it was both or neither perhaps it was some other emotion one that he had learned in the space between the stars how best to put this he said slowly i suppose he said continuing his inner dialogue there is no best way there is only to do it arbat clicked briefly and he nodded irina the monitoring that is done on me here is scientific but it is also overseen by the kgb lara and tatiana are kgb they are my handlers as well as my companions twice a week i am interrogated by a highranking colonel in the kgb do you want me to see if i can stop it perhaps mars irina mars is the kgb for a moment irina was certain that she had misheard him then it occurred to her that he was making a joke but there was no smile on his grave face and arbat was silently watching her from the other side of the pool youre joking she said feeling more and more foolish its impossible mars showed me documents that they were false the said forcefully or i should say more accurately they were falsified ive no doubt the document itself is the real department n charter its the name of its chief thats been changed the original bears the name mars petrovich volkov colonel second chief directorate no its impossible ill call for lara and tatiana let them verif no she could see the truth in his eyes his fear for her dont move dont do a thing irina remembered the night she and mars had gone to see the performance of chekhovs three sisters mars saying to her the actress natasha something isnt it and then later when he had come upon her here in star town after shed followed natasha to the heros building from moscow and wondered why shed been following natasha irina had asked him you know her and mars had said certainty i know everyone who goes into that building irina hung suspended beneath her the abyss waited only for her to finish her fall to close over her suffocating her in its immense black belly god in heaven she was trembling all over abruptly she began to gag and the turned her hoisting her up so that she vomited onto the coping of the pool he gave a piercing whistle and almost immediately lara appeared your comrade volkov has claimed another victim the said to her lara came to the side of the pool pulled irina out she lay her by the side then went to get materials to clean up the mess are you all right the asked irina arbat poked her head out of the water pressing her bottle snout against irinas shoulder no irina said im not in the least all right she sat up as lara knelt beside her she opened her mouth but the hero put his forefinger across his lips pointed to his ear as if to say remember the listening devices lara turned on a portable wetvac the noise ate up the silence of the room how long have you been working for the kgb irina asked the young woman all my life lara said tatiana as well we were orphans wards of the state we were raised by the kgb trained in their schools how long have you been working for mars tatiana and i are part of the team comrade volkov put together when he was given the assignment of finding out what went on during the eva event she kept on scrubbing not long ago odysseus was able to procure for us our kgb dossiers tatiana and i discovered who we were who our parents had been tatiana is estonian her parents were killed in a nuclear accident of suspicious origin the kgb file mentions negligence a complete coverup of the incident she sponged more soapy water onto the coping worked the wetvac back and forth as for me im ukrainian my parents were sent to the perm political prison in the urals what was their crime irina asked i dont know lara said their dossiers say that the kgb arrested them for espionage for talking to american diplomatic personnel but that is a euphemistic catchall charge it means nothing in itself perhaps my parents didnt know why they were arrested either perhaps it was because my father was a professor of political science and held strong views at odds with the state or perhaps the state just needed more wards to bring up as they saw fit the truth in these matters is impossible to determine so i try not to dwell on it do you at least know whether they are alive or dead no no one knows but someone must irina said i think comrade volkov knows the hero interjected but hes not telling irina said to lara youre awfully open about all this not to everyone lara finished her cleanup but kept the wetvac running the hero said i think to some extent lara and tatiana have been changed by their proximity to me lara nodded we find it prudent not to report everything that we hear at our weekly debriefings irina said to the hero i see that you have been quietly assembling your own team in a way the hero said volkov thought he could win my confidence by disconnecting all the listening devices in the room but he was wearing a body mike the next time he came i forced him into the pool and while he was with me lara made a copy of the cassette he had on him would you care to hear it there are all sorts of it was then that irina felt an icy stab through her heart a wave of panic so strong that all the blood drained from her face irina what is it she looked into the heros eyes pale now with anxiety oh odysseus you dont know what ive been doing ive been spying on natasha mayakova ive told mars everything how natasha has been secretly meeting with valeri how i followed natasha here after she and valeri met my god what have i done in the ringing silence that ensued only the wetvacs drone could be heard then the hero turned to lara said make the call her eyes were wide she was clearly startled are you certain now lara obeyed when natasha failed to make their next scheduled rendezvous valeri drove out to arkhangelskoe as fast as he could without attracting attention he did not take his usual route and he made sure he wasnt being followed all the way out to the insane asylum he thought of the sinking feeling he had gotten as he waited for natasha in the lobby of the old moscow arts theater it was still with him and it was accelerating natasha was absolutely reliable on the one occasion when she could not make their rendezvous she had used the deadletter drop at the international post office in kohisomolskaya square he had described to her before every rendezvous valeri went to the post office box there to make sure there was no message from her there had been none today and she hadnt made the scheduled rendezvous he could not ask about her at the old moscow arts theater without calling attention to himself so he had left fearing the worst then at the public phone bank at the post office he had called her apartment a man had answered in an officious voice his blood turned to ice valeri put down the receiver as if it had turned into a serpent all the way out to arkhangelskoe valeri was thinking like a chess player three four five steps ahead he was moderately successful in keeping his mind free of natasha because surely she was lost to him now and there were larger issues at stake something natasha knew and accepted when he had recruited her because her beliefs coincided with his she had made herself into a professional but as he well knew even professionals had their breaking points it was a question of time now if the kgb had picked her upwhich it appeared they had they would break her no question it was merely a matter of how long before she broke there was no blame here valeri knew that were he in natashas position he too would eventually break tell them everything he knew everything they wanted to hear there would be no shame in it only the secret knowledge of how many more lives would be saved by holding out that much longer before the will gave out and the damaging information began to flow he arrived in arkhangelskoe free of ticks and skirted the magnificent estate the birch forest but he did not park in the lot outside the insane asylum instead he pulled into a badly rutted dirt track that cut diagonally through the forest and switched off the ignition he sat listening to the ticking of the hot engine the bluebirds and cardinals sang in the trees the insects droned and whirred life went on here no different than it had the day before than it would the day after if only that were true for valeri bondasenko valeri pulled open the locked glove compartment extracted the handgun it was of west german manufacture and extremely reliable he slid it into the waistband of his trousers it was uncomfortable there but that was good he thought as he began his nerveracking trek toward the grim victorian facade of the insane asylum it would remind him of what had to be done now he took out a slender switchblade with a long wicked blade he tested the action of the blade then strapped the knife in its sheath to the inside of his wrist if he was expecting a contingent of kgb border guards to have surrounded the place he was mistaken by the time he arrived near the front steps he had almost convinced himself that natasha was still holding on that she hadnt spilled everything in her mind into their laps he said a little prayer as he turned away from the main lobby entering the building through the rear service doors he was immediately hit by the familiar noxious odors but he was too concerned to be repelled he went quickly up the south staircase to the third floor he stood just outside the door to the floor corridor peering through the meshed square of glass in a moment he saw a plainclothes man coming in his direction valeri ducked back into the stairwell the man passed by the door and valeri watched him as he went into his daughters room his heart sank natasha was as good as dead she had told them everything she knew poor natasha the only good news for him was that it appeared that she had just been broken otherwise all entrances would have been guarded the place would have been surrounded time was running away he knew that the border guards contingent must be on its way valeri opened the door looked first to his left the direction from which the kgb man had come the corridor was clear in that direction but to his right another kgb man stood guard outside his daughters room his heart thundering in his chest valeri ventured out into the corridor he walked directly up to the kgb man said im looking for dr kalinin have you seen him the kgb man opened his mouth to reply and valeri depressed the stud that opened the switchblade shoved the blade between the mans third and fourth ribs in a slight upward tilt so that the blade pierced his heart the kgb mans jaws snapped together as he collapsed into valeris arms valeri dragged him quickly across the corridor parking him just inside the door to a room occupied by a comatose woman in her eighties he went through the kgb mans pockets taking his id folder his weapons he strode swiftly confidently back across the hall and through the door to his daughters room the second kgb man looked up said stop where you are then looked down in astonishment at the hilt of the knife buried in his chest he went down on one knee but still had the presence of mind to draw his pistol valeri kicked it out of his hand the kgb man grabbed valeris foot twisted it from the heel valeri felt himself going over and the man was upon him blood was seeping from the wound in his chest but valeri could see how his aim had been off the mans sternum had been pierced but the bone had taken the brunt of the wound his hands were around valeris throat and valeri used his knee kicking the man in his crotch pink froth flew from the kgb mans mouth and his eyes almost bugged out of his head he growled like an animal but did not relinquish his stranglehold on valeris throat his spatulate thumbs were pressing into valeris windpipe valeri used three kites to the mans rib cage felt it stave in on the third blow the man toppled to the floor valeri scrambled to his feet went to the bed gazed down at the placid face of his daughter he was never so happy to see her bending down he scooped her up stepped over the body of the fallen kgb man he peeked out into the corridor it was clear he ran to the stairwell headed downstairs it took him seven minutes to ferry his daughter out of the asylum back to where the car was hidden among the birches then he hurried back there was more to be done he skirted the building heading around back to the long sloping lawn he looked back toward the open doors to the main lobby there was the usual activity with nurses passing this way and that some with their charges in wheelchairs others shepherding slowshuffling figures in tatty robes from one corridor to another there was a clot of doctors to the left who seemed to be huddled over a chart valeri saw dr kalinin among the clot of doctors and at almost the same moment dr kalinin saw him valeri saw the doctors face go white then he began to surreptitiously edge away from his colleagues away from the spot where valeri stood valeri ran down the lawn toward the bench that overlooked the large birch tree where he always sat with his daughter it was empty he turned looked beyond the tree toward the birch forest and he saw to his horror the young man with the strawberry birthmark on his cheek running from two plainclothes men the young man was heading toward the forest but valeri could see that he was not going to make it valeri drew his pistol went down on one knee held the gun in both hands he sighted squeezed off one shot two both the kgb men fell comrade he heard the shout behind him and whirled dr kalinin had come down the back steps onto the lawn he kept shouting pointing at valeri valeri shot him dr kalinin threw his hands into the air as he spun around by the time he hit the ground face first valeri was already off and running toward the forest of birch trees he crashed into the underbrush then was within the woods the light dimmer speckled with deep shadow the rich scents of moss and humus perfumed the air halt valeri came up short hands valeri raised his hands stay right where you are or you will be shot in a moment the young man with the strawberry birthmark emerged valeri valeri put down his hands you gave me a start sergei valeris voice was filled with relief what are you doing waiting around here i wanted to make certain you got away clean sergei said that was some shooting comrade they laughed together clapping each other on the back but sergei quickly sobered what has happened come valeri said leading him through the forest the kgb picked up natasha but how how could they know about her if there is a leak of such proportions were finished valeri found the rutted dirt track followed it back toward where he had hidden his car lets not get ahead of ourselves he said but sergei could see the concern on his face this is volkovs doing sergei said i can smell his duplicity from a mile away he shuddered that charm of his how many people he has gulled and of course that was when valeri thought of irina deke was no problem he was a scientist not a hero koi left him hanging by his ankles in the lab at the back of his tattoo parlor his face was purple bloated beyond any easy recognition but it looked a good sight better than did his body twentytwo minutes koi thought as she emerged into the teeming nighttime streets of shinjuku from the time i walked in there she had been fascinated by the smells in the lab formaldehyde sulfuric acid acetone they spoke to her of death and destruction by increments breaking down the building blocks of life one at a time she had used some of these substances on deke rubbing them into his skin as if she were in the process of pickling him koi rode the subways advertisements everywhere on long cards overhead on banners hanging at eye level even on the straps standing passengers held on to while the train was in motion koi read them all but they were meaningless to her she was outside of time traveling down her own dark tunnel even as the train she was riding snaked through the tunnels beneath the city her mind was empty her expression approaching the one of the mask of the god that had so entranced big ezoe the combination of ecstasy and despair but not yet she emerged onto the street near hammacho station the killing ground in her mind a roll of thunder big ezoe saying we must punish hitasura for his transgressions against members of my family we must destroy tori nunn for her part in all this she murdered fukuda deke had told her how tori nunn and a man named russell slade had come to him with a pellet he had identified as hafnium they had returned later along with hitasura the two men were carrying tori nunn according to deke she had been poisoned by a complex organic doku a toxin usually lethal whose main elements had been distilled from monkshood and the poison in fugu japanese blowfish fortunately for tori nunn she had been exposed to a very small amount of the doku that combined with her own inner resources had prevented her from dying immediately deke had prevented her from dying at all according to him she was recuperating in one of hitasuras safehouses near hammacho station deke had not wanted to give koi the address but she had finally persuaded him by that time he had looked like meat ready for the slaughter koi found the house with little difficulty it was one of those expensive postmodern ferroconcrete structures angular minimalist higher than it was wide with windows inset like those of a medieval castle and a heavy iron gate fronting a tiny courtyard dominated by a slender cryptomeria tree a bonsaied dwarf juniper a powerful grouping of rocks provided the negative space and thus made the courtyard appear far larger than it actually was she spent fortyfive minutes watching the house from all angles noting who walked by and what cars passed on the street in front of it parking on this street was nonexistent no one was loitering about but she knew that hitasuras men must be hidden somewhere she understood that she must solve that puzzle before she could confront the one waiting for her inside the house how to kill tori nunn less than an hour after she had arrived in the vicinity koi spotted the first of hitasuras street men it had taken him quite a while to make a second circuit of the block which meantas she suspectedhe was not the only one guarding the house koi watched his movements thought with a little luck she could avoid him her instinct from the moment she saw the house was to get to the roof and now an hour later the roof was still her first choice the front door was out of the question and when she had made her way around to the rear of the house there was a vehicle with two of hitasuras men stationed at the back entrance besides for security reasons hitasura was sure to have put tori nunn on a top floor two more of hitasuras men were waiting for her on the roof they heard her only when she was very close to them she broke one mans neck instantly but the other one she saw was going to be a bit of a problem he was a bull of a man with a bald head and an evil look in his eyes he grinned at her ignoring his fallen comrade he beckoned for koi to come to him instead she melted into the shadows on the rooftop the bald man looked around then unfurled a kyotetsushoge a particularly nasty weapon composed of a chain with a spiked ball on one end a curved doubleedged blade on the other he began to whirl the spiked ball around as he made for the spot where she had disappeared when he reached the shadows koi had had sufficient time to work her way around behind him she leaped at him slamming her elbow into his side then locking her forearm across his throat it was a mistake the huge man bit into the flesh of her forearm with such force that his front teeth scraped the bone koi stifled a cry whirled off him the bald man swung his weapon at her and she rolled as the spiked ball slammed into the tarred roof where she had just been immediately it struck and missed he reacted arcing the doubleedged blade down at the spot between her eyes koi swung left with her head kicked right with her feet the soles of her shoes cracked the bald mans shins just below the knees his legs buckled he reached out instinctively to break his fall and koi took up the doubleedged blade of his kyotetsushoge and slashed his throat now she had the roof all to herself the thick layer of industrial smog that had caused the pollution alert blurred the lights of the city running the colors together so that tokyo seemed embedded inside a giant clamshell the sky was the largest sheet of motherofpearl she had ever seen from up here she had a good view of the hammacho station itself where so many customers embarked and debarked each day the overhead rail lines shone like quicksilver as a train pulled into the station crowds surged forward koi turned away she tore a piece off the bald mans shirt wrapped it tightly around her forearm to stop the bleeding when she was satisfied she took a careful look around her immediate environment there was a small raised ferroconcrete structure in which was set the metal door down into the house but she did not want to use it too vulnerable if she were caught in the narrow stairwell there would only be one way to go back to the roof and that could all too easily prove to be a deathtrap on the other hand all the windows were illuminated by the streetlights making it far too risky to seek entrance through any of them but during her initial reconnaissance she had spent some time studying the facade of the house and thought she had noticed a vulnerable point a small pebbledglass window in backprobably leading into a bathroomthat was in the shadow cast by a large building opposite it was too small for a man to get through but she thought that she might be able to make it she took the kyotetsushoge walked to the rear of the roof knotting a length of nylon rope she carried around the center of the weapons chain she wrapped the kyotetsushoge around a metal flue paying the rope out slowly until she tied the other end around her waist she went over the side of the house when she got level with the pebbledglass bathroom window she braced herself by placing her feet on either side of it it was partly open but this was of no help to her since the metal frame impinged on the space she needed to crawl through she spent the next two minutes detaching the window from its hinged brackets then she slid it carefully into the bathroom followed it in it was a tight fit but she made it she untied herself from the nylon cord stood absolutely still for ten minutes while her eyes adjusted to the gloom inside she accustomed her ears to listen to the natural sounds of the house creaks doors opening closing footfalls in the hallway muffled voices no tv no radio no stereo no vcr no loud sound no doubt in deference to their sick house guest when koi was certain that she had catalogued every sound no matter how minute and that she would pick up the slightest deviation she opened the bathroom door a crack again she was still for ten minutes allowing the scents of the house to come to her while the repetition of the tiny sounds reassured her that all was as it should be she had come in on the fourth and top floor it seemed logical to her for hitasura to put tori nunn as high up as he could also that he would put her in a room as near to a bathroom as possible koi stepped out into a hallway to her right was the landing of the open iron spiral staircase down to the third floor beyond were two rooms both with their doors open both dark koi forgot them to her left was only one room the door to which was closed a crack of dim light filtered out into the hallway from the far edge which was not quite fitted into the frame still koi did not move her peripheral vision had picked up a shadow moving it crept up the open stairwell illuminated by the lamps below someone was coming up the stairs she contracted her wa stilled her breathing to the minimum she watched as the top of a mans head came into view it stopped and she could hear voices talking softly she craned her neck without otherwise moving saw the top of a shorter mans head he had been guarding the staircase but because of his lack of height she had not been able to see him from where she stood koi waited eventually the conversation ceased the shadow moved down the spiral staircase the shorter man remained at his post but he was concentrated on someone trying to come up the stairs koi slipped down the hallway to her left out of his field of vision she stood by the lone door for a long time she could hear nothing from inside the room her fingers on the door a spiders deft touch she pushed it inward koi stepped into the room it was a bedroom furnished in western style mahogany bed masculine dressers a dark red and black patterned rug covering most of the floor a mirror hung on the wall along with several modern abstract prints a lamp glowed on a night table beside the bed on kois face now spread that singular expression ecstasy and despair in the bed was the sleeping form of a woman koi drank her in the face beautiful even if her skin was still unhealthily pale her breasts rose and fell evenly from beneath the covers her long cinnamoncolored hair fanned out across the pillowcase very exotic very american tori nunn eleven tokyo tori nunn lying unconscious in the big bed in the fourthfloor bedroom of hitasuras safehouse near hammacho station was dreaming of one moment in time when she was the wild child it was nine years ago the year after she had stumbled across hitasura who had pulled her out of hiding after she and her brother greg had been involved in the death of the young yakuza three months after she had been recruited into the mall by bernard godwin the thenmanaging director of the mailand godwins right hand manwas tom royce royce was a lanky rawboned man a sunravaged texan who rolled when he walked and chewed rather than smoked small black cheroots it was easy to imagine him in a tengallon hat lassoing a dogie bernard had sent him to japan to brief tori on mall procedure and discipline in toris opinion royce was entirely the wrong man to send to japan after the first interminable week with him she cabled bernard this conviction but all the reply she received was a terse carry on youre under discipline follow orders in the end however tori was proved correct japan got to tom royce royce fancied himself a real cowboy wyatt earp when tori found him in the alley behind her apartment shot to death with his own colt pistol she was hardly surprised but she was angry this was tokyo her city and she had been charged with royces safety besides the murder had come on what was the equivalent of her back porch she knelt beside tom royces body pulled the barrel of the remington out of his throat what a way to die yakuza tori was willing to bet she went to see hitasura the yakuza oyabun was not forthcoming i do not know who killed this american hitasura said after they had had green tea and as civilized protocol demanded had spoken of many other unimportant matters but i will shed no tears for him and neither will you he added shrewdly my personal feelings for royce are unimportant tori said i was responsible for him whoever killed him knew that and threw him up into my face the american was without manners hitasura said as if he had not heard her he was loud aggressive he made passes at our women and insulted our men i would think that the suspects in his murder would be many only one person killed him tori said rising and that person must answer for the insult hitasura had poured more tea this time torisan i would think it better if you let the matter drop it is a question of honor tori said if i back away then i am worth nothing to my employers to myself hitasura said nothing and she left him pouring more tea for himself and for a guest who was no longer there over the next several weeks tori dived deep into the bowels of tokyo she wheedled cajoled threatened plied her contacts with drink nobody knew a thing about tom royces murder either that or they were involved in a conspiracy of silence it could happen for all of toris fame and the respect she was given by the japanese she was still gaijin an outsider and now trying to run down tom royces murder she came to the realization that as much as she wantedneededjapan to be her home it was not she was born caucasian and here that alone counted too heavily and irrevocably against her with a kind of relief she never thought she would feel she flew back to the states spent ten days being debriefed by bernard himself in mall central in virginia then headed west to los angeles and dianas garden ellis nunn didnt say what the hell are you doing here he didnt say anything he was on a business trip in europe greg was off on some topsecret assignment for nasa that left tori to fend for herself with her mother within a week that familiar stifling feeling had returned and tori packed her bags flew directly back to tokyo it was good to be back the city seemed scoured clean bright with nervous energy a beating heart that never faltered it didnt matter that in her absence so many buildings had been torn down others built in their stead that she hardly recognized certain districtsthat was part of tokyos uniqueness and she felt immediately at ease she threw herself back into her work but the specter of tom royces murder continued to haunt her now she could not get her interview with hitasura out of her mind what if it was one of his lieutenants who had murdered royce or even worse hitasura himself tori asked herself what she would do if the worse came to the worst would she try to bring hitasura down or would she back away as he had first suggested this was the essential question that gnawed at her the night she was at the neon starfish it was a club just this side of respectability on the outskirts of the ginza starlit with colored lights with a transparent floor beneath which lusciously colored tropical fish swam in lazy circles there were two japanese businessmen drunk on sake who she had been aware of for some time they looked as similar as bookends though one was shorter than the other they had already taken off their suit jackets hung them up on seat backs they wanted women but were apparently too drunk to make it down the block to the local akachochin where they could have their pick of the litter in return for a sum of money equal to a months paycheck instead they had begun a series of obnoxiously maudlin reports on the pathetic state of their home lives tori had just about had it with stories of their suckling at their wives teats as they had done with their mothers when as drunks are often wont to do without warning they veered off on another topic entirely now they were intent on impressing one another with tales from the office where latterday samurai as they apparently considered themselves they were rife with legends of their boardroom prowess this also proved to be boring and tori was considering changing tables to escape the white noise when the shorter man said to his pal thats nothing my boss killed a man yes yes of course its true i swear it we got drunk together last week and he told me so himself i killed an american he said a drastic resolution to a problem i said but you know my boss very oldfashioned comes from the murashitoshis ancestors it is said were samurai at the court of the first shogun ieyasu tokugawa but now he tells me that this american raped his daughter and i say did you go to the police what he said crossly and involve my poor daughter further do you think i would consider holding her up for public inspection or dragging her through the courts no no not a chance this had to be settled quickly privately absolutely i agreed yes yes i believe he did right tori moved closer to the shorter businessman and at one point in leaning over to find something in her handbag she palmed his wallet out of his inside jacket pocket she dug out one of his business cards and five minutes later slipped the wallet back without having been detected the next morning she presented herself at the executive offices of tandom polycarbon they had a dozen floors in a huge building in shinjuku and the chairmans suite was on the top floor she asked to see tok murashito but was told that the chairman was in the middle of a board meeting and furthermore would be tied up all day there was an appointment book on the secretarys burlwood desk but she did not ask tori if she wished to make an appointment tori was apparently beneath her notice tori said sweetly just tell mr murashito that tom royces sister is here to see him im afraid that murashitosan has left instructions not to be disturbed the secretary said tori leaned over the desk put her face close to the secretarys expanded her wa to its limits call him ill wait the secretary jumped as if poked with a hot fork her hand trembled as it picked up the receiver she dialed an internal number spoke briefly waited a moment then spoke again at length in a moment she hung up she seemed frightened murashitosan will see you in his office she said getting up ill show you the way the secretary led tori through thick wooden doors down a hushed carpeted corridor whose walls were covered with color blowups of microscopic views of different manmade fabrics that tandom polycarbon had designed created and patented these photographs were matted and framed like works of art tok murashito had an office that faced west and south a magnificent view that was in itself a major work of art but the inner walls of his office were adorned with a braque a schiele and a manet tori was impressed as she was meant to be both by tok murashitos wealth and his good taste fuck good taste tori thought as the secretary withdrew tok murashito made certain that she had the office to herself before he made his entrance through a discreet side door hidden within the walnut paneling that housed a wet bar a magnificent olmec head that belonged in a mexican museum and six shelves of books more suitable to a lawyers office he was shorter than the short drunk man who had spilled the beans the night before at the neon starfish but he was thicker too with the wide shoulders and upper arms of a bodybuilder the way his muscles stretched his suit he seemed to belong in a dojo or a gym rather than a boardroom the way he was built tori saw hed have to have all his clothes made to order well tok murashito said without preliminaries what is it you want okay tori thought you murdered an american named tom royce murashito didnt blink i had just cause i wonder whether the police will think so the police wont be called oh what makes you think that tok murashito walked past his desk looked out his windows it was a magnificent view but it was also a long way down murashito put his hands behind his back why would the police be called they usually are when a murder has been committed he nodded thats true in fact theyre already on the case he smiled surprised miss royce the police have been in contact with me you see we knew one another royce and i did business from time to time tori recalled tom royces cover as a textile salesman thought fronts have to be maintained in order for them to seem legitimate so you knew him she said do the police also know you had a motive tbk murashito went very still who are you he said tori ignored him you didnt report the rape of your daughter did you now an odd thing happened murashitos face changed and if tori hadnt known better she would have sworn it relaxed he turned quickly away as if embarrassed shes already endured more pain and suffering than any young woman should tori went silently up behind him she said im not tom royces sister my name is tori nunn do you know me tok murashito shook his head no im the wild child i could kill you right here and no one would know about it do you understand me tbk murashito said nothing for some time then he said youre a foolish young woman there is too much fire burning inside you go home when she did not move he turned to face her one of these days youll discover that there are alternatives far preferable to violence thats curious advice coming from you giri i did what i had to do tori looked him in the eye just as i do she said tok murashito stared at her for a long time then he shook his head time makes fools of us all miss nunn i strive to remember that but all too often it slips my mind when she said nothing he said will you kill me now if i did tori said your daughters pain would forever be on my conscience well tbk murashito said after all perhaps there is such a thing in the world as justice he never took his eyes from her tell me why did you come here miss nunn to let you know that i was here tori said to see how you would react you were testing me in a manner of speaking he passed a hand across his face i must say that this is the first time i have been tested by a woman how does it feel to be truthful it makes me uncomfortable tori nodded the traditional roles have been reversed thats not what i meant tok murashito said carefully what makes me uncomfortable is your easy acceptance of violence you think that because i am female i should hate violence that is my experience yes he shrugged someone has to fight against violence dont you think if women abandon their traditional role as peacemakers where will we be mr murashito tori said you are something of an enigma i think i shall take that as a compliment young lady tori frowned no ones ever called me young lady before well tok murashito said i think its about time they did the dream of the past began to dissolve in much the same way as a reflection of the moon on water breaks up with the coming of rain tori became aware of something dark and metallic impinging on her consciousness and she rose through the layers of sleep from delta to beta to alpha her eyes fluttered open and she saw the figure standing at the foot of the bed half illuminated by the lamp at her bedside she was far more aware of the figure than she was of her surroundings she hardly knew where she was or how she had gotten here what had happened to her slowly in patchwork fashion she remembered the nightmarish chase inside the kinjito leading to the final confrontation with fukuda but again the dark metallic rings brought her out of the well of her memories and at last she understood that what she was feeling was the expansion of the figures wa a dangerous weapon that was about to be used against her who are you koi moved closer i am fukudas spiritual sister i have come to repay you for killing her and immediately tori thought of her encounter with tok murashito now it seemed in an eerie replaying of the scene she was tok and this woman was what tori had been so many years ago tori saw a rather small handsome woman with wide shoulders narrow hips black glossy hair her black eyes seemed opaque or perhaps they were utterly transparent and the darkness was the ghost hidden inside herself tori allowed herself to touch the other womans wa felt an engine that would not stop something so relentless that it would not give even its owner surcease she felt what big ezoe had defined as the water tap that would not shut off what is your name tori said i have given myself the name of koi you are a foolish woman there is far too much fire burning in you go home koi said i will leave when you are dead so much violence inside you eating you alive dont you see it not before no of course you dont i didnt either years ago im not sure that even now i do i dont understand you tori looked at koi in respect to fukudas death i did what i had to do giri she stalked me laid a trap for me she was determined that only one of us was going to leave that tunnel this is irrelevant to me i too must do what i have to do grasping at last what tok murashito had meant tori said listen to me koi theres a difference between doing what you have to do and doing what you have been told to do there is no difference if thats so tori said then there is no self in that case you dont exist at all but are purely the creation of someone elsewho would that be big ezoe of course big ezoe there is no koi only big ezoes automaton she watched the other woman tell me koi who are you i am the hard machine that may be what you are but it isnt who you are silence you cant tell me because you dont know ill bet there was never a time in your life when yon were you plain and simple with no one else telling you what to do and what to be koi said nothing for a long time her eyes seemed to have fixed on that peculiar middle distance that exists only in the back of the mind at last she said i was trained by a sensei known as the man of one tree he adopted me or so it seemed when my parents no longer knew what to do with me i am cursed i was born hinoeuma in the year of the husband killers her head moved slightly but her eyes did not change their focus the man of one tree taught me how to combat my curse he told me that karma was mutable that if my will was sufficiently developed i could change my karma i believed because i had nothing else to believe i stayed with him on his island for many years i came to think of myself as his daughter and it seemed that he thought of himself as my father i liked that my real father was always so afraid of me whatever paternal instincts he might have had were channeled away from me toward my brothers and sisters then one day the man of one tree announced that we were leaving the island for several days he took me to the mainland where his daughter was getting married watching the look of love transform his face as he gazed upon his daughter i knew what a pathetic fantasy i had been living all the years i had been with him i was nothing to him not a daughter not family nothing but i hid my disappointment and anger by covering myself with shame of course he did not think of me as his daughter how could he i was hinoeuma i was unworthy of his love i said nothing of this to the man of one tree i needed him as much as i had beforeperhaps even more now that i knew he had not adopted me as his own i had even less than i had thought and i needed every scrap of attention i could find otherwise i was sure i would shrivel up and die koi stood very still paralyzed by memories tori could feel the awesome strength of her wa purling outward in waves but she did not try to fend it off instead she said koi tell me something why is it that you accept violence as your only alternative my nature is steeped in violence in blood i am unclean and yet tori said i bleed every month the same as you and you embrace violence as if it were your lover no tori said thats not true but it is koi said i feel the fire of rage in you its easy to identify something that is so familiar to me were women tori said we should do whatever we can to find alternatives to violence why because fire without the requisite water to put it out occasionally is madness tori said beginning to work the enigma out for herself it had not been tok murashito who had been the enigma it was herself nature cannot long tolerate something that is so out of balance yin without yang will not long survive koi said then i will be a star burning bright in the blackness before winking out is that what you want for yourself tori asked death in a world without honor death is the only honorable solution no youre wrong bringing water to the fire is the preferable alternative banking the fire is impossible for me for people like us nothing is impossible tori said koi put her hand on tori you cannot even bring the water to your own fire how can you counsel me to do it tori said in life only failure breeds success if in the past i have tried and failed it does not mean that i will stop trying and making the same mistakes over and over no tori struggled now to sit up but kois powerful hand prevented her the circle of defeat must be broken i cannot tell you how to make yourself better too many people in your life have already done that and look at the result i cannot be better koi said i am hinoeuma i am doomed superstitious nonsense youre no different than i am except that youve been totally cut off from people youve had too many mentors and no one to trust its so terrible to be disconnected life seems so desolate you begin to survive only on desperation but all youre doing is feeding on yourself toris eyes caught kois if you trust me i can help you perhaps we can even help each other impossible koi said tightening her hold on tori i must avenge big ezoes death giri i must kill you then tori said you truly are doomed her eyes had not left kois koi did nothing the two women locked in a silent duel heard the noise at the same moment its big ezoes assassin kill her tori recognized hitasuras voice saw at the same moment russell step into the room aim a gun at the back of kois head shoot me koi said calmly before i die i will take tori nunn with me into the ringing silence tori said sharply back off she risked a glance at the men in the open doorway i mean it russ back off and take hitasura with you shes a killer tori russell said she came here to kill you for christs sake shes got to go im sick of you men and your solutions to problems tori cursed in japanese get the hell out now russell dropped his arm tori tori said nothing the men withdrew why did you do that koi said because this has nothing to do with them this is between us i think they found the right spot they could have killed me before i had a chance to get to you perhaps yet you insisted they back off she shook her head why i told you before its a matter of trust i could kill you now i know its what big ezoe wanted me to do tori said what the hell is big ezoe to you for a moment koi did nothing then she began to laugh she laughed and laughed collapsing on the bed beside tori holding her sides gasping tears streaming down her face then abruptly she was weeping bitter tears tears pent up for years tears of rage and selfloathing and she put her head in the crook of toris shoulder while tori stroked her hair as she would a frightened child its going to be all right tori whispered but koi shook her head no she gasped through her sobbing it wont i dont think im capable of trusting anyone but youre already trying arent you koi nodded her head yes then tori told her if it wont be all right at least it will be better i feel all right you look like death warmed over my what a charmer you are tori and russell sat facing each other in the room where tori had awakened to find koi standing over her however now thirtysix hours later the bed was empty tori was dressed had eaten two normal meals just trying to make a point russell said which is youre not a being from the planet krypton tori groaned dont worry i dont think i could leap over a fireplug let alone a tall building but weve still got work to do now wheres koi have you kept her and hitasura apart as i asked you to do yes though this is his turf so it wasnt all that easy but i must say your poisoning has unnerved him is that so tori said well see about that what did you and koi talk about you and she were up here for hours i need to do a couple of things before i tell you tori said first off i need a hookup to the computers at mail central can you fix that up no problem ill go make the call now weve rented out space in the sumitomo building for about a year now good then im going to want to interview hitasura thats long overdue you bet it is russell said i have some questions to put to him no trust me on this russ ive got to do this alone but russell was already shaking his head no way for one thing youve just got off a sickbed want to arm wrestle for another this is a situation of totally unknown consequences i cant take such a risk with your life dont worry tori said whatever happens hitasura wont kill me i dont know that russell said firmly and despite what you tell me i cant believe you do either no if you speak to hitasura at all itll be with me in the same room be realistic russ hitasura wont talk to you well one way or another youre going to have help when you meet with him but tori wasnt listening christ she continued if hes involved in cocaine smuggling he might not even talk to me but hes got to russell said he owes you doesnt he tori gave him a small smile if only it were that simple she shook her head no matter what giri hitasura feels toward me i am still gaijin an outsider that fact outweighs everything else even giri because to a japanese a gaijin might speak of giri but it is impossible to believe that he will live by it that gives him the leeway to speak of giri to me without actually meaning it christ if he feels he owes you nothing how will you get him to admit to his involvement let alone tell you whats going on right now i havent the faintest idea tori said russell sat on the bed took her in his arms you scared the hell out of me you know russ youre losing your directors perspective fuck being a director im a field executive now she smiled youve been demoted is that how you see it i dont ive gotten a sense of the mall that i never had before it seems that the higher you get in any hierarchy the less you know about the nuts and bolts of running it he leaned forward thats because you have to turn off and disconnect yourself from one set of alliances in order to plug yourself into the political sockets needed to keep the jackals on capitol hill at bay dangerous stuff russell nodded but a month ago i would have wasted my time and yours by shouting you down being out here in the field has allowed me to finally see the danger in what i and bernard do we get more and more insulated devising policiestheoretical canvasses which we then order you to color with your blood im beginning to understand that bernard and i have lost all perspective politics and life are often wildly out of sync thats what being out here in the wild has taught me tori kissed him lightly we all have expectations of things people events situations you name it but the reality is so often different you know there was a story bernard told me about when he was younger you mean when he supposedly went to chicago to look up his longlost dad and dad turned out to be a sonuvabitch after all tori stared at russell he told you too here we go russell thought im never going to get a better shot at this tori bernard loves to tell that story but its bullshit pure and simple he tried it on me only i had done my homework i knew he came from bluebloods in virginia his father was a wealthy and successful attorney founding a dynastic law office until his death some years ago he had been happily married to his wifebernards motherfor more than fifty years but that story he could feel her drawing away from him a familiar coldness coming into her but still he persisted it was time for her to know the truth bernard thinks it makes him seem more human he tells it to people like you to help bind them to him oh come on tori said bernards not that cynical he doesnt think of himself that way russell said according to bernard business is conducted in any manner that gets the job done i dont believe you tori said then you certainly wont believe that before i left with you on this assignment bernard told me what to do to you if your undisciplined methodology got in the way russell rose he told me to terminate you it was dusk by the time ton returned from the mall offices at the sumitomo building in shinjuku by that time it had begun to rain fine silver needles spraying the sidewalks streets and car tops smearing the city grit across windshields gray water dripped from building facades the sidewalks were a sea of umbrellas neon had taken over from daylight russell had remained at the office to transmit a progress report and clear up the mountain of paperwork that accumulated during a transcontinental trip tori was shaken by her foray into the mall central computers her suspicions had been made all too real the travel information contained there confirmed everything that koi had told her about the coalition between the industrialist kunio michita fumida ten chairman of kaga and toris friend hitasura with estilo acting as willing middleman supplier kois repeated mention of the mysterious american who didnt have the appearance of a businessman had set off warning bells in toris mind now she recalled her and russells puzzlement over why estilo would give them information that seemed detrimental to him in revealing his involvement he had not only implicated himselfthus risking a termination of what must be a lucrative business deal to supply the decidedly odd michitatenhitasura coalition with illegal hafniumbut he also had pointed them toward the one person in japan who could help them further hitasura why now it seemed clear he had been warning tori if estilo had betrayed their friendship he had more than made up for it by what he had done tori thought now that she owed estilo an enormous apology he could have told her outright what was happening but he knew that she would not be able to bring herself to believe him he knew that she had to be led step by step toward the inevitable conclusion the information in the mall central computer confirmed that on the dates that the kagamichita negotiations were commencing bernard godwin had been out of the country but there was some other reason why these dates seemed familiar tori racked her brain but could not think of where she had come across them before giving it up for the moment she returned to the most immediate problem where had bernard godwin gone a search through the travel facilities of the mall revealed that he had not used the companys services to book his flights linking up to the american airlines computers had been more enlightening a week before the kagamichita negotiations had begun in earnest bernard godwin had bought a firstclass ticket to san francisco he was there just overnight the next day he was on a flight to tokyo his return to the states was three weeks later tori did not believe in coincidences bernard godwin was the american who had instigated michitas inquiry into the new kaga process that had led to the forming of the coalition bernard godwin but that was patently impossible for one thing tori could not believe that a man like bernard would ever involve himself with cocaine trafficking for another even if the impossible had occurred godwinalong with russellhad had a hand in bringing her back in order to track down the source of the lethal supercocaine recalling bernards outraged face as russell described the effects of the new drug tori was more certain than ever that he had nothing to do with that part of it and yet hitasura was an integral part of the coalition that bernard must have put together so that he could supply these new nuclear weaponswhatever they wereto his precious nationalist movement in the soviet union and estilo had said that the untreated coke was being bought by hitasura its still not making sense what am i missing tori asked herself there was only one path to take and it led right through hitasura hitasuras teacolored melanin birthmark which ran up the left side of his jaw onto his cheek seemed darker on this dark twilit day the pachinko parlor in the ginza was vast as large as a castle it was one of many owned by hitasuras yakuza family the weekly amount of money hitasura took in from just these betting game parlors tori knew was astronomical lights flashed on the rows of vertical game boards as steel balls whizzed through the maze of the pachinko men and womenespecially womenstood enwrapped playing game after game the hardened veterans were sure to stake out one of the game machines that had a tiny color tv screen set in the middle of the game field so that they would not miss their favorite soap operas while they lost their money hitasura sat in a glassedin booth two floors above the action the entire back wall of the booth was a bank of tv monitors which scanned the aisles and rows of players making sure the house odds were not being tampered with we got a kid in here last month hitasura said as tori put down her dripping umbrella came to sit beside him on a plain metal and green vinyl office chair you should have seen him the sonuvabitch was some whiz he had made a tiny electronic gadget that zapped the pachinko machines circuits he won every other time he played then he got carried away with himself and began to win every game that was too much dont you think tori said nothing she ignored the tv monitors reproducing the frantic play going on below her she had changed clothes at the mall offices in shinjuku she wore a pair of tapered chocolatecolored leather pants a mantailored cream cotton blouse under a waistlength fawncolored quilted rain jacket how are you hitasura inquired he was wearing an expensive but illfitting sharkskin suit that was still rainstained when we got to you in the tunnels and mr slade told me you had been poisoned i moved heaven and earth to make sure you wouldnt die dekes dead tori said yen yasuwara is maimed hitasura rocked a little in his chair as if he had developed a western manner of mourning i am sorry you learned about dekes death in this way he said i had wanted to be the one who told you under the circumstances tori said carefully i agree that would have been proper she noticed that he had not acknowledged in any way her reference to yen hitasura looked at her perhaps you should speak to your newfound friend the assassin who calls herself koi she killed deke tori said i have talked to her hitasura turned his head away his gaze was flicking from screen to screen on the wall of monitors suddenly tori saw him start shes here he said tori looked at the screen that held his attention it showed koi making her way down one of the aisles on the floor below what is she doing here i asked her to come tori said you hitasuras head swung around tori watched him its time to settle our accounts to honor old debts hitasuras face was now devoid of all emotion it was as if his eyes had slid behind a veil he reached behind him produced a pistol from a holster strapped to the small of his back he balanced the pistol on his right kneecap is that necessary when old friends reveal themselves as enemies hitasura said all precautions must be taken what makes you think ive become your enemy hitasura gestured with his chin you bring big ezoes assassin here to my ground you have become friends with a monster who would murder you where you lay helpless in my bed my bed what else am i to think i dont know tori said im not the one whose conscience lies heavy hitasura made a dismissing sound between his teeth tori watched koi as she passed from monitor to monitor as she moved toward the metal staircase to the booth tori said as long as you brought up the notion tell me what kind of monster is it who concocts a new kind of cocaine so powerful its effects destroy the human mind and body in months hitasura sat very still and with an icy crawling in the pit of her stomach tori had her answer estilo had not lied hitasura was the man hitasura said if she begins to climb the stairs to this office ill order her shot i promise you and then youll shoot me and all your problems will be solved tori shook her head but no theres russ to think of what will you do about him hitasura kill him as well what good will that do you there will only be more people from the mall come to avenge his deathand mine you cant win this time hitasura allowed himself a tiny smile is that how you see the situation well good then i have nothing at all to fear now a laugh leaked out of his mouth quickly stifled as if it had popped out unexpectedly hitasura wiped the smirk from his face pardon me for laughing at you but i could not help myself you are so far off the mark you have added a moment of unexpected amusement to an otherwise serious discussion whats struck you so funny she had not wanted to give him the satisfaction of asking but she too could not help herself mmm i suppose you could not have forgotten tom royce no i see by the expression on your face you have not then there is tok murashito i know you remember him what an interview you had with him you the avenging angel out to nail him for killing that idiot royce tori was astonished how do you know about my meeting with murashito well it wasnt from you was it hitasura cocked his head figure it out for yourself having trouble okay ill go on murashito killed royce all right but he didnt do it because royce had raped his daughter the funny thing is that i think tom royce was fully capable of rape but murashito was far too clever to allow his daughter anywhere near royce no murashito killed royce because he was ordered to by whom you are about to ask why by bernard godwin royce had begun his own investigation into godwins involvement here in japan and the deeper he got it seems the less he liked what he saw thats why he angled to take the assignment to come to japan to brief you godwin let him come until that moment he had not been sure that royce was the one doing the burrowing behind his back once he was sure royces fate was sealed he was a dead man so you can see how empty a threat youve just made no one from the mall will come to avenge your death or that of mr slade there will no doubt be an investigation but bernard will handle it himself the circumstances dictate it after all another laugh was squeezed out of him and tori shivered hitasura cocked his head again responding to the dumbfounded look on toris face are you shocked perhaps ive gone too fast and youre not following me shall i slow down all she could think of was bernard godwin how he had manipulated everyone around him including her she had thought of him as a surrogate father when all along he had been using her she heard russells voice bernard told me what to do to you if your undisciplined methodology got in the way he told me to terminate you how right russell had been about him go on she said concentrating now on the present i assume then that youve been working for the mall for years oh no not the mall for bernard godwin himself hitasura permitted himself another small smile as if he were a dieter doling himself sweets working with individuals ive found is far more rewarding than being part of a machine i think you understand that well torisan he shook his head i must admit i never understood your consenting to come back to them why did you do that because tori said i had nothing else hitasura pursed his lips poor girl if i had known forget it i wouldnt have been interested she put her head in her hands how could i have been so wrong about bernard hes trafficking in that supercoke after all are you kidding hitasura said hed try to skin me alive if he knew what i was up to tori raised her head staring at him she had the sensation of her heartbeat being slow and painfully heavy as if her heart was being set in cement what are you saying in some important matters bernard is slightly behind the times i attribute it to his essentially altruistic nature i find that odd in a man who must in his chosen profession be so profoundly pragmatic but there you are people are often far more complex than you ever give them credit for being you were supplementing what he was paying you is that it hitasura nodded essentially yes bernards an excellent business partner in some respects but in others hes sorely lacking his obsession to free the soviets from their russian masters has blinded him to many things including my method of getting the hafnium into japan he didnt ask and i didnt tell he was too busy making sure those teenytiny hafniumcontrolled reactor cores were being fitted inside some kind of prototype nuclear devices my god our worst nightmare has come true tori thought but either hitasura didnt get it or he didnt care he laughed it was rather neat i thought using bernards altruism to make me rich until you came back nosing around what a pest youve become torisan such a disappointment especially in a friend tori was appalled her head was throbbing and she felt as if she had been struck in the stomach but she knew she had to press on get all the poison out at once in order for some sense of healing to begin and ariel solares oh him this discussion appeared on the verge of boring hitasura he was like royce nosing around getting suspicious of what might be happening under his nose behind closed doors he had become a liability to bernardand to me i had him killed with her heart in her throat ton said did bernard order ariels murder hitasura laughed god no bernard hadnt the stomach for it we discussed it of course but he was too afraid of solaress friendship with estilo but i knew better i knew that solares had got further in his investigation of us than bernard suspected i did what had to be done for the good of all of us tori slumped in her chair there was a feeling of desolation inside her the same terrible sensation one got when one squeezed the life out of another human being every time it happened she felt somehow diminished as if a piece of her soul were being chipped away falling into a fathomless blackness from which it could never be retrieved now she saw another reason had prompted estilo to warn her it was not only a question of friendship of his caring about her it was also revenge tori remembered the eerie story estilo had told her about the german twins in buenos aires who had been so cruel to him and how he had waited to gain his revenge on them by turning their love and trust in each other into fear and hate estilo lived by his own unique brand of justice not for him the bullet in the back of the head that was too quick his definition of revenge was dominated by the verb to suffer it seemed clear now that ariel had told estilo of his suspicions about bernard and when ariel was murdered it was natural for estilo to think that bernard had ordered the hit in order to protect himself this was to be estilos revenge he wanted her to find out everything so she could bring bernard down for him with an effort of will tori brought herself back to the present you were bernards eyes and ears inside kaga werent you hitasura nodded my people are very highly placed in many useful industries we may not control them yet but we certainly can manipulate them when there is a need and me why did bernard seek me out all those years ago if he had you and murashito what did he need me for that i cant say for certain hitasura admitted though knowing bernard as i do i suspect he wanted someone to keep an eye n m i guess i didnt do such a hot job i dont know about that you know what im doing and bernard doesnt tori said tell me something what would have happened to me if i hadnt bought murashitos bullshit about royce raping his daughter what if i had gone ahead and killed him hitasura shrugged nothing im quite certain by exposing murashito you effectively killed him anyway he became useless to bernard so you two had to find someone to take his place tori said enter kunio michita thats right in fact you did us a favor kunio michitas far more venal than murashito ever was hes more powerful too god what a fool ive been in america hitasura said history shows that your countrymen make heroes of fools his hand slid around the grip of his pistol he lifted it aiming it at toris chest its a pity youll never see america again tori stood up and she felt his tension soar dont he said tracking her with the muzzle of the pistol why not do what i want tori said if youre going to shoot me all the same i dont want to kill you hitasura said not really tori shook her head too late for remorse not remorse regret you were a good friend while it lasted while it suited you you mean hitasura shrugged i have no interest in semantics ive no doubt tori said you cant make a profit on it its exceedingly odd hitasura said with some admiration but in many ways you are not at all gaijinnot at all the foreigner he shrugged i suppose there are still some things in the world i do not understand i would like to know one thing tori said who are you sending the nuclear units to who is bernards contact inside russia a last request hitasura said then shrugged why not who are you going to tell he laughed bernards befriended a man named valeri denysovich bondasenko the mans a ukrainian hes spent his entire career it seems suppressing minorities for the kremlin while secretly working for their unification sounds like my kind of guy but i dont know from what bernard says bondasenko genuinely hates the russians but then again he could be kgb its happened before i understand i dont personally trust any of these russians far too inscrutable what is it they want anyway to bury the west or to make money from it its tough to put your trust in a schizophrenic but apparently thats just what bernards done and now god help him because we just got an emergency coded cable somethings happened in moscow and the situation is rapidly getting out of hand bondasenkos white star organization has sprung a serious leak knowing that ive washed my hands of bernard as quick as you can slide a clam down your throat theres a dead drop we use at the hotel rossiya in moscow addressed to a mrs kubysheva i wouldnt use it now if you paid me fifty million yen i dont need any of the complications that inevitably come from trying to be a saint in this day and age a saint is synonymous with a sucker hitasura looked at her is that it for your last request can we get on with it yes tori said hitasura pulled the trigger the explosion was loud in the booth but amid the sound and vision of pachinko no one noticed besides the booths glass panels were both bullet and soundproof tori was slammed back against the glass a hole torn in her jacket just over her heart she collapsed and hitasura was across the booth in one stride he stood over her much as he had stood over big ezoe in the corridor of the kaijin tea house in shimbashi he kicked toris thigh with the toe of his shoe but there was no sign of movement he squatted put the muzzle of his pistol against her forehead in preparation for the shot that would make certain she was dead at that moment koi tore open the door to the glassedin booth hitasura hearing her swung the pistol in an arc toward her and in that instant of hesitation toris right hand blurred upward her hardened heel smashing into the base of his nose with such force it drove the cartilage in one piece back through his sinuses into his brain cavity hitasuras expression was one of dismay it was frozen on his face as his upper torso tumbled backward his head hit against the leg of one of the chairs but he was past caring koi came over to where tori sat with her back against the glass panel koi stared down into hitasuras face then she knelt beside tori are you all right hes dead isnt he toris voice seemed far away yes another part of me gone tori closed her eyes her heart was pounding furiously and no amount of prana would slow it i didnt want to hurt him i never came to hate him then she looked up into kois face this killing must stop koi nodded reached over picked tori up she put her hand beneath toris jacket her blouse wearing this kevlar vest was a risk she said what if hed aimed his first shot for your head tori said as they stepped over hitasuras body then that would have been me lying there it would be all over toris knees buckled and koi caught her now you must repay me for helping you koi said there is something i must do and i fear i cannot do it alone sengakuji the resting place of historys revered heroes the splendid fortyseven ronin the place where kakuei sakata had purified his spirit where he had regained his honor by committing seppuku ritual suicide inibuki kois soft abdominal breathing changed to yoibuki the hard aggressive breathing of battle and stress wordlessly she pressed the translations of sakatas ledgers into toris hands then knelt on the carpet of grass among the gaily waving flowers her white garb stood out starkly she hoped that this one spot of purity among the vibrant colors would remain in toris memory as it had in hers from the day of sakatasans death she could still remember the wind whipping his loose white leggings the glare of sunlight on his blade at the instant before he reversed it plunging it into his lower belly tori bent down closed her hand over kois where it clasped the short killing sword dont do this she said urgently i beg you to reconsider there are alternatives for you perhaps koi said but not for me i see now that i have trod too long and too heavily down one path but you have a friend now tori said your life is already changing but koi was already shaking her head an illusion a pleasant one ive no doubt you think but also a treacherous one for no matter how much i may fight against the violence inside me it will overtake me if not today then tomorrow or the day after my spirit is unclean it longs to be purified she turned her head toward tori and tori could see the tears in her eyes oh my dear tori whispered the tears ran its not me i think of now but others i no longer wish to harm you with that koi plunged the blade to the hilt into herself koi kois lips rounded and a tiny oh escaped her bloodless lips she drew her elbows in her whole body was shaking with an effort that tori found unimaginable she dragged the buried blade from left to right cutting herself open the stench was appalling steam came from her like a mist over spectral fields she slumped over the buried blade her bloodied whiteknuckled fists blood crawled down her thighs soaking into the grass it grows dark koi whispered dont go im here tori said despair and helplessness mingled inside her in her mouth was the nauseating taste of fresh blood it grows darker still but the mountains the mountains are alive with light death came to koi like a cloud obscuring the moon a film covering her staring eyes seeing their mysterious mountains alive with a light only she could see it took a long time to fill russell in but after what had happened in the pachinko parlor it was no longer in toris interest to remain in tokyo so tori locked herself in with him in the main cabin of their and as the jet took off went over everything she had been told and had discovered a step at a time she told him about the coalition of michita yen and hitasura that bernard had created she told him about hitasura having ariel solares murdered because ariel like tom royce before him had begun his own investigation of the clandestine affairs within the clandestine affairs of mall central she even detailed her own unwitting role in playing watchdog to hitasura and in helping bernard come up with kunio michita a far better and more powerful business partner than tok murashito had been it was good for her to have to explain everything to someone else she had had so many shocks in so short a time she needed to talk about these things out loud in order to make sense of them still it surprised her how calmly russell took the revelations you were right on target with bernard tori said it tears me apart to think how he used both of us how i hate him now russell was quiet for some time then he said i wish you could learn to respond with your brain and not with your heart this is a time to consider objectively what has happened he sat forward think tori bernard put together this bizarre coalition of michita yen and hitasura for a reason he saw what no one else did an unprecedented opportunity to seize what appears to be the ultimate chance to free the minority peoples of the soviet union toris face was pale i never suspected a thing my god all along bernard never retired from the mall he had his own agenda hidden away from even you the director he appointed in his place youre quite right russell said hidden agendas are bernards stockintrade tori stared at him how long have you known russell gave her a thin smile not long enough i cant wait to bury the bastard tori its no good hating bernard he is what he is a man totally obsessed with freeing enslaved peoples i wish there was some way i could help the nationalist movement inside russia tori said its bernards methods i disagree with not his goals so often said russell kept her close but it just goes to prove that bernards as human as the next person hes made mistakesgrave ones like allowing hitasura to run his own supercoke smuggling operation under mail auspices tori turned away looked out at the clouds streaming by below them russ how can you defend him after what hes done to us he took our trust and our love and in return manipulated us ill tell you something russell said bernard is a master of using all the resources available to him at first thats what i thought he was doing here but now im not so sure you see he made a point of telling me how angry he was not only that ariel solares was murdered but that it was done with such a bang we heard it all the way back in virginia he said they wanted to embarrass us that there could only be one response to that russell made sure she was listening but bernard knew all along who had ordered ariels death hitasura go for the jugular bernard said jesus he wasnt kidding he made sure that every step of the way it was my idea to bring you back but i could see how he planted that idea how he manipulated conversations so that i would take that extra step to ensure that one way or another youd come back to the mall i didnt know why then but i do now he knew that you were the only one who could take care of your old friend hitasura for him go on but bernard also must have known that for you to get close enough to hitasura to terminate him youd have to have learned enough to implicate himbernard so you were a twoedged sword tori on the one hand you were the only agent skilled enough to bring hitasura down on the other you would come away knowing enough to send bernard away for a very long time thats why bernard ordered you to terminate me russell shook his head youre still not thinking clearly i said bernard told me to terminate you under certain circumstances he didnt order me to do it and further he knew that i couldnt possibly hurt you you see bernardwho knows everyones weak spotsknew before i did that i was in love with you tori said nothing for a time at last she put her head into her hands i cant think theres too much this is your time in the corrida tori and when she lifted her head to look at him russell said the bull is so close upon you you can feel his hot breath yes she said yes russell took her hands in his this is the time when you must think for yourself think not as bernard wants you to do but for yourself she knew he was right in everything he said and yet a stubborn obtuse part of her was still committed to hating bernard godwin for his betrayal of her trust she said whether he asked you told you or ordered you to terminate me makes no difference bernard still wanted me dead in order to protect himself no tori russell caught her gaze with his own if bernard wanted you terminated he certainly wouldnt have asked me to do it im a desk jockey remember and he knew i was personally involved with you id be just about the last person hed contract with to make the hit that makes sense tori said then why did he tell you to terminate me well ive been thinking about that russell said what he said was so wildly out of character that it was as if he was trying to tell me something it took me a while to figure out the puzzle bernard had set put for me but i think i have it now it was as if bernard was saying to me ive given you this picture whats wrong with it he knew that hitasura had turned bad on himhitasuras murder of ariel solares was a major break in discipline bernard may not have known that hitasura was behind the supercoke but he sure as hell knew that he suddenly had a rogue agent on his handsa rogue agent i might add who reported only to bernard bernard knew he had to terminate hitasura as quickly and as efficiently as possible he knew he couldnt tell you openly about hitasura because you wouldnt believe him and he wouldnt have told me for fear i would tell you that would have made you walk straight away from us bernard knew you needed to discover the truth about hitasura for yourself but he was warning me that things were not as they seemed in the hope that i would stay one step ahead of you you see bernard was still concerned by your volatility he set me up to be your watchdog just as years ago he set you up to be hitasuras watchdog tori gave an ironic laugh and now bernard has given me the means to exact my revenge on him for manipulating me for so many years russell nodded now you understand that bernard knew he was doing just that when he manipulated me into bringing you back to the mall it says something about the man that he trusts youand mewith that power over him tori thought about that for a long time then she nodded i guess i still cant believe that i could have been so wrong about hitasura he used bernard as bernard was using us and everyone else around him we have confirmation from hitasura himself that bernard never wanted ariel murdered and its true that bernard had no conscious knowledge of the supercocaine hitasura was selling it will just about kill him when he learns to what extent hes been involved in that russell said nothing tori exhaled slowly there is an argentine saying the devil can see at midnight but revenge is blind even in the noonday sun russell knew what she meant she was moving away from the emotionally volatile adolescent filled with weaknesses that bernard godwin recognized and exploited she was becoming more whole and therefore more powerful with each breath she took she had met her bull head on and was riding it facing herself at last instead of turning away from herself to face death over and over look were not trying to excuse bernard are we tori said at last i think youll have to make up your own mind about that russell said ill only remind you of what you said just a few minutes ago you told me that you wished there was some way for you to help the nationalist movement inside russia bernards shown you the way you think we should help him tori said bernards been selling nuclear devices of unknown and unproven design to white star a nationalist underground movement that might or might not be controlled by the kgb itself youve just given the best reason i can think of for helping bernard those miniature hafniumdamped nuclear devices could easily be the means to a revolution inside the ussr or the spark that ignites a world war white star has become the nexus point of this assignment either way we have to penetrate white star and find out whether bernard has become a saint or a fool now theres a hell of an idea russell pointed out the planes perspex window welcome to hell tori he said weve just crossed over into soviet airspace twelve moscow star town weve lost him lost him mars volkov clenched his fists this man this traitorhas killed four of my men he has kidnapped a helpless psychotic from her bed in a state institution and all you can tell me is that you lost him how is that captain anatoly nikolev captain of the eleventh division of the kgb border guards temporarily under the command of the chief of department n shifted uncomfortably on the hard wooden bench he and mars were sitting in the otherwise empty stands of the baseball field at moscow state university they were watching the burgeoning national team work out beyond the stadium were the greentiered lenin hills where the vast mosfilms sound stages and some of the citys finest old villasmars had onewere gradually being surrounded by squat modernstyle multiple residences in the opposite direction was the stolid ugly facade of the university dormitory and student facilities building one of the many constant reminders in moscow of stalins indelible influence on this stolid society captain nikolev looked resplendent in his gray uniform with the red accents there were medals on his chest but he knew from experience that mars volkov was not impressed by past accomplishments the man lived entirely in the present captain nikolev loved this place especially a beautiful spot not a hundred yards from here where on a promontory overlooking the river it was said that napoleon gazed down upon moscow on september before marching into the city i can never come here mars said interrupting captain nikolevs thoughts without thinking of nikolai ivanovich lobachevsky now there was a great man i see his bust in front of the university and i feel a great pride in being russian of course captain nikolev thought with some cynicism i come to the lenin hills and am filled with history what fills comrade volkov rhapsodic thoughts of a noneuclidian geometrist mars said i understand that the last tank units have been drawn up which means were ready to cross the mythical borders into lithuania and latvia true enough captain nikolev said its a daring plan but one which is also timeworn it worked in poland decades ago so it should work now have you reservations captain i am not a military tactician nikolev said neutrally so i have no worthwhile opinion on such matters mars regarded him with some surprise yet you are a military man such action should set your blood on fire nikolev grunted i think the time is long past for the heyday of the military man i know mars said with some amusement a commission as an officer in the roman legion would have suited you more captain nikolev watched the baseball players at their strenuous calisthenics and thought glumly that the military should adopt such daily exercises we lost bondasenkos white star contact at the institution in arkhangelskoe as well he said when he felt he could no longer prolong the inevitable it was our ill fortune to have bondasenko show up just as we were about to get the man apparently bondasenko was using the institution where he had so successfully hidden his daughter as a meet to exchange intelligence with other members of white star very clever mars said i must remember to commend him before i put a bullet through the back of his head captain nikolev said i think we can assume that bondasenko is white stars commander we have gained that information at least its not an inconsiderable bit of intelligence mars grunted his assent all right he said now bondasenkos gone to ground but he cant stay hidden indefinitely hes going to have to surface sometime and captain when he does i want his head snapped in a rat trap is that clear yes comrade mars and captain nikolev lapsed into silence they watched a pair of thin chainsmoking professors from the university circulate among the young members of the national baseball team they were not the coaches the best coaches were still to marss shame mainly cubans who had many years of invaluable baseball experience these chainsmoking professors were sports specialists in eyehand coordination and musculature conditioning they had determined that quickness of reflexes not endurance was the most desirable trait to breed into the new generation of ballplayers that the soviet union hoped would dominate world play in the s but perhaps it would take longer to field a worldclass team than had first been anticipated since endurance was a trait already bred into the young russians graduating from the extant statefunded sports academies but professor kutateladze who spoke eloquently and at length of the technology of building a baseball player had promised that the young men coming out of his baseball school would be different mars hoped he would be right he always had been in the past mars said have you as yet located miss ponomareva no where has irina got to mars asked himself she was not at work or at home she had not been at valeris and she wasnt with the hero captain nikolev had checked these places himself irina might continue to be very useful to me now he thought my surveillance has shown that shes been the closest to valeri denysovich over the past several months if anyone might know where he was holed up she might well mars thought stirring perhaps it is time i took a more active role in finding out where she is it was very quiet when mars entered the heros fortress in star town he came across tatiana first she was folding the heros newly laundered shirts into a neat pile the homey smells of soap and bleach were in the air comrade she said when she saw him her wideapart gray eyes were neutral she did not stop her folding is he alone mars asked brusquely lara is with him tatiana said you left orders that one of us should be with him at all times now yes mars said of course he sat on a steel folding chair watched her dispiritedly while she worked tatiana cocked her head you look like you could use a drink comrade she said can i bring you something have you any pepper vodka ill see she went out of the room returned in a moment with a pair of thick water tumblers and a bottle she grinned hoisting the bottle i didnt think a shot would be sufficient mars drank the first slug of pepper vodka gratefully felt his throat begin to burn then his stomach he held out his glass for a refill you know tatiana i believe that the hero has won won what comrade oh our little battle of wits mars sipped i confess that hes still a complete enigma to me is he mad or sane did he make contact with an alien entity during the event or is he so enraged at what weve done to him that hes been pulling our leg all this time if you want my opinion yes of course i do well then she took a long gulp of her vodka as if she needed fortification to go on i think the hero is mad whatever happened to him up there in space has made him mad but hes not insane in any way that we can understand hes not for instance psychotic or schizophrenic something our scientists can put their finger on no the heros different from you or me of course he is hes no youre not understanding me tatiana said she looked down into the bottom of her glass what are you saying that hes no longer human dont be idiotic tatiana im beginning to think that you and lara have been too long with him but thats just it she said we know him better than anyone and im telling you that even if his physiology is the same as yours or mine his mind is not its been altered mars watched her in silence for a long time why is it he asked himself that every time i come here i feel as if ive entered a whole new dimension has the turned everyone around him mad or is what tatiana is telling me the truth abruptly he stood up put the glass aside hed had more than enough liquor id better go see him he left tatiana as he had found her carefully folding the heros shirts upstairs in the pool room it was very still even the water seemed to have ceased its constant lapping it was dark and mars groped in the gloom for the light switch comrade dont turn it on it was laras voice the heros eyes have become sensitive to light mars fumbled his way toward the pool have you informed the doctors now that he was closer he could see the slight phosphorescence of the saltwater yes theyve examined him extensively lara said theyre baffled bah mars said with a dismissive gesture theyre baffled by almost everything what use are they what use is anybody he squatted on the coping of the pool lara swam up to him he could see her dark eyes her dark hair gleaming plastered back against her skull her face was an almost perfect oval mars wondered why he had never noticed that before somethings happening the way she said it low deep in her throat made the short hairs at the back of marss neck stir what do you mean i mean that this sensitivity to light does not seem isolated but rather part of an ongoing process what nonsense mars scoffed then looking at the expression on her face he said is it the cosmic radiation affecting him so quickly the doctors say no what do they know nothing but mars felt a peculiar writhing in the pit of his stomach he remembered tatiana telling him that it was her belief that the heros mind was no longer human its been altered he recognized the tiny flame of his fright flickering in the phosphorescent darkness lara what is happening im not sure but i think hes in the early stages of some kind of change you mean hes metamorphosing mars worked his jaws for a moment until he was able to whisper into what but he was greeted only with silence where is he mars said after a time in the pool tatiana said around the other side with arbat stay here mars ordered her he got up made his way around to the other side of the pool odysseus mars heard his voice in echo it resounded in the darkness that now seemed alive with a hidden pulsingof life but what form of life mars gave a tiny shudder squared his shoulders called to the again here i am comrade the lapping of the water a small splash over the coping at marss feet mars looked down saw the pale pale flesh of the heros face and shoulders was it his imagination or was the heros skin even more colorless than usual more metallic lookingmore alien at that moment mars felt a hand clamp around his left ankle youre too faraway comrade the grip on him tightened what are you doing mars said why stand aloof at a distance the hero gave a mighty pull and mars lost his balance his backside hit the coping with a painful smack at the same time he felt himself being dragged into the pool he fought to resist but it was as if his muscles were paralyzed his body of no use at all the saltwater rose over him and he felt the drag of the water on his clothes he waved his arms scissored his legs but his shoes were weighing him down the water closed over his face then a fist grabbed his shirt and he was pulled upward his head broke the surface of the pool and he spluttered saltwater ran down his face his eyes cleared slowly he was face to face with the hero its a strange world odysseus said dont you agree comrade exceedingly strange mars was struggling with his fear it had been bad enough when the hero had scared him with the fake radium pellet he had thrown into me pool now mars was in here with the hero himselfand what was the hero becoming odysseus guided him to the side of the pool thank you for not turning on the lights mars said youre welcome then realized that this was the most civil exchangebrief though it wasthat he and the had ever had he heard the small splashings beside him i dont seem to need as much light as i used to in order to see it was the heros voice all right mars assured himself but what was he saying also i see things i never saw before mars opened his mouth to say like what but no words would come out he recognized with a shudder that part of him did not want to know the same part of him that wanted to get out of here as fast as it could and stay far away with an act of will mars clamped down on that part shoved it back into the shadows of his subconscious where it belonged i can see underwater without opening my eyes it didnt matter he saw with a mounting horror he could not control the hero was going to tell him anyway arbat says that im developing the kind of sonar that she has mars forced himself to say all this sounds like so much fantasy odysseus but there was no conviction in his voice dont you think perhaps youre imagining these changes just as i imagined the color between the stars his face was very close to marss there was a sharp distinct scent like cloves but not cloves the color of god his eyes were like steel pellets hard highly reflective perhaps this is all a dream eh comrade my training the flight of the odingalaktika ii the eva menelauss death the event he spread his hands all this the building the pool arbat you if i were a solipsist volkov i tell you thats what i would believe but my experiences have made me into something as far from a solipsist as possible i am not alone man is not alone his voice though soft had the quality of a tolling bell as if there were reverberations like sparks filling the space above the pool even after he had ceased to speak mars had had enough of this he needed to establish control of the interview give it a certain rhythm to turn it from a conversation into an interrogation that would calm him he was sure i am afraid to say odysseus that your days of uninterrupted information gathering have come to an end mars was watching the heros face for a sign of reaction he thought of natasha mayakovas face when he had announced that he was taking her to the lubyanka too bad he couldnt do the same with the but he could not afford a revolt from all the cosmonauts in star town with the burgeoning breakdowns in farflung parts of the soviet unionthe strikes the pronationalist demonstrations the acts of sabotage against government installationshe could not risk such a protest so close to home and from the symbols of russian pride and superiority so it was to be no hard man for the hero just mars volkov youve been very clever ill admit mars said but ive been more clever i have found the source of your illegal information is it your intention to isolate me then damn him mars thought i can discern nothing in his eyes no emotion at all for a time mars said punishment enough i would think for becoming involved in an illegal activity and i assure you that i am being lenient because i am ignoring entirely the charge of espionage that no doubt someone more rigid and zealous than i could level at you he shook his head kgb files are offlimits to everyone other than ranking kgb personnel even members of the kremlin so i understand we are not here to debate the fine points of soviet policy mars thundered seeing the look on the heros face he immediately regretted his tone he was ashamed that he had been led to lose his temper it seems selfevident odysseus said blandly that far too often soviet policy and kgb policy travel two separate paths for the good of the state mars said stiffly another error and the labor camps as well they exist for the good of the state mars glared at the gleaming ashen face which he found so impenetrable all right he thought both barrels we have natasha mayakova your courier by have her i take it you mean you have put her under articulated interrogation and we know her source mars pressed grimly on valeri denysovich bondasenko im afraid youre going to be information dry for some time to come so thats how its going to be yes no more trying to be my kindly uncle cajoling me out of the intelligence stored in my brain pulling it from me like taffy centimeter by centimeter the traitor comrade bondasenko has caused the situation to change mars said its clear that he stopped horrified the heros expression had gone slack his eyes had rolled up into his head and his head lolled on his left shoulder at the same time mars felt a stirring against his legs something cold and rough like a sharks skin scraped against his flesh where the purling water had lifted his trouser leg he kicked reflexively as he turned this way and that to see where arbat was he saw her across the pool looking curiouslysomewhat hostilely he thoughtat him when he turned back the heros eyes had cleared he was looking directly at him mars said what the hell happened to you the hero opened his mouth spewed out sounds that had no meaning mars felt the small hairs at the back of his neck stir again he thought of lara saying hes metamorphosing and his own response into what odysseus mars said can you understand me the hero said nothing and mars called for lara in a moment she swam up look at him mars commanded her a moment ago i asked him a question and he answered me in a nonsense language has he ever done that to you or tatiana no lara said she was staring curiously at the hero he looks different somehow different the icy crawling had returned to the pit ofmarss stomach how do you mean his eyes she said swimming a bit closer mars reached out pulled her back beside him what about his eyes his fright had made him angry with himself and he was impatient with her i can see right through them impossible mars snapped a moment ago they were as opaque as ball bearings but he peered into the heros face anyway had those eyes changed in this low light he couldnt be certain unless he went closer he wasnt going to do that he swam to the edge of the pool hoisted himself out water sluiced from his sodden clothes filled the spaces in his shoes his tie was ruined he rubbed at his leg where he had felt something mysterious scrape him lara he said where is irina ponomareva i dont know comrade lara was still staring into the heros face she left here some time ago she had transportation i think she said she had a car mars nodded he had loaned her the car so he knew where to find it it had a homing device hidden in the innards of the engine perhaps when he found the car he would also find irina he stood up he thought it imperative that he do so as quickly as possible i need some dry clothes he said imperiously right away comrade lara tore herself away from her contemplation of the hero she got out of the pool went quickly across the room disappeared into a cubicle mars stared down at the still floating figure of the hero he thought with a shiver of the thing that had brushed against him in the pool what is happening to you he asked silently what are you becoming he suspected that even the hero did not know the answer to that at the end of red square one crosses the moskva river via the moskvoretsky bridge from there one is confronted by the illusion of choice for it is no choice at all two streets which though their paths immediately diverge end up in precisely the same place dobryninskaya square this is part of the great sadovaya ring that girdles central moscow and here is known as the zamoskvorechye or the district beyond the moskva centuries ago the zamoskvorechye was the residential quarter not only for the czars servants but for the court artisans nowadays it is very different like most of moscow having gone through a period of intense industrialization during the early part of the nineteenth century however many delights still abound here not the least of which is the church of st gregory of neocasarea one arrives at this seventeenthcentury triumph of gothic architecture by passing over either one of the kamenny bridges following halfway down bolshaya polyanka street the church is surrounded by modern onestory houses with their wide porches and cool inner courtyards its fivedomed sanctuary and tented belfry soaring over the shaded houses and narrow streets to the right where startlingly one comes upon the institute of geography and the atomic energy administration valeri bondasenko could not have found a better hiding place in all of moscow than the church of st gregory of neocasarea though its gorgeous interior had been denied the sublime sanctuarys decorative frescoes and ceramics had been confiscated by the statethe church was a popular spot for foreign tour groups intourist buses were always parked not far away and the ringing voices of sourfaced state tour guides could be heard during the day as regular as the belfrys chiming echoing through the interior repeating by rote the authorized version of this particular piece of history below the shuffling crowds in the longforgotten church crypts valeri and sergei hunched in the dust and the cobwebs beside them on a crude pallet valeris daughter lay as if asleep her face was peaceful utterly blank god must be testing us eh comrade sergei said with a derisive laugh otherwise i cant think why i feel like job it appears that the testing will be over soon valeri said in a serious tone one way or another sergei sobered quickly is white star doomed men i dont know valeri admitted comrade volkov may he rot in hell for eternity comrade volkov may have squeezed natasha mayakova dry but there is only so much she knows we have sprung a leak to be sure but were not yet sinking as long as my log of white star activity is safe so are we sergei said i dont think i care for the look on your face comrade what are you thinking im thinking that as long as my computer is in my apartment it is a liability to us now the log is in there valeri nodded hidden safely away from inquisitive eyes but still yes i understand completely sergei said still it is there he shrugged well one thing is for certain with comrade volkovs people scouring the city for us neither of us can risk going to the apartment to get it all of moscow has become a danger zone i doubt if we can risk anyone anyone who is involved with white star well of course thats what i meant sergei said but who else could we use there is someone who a woman sergei groaned not another woman comrade look at what has happened to natasha mayakova doesnt her torture mean anything to you yes valeri said it means a great deal i cared about natasha that if i may say so is the problem with you comrade emotional involvement is a clear and present danger valeri finished his thought yes i know sergei but i find it imperative to continue to see people as people not as pawns to be pushed around a chess board but for the sake of all of us youll push this woman around the board wont you comrade ill tell her what needs to be done but not why valeri said ill give her a choice the illusion of choice you mean sergei grunted by the time youre done with her holding her tight kissing her im quite certain shed jump off the moskvoretsky bridge if you asked her to she is not someone to manipulate valeri insisted neither was natasha mayakova comrade but you manipulated her just the same for the good of us all it was wrong of me to so shamelessly use natasha in that way wrong but no you have mistaken my intent sergei put his hand briefly on valeris arm a sign of solidarity you did what needed to be done it might have been dirty but there is no shame involved my friend it was necessary i am not often certain of that sergei think of volkov man without your constant cunning that monster would have defeated us already perhaps youre right the times of revolution are desperate times sergei said they call for desperate measures i think comrade that we are done with revolutions you see the results of our original glorious revolution would you have us repeat the mistakes of our forebears he shook his head no comrade these may indeed be desperate times but i will not condone desperate measures the cycle of mindless violence and hidden greed must be broken once and for all time i will not bring down one form of tyranny only to replace it with another do you understand this are you with me sergei nodded for forever and a day valeri valeri clapped sergei on the back but his gaze was far away ah natasha he said softly into the musty darkness of the crypt if only you knew how important your pain was for white star volkov has broken you but now he believes that all you were doing was bringing the kgb dossiers our truth is still safe he turned to sergei still safe eh comrade is he gone yes irina crept out of the heros shower where lara had hidden her when tatiana had warned them of mars volkovs arrival in the building dont be frightened by what you may have overheard irina slipped into the pool beside him nothing about you could frighten me the hero touched her as they moved out into the center of the pool mars was looking for you he said did he say why i dont think it would be a good idea to let him find you lara said but why is he looking for me he thinks you know where valeri is hiding the said hell kill valeri if he gets the chance lara said irina shivered now i am frightened so you should be the said then he put his hand on her again and she felt a warmth flow through her dont worry you have a guardian angel looking after you thats what natasha said irina squeezed her eyes shut why must there always be violence pain suffering death the lapping of the pool four entities in the faintly phosphorescent darkness linked by an invisible umbilical the hero said all these things are part of human nature youre wrong irina said you must be people want things the hero said usually they are things they shouldnt have such as too much money too much power dominion over other people dominion over other nations it never ends there is a cycle of human existence that must be played out nothing is so inevitable irina said now you sound like a god talking about his mortal charges mars has accused me of wanting to be a god but that is not my intent irina looked into his extraordinary opalescent eyes what is your intent then freedom the hero said thats simple enough isnt it or it should be but human nature being what it is the concept of freedom becomes entangled like a crab in a net and now that crab crawls and crawls and never comes to the end of the net irina was about to answer him when she became aware of tatiana slipping into the pool she was their sentry both the hero and lara looked toward her she must go tatiana said indicating irina now the hero asked at once it is vital where am i going irina said i dont want to leave the hero ignored her for a moment he said to lara make certain she exits as she entered so she is not seen lara nodded climbed out of the pool tatiana followed her irina could hear the padding of their bare feet against the tile water dripping in the darkness must i go she repeated it is most important the hero said or the request would not have been made i wont go i refuse to be ordered around im done with being a marionette dancing on the end of strings that men pull its freedom you want isnt it yes well so do i the hero said so do we all even arbat he looked at her if you consent to go youll be helping us get there then how can i refuse but irina felt the fright like an engine that would not stop churning inside her the hero smiled bravely spoken but where am i going i dont know he said its better that way i assure you irina stared at him with wide eyes she was fighting back the tears the hero swam up to her he took her in his arms kissed her hard on the lips come back to me irina he whispered i dont know what id do without you irinas heart was beating so loud she could hardly hear him she searched the universe in his eyes spoke to him wordlessly in that peculiar silence of communication she had learned from him then lara and tatiana were standing on the coping its time the hero said bending down they pulled irina from the pool what is it mars said to captain nikolev that is of paramount importance to you the sovereignty and security of the soviet union you did not hesitate no comrade mars nodded they were sitting in the command center of department n mars was at a small desk reviewing the monitored communications of suspected white star personnel over the past twelve hours captain nikolev was manning a sophisticated electronics console its good to be sure of yourself captain mars said that is something that fades with stamina as youth gives way to middle age he looked at captain nikolev you are what thirtyfive thirtytwo comrade there you have it mars said almost wistfully youth must have its day he smiled enigmatically like perestroika almost immediately his mouth twisted as if he had tasted spoiled food tell me captain how do you feel about the americanization of russia i beg your pardon dont do that mars balked dont play the loyal but dullwitted soldier with me captain you may gull your superiors but they are only army men after all you cant fool me i know the extent of your intelligence i know about your studies your passion for history that has led you to unearth the levels of authorized histories down through the decades comrade not to worry captain your secret is safe with me but dont tell me that you are unaware of the americanization of our country the military must now go begging to a committee formed from the congress of peoples deputies if it wants to change anything including the location of post latrines budget increases oh no it must go before an oversight committee which knows nothing about capabilities liabilities national security then there are the independent farmers who are now being paid in foreign currency in direct competition with the collectives mars shrugged and what about the kgb we are forced to endure the excruciating nitpicking examinations of our present structure while submitting meekly to the grossest of theatrical public lamentations by known dissidents and subversives allowed into the congress berating us for what they see as our past sins he grunted this is not perestroika its america as i understand it captain nikolev said perestroika is merely an experiment an experiment that has gone terribly awry mars said when nikolev made no further comment he continued we have gone from trying to emulate a perfect model to wanting to emulate a thoroughly corrupt one in terms you can easily understand captain it is akin to the ancient britons wanting to base their culture on that of rome in the time of caligula utterly incomprehensible utterly reprehensible what is happening to us captain are we to lose all sense of ourselves of what makes russia unique in all the world our culture is being subverted by the very people who govern us the cia no longer needs radio free america its got the president to do its subversive work for it i suppose its all in how you look at things nikolev said its a telling lesson in how interpretation subverts intent dont you think spoken like a true diplomat mars laughed youre wasting your talents in the border guards i can tell you as you no doubt have suspected nikolev said my job affords me the luxury of time to pursue my own interests it is altogether beyond my comprehension how you can hold any love for history captain when our socalled scholars keep rewriting it i would have thought that you of all people would see the necessity for revisionism you interest me captain mars said perhaps you too understand what an elusive and treacherous beast the truth is comrade i am not even certain that i understand the definition of truth mars laughed yes indeed captain there is more to you than meets the eye he nodded toward the bank of electronics what news the same captain nikolev said irina ponomarevas car is still in the same spot it has not moved since we began monitoring it it is parked six blocks from your apartment i have four of my men watching it you do marss head came up who told you to do that no one comrade i thought it would be pro you thought wrong mars snapped get your men out of there at once all we need is for one of them to be spotted irina does not know i am kgb if she sees one of your menand believe me if your men are there this woman will spot him she will never go near the car yes comrade while nikolev made the arrangements mars thought of irina he had to laugh at himself paranoid mars how often in the past had he wondered whether she had made any clandestine contacts perhaps with american white star sympathizers while she had been abroad in the united states after all she had had midlevel security clearances and therefore had not been monitored by the kgb as closely as say natasha mayakova had been during her tours of new york but he had had cause to be suspicious he reminded himself righteously did she not have definite opinions about the national minorities inside the ussr opinions that frankly had concerned mars oh yes and mars cleverly had made those questionable opinions work for him when he had sent her off to try to pry open valeri denysovich and ultimately irina had proved her worth to him when her amazing amateur sleuthing had uncovered natasha mayakova the link between the traitor valeri denysovich and the hero damn valeri denysovich marss fist crashed onto the tabletop making captain nikolev start comrade mars was already looking over the monitoring of white star transmissions they seem to have sent some kind of distress message into the west mars rubbed at his face we havent fully broken their code yet but we have enough to make some sense out of the garble he looked up at captain nikolev do you think that white star is desperate enough to ask for direct help from the west even if they have nikolev said who would be foolish enough to respond hmm mars contemplated the transcripts as if they were tea leaves from which he could divine the future after a time he picked up a small interoffice memo said an american diplomatic mission has logged a flight plan into moscow so american diplomatic missions happen all the time mars flipped the memo over to captain nikolev but take a look at where this particular mission is coming from tokyo yes mars said interesting because tokyo is where the white star sos we intercepted was sent to captain nikolev shrugged could be a coincidence mars took the memo back without saying a word captain nikolev watched him as he clipped the memo to the transmission transcripts in a moment mars raised his head the mobile units are standing by yes comrade the moment miss ponomarevas car begins to move i want to know about it if im sleeping wake me if im eating pull the fork from my hand clear absolutely comrade the hotel rossiya an enormous twentystory structure built in an undistinguished style that in russia passed for modern took up the south side of an entire block of razin street the street was named after a wellknown cossack leader a scourge of czars and somehow it seemed appropriate to the state to house so many tourists here irina went into the front entrance to the rossiya and as tatiana had instructed her to do went up to the front desk and asked if there were any messages for mrs kubysheva there were irina took the plain white envelope went across the lobby up the stairs into one of the many restaurants in the hotel locating the rest room she went in locked herself in a stall she slit open the envelope read it twice through her heart was hammering so hard in her chest that when the door to the rest room swung open she wondered how the ladies who came in didnt hear it memorizing the instructions irina tore the paper and envelope into tiny bits threw them into the toilet she flushed twice making certain that not one scrap of paper was left in the bowl in the rest room she rinsed her hands but she did not look at herself in the giltedged mirrors she went out of the rossiya by a side entrance the onion domes of the cathedral of st basil dominated the near distance she was not far from the kremlin and she shuddered as if it were winter and she without her furlined coat the instructions had urged her to go by foot and by bus and irina scrupulously heeded this advice sensibly she did not want to look around to see if she was being followed but she found herself staring like a cat into windowpanes the glass of passing cars and trams in order to catch the reflections of as many of those around her as she could see she made a circuit of trolleybuses using routes that paralleled one another ending up essentially where she had begun then she set off by foot and at length came to the far end of red square the moskva was dark and muddy and the sky was so full of clouds that she could not see her reflection in the water as she crossed over the moskvoretsky bridge that was all right with her it seemed anyway as if another irina ponomareva was engaged in this terrifying espionage enterprise past dobryninskaya square she came at last to the zamoskvorechye the district beyond the moskva she saw the intourist buses exhausts bluing the heavy gray sky and on bolshaya polyanka street the lovely facade of the church of st gregory of neocasarea in the sanctuary irina prayed for valeri for herself but especially for odysseus the lies of the intourist guides fell on her ears like acid the tourists shuffled behind the guide like sheep to the slaughter death and destruction were never far from her consciousness now and she was frightened for herself as if she could no longer recognize her own moral center let alone the moral centers of those around her every step i take down this path she thought i am more lost as i push back the boundaries of what i will and will not do will there be no end she was finished with her prayers she walked from the sanctuary into the sacristy it was quiet here the droning of the intourist guide indistinct far away the shadows hung like shrouds thick embroidered with threads of black among the shades of gray irina started when a robed priest touched her arm she was about to say something when he put his finger against his lips his hood hid his face he beckoned and she nodded followed him out of the sacristy down a dark musty hall through a wooden door down worn stone steps it became cold and dank she smelled tallow fermenting wine and mold she sneezed at the foot of the stairs the priest pushed back his hood revealing the strawberry birthmark this way sergei said he did not offer his name and irina did not ask sergei took her by a circuitous route through the crypt until they came to the place where he and valeri had made their temporary camp irina saw the young girl on the makeshift straw pallet my daughter valeri bondasenko said stepping out of the shadows i know you believed that i had no children a necessary lie no one knows about her my daughters illness could have been used against me why is she here the kgb discovered her existence and her whereabouts in one terrible blow irina looked at him they made natasha tell them valeri nodded my god is she alive or dead i have no way of knowing oh valeri i may have killed her ive been such a fool no not a fool koshka youd been lied to so much you just lost your ability to tell fact from fiction he gave her a rueful smile dont blame yourself please you were up against the best you had no chance to come through this intact you and mars valerie came closer to her yes but you she said why did you have to lie to me i thought i was protecting you valeri said at least thats what i told myself i had read your dossier i knew about your family background what you had suffered at the hands of the kgb i convinced myself that though i sought to use you against mars i would spare you knowledge about him that would cripple you i felt that if you were ignorant of who mars really was you would be more natural with him valeri shook his head ruefully you see koshka ive become such a skillful liar that i had no trouble fooling myself i didnt understand that i was falling in love with you that each day i was sending you out into incalculable danger what happened to natashaher arrest and interrogationcould have happened to you had mars begun to suspect you were spying on him for me in the beginning i ignored that danger because i was obsessed with destroying mars he moved toward her then at last i understood what i was doing to youand to myself dont irina said i no longer know whether i want to be close to you you hurt me deeply valeri i didnt mean to you must believe that irina said nothing valeri said you must have forgiven me you came didnt you i came because odysseus asked me to he said it was important that i would have a chance to actively work for freedom he was right irina stared at him but right now odysseus is beside the point is he valeri said why we are working toward the same end perhaps it is your methods that i find so offensive frankly from where i stand i dont see all that much difference between you and mars mars volkov has been systematically interrogating odysseus ever since he came out of his coma mars volkov picked up natasha mayakova and subjected her to articulated interrogation what does that mean even i dont know but it could include beating starving sleep deprivation electric shock drug inj stop it irina put her hands to her ears i m just trying to set the record straight irinas shoulders slumped your efforts are noted thank you he said formally there was a deep almost hostile silence between them before it went on long enough to become irrevocable valeri said how did we come to this point koshka you tell me irina said wearily do you want me to say its my fault all right its my fault i never should have lied to you but how could i have known what youd be like how could i possibly have trusted you you dont see it do you irina shook her head sadly you condemn yourself with your own words look at what your work has made of you valeri you are suspicious of everyone you cant allow anyone to get close to you for fear they may turn out to be your enemy but youre wrong koshka i was close to natasha mayakova my heart breaks for what happened to her and you irina i love you no valeri i dont believe you know the meaning of the word love but i dont blame you your work comes first it always has and i see the necessity of it truly i do i dont know how i feel about you and thats all right i dont think it a good idea to examine that part of me right nowmaybe ever forever is a long time koshka especially in your line of work irina said and now that its minehowever temporarilyi suppose wed better get on with it then youll help us oh valeri how your face lights up like a child at easter irina smiled i had forgotten how nice your face is when youre happy valeri gripped her arms irina i cannot overemphasize the element of danger involved mars is out for my blood hes mobilized the kgb border guards to find me if youre trying to frighten me youre doing a firstclass job of it youll be more careful if youre frightened valeri said now listen you need to get to my apartment you know the toshiba laptop you must somehow get it out of the apartment it was at that moment that irina almost told him that she had found his ghost in the machine that she knew much of the inner workings of white star including the identity of its leader but she bit her lip instead sure that he would not allow her anywhere near his apartment if he knew she had so much critical information inside her head once i get it out of your apartment then what irina said i cant very well walk around the streets of moscow carrying an illegal computer of course not valeri said do you have access to a car yes ah good valeri said breathing a sigh of relief at last the tide seems to be turning in our favor dont you just hate americans mars said i met an american once captain nikolev said i was off duty of course the border guards is not something the state wishes tourists to be aware of i met him outside the gates to the kremlin he seemed a decent chap really full of questions but he had no real idea of how this country works thats just it mars said hotly americans have no idea how anything works not politics not economics not even social dynamicsespecial not social dynamics theyre far too busy rooting around bloomingdales and tiffanys to be of any value to their fellow man like khrushchev you want to bury them comrade no captain not bury them mars said i want to eradicate them then youve set yourself an impossible task mars looked at him do you really think so thats interesting coming from a scholar of history rome fell so did byzantium why not america to be brutal comrade because it is not democracy that has been found deficient as a form of government but communism the theories of marx and engels are simply inadequate its a fact sad though it may be to contemplate poland hungary rumania czechoslovakia east germany weve had to relinquish control of our colonies as the western nations were once obliged to do with theirs and why not desperate men must resort to desperate measures our own economy is in a shambles we cannot even feed our own people corruption and alcoholism are rampant throughout a bureaucracy that is second to none in its bloatedness selfimportance and obstructionism we simply have to face facts the path we have set out on is a dead end and where are we to go then mars said fiercely where will it end with a bloomingdales and tiffanys opening on gorky street with our women wearing designer blue jeans and sequined jackets his face was livid that is not the solution to lose ourselves in the mania of americanization i reject that despicable notion in the days of the ancient britons captain nikolev said the lure of rome was irresistible it was an endlessly fascinating place a pit full of quicksand mars said theres the truth if only nikolev said with an ironic tone we could recognize it his eyes darted to the electronic console he was manning what is it captain irina ponomarevas car nikolev said its begun to move when irina got to valeris apartment she circled the block three times cruising slowly doing what valeri had advised her looking for kgb men who might be staked out watching the place if they have spared anybody at all it wont be more than one man he had told her they know im not stupid enough to try to get back there in any event irina used a great deal of caution she parked around the back went into the rear entrance of the building next door and down into the cellar valeri had told her that his building and the one next to it had once been one and the cellars still connected ten minutes later irina emerged into the hallway of valeris building she stood quietly in the open doorway to the fire stairs slowing her breathing trying to listen for small sounds beyond the pumping of her heart her eyes were open all the way around and their pupils were fully dilated someone came out of his apartment and irina ducked back into the stairwell she could smell boiled cabbage and stale tobacco the door closed a key turned and heavy footfalls sounded in the corridor the elevator whined opened closed whined again descending to the lobby stillness creeping like shadows with the movement of the sun across the afternoon sky there were no dezhumayas in either of these buildings snoops who in years gone by would keep track of everyone and everything going in and out unofficial adjuncts to the kgb some things at least had finally changed in moscow from where she stood irina could see valeris front door it looked all right closed just as she had left it but was that an illusion marss people must have been through the place if only to be thorough searching for clues to valeris whereabouts kgb keep calm irina shuddered and for a moment her resolve wavered she could just turn around go down the stairs to the basement cross over and leave via the building next door simple no one would know that she had even come near the place but the fact was it wasnt so simple freedom was a complex issue one that she saw now she had been obsessed with ever since she had returned from cambridge how could she turn her back on freedom now if she turned away where would she go back to her apartment to wait for mars volkov to find her and debrief her about her conversations with odysseus what would she do when mars was finished with her return to her dronelike job at the ministry of education no no she could not go back she would choke to death on her own despair her feet were set on this new path and she knew that she must follow it to its end or she would never be able to live with herself the other side of the mirror was too tantalizing too filled with wonders for her ever to contemplate stepping back irina stood trembling with fear as she inhaled the smells of the building the elevator hummed on its way toward another assignation on another floor a baby cried a radio played a snatch of martial music then was still gathering her courage like a cloak around her irina ventured into the hallway she went quickly to valeris door slid her key into the lock turned it she closed her hand over the knob and turning it let herself into the apartment she knew immediately that people had been here the stillness was the same as when she had been here before but there were smells lingering in the air halfremembered reminders a whiff of body odor in the dusty air of the hallway a hint of cheap tobacco in the stale air of the bedroom she saw no butts anywhere and she did not notice anything out of place whoever had been in here searching had been circumspect irina held her breath until she reached the kitchen but there it was the illegal toshiba laptop sitting comfortably where it had always been on the corner of the chopping block crossing the kitchen irina slammed down the top of the computer unplugged the cord from the current converter stuffed both into the computers carrying case then fit the computer itself in zipped the case closed she had just grabbed the case by its soft handles when she heard the scrabbling sounds at the front door her blood froze in her veins the contents of her stomach threatened to return to her mouth kgb keep calm mary mother of god irina looked around her im trapped she thought then no the window she threw open the kitchen window ducked stepped quickly out onto the fire escape she turned shut the window behind her stood with her back against the filthy concrete and brick facade of the building below her was telegraph street irina closed her eyes imagining herself kneeling in the sanctuary of the nearby church of the archangel gabriel she was there as a child with her mother inhaling the heady incense hearing voices raised in prayer listening to the incomprehensible sacraments if only she could turn back time her eyes flew open as she heard a voice say is there any evidence that she was here the front door was unlocked captain search the apartment irina turned her head strained to get an oblique look through the windowpane in a moment she saw a young goodlooking man in a gray uniform with red accents valeri in the dankness of the crypt saying mars is out for my blood hes mobilized the kgb border guards to find me how did they find me irina asked herself was i followed or were they watching the apartment i thought i had been so careful oh god how stupid i am shes already left captain why did she come here silence is anything missing just the computer captain ah the young uniformed man said the computer he turned away from the window find her irina could hear him say if she slips by us comrade volkov will have the lot of you reassigned to sinkiang kgb keep calm how many of them are there irina wondered shaking with terror theyre like ants crawling over a picnic blanket ive got to get off the blanket before they eat me alive when she could no longer see anyone through the kitchen window irina began to climb down along the rusting catwalks at any moment she expected shouts to be raised as one of the border guards contingent spotted her but nothing happened she gained the ground without incident the toshiba computer pulled at her left arm if only i can make it to the car she thought ill be all right she went along telegraph street fearful that someone would wonder what it was she was lugging around with her it had begun to rain instead of heading directly for the car irina sought shelter she stood hidden within the deep shadows of a building doorway the toshiba tucked behind her legs invisible to anyone passing by she watched the street with frightened haunted eyes she could feel the bars across her moon heading downward to close around her she could feel the arctic cold of the winter that never ended bones strewn across a bleak field of ice frozen siberian tundra catching the snow as it silently fell from a featureless sky her nightmare taking shape around her irina scrutinized the faces of everyone who passed by she peered into rainstreaked car windows everyone was a potential enemy and she thought its happening to me so soon so soon i have become afraid of everything and everyone must this be the price of freedom havent i any other choice thunder rolled through the canyons of the city and it became as dark as midnight once or twice a flash of lightning lit the street in a sickly colorless burst of energy making irina start nervously it was pouring the kgb must be nearby she knew and she suspected that the longer she remained in the area the greater her chance was of getting picked up such was her anxiety and singlemindedness it never occurred to her to ditch the toshiba in the nearest trashcan besides even she knew that making a run for it on foot now would be foolish the kgb would spot her within minutes the car was her only salvation once she was in it she could blend into traffic take back streets shortcuts be able to double back on herself to make certain that no one was following her picking up the computer and ducking her head irina ventured out into the rain heading for the car it was slow going the drainage in this section of the city was due for repairs but they had not come through as scheduled and as a result every time it stormed rainwater would sluice through the gutters occasionally slopping onto the sidewalks irina passed several babushkas dragging their net shopping bags behind them a street merchant huddled with sodden newspaper over her head dancing from one foot to another to avoid the water as best she could as her pathetic display of driedout beets and blasted turnips was battered by the foul weather once when irina suspected that she was being followed she ducked into a small building clattered through the worn tiles of the dismal lobby at the rear entrance she glanced back saw the obvious trail of water and nearly burst into tears ill never get the hang of being devious she thought miserably then she remembered that she had still eluded the kgb and she took some solace from that fact perhaps im not as inept as i think she told herself bravely as she pushed out the rear door she found herself in a filthy back alley someone had forgotten to take in their laundry and linen flapped wetly over her head in the sodden wind for a moment she was at a loss as to which way to go then glancing down the end of the alley she saw part of the rear of the church of the archangel gabriel and regained her bearings irina hurried down the alley the toshiba was growing heavier by the minute but she tried not to think of the weight she concentrated on getting to her car slipping through the net the kgb had thrown around valeris apartment she emerged from the alley turned left down the block a black zil turned onto the street came cruising toward her its speed far slower than was normal as if its occupants were checking each side of the block irina ducked back into the alley held her breath as the zil came abreast of where she was hiding she wished she were twelve again thin as a rail able to disappear in a sliver of shadow she imagined herself gone from here as the zil stopped abreast of the alley her pulse thundered in her ears and she was certain it would give her away the zil sat for what seemed an interminable time its windows were tinted black and she could not see inside truth to tell she did not want to look inside what was happening in there had they spotted her were they playing with her as they would a mouse at last the zil rolled on irina took a deep shuddering breath as her eyes followed the zil down the street it turned at the far corner disappeared she headed down the street in the opposite direction she would have liked to stop at the church sink to her knees pray for safety for valeri the hero as well as herself but there was no time still she spoke to god as she rounded the corner to the street where she had left the car she stopped cautious again the street was deserted the car sat where she had left it but suddenly it didnt seem like a sanctuary this was after all the car mars had given her what if it had been followed or worse was bugged irina looked furtively around her heart pounding in her chest what was she to do she had to get back to valeri with the computer yet with the kgb out she could not walk there or take a tram but if the car was bugged she would lead them straight to valeri there was so little time sweat rolled down the back of her neck as she worked through the problem she stared at the car it seemed to beckon her on a safe haven it occurred to her that she was already thinking like a fugitive and that frightened her further behind her she heard the soft swish of car tires on the wet asphalt of the street and she jumped thinking of the black zil all right she thought i ll use the car but abandon it well before i get to the church once i get to the other side of the kremlin ill be all right i can walk the last few blocks making sure im not followed having made up her mind she hurried to the car dropped the keys in her anxiety retrieved them unlocked the drivers door she threw the toshiba on the passengers seat slid in herself shut and locked the door behind her the ignition turned and when she heard the engine cough to life she breathed an enormous sigh of relief she stared out the windshield it was already fogged and she used the cuff of her coat to wipe away the condensation she wondered vaguely why there should be so much condensation when she had just now got in the car that kind of mist came from human breath that was when she became aware of the slight stirring behind her a hand clamped her shoulder and she gave a little scream did i startle you irina that was thoughtless of me she saw his movieidol face in the rearview mirror and she thought for a moment that her heart had ceased to beat then it thudded home and she felt as if she had been punched in the chest she said his name involuntarily like a sigh mars thirteen moscow star town tori was dreaming of koi of the purity of whiteness stained red of shiny innards slithering into sunlight steaming like an aztec sacrifice she was meditating on the uncompromising will of the warrior spirit she was wondering how it was the japanese among many other ancient peoples of the world had determined that blood could purify the most corrupted spirit when russell woke her had she dreamed about the blood of koi or the blood of christ weve just landed outside novosibirsk for refueling russell said were halfway to moscow although they were at a civilian airfield and had logged an official flight plan the military commander of the nearby air base had sent his adjutant who was in the company of a leanfaced plainclothes man an obvious kgb agent the leanfaced mans cheeks were scarred by a severe case of adult acne and his cheap suit seemed to grab him under the arms and in the crotch tori wondered stifling a guffaw whether after eight hours in that flexible torture chamber he would talk in a falsetto the two men scrutinized the false diplomatic documents the tides and legends section of the mall office in tokyo had prepared just as the soviets in ulan bator their first refueling stop had done everything had been preprinted all that had to be done by titles and legends was to insert the proper names titles border frankings and so forth add several sets of official orders and the documents were ready to go the two men made a great show of taking notes conferring among themselves quizzing russell mostly they stared at toris legs then apparently frustrated they went forward to grill the flight crew forty minutes later they exited the plane but not before scowling menacingly at russell and taking a last lingering look at toris legs horny devils tori said russell smiling at the scowling angry faces said youd be horny too if you were stuck in the back of beyond with only your kalishnikov to keep you warm when the russians were finally gone russell relaxed theres one thing that still bothers me about this whole affair bernards lost himself in if he isnt part of hitasuras supercoke schemeand im as convinced as you are that he isntthen how the devil is he getting the funds to buy these nuclear weapons you can bet the coalition isnt giving them to him and i can tell you unequivocally that he isnt using the mails money even bernardif hed a mind tocouldnt embezzle the amount hed need without my finding out pretty damn quick thats a good question tori considered this i hadnt thought of that but even if i had i doubt whether koi or hitasura would have provided any help on that score bernard knew nothing of hitasuras finances and knowing bernard you can be damn sure the reverse was true as well russell looked thoughtful you know i dont believe ill ever really understand what happened between you and koi what kind of bond could there possibly have been between the two of you frankly it scares me to think that you could have related to anything about her oh russ there was a whole other side of koi you never saw koi was a stone killer so am i she enjoyed torturing deke there youre wrong tori said when she tortured deke she was torturing herself she loathed what she did but she felt she was cursed that she deserved to be loathedby everyone someone like that is to be pitied not despised she had to be stopped from repeating what she did to deke i stopped her russ toris eyes held his as if in an invisible vise and that felt good cant tell you how goodbecause i didnt have to resort to killing her he nodded i can see that sure but look russ koi was driven by demons maybe they werent the exact same demons that drive bernard but theyre close enough do you think bernard is any less haunted than koi was the only difference between them is that bernard has found a way to live with his demons but dont you see that in time koi would have become another fukuda and what has bernard godwin become over time russ can you answer that with any degree of certainty no then ill tell you bernard is as much a stone killer as koi was but his motives are so altruistic thats mall central thinking tori said motives dont count heremorality does at least koi had the courage to face what she had become and killed herself he shook his head i dont understand a person who prefers death to life preference has nothing to do with it toris eyes blazed death was an atonement for her sins for koi to die in so honorable a fashion as seppuku was to cleanse her spirit if i compare her to bernard i think she had the right idea russell rose all this talk of death is making me claustrophobic he went off to the head tori looked out the perspex window stared at nothing christ she breathed how can he be so obtuse when hes also so insightful then she shook her head followed him she wanted him to understand to at last grasp a concept that was not grounded in logic mathematics binary languages russell for an unbearably long moment they stared at each other then russell grabbed her shirtfront pulled her inside the head hard against him nothings going to save you now he said hoarsely just before his lips came down over hers i dont want to be saved she moaned into him toris mouth opened and her tongue twined with his her back was arched and her breasts were crushed against him she felt dizzy and weak as if she had lost all strength in her upper body at the same time her legs felt heavy as if they were buried in sand her thighs were on fire and she could not seem to catch her breath russell was pulling apart her blouse his hands running roughly over her breasts she moaned into his mouth as he found her nipples she could not wait her own hands searching for his belt and fly frantically pulling down his trousers feeling him rise deliciously into her hand cramming him beneath her short skirt her other hand pulling aside her underclothes ramming him full length inside her they both cried out at the same time and russell slammed her repeatedly against the bulkhead if they were making noise neither of them cared if they were to be discovered it did not matter they were beyond caring about anything but their joined hot flesh their liquid union the mutual fire that threatened to consume them tori felt filled to overflowing she wrapped her arms around his head filled the spaces between her fingers with his thick hair russ russ oh his mouth was at her throat the sides of her neck her ears her jaw he gathered her hard breasts in his hands squeezing them as he hammered at her until tori almost fainted with pleasure her eyes were closed she rubbed her face against the coarseness of his cheeks and jolts of electricity penetrated all the way into her lower belly she could feel the tension come into him in increments not the tension of conflict and strife with which she had become all too familiar but the tiny ribbonings of a luscious tautness in the last few indescribable moments before release a desire to drown in bliss then he groaned deep in his throat a growl really drawn out and heartfelt and she felt him draw in against her so tightly that she could not breathe as he convulsed this in turn set her off her eyes flying open her mouth gasping all thought obliterated then all too quickly he was sliding out of her no she moaned oh no not yet but he had dropped to his knees his mouth found her burrowing in and up his tongue like an adder flicking at the core of her and she almost screamed she worked her hips around and around her hands on either side of his head lovingly stroking him as she shuddered again and again her upper torso folded over him her legs shaking and jerking her head heavy spinning in the full flux of desire oh god tori collapsed against him and they tumbled in a heap to the floor she took him in her hands whispered i want you hard again right now russell laughed only one of us is from krypton remember give me a couple of minutes to recover tori kept her hands on him moving and as it turned out he didnt need a couple of minutes when at last they were fully sated tori rested her head against his chest she liked hearing the beating of his heart running at such a different pace from hers it was as if from this one percussion line she could determine the scope of the music that moved himwhat he liked what he didnt what made him happy what made him sad what comforted him what frightened him it was an illusion she knewpeople were far too complex for all their secrets to be revealed in such a waybut it was a lovely illusion for all that almost to moscow tori said wryly when they had returned to their seats and all we can think about is sex its a survival instinct russell said we both know where were headed that theres nothing but trouble waiting for us when we land and yet were still going theres a part of us that does what it has to to remind us were still alive is that what our making love was to you a primitive instinct i see that once again ive said the wrong thing you bet you have tori said pulling away calm down russell said tori shook away his hold dont tell me what to do im not for christs sake telling you what to do well how do you expect me to act when weve just made such wonderful love and you tell me that didnt it mean anything more to you than some kind of anthropological mating dance of course it did russell shouted havent i already told you i love you but i havent heard a word in reply in the ringing silence they stared at each other sometimes i wish i didnt love you russell said in a low voice were so different youre such a mystery to me you can be quite frightening at times the things youre capable of i dont really know what im letting myself in for loving you we never do know tori said softly isnt that part of the excitement of love the not knowing the future of finding out together tori russell said do you love me oh russ she kissed him hard on the lips when she pulled her head away she said im afraid too of what of losing myself in you im not your father she stared at him what do you mean isnt that what happened to you you wanted to lose yourself in him and because you couldnt you lost yourself in bernard godwin what a horrible thing to say perhaps but its the truth russell held her tori this is what bernard saw in youthe wild child of tokyo do you think he came upon you by accident that he hadnt studied you for months understanding your particular psychology was how he was able to snare you keep you loyal to him this is bernards specialty tori sought to digest all this she watched water droplets streaking the window it seemed to her as if that horizontal rain represented the strange new world opening to her im still the wild child russ she said i dont want to lose her russell stroked her hair it seems hard to realize i know but you wont lose her no matter what happens tori closed her eyes shuddered is that why its so hard to pull away partly russell said theres also the fear of there being only you now to rely on tori opened her eyes but thats not true now is it she was crying i love you russ they held each other in silence for some time at last he stirred and said you know discipline dictates that we turn this plane around right now love and fieldwork are deadly companions its too late for second thoughts tori said is it always serious always duty first thats you russ not always he said reaching for her not anymore the flew on toward moscow captain nikolev was at department n headquarters immersed in the drudgery of paperwork connected with the bondasenkoponomareva stakeout when the routine report came over the wire it concerned the american diplomatic mission from tokyo being held up at sheremetyevo airport because of bureaucratic red tape he immediately got up from the typewriter he was thinking of the memo mars had shown him and marss firm if unstated belief that this diplomatic mission had more to do with white star than it did with international diplomacy he rang downstairs to the garage for a driver and car grabbed his hat off the rack and took the concrete stairs two at a time down to where the black zil waited it was pouring and traffic was snarled he instructed his driver to take the chaika lane out of the city so they could make good time to sheremetyevo it was important now that he arrive before someone from the american embassy did to bail the diplomatic mission out but even with all the cynicism kgb foreknowledge provided he was unprepared for the two americans he found enmeshed in the exquisitely inefficient soviet bureaucratic machine it was not the big handsome american male with the hard eyes and sharp tongue of a professionalalthough hardly a professional diplomatwho threw captain nikolev but the stunning wellbuilt blond with eyes so fantastic that nikolev had to force himself to look away or forever be mesmerized if possible her tongue was sharper than that of her companions she was wearing a short skirt and a sleeveless blouse captain nikolev stared at the definition of the muscles in her arms he had never before in his life seen a pair of legs like those his mind was busy nicking past possibility after possibility who was this singular woman the two americans were surrounded by a clot of suspicious dulleyed officials shaking off his amazement captain nikolev waded into the mess with the assurance and aplomb of a member of an invisible club which operated by an entirely different set of rules from the rest of the local citizens he glanced at the diplomatic missions papers and though he was convinced that they were forgeries before he even saw them he could find no hard evidence to back up that suspicion the papers seemed genuine to him and he was certain that should he hand them over to the kgb lab its results would likely not differ from his first visual impression the lab could do the same with any americanor british french japanesedocument one could name so what was the point in trying to spot a forgery one had to go by instinct in these matters captain nikolev had learned not by evidence though of course one needed to be thorough experience had taught him that professionals rarely gave you any evidence to work with so it was useless to waste too much time searching for it mr slade miss nunn captain nikolev said in russian as he introduced himself do either of you speak russian i speak it passably well tori said though i admit its been some time since i had cause to use it captain nikolev smiled inclined his head your accent is not terrible miss nunn how is your vocabulary well have to see yes nikolev thought that we will he closed their documents handed them back everything seems in order he said really tori was surprised then why have we been sitting here wrangling with immigration for over an hour nikolev shrugged it seems to me that bureaucracies are the same the world over he smiled someone perhaps was concerned that your flight plan overflew the military air base outside novosibirsk tori said the fact is we were detoured around it of course i understand local security outside of moscow is quite good quite stable but nevertheless he smiled again i hope it would not be too much of an inconvenience if i had some of my men check your aircraft im afraid thats impossible tori said we are on a diplomatic mission our carrier is united states government equipment weand ithave immunity i promise you nothing of a personal nature will be disturbed i suppose some of my superiors are understandably disturbed that we might find longrange lenses or cameras tori said i can assure you theres nothing of that nature on board not to dispute your honesty miss nunn but policy dictates youll leave our airplane alone captain unless youre prepared to initiate an international incident our government takes a dim view of the violation of diplomatic rights captain nikolev hesitated for just a moment then a smile broke out on his face of course he said youre quite right i cant imagine what i was thinking of he gestured them through immigration wont you follow me i have a car waiting to take you to tchaikovsky street to make up for the inconvenience tori saw his expectant look she knew she was being tested she already had the disquieting sense that this captain nikolev of the kgb border guards did not for a moment believe that she and russell were diplomats but how was that possible for a moment she had the odd even more disquieting sensation that this man had been waiting for them to land but all that had been logged with the soviet authorities was their flight plan that could hardly be enough to alert the kgb and that nonsense about the air base at novosibirsk had not fooled her had the everparanoid soviets really been worried they would never have approved the flight plan in the first place she wondered what was going on behind the carefully erected facades as they headed through the terminal russell said in english what the hells going on tori grinned like an idiot at him this nice kgb captain has been kind enough to offer us a ride into town hes too kind russell said catching her expression which said who knows who understands english around here my thought exactly captain nikolevs driver had the black zils curbside doors open and they all piled into the car nikolev had previously told his driver not to take the chaika lane inside moscow and the man did not take the route that would have brought them directly to the american embassy on tchaikovsky street i thought nikolev said that you might enjoy a spot of sightseeing before i drop you at your destination thats most kind of you captain tori said after she had translated for russells benefit neither of us have been in moscow before a first diplomatic mission nikolev enthused now i must make this sightseeing something to remember why is it tori asked herself that im hearing sinister undertones in everything he says as if hes saying one thing and meaning something altogether different he took them past the lenin hills and the state university where yesterday he and mars volkov had had their discussion along the moskva past gorky park so green and lush in the full onset of summer captain nikolev stuck his head out the window he could almost taste the ice cream as he watched children with their mothers queuing up to the mobile stand clamoring for their treat such a beautiful time of year nikolev said to tori you are so lucky to be here now luck has nothing to do with it tori said our orders from the state department brought us here of course nikolev brought his head back inside the zil it was odd he thought fencing with a woman he would have much preferred to deal with the man russell slade but since slade obviously did not speak russian nikolev knew for the time being hed just have to make the best of it you know he said now all this sightseeing has made me hungryand you well youve just come off a twelvehour plane ride please allow me to take you to lunch much as we appreciate the offer tori said i think wed better be getting to our first appointment i believe the time change has made you confused miss nunn nikolev shot her his best smile you missed your first appointment while you were unfortunately held up at sheremetyevo in fact were it not for me im afraid that you and mr slade would have been stuck there the whole day besides its lunchtime now and i know the best restaurant in moscow in fact tori and russell were famished but the moment they turned onto krasnokursantsky street tori was all too aware of the joke being played on them she had heard of lefortovo the state security police interrogation center and prison had even seen photos of its forbidding exterior so had russell what the hell is this he said sitting bolt upright captain nikolev laughed you do not think i am taking you there do you he shook his head that lefortovo is only for spies and criminals the black zil pulled up across the street you are to be my guests at the lefortovo restaurant charming tori said as they stepped out onto the rainwashed sidewalk not really nikolev said apparently ignorant of her sarcasm he led them up the steps the place has little charm i admit but the food is good the service even bettermost important in moscow im afraid and its cheap we who are dependent on military salaries must constantly count our rubles they went through the doors i suppose its the same with you and mr slade why would you say that tori asked captain nikolev took off his shinybilled hat and sticking it under his left arm spoke for a moment with the maitre d they were immediately led to a superior corner table when they were settled nikolev studied tori for a long time then he said it is my understanding that government personnel of all types are underpaid is this not so tori chose not to answer him instead she said captain i would very much like to know why you chose this restaurant to take us to surely you knew its locationnot to mention its namewould be repellent to us well yes that did occur to me nikolev said he paused to order them all vodka when the waiter had gone he continued but we have business to discuss and in moscow one must choose ones negotiation site with the utmost care negotiation whats he saying russell asked concerned by the expression on her face when she had translated he said just what the hell does this bozo want this bozo captain nikolev said in almost accentless english wants a chance to make a proposal the silence at the table was deafening tori shot russell a glare that would have taken off his head if her eyes had been lasers nikolev cleared his throat it seemed as if he was as uncomfortable as they were the vodka came to save them allat least temporarily he raised his glass what shall we drink to the dismantling of lefortovo prison tori said an inquiry into its questionable practices captain nikolev said they drank to that but it was a compromise that made tori uneasy this man was after all a captain in the border guards division of the kgb he was on to them no doubt about it but what was his game tori expanded her wa in an effort to catch a glimpse of his strategy she did not like being wholly in the dark she and russell had no sooner stepped into the red sector the enemys territorywhen they had been picked up by that very same enemy or was captain nikolev the enemy that was the danger she recognized to be able to differentiate the enemy from a friend was a cardinal principle of espionage the idea of successfully couching the one inside the other was what made this clandestine world continue to tick in this electronicized computerized age when you got into troublewhether it was an individual a department a countryit was because you had trusted the person who was selling you out to your enemy she felt nothing from this man neither hostility nor camaraderie merely a kind of coiled tension it was different from russells tension when she and he were fighting the russians was more intense darker more opaque and it had many layers it seemed interesting to her that this man should be under so much stress what was he frightened of she wondered i want to at least attempt to explain captain nikolev was saying now breaking in on her thoughts look around you by and large you will see only military men most of them work across the street i know many of them though not well we have never shared an evening meal our children are not friends but they know me and therefore this is a safe haven for me i can take anyone here and no one will talk about it because it will be assumed that these people are my friends my guests or are business associates he cocked his head do you understand i think im beginning to tori said but youd better spell it out for mr slade he isnt as quick as i am is this true nikolev asked russell anxiously perhaps my english will be inadequate your accent isnt terrible tori said but mr slade will i think tax your vocabulary nikolev laughed softly i like humor he said especially in a woman its very comfortable dont you think i think you mean comforting tori said and that depends on the type of humor perhaps if i get to know you better i will receive an entire catalogue of humor nikolev said clearly delighted i would welcome that its said the romans of augustus caesars day had much humor nikolev patiently watched the silent interplay between tori and russell before saying i know youre thinking again what does this bozo want by the way what is a bozo know what a clown is russell said same thing i see nikolev seemed to frown a little then the first course came and he brightened its a set menu here i hope you dont mind not being able to choose were getting used to it tori said they ate more or less in silence when the plates were cleared of the last course nikolev said was it so bad lutece it isnt russell said plopping sugar into his strong russian tea ah a restaurant in paris close russell said captain nikolev nodded apparently satisfied in any case i think we all feel better now yes maybe some of us do russell said pointedly what mr slade means tori said hurriedly is that were still a bit bewildered obviously you want something from us but we still have no idea what it is thats all right for now nikolev said can we say that this time together has proven that we can talk to one another russell said depends about what captain nikolev looked at him for some time as if he could not make up his mind about something important its a matter of trust isnt it he said he took out a handkerchief wiped his brow i have no idea whether i can trust you russell who had just taken some tea was so surprised he almost choked on it he began to cough and his eyes teared tori just sat and stared at nikolev as if he were out of his mind have i said something odd you bet you have tori said russell said you captain are the goddamnedest russian i have ever met yes well perhaps that is something to be proud of you said something before about a proposal tori said have i your assurance that youll listen to what i have to say im more paranoid than she is russell said what kind of proposal an exchange of information you first ivan russell tori said what russell retorted remember where we are tori in a country where were guilty until proven guilty anything we say or do from now on will be used against us in a place not unlike the building across the street talking to this guys like trying to stand in quicksand i think hes as loony as daffy duck excuse me captain nikolev said this daffy duck is he a bozo as well tori put her hands over her face russell said yeah then he turned to her this isnt happening it isnt nikolev said clearly confused russell said where are the guys in baggy pants to squirt us with seltzer they have seltzer here nikolev said calling a waiter he was trying to be helpful thats all right tori said she told the waiter in russian to forget it and he retreated tori hunched over the table captain we have nothing to hide i want that understood from the outset nikolev nodded on the other hand mr slade and i have no way to know whether we can trust you tori for gods sake i understand captain nikolev said his expression showed something of his relief it is like a mexican shootout yes standoff russell said a mexican standoff captain nikolev nodded soberly thank you i will remember that american idioms are so incomprehensible tell me about it pardon i just did lets not start this all over again tori said she spread her hands on the table palms up how do you wish to proceed captain i would like to make my proposal but not here where russell said a villa in the lenin hills tori smiled captain please try to see this situation from our point of view we have had no assurances from you i am speaking english nikolev said immediately kgb agents are not supposed to reveal such things we are to pretend ignorance of english so as to learn more russell said to my way of thinking thats damn little in the way of assurances be fair tori said we havent given him much either she said to nikolev well listen to your proposal captain but thats all well agree to captain nikolev nodded russell groaned great either way i think were about to get fucked at approximately the time that tori and russell were stuck at immigration at sheremetyevo mars volkov was embracing irina then he pushed her from him held her at arms length so he could look into her eyes i was getting worried about you he said your amateur sleuthing is all well and goodand believe me when i tell you i owe you an enormous debt of gratitudebut with valeri and his kgb stooges on the loose when i didnt hear from you i feared the worst in fact i was just about to call the police when you showed up how fortuitous fortuitous indeed kgb keep calm irina was careful to let none of the terror she felt leak into her voice hes not yet ready to reveal himself she thought that means he wants something from me what it seems that the kgb were watching valeris apartment they almost caught me its a good thing im here then mars said the rain beat against the windshield of the car the world was contracting into a tiny gray ball the size of a prison cell irina felt the irrational urge to look at the toshiba portable to make sure it was still there of course it was she stared steadfastly into the teeming mist youre without wipers mars said they were stolen its my fault i forgot to take them with me one day he shrugged there are more in the trunk ill get a pair irina watched him as he slid across the backseat got out went around to the rear of the car she put her hands on the steering wheel then let one slip to the gear lever she saw mars open the trunk bend down all she had to do was release the hand brake throw the car in gear and crash out of the prison mars was contemplating for her simple irina felt her muscles tighten in preparation for the move or was it so simple where was the bonier guards contingent that had had valeris apartment cordoned off surely they hadnt gone and left mars here on his own her hands were shaking so badly that she did not believe that she could drive property not in this downpour not without windshield wipers she heard the trunk slam and she gave a little cry as her heart skipped a beat then mars was coming around attaching the blades he did this with one hand when a moment later he returned to the car he slipped into the front passengers seat he put valeris toshiba between his legs irina looked down saw a pistol in marss right hand it was pointed toward the floorwell i thought i saw one of valeris kgb men mars said when he saw where she was looking a kind of war has broken out between the two of us he put the gun away im afraid you almost got killed coming between us ive done what you asked irina wondered whether her voice sounded as brittle to mars as it did to her she hoped not didnt i discover the connection between natasha and valeri yes he said you did and as i said im grateful valeri and i had come to an odd kind of stalemate surveillance on either side had become virtually impossible we knew each others people far too well he smiled then you came to me like an angel from heaven for that i am also grateful the interior of the car had begun to steam up and he rolled down his window a bit rain pattered against the edge sending a fine spray onto his shoulder he took no notice but im also puzzled irina what were you doing in valeris apartment trying to find the answer to the mystery of white star she turned to face him thinking was it you who tortured poor natasha until she gave up the dark secret of valeris daughter and did you kill her when she was no longer of use to you bastard she said isnt that what you asked me for and what have you found she was acutely aware of the gun in his pocket i searched his apartment and came up with nothing except this mars said what is it valeris computer she said an illegal computer mars said that would be just like valeri denysovich he stared at irina why did you take it kgb keep calm irina fought the numbing terror fought to make her mind work to figure out what she must say to him to appease him yet not to give away i ll answer for you mars said you thought the computer might contain white stars secrets her mind was like a sheet of ice yes what else could she say mars said nothing for a time then he put his head back against the seat rest closed his eyes a slow smile spread across his lips why dont we give it a try too late irina realized her mistake in not throwing the computer away when she had had the chance better it be lost to valeri than land in the hands of the kgb she wept inside for valeri for natasha for white star for herself because this monster had won now she knew what he wanted from her she set the wipers going and the windshield cleared as much as it was going to with the cars primitive and inefficient defroster she held her breath said where shall we go your apartment no mars said star town arbat was swimming in a circle whats the matter with her lara said i dont know the hero admitted he spoke to her in the peculiar clickings that lara did not understand but had grown used to immediately arbat ceased her nervous circling lifted her nose let out with a long string of speech somethings wrong the hero said what i dont know neither does arbat but something very bad has happened volkov yes probably the hero said he swam over to where arbat was put his arms around her she nuzzled his face dont worry he whispered then repeated it in her language it was then that lara understood the depth of his concern he had been trying to comfort himself lara came close to him perhaps we need not fear comrade volkov as much as we have in the past i think we have succeeded in making him believe you are turning into something beyond his ken the hero smiled that was a neat trick you swimming underwater to scrape his leg while i went into my seizure you played your role to perfection lara said comrade volkov has seen to it that ive had enough time to work out the rough edges lara was abruptly serious she touched his arm all this playacting is one thing but what worries me are the real effects of the cosmic radiation you were exposed to what happens when its effects are made manifest what happens when we die the hero asked her rhetorically it might be interesting to contemplate but theres no solid answer is there he smiled reassuringly well just have to wait and see do you think irina will have the courage to wait with you i dont know the hero said truthfully ive tried to explain as best i can what im up against but you know as well as anyone that there is no way to explain the unknowable you love her dont you the hero was silent for a long time hanging in his void of saltwater i love the color between the stars he said that is where much of my mind now dwells in the time no time the dimension where time is twisted like taffy around a spindle ive been shown the limitations of being part of only the taffy now i long to join those inside the spindle you do not need to worry about making me jealous lara said tatiana and i would never betray you now not after what youve done for us you have shown us the power of our past the weaknesses of our present you are our family the hero reached out twined his fingers in laras if i do love irina it is in a way that neither of you can understand certainly i cannot explain what i feel you talk to her without ever speaking thats true as you did with the entity who discovered you between the stars yes what was it like that communication the hero smiled ive told you so many times its like a bedtime story lara said i never grow tired of hearing it all right the hero said and his face screwed up in concentration it was like lying on a bed of nails like running barefoot across a room filled with shards of glass it was like eating so much chocolate at once that your brain boils like hanging in a sensorydeprivation tank your body sloughed off like a memory connected to nothing but the processes of your own mind he closed his eyes and it was as if the world had winked out blackness reigned it was like all of those things happening at once yet it wasnt any of that at all what then all right another image i was farther out in space than any human being has ever been but when the communication began i knew that i had journeyed so far only to have come to the center of things so deep inside that i had found an entirely new existence but inside what i dont know the hero said perhaps time itself lara was very close to him i wish i could understand yes he said softly i wish you could too arbat understands arbat is special and irina she understands too doesnt she the heros eyes were like stars in the blankness of space they radiated warmth as well as light irina knows how the entity and i communicated how i envy her arbat was pushing her nose insistently against the heros hand and a moment later tatiana slipped into the pool with them volkovs back she said quietly ominously irina is with him and so is valeris toshiba portable ah god the heros voice chilled them all on the doorstep to the villa captain nikolev turned to tori and russell said this place belongs to the man from whom i take my orders russell said you mean your superior in the border guards unit no my division has been seconded to department n of the kgb mars volkov the chief of department n is the man who commands my unit hes got wideranging powers tori said i want you to understand that captain nikolev said as part of your assurances this is an enormous risk i am taking he looked at them both then turned unlocked the front door he went immediately across the tile floor showed them where the microphones were hidden he opened up a blond wood console behind a mirrored bar with a false back was a professional reeltoreel tape recorder nikolev took the tape reels from the recorder so that tori and russell would know nothing that was said here was being recorded theres always the possibility of body mikes russell said i suppose we should all strip nikolev laughed he eyed tori thats jake by me they looked at him and he said have i mixed up my idioms again if i were you i wouldnt try to pass for an american just yet russell said tori said youre just a little behind the times thats all when they had assured themselves that none of them was taped with a body mike tori and russell sat on an ugly scandinavian couch hideously upholstered in a dark brown tweed captain nikolev fixed them drinks he was obviously nervous and in need of something to do with his hands but neither tori nor russell touched their vodka on the other hand nikolev knocked his back poured himself another he paced back and forth and tori could feel his tension reaching a new pitch she shifted uncomfortably as his nerves affected her abruptly nikolev faced them said in a world full of lies how are we able to recognize the truth truth comes with trust tori said which is in short supply here russell added there was silence for some time nikolev nodded department n of the kgb of which mars volkov is the chief has been given a mandate to root out the elements of white star and eradicate them succinctly put russell said i am trying nikolev said with some desperation to establish an atmosphere of trust he took a deep breath before we go further i must know something did you come here in response to white stars request for aid is this your proposal russell asked it is the beginning of our exchange of information nikolev looked pained i am under the gun mr slade i wish you could appreciate that were all under the gun tori said keep still russell said as he got up he prowled around the villa when he disappeared into the other rooms nikolev and tori watched each other like gladiators unsure whether to fight or join forces to assassinate the emperor hes a hard man nikolev said pull of suspicion thats what they pay him for and what do they pay you for miss nunn tori got up made her own slow circuit of the room when she returned she stood in front of captain nikolev stared him in the eye they pay me she said to know who our friends are nikolevs gaze flicked to her arms he licked his lips what happens to those who you decide arent your friends i kill them tori said with what she hoped was an expression of great relish i am a friend miss nunn do you believe me tori said nothing when russell came back into the living room nikolev said what were you looking for kgb goons russell said but i guess i m looking at one huh nikolev said you have yet to answer my question before i proceed further i must know whether you have a connection with white star we do tori said christ almighty russell was clearly not happy here comes the death squad why tori said keeping her eye on nikolev for all the captain here knows we could be working for mars volkov i could be lying to draw him out so that he can incriminate himself as a traitor to the state she smiled into nikolevs anxious face isnt that so captain nikolev licked his lips again yes it could be either way but now one way or another the die is cast we must see whether the trust on both sides is justified nikolevs gaze faltered he stared for a time into his glass i come to bury caesar not to praise him russell said what nikolev looked at them i feel a bit like brutus mr slade so forgive me if i take my time about this tori so close to him could feel the constriction in his chest the conflict of emotions battering him if he was being duplicitous he was a master nikolev could bear standing still no longer he walked to the windows that looked out on a balcony and a steep drop as the lenin hills fell away into brush beneath slender pines and larch tori could see his shoulders hunch involuntarily as if he were expecting a blow he said at length there is a planhatched within the kgb but fully agreed to by the militaryto march into lithuania and latvia we are now on the cusp of this mad campaign to return the baltic states which the president in the euphoria of perestroika allowed to slip away from the soviet union russell rocked back and forth on his heels whistling softly tori said nothing nikolev turned to face them he was haloed by the pristine light that fills the sky after a violent storm and his face seemed so young that one could almost imagine peach fuzz on his cheeks instead of whiskers this is of course treason nikolev went on no matter the campaign will begin in thirteen hours dawn tomorrow there will be wholesale slaughter the official story is that the new and as yet unstable baltic governments have been infiltrated by dangerous western elements that threatened the national security of the soviet union in the charged silence that ensued tori said what about the president the president it is felt by these factions within the kgb and the military has become obsessed by the same cult of personality that enveloped yuri andropov at precisely the same moment that the order will be given to invade the baltic states the president of the ussr will be assassinated by his own guards it is the rome of claudius all over again this is madness russell said do you expect us to believe some cockandbull he stopped as tori clutched his arm what has all this to do with us captain surely we are even more powerless than you are at this moment but youre not nikolev said with some urgency not if i can believe you not if there is trust between us you see for a while weve known that white star has been receiving aid in the form of materiel from the west if youre here on behalf of white star then you are a godsend mars volkov has forced valeri bondasenko white stars leader into hiding we cannot find him but as representatives of white stars western support i have no doubt that you have the means to get a message to bondasenko if you can do this tell him what is happening then we have a chance white star is the wild card in this whole equation thats why mars volkov has been given carte blanche to find white star and eradicate it only white star has the power to stop this madness it has the popular support throughout the soviet union it has the people all it has been lacking is the proper armaments but now we believe that what were you going to say captain tori said that it now has the weapons yes nikolev said we have no idea what they are but we suspect that they have been amassing some kind of arsenal to use when they felt the time was right his fist clenched but the time is now you must convince valeri bondasenko of the extreme jeopardy the entire country is in he must use his new weapons to bring white stars power into the kremlin and what will you be doing russell said while were unearthing white stars leader for you not for me not for the kgb nikolev said for the first time showing his impatience for all of the soviet union russell turned to tori cant you see this guy is trying to use us bondasenkos gone so successfully to ground no one can find him nikolev will use us as his bloodhounds as soon as we find bondasenko for him hell come in with his goons and no no that is not my intention i am telling you the truth i think he is tori said but russell waved away her words prove it he said to nikolev but how can i nikolev thought a moment then nodded i will make a proposal mars volkov has captured valeri bondasenkos personal computer it is believed that white stars entire infrastructure is contained in the computers software under no circumstances must volkov be allowed access to that material with it he could break white star inside thirtysix hours i was going to get that computer out of volkovs hands while you were running down bondasenko but now i have a better idea youll come with me youll see firsthand that i am telling the truth i will be putting my lifeand the lives of my handpicked menon the line by defying mars volkov as outsiders you cannot know what an enormous risk that is if we fail we will be summarily executed no trial no incarceration no recompense for our families in the blink of an eye we simply will cease to exist if we go with you tori said well be wasting valuable time weve got to get to bondasenko well before the dawn deadline yes nikolev said so we will all be taking enormous risks there is an increasing chance we will not get to bondasenko in time that is why i resist taking you with me we will be gambling with an entire nation but i see no other method of fulfilling mr slades demand russell i dont want to back down russell said nikolev said you must help me you must if the invasion and the assassination are allowed to take place i fear there will be no recourse for us we will return to the repressive government of the nightmare days of stalin we will be lost forever we are lost the said the moment before mars walked into the pool room with irina tatiana was already out of the pool she had an oversized towel wrapped around her middle but her chest above the line of her swimsuit was beaded with saltwater comrade she said irina good afternoon tatiana mars said look what i have he lifted the toshiba portable would you help irina set this up on the table over there make sure the power source is secure tatiana did as she was told she glanced at irina out of the corner of her eye irina was afraid to say or do anything that mars might misconstrue there was still a chance she felt that he believed she was loyal to him while that possibility existed she was determined to make the most of it she certainly was not going to give him any cause to doubt her allegiance irina unzipped the case took the toshiba out handed the power cord with its adaptor to tatiana while she was setting up the computer mars walked over to the coping of the pool peered down into the phosphorescent depths odysseus he said are you feeling any better i wasnt aware that i was at all unwell mars knelt down you had a seizure you dont recall that no during the seizure you spoke a whole bunch of nonsense the color between the stars the hero said i remember speaking their language mars swallowed hard whose language not yours comrade mars stood up as if abruptly repulsed he turned went over to where the computer sat irina had pulled up a chair lara came up told mars he had a call out of the corner of her eye irina watched him as he went to the wall phone spoke into it briefly he seemed to listen for a long time and though irina could not be certain she thought his face shut down tight mars made one final curt reply hung up the receiver irina went back to work her fingers danced over the keyboard and a string of recipes began scrolling across the screen mars came up behind her what is this he demanded pineapple upsidedown cake irina wondered what the call had been about whatever it was it had put him in a sour mood good news for her or bad idiotic mars commented where in the world would one get a pineapple perhaps valeri has them flown in from cuba irina said tatiana said i dont believe cuba has pineapple trees idiotic mars repeated what else is in the machine more recipes it seems bah valeri denysovich wouldnt use an illegal computer merely to store his recipes mars shook his head what a woman he is apparently he is a woman you cannot find in the wake of the heros words everyone froze mars stood up walked on stiff legs back to the pool he glared down at the who told you that the hero said nothing he floated placidly in the saltwater i said who told you that arbat began to chatter in alarm mars had drawn his pistol and was now aiming it at the heros head youll answer me odysseus or ill blow your head off irina got up went across the room mars she said softly she put her hand on his arm mars dont no one told me comrade the hero said youve quite effectively cut off my information gathering remember besides no one had to tell me i can read your mind what are you talking about youve manipulated the final showdown with your archenemy havent you volkov no dont bother denying it i know i can see it as clearly as i can see that ugly expression of hatred disfiguring your face you pushed and pushed and what do you have to show for it bondasenkos beyond even your reach shut up mars said and irina with a flash of intuition understood that he was abruptly terrified that odysseus would blurt out that he was kgb mars had no idea that odysseus had already told her that irina knelt beside the pool looked into the heros eyes they spoke silently for the instant before she said let it be for now odysseus youve provoked him enough the hero sank beneath the water and arbat followed him for a long time mars stared into me pool how does he do that he said stay underwater for so long perhaps hes half dolphin irina joked but the stricken look on marss face told her that for him on this subject there was no room for humor she thought that quite interesting and remembering the heros last conversation with mars she began to see the strategy odysseus had formulated for combating mars come away now she said gently her fingers closed over his where he still gripped the pistol with white knuckles theres no need format come mars come and irina led him back to the computer where every secret mars lusted after lay hidden waiting to be unlocked its the waiting russell said that i hate the most youre thinking of nikolev arent you tori said you still think hes using us as bloodhounds i only wish i was as sure of him as you are yeah well i thought i was sure of estilo and hitasura they stared out at the glorious view of the kremlin and the golden domes of st basils they were sitting at a window table at the twentyfirstfloor restaurant of the rossiya hotel they had been there for fortyfive minutes and had still to receive their drinks that was all right they were in no hurry tori had left a handwritten message sealed in an envelope and as hitasura had told her was to be done had addressed it to a mrs kubysheva handed it in at the front desk the young man who had taken it from her had looked at the name she had printed on the envelope said carefully in english perhaps youd care to have dinner at the restaurant upstairs miss the twentyfirst floor offers unparalleled views of the city tori and russell did as he suggested upstairs tori went to the ladies room while russell went to get them seated how he had procured this choice table at the crowded restaurant she could not guess but as she was learning russell was adept at such things hitasura outfoxed everyone russell said still staring out the window and as for estilo perhaps you werent so wrong about him after all without his help we might never have come this far but oh poor ariel yes russell nodded poor ariel he was a seeker after truth and he died for that tori pulled something out of her pocket put it on the table between them she smoothed out the creases i didnt tell you about this before but ariel made sure i had this before he died he obviously thought it was significant russell looked at the photograph its of ariel thats san francisco isnt it yes its a park very close to his house he looked on the back read off the date march jesus tori snatched the photo out of his hand studied it carefully now she knew why the dates of bernard godwins trip had rung a bell they coincided with when this picture was taken she moved the photo closer peered intently at the people in the background and there just to the left of the couple in the extreme lefthand corner of the frame was a man bernard godwin russell could see it too you had to be looking for bernard but once you did you could recognize him ariel had him pinpointed all right tori said russell nodded it would seem so and was murdered for it do you think so russell was not convinced but there must be something more to this photo whats so incriminating about it i mean bernard could have gone to san francisco for a vacation to see a woman any of a million reasons he studied the photo again handed it back can you make out this couple tori shook her head theyre further away than bernard is though they seem to be headed his way we could use a darkroom russell said if we could blow this picture up we might be able to identify this couple in the background before the film got too grainy we could always go to the kgb im sure they have darkrooms to spare very funny russell looked morose im sorry tori but i cant help thinking that nikolev is something less than totally sincere i think youre wrong russ and like it or not were both gambling our lives on it nikolev has already revealed enough of himself to make us reasonably sure of him then i m an unreasonable person no tori said giving his hand a squeeze just a careful one at last a waitress showed up and they ordered dont get your hopes up russell said the food wont be coming any time soon itll be getting dark soon tori said watching the lights come on in red square the onion domes of st basils glow a burnished gold at the waning of a long afternoon this is a cold city even in the beginning of summer russell grunted thats because the temperature has nothing to do with it he sat back abruptly its the waiting i cant stand unfortunately thats all we can do until we get a reply from mrs kubysheva if we get a reply with bondasenko gone to ground the organization wont be taking many chances i think the dire situation is exactly why well hear from them tori said they wired hitasura for help we know that now that weve come theyll see us yeah but according to nikolev it seems were not the only ones who know about that communication the kgb must have broken the organizations code i wonder what else the kgb knows i think nikolev told us as much as he daresperhaps from his point of view too much hes the goddamn kgb tori hes also a human being hes obviously unhappy with what he has been doing it seems to me he wants the best for his country i think hes not so very different than we are russ hes caught in a spiderweb of deceit and now hes doing the best he can to crawl out of it christ i hope youre right about this guy tori stared out at the domes of st basils she was struck by how alien this city seemed to her she remembered stories her father used to tell her that his father had told him legends of valiant ural mountain wolves in winter tales of courageous georgian peasants in high summer sagas of brave soldiers caught on the ice fields of siberia how different this strange and unpleasant place seemed from the settings of those magical stories how she had hated when her father had spoken to her in his native russian she had known he was only trying to help her in her studies but she despised the russian classes she was takinghated everything russian she had wanted her father to speak english like the fathers of all her friends now to her surprise she found that she wished he were here with her to talk with her in russian and to guide her around this remote and forbidding metropolis she wondered whether he would like it here if he ever came she suspected that he would be depressed by modernday russia as she was perestroika or not it was still as backward as a thirdworld country it was not until ten that they were finished eating night was coming down at last its not going to happen russell said and now weve lost nikolev as well hes off in some place called zvezdny gorodok star town tori said where they train and house the cosmonauts for the soviet space program we never should have allowed him to go without us too late for that the bill came on a small tray tori picked it up saw a piece of paper smaller than the bill lying on the tray she scooped it up read it quickly excitedly then she looked up said softly to russell were in business irina mars said come here for a moment irina gratefully abandoned her faked search through the hard disk of valeris toshiba went across the room to where mars was standing he was in deep shadow and she could not make out his face in here he said pushing open a door for her to step through inside the small cubicle he said now that odysseus is asleep in his bed i want to have a talk with you irina nodded keeping herself as calm as she was able she wished she could control her heartbeat as she had read the priests of tibet could what did he tell you about his sources of information irina blinked sources i thought natasha mayakova was his source she was a courier yes thats clear mars said but i dont believe she could have brought him all his information hes always too uptodate when i see him natasha saw him only perhaps once a week i see him more often he didnt say anything and in any case i felt i couldnt press him he didnt say anything about lara or tatiana irina could feel her heart skip a beat no was he suspicious when you asked him about his sources no irina said i didnt word it as a question anyway he seemed to have other things on his mind what for instance irina looked away hes very sexually active ah are you angry ask me that in half an hour mars said irinas head swung around she kept her eyes on him what will happen then ill know unequivocally whether you have betrayed me to valeri denysovich there was a buzzing in irinas ears and she thought she would faint what are you saying valeri is kgb you know how i loathe them mars said i am now prepared to say that i dont know as much about you as i would like youre very different here irina said trying to break off this inquisition she hoped she was able to keep all wariness out of her voice not here mars said now valeri has declared open war on me he shrugged this will be a difficult and trying time for us all he moved with the casual grace irina was used to but she noticed that he always kept himself between her and the door you should take that as a warning but how can you suspect me irina said didnt i give you natasha mayakova mars nodded indeed you did but that could have been a mistake mistake i knew exactly what i was doing i wonder mars said his gaze seemed to penetrate her defenses layer by layer the work you have been doing is tremendously strenuous even for a trained professional which most certainly you are not you have to be mentally and emotionally tough to be able to befriend people and then on command betray them you spend so much time pretending to be someone else that often you actually become that someone else isnt it so irina admit it it happens to even the most hardened professionals illusion becomes real and vice versa in a way its a form of camouflage if you believe your false identity is real so will everyone else around you surely you can see the logic of such a trap in any case im told by experts that its a sound psychological principle no matter irina said somewhat defensively it hasnt happened to me no he was very close to her now close enough to hear the rapid pounding of her heart who are you really the sweet irina ponomareva my family knows or the devious katya boroskaya who is using natasha mayakova or the tough irina ponomareva who is spying on valeri denysovich he cocked his head sagely you know even i get confused trying to sort through all these different personalities it certainly would be understandable if you did as well i dont understand what youre doing irina said why are you trying to put words in my mouth mars spread his hands im just trying to sort out illusion from reality fact from fiction myth from certainty im like an archaeologist at an important historic dig many people are counting on the acuity of my skills i dont know what youre getting at you know i blame myself most of all irina im afraid i pushed you into this triple life i see now the foolishness of my action but it was compulsive surely that absolves me if only a little valeri denysovich pushed me to it because of him youve been walking a perilous tightrope and now youve fallen off youve lost your center youve forgotten who you really are what your true allegiance should be as i said before its perfectly understandable certainly theres no hint of a criminal act involved nothing you could be charged with no matter what your confession might bring to light id see to that personally he reached out to touch her comfortingly you can count on me irina to be your guardian angel the odd and terribly frightening thing was that irina almost believed him there was so much essential truth in what he was saying that it was easy to accept the entire packagebelieve everything that she would be off the hook that she would not be charged that he would protect her no matter what no endless siberian whiter no bars over her moon after all it was so very tempting he made it so difficult to see the lie hidden away beneath his version of the truth but irina did see it at last and imagining him torturing natasha she wondered how on earth she was going to fight this enormously powerful and charismatic creature she could see that she was out of time it was obvious to her that mars was pushing for a resolutionsoft or hardone way or another she had to fight him but how then she thought of odysseus marss prisoner for almost eighteen months he had successfully fought mars how by applying marss own psychology and boomeranging it back at him mars might on the surface seem invulnerable but odysseus had certainly proved that to be an illusion mars was now frightened of odysseus because odysseus had convinced him that he was metamorphosing into another kind of being was that a complete lie irina did not know and she suspected that for all his bravery and bravado odysseus did not know either after all he had been made into an experiment to see the effects of cosmic rays on the human body and mind and he had had the communication he had seen the color between the stars the color of god who could know how that had altered him or even whether the changes were not still going on certainly not mars so there was a way to fight him then as marss fingers wrapped around her wrist she collapsed in his arms i dont know what more you want from me mars she whispered ive given you everything youve wanted i want the truth irina only the truth she put her head on his shoulder molded her body against him not as a siren but as he would wish for a helpless confused female dependent on him for guidance irina he said in her ear just tell me everything it will be all right i promise you oh mars bringing to mind images of her betrayal of natasha mayakova she began to weep when odysseus took me by surprise in the pool i was helpless you must believe me i do koshka i see his physical effect on tatiana and lara i was at that time of the month i was fertile she felt him stiffen and she clung to him all the more there is no way to know for certain of course she went on relentlessly but a woman can often tell these things far sooner than even a doctor can but now i am afraid i dont know what odysseus is any longer i dont believe even he does though he puts on a brave face now i dont know what is forming inside me what if itsbut that is too unspeakable to even contemplate i would kill myself i would she stopped as mars thrust her convulsively away from him he stared at her for a long tensionfilled moment how could you he said at last how could you be with him at just the wrong moment i told you he took me by surprise irina made herself shiver who am i a tiny voice reverberated in her mind he gave me no time to think he made me helpless i at that moment a sharp rap on the door interrupted them what is it mars showed his nerves by nearly shouting captain nikolev is here tatiana said tell him im busy ill see him he says he must see you now comrade it is most urgent shit mars said he looked at irina get back to the computer find that white star information now he went out into the pool room ignored irina as she slipped past him what is it captain he said tersely nikolev took mars aside both tatiana and lara were staring at them we have located valeri bondasenko excellent mars said for the moment forgetting the sliver of terror irina had handed him bring him here i am afraid that is impossible comrade nothing is impossible captain do it thats an order i must have the secrets of white star contained in valeri denysovichs computer you and i will have to go to him nikolev said i wont leave here mars said flatly i do not trust the hero alone with lara and tatiana bring some of your men in no mars said such an overtly aggressive act would destroy everything ive worked for here the hero is far too important to us he is a doorway to a whole new technology then take the computer and come with me do as i order but you dont understand comrade nikolev said there was only one way to get to bondasenko and i used it remember the american diplomatic mission from tokyo i intercepted them at sheremetyevo they are the americans that white star asked for in the coded cable we intercepted nikolev leaned closer i convinced them of my sincerity they believe i am on their side they told me they know a way to contact bondasenko and they are at the rossiya hotel doing so right now is that where valeri denysovich has gone to ground no the hotel is apparently one of white stars dead drops nikolev watched the play of emotions flicker across marss face we must go in as friends or at least i must the americans can convince bondasenko to access the computer i know that you do not want to let it out of your sight so i suggest the two of us go valeri denysovich and his people will not allow me to get anywhere near him true enough nikolev said you will be thoroughly hidden from them along with my people i will go in with the americans and the computer when they have convinced bondasenko to access the information i will signal you electronically youll bring my men in and we will have them all mars spent some time digesting this it seems flawless he said except for one thing how will the americans convince valeri denysovich to access the white star information ive told them about the coup you what nikolev thought mars was going to have a stroke it was the only way to hook them he said didnt you teach me that the truth works better than lies to catch human prey believe me these are no ordinary americans they would not have believed a lie entanglement in the truth brings defeat thats what you often say eh comrade mars thought a moment longer then he nodded come he said take the toshiba and lets go downstairs the two men strode to nikolevs black zil nikolev got in behind the wheel and mars with the toshiba on his lap slid into the passengers seat where is your driver mars asked i drove myself nikolev said he engaged the ignition he was about to throw the car in gear when mars put a hand on his arm just a moment captain regulations make it clear all my men are with the americans nikolev broke in heading out of star town not so the americans would notice mind you but thats why ive had to use so many ive thrown an invisible cordon around the six square blocks surrounding the rossiya what do the american soldiers say an ants ass couldnt get through there without my knowing mars laughed good work captain youll gain a promotion yet out on the highway there was almost no traffic at all and the zil made good time several miles from star town nikolev pulled over to the shoulder and turned off the ignition is something the matter captain mars asked nikolev turned and there was a pistol in his hand it was aimed at marss chest ill take the toshiba now comrade marss eyes did not nicker why captain you disappoint me never mind that nikolev snapped i want the computer and i want it now i hope there are a great number of treasures in here mars said otherwise youre throwing your life away for nothing thats yet to be seen nikolev said what did you do captain foolishly make a deal with the americans i should have known a rampant devotee of history could not be a true marxist youre a bit behind the times comrade there is no such thing as a true marxist anymore cant you see that youre the last of a dying breed a dinosaur in a new enlightened age if thats so mars said then my teeth are huge the better to bite you with the muzzle of the pistol flicked slightly give the computer over and once i do what is to happen to me mars nodded reading the look on nikolevs face i see so thats how its to be youll leave a lump of dead meat for the animals to tear apart youre a dangerous man comrade nikolev said you re telling me mars said firing the smallcaliber pistol he had hidden in his lap under me toshiba the report was deafening inside the zil and the two men were rocked on its shocks captain nikolevs face registered surprise and he gaped at the blood pouring out of him but the bullet had been slightly deflected by the computer and it had entered nikolevs belly quite a bit below where mars had been aiming mars slapped at nikolevs pistol and it went off tearing a hole in the zils roof nikolev grabbed mars slammed the heel of his hand into marss throat marss grip on his pistol loosened and nikolev slapped it away the toshiba crashed to the floorwell of the car mars balled his fist smashed it into nikolevs belly where the bullet had entered nikolev shouted and tears of pain came to his eyes mars immediately bent to retrieve his pistol but nikolev caught him in a lock meant to break his arm gritting his teeth mars jammed his elbow into nikolevs face heard the sharp crack of the jawbone splintering and thought i have him now it was a mistake nikolev almost blind with pain used two quick percussive blows to marss solar plexus bright spots of noncolor danced in marss head and he felt himself begin to black out he fought to gain control over his spasming diaphragm winced as the third blow robbed him of desperately needed air he used the heel of his hand in an attempt to break nikolevs nose but the lack of oxygen in his system had robbed him of strength and he had nothing behind the strike meanwhile nikolev was hard at work trying to separate mars from his ribs mars felt a searing pain lance up into his chest and neck he was losing feeling in his right side and he began to panic he had nothing to work with so in desperation he slammed his forehead into nikolevs nose blood and cartilage splattered but the pain in his chest would not abate mars losing control hit nikolev again with his forehead and this time nikolevs neck snapped back the top of his head smashing into the zils windshield and breaking it nikolev stretched unnaturally backward across the dashboard blinked heavily momentarily stunned mars taking great gulps of air made the most of this respite he drove his fist into nikolevs side over and over until the rib cage gave way nikolev fell sideways into the floorwell his face was streaked with blood and shards of glass were embedded in his cheeks his eyes stared upward mars almost weeping with the enormous expenditure of energy cursed him mightily kicked the side of his head he bent over put his head between his legs so that he wouldnt pass out it took him some time to recover the smell of fresh blood as sickly as decaying flowers reminded him of how close he had been brought to the brink of death you sonuvabitch nikolev you thought you were more clever than i was but in the end you didnt have a clue i had a man on the inside of your division since before the time i had you seconded to department n thats one of the reasons i picked the eleventh division of the border guards he spat onto nikolevs face the captain was beyond caring but just the same it made mars feel better mars opened the passengers door bent down rolled nikolevs corpse out onto the verge of the highway dead meat captain mars said you were right about that at least he took the toshiba off the floorwell the case was covered in blood and bits of bone but mars didnt care about that hurriedly he unzipped the case cursed harshly as he saw the damage his bullet had done to the computer there was a large chip taken out of the hard disk christ he thought this is useless now the white star information is locked away in there for all time now i need valeri denysovich more than ever throwing the toshiba aside he activated the zils twoway radio he identified himself asked to be patched through to lieutenant pokov his fingers drummed impatiently against the bloody dashboard come on he thought come on the radio crackled to life pokov this is volkov mars said without preamble you are now commanding the eleventh division is that clear lieutenant perfectly comrade you have the americans in sight i do everything is under control excellent they will lead you to bondasenko bring as many men as you feel you need i give you the authority and pokov i need bondasenko id like to have the americans as well but if they give you the least problem kill them the less witnesses the better do you follow me lieutenant yes comrade volkov out mars replaced the receiver slid over into the drivers seat he started the engine swung the zil around headed back for star town it was difficult negotiating the highway with the shattered windshield and he was soon obliged to pull over use the butt of his pistol to knock out the remainder of the glass so he could see the guards gaped at him as he pulled into the heros fortress but he had no time to give them an explanation he was thinking of how anatoly nikolev had believed himself more clever than himself he expected irina did too she thought she had convinced him of her loyalty but he knew better he was willing to bet that someone somewhere had given her proof that he not valeri was kgb he could see the fear in her eyes feel it in her body when she touched him had she been fertile when she had allowed odysseus to take her he did not know if she was capable of such a terrible lie buy why not he asked himself as he raced up the stairs of the heros fortress wincing at the pain from his broken ribs she had proved herself capable of so many dangerous things he admired her for that even as he hated her in the same unthinking way he hated the traitor valeri denysovich bondasenko it was the antipathy of the cobra for the mongoose there was no reason to it just an elemental fire that could be temporarily banked but would never go out now mars thought opening the door to the pool room its time to see just how far irina is capable of taking her triple life he decided it would be most interesting to see whether she clung to her smooth lies even at the edge of death having crossed both the moskva river and the narrow canal at the end of red square having come cautiously down to dobryninskaya square on the sadovaya ring tori and russell now found themselves on the edge of the zamoskvorechye the district beyond the moskva behind them they could see the four handpicked men captain nikolev had left behind to make sure they got safely to their destination he had been most persuasive with mars volkov using the bulk of the eleventh division to comb moscow for valeri bondasenko youll never make it on the streets on your own nikolev had said lieutenant pokov got out of his zhiguli came over to them it was one of those typical russian cars tinny uncomfortable a piece of junk really yet another manifestation of the thirdworld atmosphere we are close to a number of volkovs patrols he said are we near our destination fuck off russell said pokov looked hurt he was a stolidlooking darkhaired russian with the kind of musculature one often saw on amateur wrestlers he appeared very quick on his feet ill lock the car and leave it here it will attract too much attention closer in russell glanced over his shoulder at pokov drew tori away from him im liking this less and less he whispered to her were out in the deep water and we cant even tell the good guys from the bad guys this seems to be an excellent way to get ourselves killed tori said you still think nikolevs fall of shit dont you believe me i would like to think hes telling us the truth bat i cant face it the odds are against it tori look at this setup in all honesty weve got to figure he had more reason to lie than to tell us the truth or he could have been telling us the truth but for the wrong reasons is that the same thing russell looked at her do you see whats happening were getting so enmeshed in sorting out the truth weve lost our way in the forest of lies and let me tell you moscow is not a city to get lost in you do and chances are you never come out either way tori said levelly weve got to reach valeri bondasenko as quickly as possible its after one in the morning less than four hours to the start of the russian invasion of the baltic states if nikolev wasnt pulling our leg they fell silent as lieutenant pokov approached them excuse me he said but we must go quickly it is very late not many people are still on the streets and so you will become too conspicuous to remain out yourselves one of volkovs patrols could pick you up at any moment and i would be helpless to stop them my men and i can only try to steer you clear of the other border guards patrols hes right tori said wed better go russell said goddamn this to hell but he did not stop her as she headed down bolshaya polyanka street and so at length they came to the church of st gregory of neocasarea stay here understand russell said to pokov is this where bondasenko is hiding pokov said a church something in his voice warned russell and he grabbed tori by her arm dragged her quickly around to the front of the church he got out a small instrument twisted it into the lock russell pushed and the huge door swung inward they stood inside in the utter darkness listening for shouts the shouts of running bootsteps on the gritty pavement outside they heard nothing what happened tori whispered maybe were okay after all russell said then he saw the silhouette of one of nikolevs border guards insinuate itself through the front door for a moment it was outlined against the faint blue light filtering in through the stainedglass windows and russell pointed to it then the silhouette was gone and so was tori tori spent the first few moments doing nothing but listening it was impossible to see the border guard but she could hear him well enough he was taking all the proper precautions and in fact he was quite good but tori heard him nonetheless she had already taken off her shoes had tied the laces together so she could hang them around her neck she listened a moment more then when she was certain of where the border guard was and how he was moving she went after him he thought he was being clever crawling between the pews tori climbed onto a pews back and like a tightrope walker put one foot carefully in front of another she felt without having to see the straight line of the wooden pew back against the soles of her feet which she relaxed around the inch or so of wood molding them to the shape of the carved wood when she was above and just behind the crawling border guard she dropped onto him as silent as a bat the border guard already had his knife out ready to stab whoever he came upon first her or russell he twisted as he felt her weight come down on him and as he did he swung the knife up in a vicious arc toward her belly tori using an aikido immobilization guided aside his thrust grabbed his jaw on either side and as he reared back in surprise twisted once very hard to the left his neck snapped like a dry twig he convulsed a moment and was still when tori had left him russell stole behind the front door he was waiting for the next border guard to come through when he felt the pistol in the small of his back stoi a voice commanded russell not understanding moved he turned around and found himself face to face with a cowled figure have all priests in moscow a need for a gun father he said only if they are in hiding the figure said in heavily accented english valeri bondasenko yes russell tried to penetrate the penumbra of the cowl but the darkness of the interior of the church defeated him i am a representative of bernard godwin my colleague is if what you tell me is the truth why have you brought the kgb border guards with you its a long story russell said and i havent the time or the understanding to explain it all now you must help us with the border guards how many are there three enlisted men one officer lieutenant pokov so few thats odd they are usually deployed in much larger groups but russell was no longer listening he was staring into the muzzle of a kalashnikov semiautomatic machine gun tori took the knife out of the dead border guards hand she considered taking the gun as well but thought better of it she did not care for guns and in any case the firing of just one shot would alert the authorities and bring disaster on them all she opted for pocketing the guns ammunition so no one else who found it could use it then she moved off into the depths of the darkened church the impenetrable blackness was like the shroud of a forest she could recall the winter in hokkaido where she was tested to find sensei who was living in the dense forest of pitch pines there it took her ten days a long time in her estimation but sensei told her she had beaten the next best record by eighteen hours most of his students never found him at all lightning burst reflection off a length of metal tori watched the progress of the telescoping steel truncheon as the border guard made his way through the darkness a moment later she could make out his face and seeing the fixed look in his eyes saw that he had spotted russell she creeped along the edge of the pew she was on and was just about to break toward him when she became aware of the presence behind her she leapt off the back of the pew as the steel truncheonthe mate of the one she had been staring atwhipped through the space where an instant before her ankles had been tori whirled and as she hit the floor struck out hard with her left leg she felt it strike flesh and bone heard a sharp intake of breath and then she attacked with the stone a twohanded percussive atemi his stiff arms the gun held in both his hands were raised toward her tori was so close she could see the tremor of intent in a fraction of a second he would fire and the explosion would give them all away if not the kgb then the police would be alerted a loud noise like that this late at night would be reported instantly by some concerned citizen tori swung her steel truncheon into the mans left wrist momentarily paralyzing his finger on the trigger he kicked upward caught her on the inside of her thigh she grunted felt her balance going as her left leg crumpled the border guard tracked her with the muzzle of the gun he was taking no chances aiming for her head tori ducked but slammed into the back of the wooden pew the border guard reached up his mouth in a rictus of pain as he grabbed a handful of her blouse pulled her toward him with his left hand that cost him a lot toris first blow had fractured his wrist but he was dedicated and not about to give up now tori was too close to use the truncheon and she let it go just before he smashed the side of his pistol into her rib cage breath hissed through toris clenched teeth as she collapsed onto her knees the border guard pressed the muzzle of his pistol against her forehead da zvedanye suka he said managing to grin through his agony goodbye bitch tori slammed her fists against his ears grabbed his right wrist with one hand the barrel of his pistol with another he fought her every inch the cords at the sides of his neck stood out as he beat against her with his powerless left hand tori was straddled across his legs so he could not use them against her both she and the border guard were concentrated on the gun tori had the leverage but he had the brute strength they struggled silently violently force against force it was a standoff until tori employing one of the main principles of aikido abruptly dropped her resistance to him his aim came down with his unimpeded arm past her face past her body she used a kite against the side of his neck and his arm fell to his side his eyes rolled up into his head she looked up now she had lost the third border guard put your pistol down the border guard said to the cowled figure who did as he was ordered kick it over here when russell saw the border guards eyes flick toward the gun he stepped forward and across and as he had been taught chopped down straight and hard thinking not of the mans flesh but of the space beyond the border guard went down as his shoulder blade cracked beneath the assault he was scrabbling to lift his kalashnikov into position when russell hit the nerve at the inside of his elbow and his arm went dead russell took the kalashnikov out of his hand swiped him across the side of the head with the stock end tori winced slightly as she crouched began to move out of the aisle of pews into the sanctuary where she had last caught a glimpse of russell she saw him now he was standing above the body of the third border guard and there was a robed priest with him a disguised bondasenko tori hoped so russell she said as she came up to them have you seen pokov no what about the other two of his men taken care of tori said like this one she felt gingerly at her side are you all right when she nodded russell stared at her for some time you really are a very scary human being mr slade yes yes russell said tori this is valeri bondasenko valeri this is tori nunn we have a lot to talk about tori said the robed figure nodded this way he whispered not at this time comrade maybe later lieutenant pokov emerged from the shadows where he had been hidden he had stayed so still that even tori had not been aware of him she cursed herself for her lapse sensei would have been very angry with her lieutenant pokov nodded his head a pleasure to make your acquaintance comrade bondasenko or i should say traitor bondasenko russell was furious tori i told you we shouldnt have trusted that sonuvabitch nikolev ah poor nikolev lieutenant pokov laughed he could afford to be jovial now so misguided unfortunately he was stupid enough to have told you the truth not that it will do you any good now youre on your way to the lubyanka where mars volkov will interview you comrade volkov is notorious in the lubyanka for his interviews i dont envy any of you he made a sharp motion with his gun that way is the exit lady and gentlemen use it pokov followed them down the aisle of pews they passed the second man that tori had dispatched pokov looked at her grimly ill have something to say about this ill take a measure of their shortened lives out of you when volkov is done with you tori saw ahead of them the first man she had fought with she could see his pistol lying on the floor where she had left it she put her hand in her pocket so you switched sides pokov russell said pokov laughed i never changed sides is more accurate nikolev was a fool to try to cross mars volkov no one does that and lives very long i myself like life too much to play the fool during this exchange tori had come to the fallen border guard putting her consciousness in mind no mind feeling the void fill her with the elemental power of the universe she bent down with her back to pokov he saw her almost immediately what are you doing he shouted get away from there tori turned she had the border guards pistol in her hand pokov took one look at it and threw his head back laughing oh good try but its empty do you think i would have left it lying around otherwise his lip curled in contempt stupid americans sending a woman to do a mans job a man would know better oh yeah tori said and pulled the trigger pokov was slammed back against the end of a pew his legs crumpled under him and his expression of shock and rage transformed his face into a stylized mask but it was empty he whispered i know it was tori walked up to him held out a handful of bullets pokovs eyes fluttered his head hung as he slid to the floor of the church da zvedanye pokov tori said throwing the pistol onto his unmoving chest sergei the man with the strawberry birthmark pulled the cowl off his face by god that was well done he said i think its safe enough now to no valeri said striding toward them from the far end of the sanctuary i am valeri denysovich bondasenko he clapped sergei on the shoulder you have protected me from danger long enough my friend tori and russell introduced themselves and valeri nodded to them our terrible risk in bringing you here may prove our downfall i have not been idle while you were here valiantly defending me he nodded toward the dead border guards your courage is beyond reproach and very much appreciated but im afraid it may be for nothing these four did not come alone there is a contingent of border guards setting themselves in a standard perimeter around the church that bastard pokov russell said he must have been in communication with volkov no doubt valeri said and now mars petrovich has pulled his net tightly around us perhaps too tightly comrade sergei said remember the tunnels that lead out of the crypts beneath the church valeri nodded grimly but even so volkovs patrols are everywhere we will have no chance at this hour on foot maybe thats not so important right now russell said he recounted captain nikolevs warning about the dawn invasion of the baltic states and the simultaneous assassination of the soviet president valeri closed his eyes he seemed infinitely weary yes i suspected something of that nature but not so soon nikolev said that white star is the wild card in the equation he said that if we could get to you white stars leader you would be able to mobilize the organization to prevent the invasion and the coup russell stared at valeri we know about the nuclear weapons bernard godwin has been selling you its time to put them to use valeri shook his head not selling mr slade mr godwin has been giving the devices to us he is thought of as a great patriot here he is one of white stars spiritual leaders good christ russell said but all this does no good im afraid valeri said we are rather cut off here there is no transcontinental communication possible from the church i was barely able to manage to get your local communique that was what caused the delay in my responding no weve got to get out of here weve got to get to star town tori broke in mars volkov has a woman named irina and your computer is it true that the whole of white star is in its hard disk irina valeri said so mars caught irina going into my apartment that must mean he suspects her loyalty is to me so the computer could betray you tori said valeri nodded yes the entire network is secreted in the software but no one could possibly dig it out its a ghost in the machine then he stopped all the color drained from his face my god he said softly a ghost in the machine i told irina and she is well versed in computers she could if mars forced her dear god he glanced at his watch then looked at tori its almost three in the morning yes youre right we must get to star town now but how comrade sergei asked the tunnels will take us to the streets but what then and then russell said we have a car he almost laughed in his relief pokovs car he knelt down went through pokovs pockets stood up with the key in his hand at that moment the front door to the church crashed in kgb keep calm quickly valeri whispered this way they ran back through the sanctuary through doors that valeri carefully closed and bolted behind them he left them for a moment while sergei continued to lead them downward they were on the second flight of stairs going down to the crypts when valeri rejoined them i smashed out the window in the back of the sacristy he said thinking we have escaped they will never find us down here now in the crypt itself valeri turned to the man with the strawberry birthmark sergei you must stay here with my daughter i dont want her moved again so soon and in any event there wont be room in the car for everyone i understand comrade take good care of her as if she were my own daughter the two men embraced godspeed valeri i will come for you myself sergei after dawn then valeri denysovich bondasenko was leading tori and russell into the tunnels into the darkness and the light on his final race to save his country from certain disaster mars had a murderous look in his eyes stay away from me he said to lara and tatiana ill deal with you later he strode through the pool room the women gaped at the blood caked on him just as the guards outside had at this time of the night there was no one else in the building mars stood by the pool in his absence the had awakened from his sleep returned to the pool or perhaps in this growing crisis he had been awakened mars stared down at the hero here he said a present for you he swung the damaged toshiba in a flat arc let go of the cloth handles at the apex the computer in its case flew into the water the resultant splash slapped at marss shoes and trouser bottoms you see odysseus i dont need it anymore and do you want to know why but you must you can read my mind yes the murderous look in his eyes intensified i dont need the computer because i have the real thing he gave off a feral grin my men found my archenemy as you so aptly put it even as i say this they are bringing valeri denysovich here to me for interrogation how does that make you feel sorry for you the hero said mars clenched his jaw his fists balled into white claws thats right odysseus said why fight it comrade why not jump into the gladiators arena and have it out with me man to man thats what you want isnt it but then again it might not be what you think it might not be man to man but man to well what do you think volkov you cant possibly know what i am or what i could do to you in here so go about your dirty little business on dry land go on mars bent over the edge of the pool you think you know it all that youve got all the answers well well see just how clever you are now odysseus mars stalked to where irina was watching him he reached out in a blur grabbed a handful of hair yanked it back so hard that she cried out as she fell to her knees volkov mars looked at lara and tatiana if either of you interferes ill kill you then he slapped irina hard across the face volkov comrade volkov to you odysseus comrade volkov odysseus said stop it oh no mars said its gone too far for that he yanked at irinas hair again bending her painfully backward she whimpered im going to hurt her odysseus i want you to know that in advance because youre going to be the principal witness shes just a woman comrade leave her out of it but i cant mars said reasonably she insinuated herself into my game she got one whiff of it and she was excited beyond control it was her decision she agreed to play by my rules the moment she seduced me she had no way of knowing but she did odysseus she seduced me then she spied on valeri denysovich for me she befriended natasha mayakova and then she betrayed her did you know that betrayed her just like that and then she betrayed me no shes as coldblooded as any man i ever met she accepted the violence and now she must learn the lesson that violence begets violence its only fair odysseus live by the sword die by the sword its revenge comrade revenge pure and simple no mars fairly shouted it i am speaking of justice here not revenge your definition volkov its always your definition odysseus made a disgusted sound this is your world it is my fate that i am stuck in a rome ruled by a caesar such as you there is no justice here we are governed by your whims and isnt it ironic who really seeks to be the living god not me comrade damn you and your circumlocutions mars said who taught you to use language like a weapon i act only out of selfdefense comrade language is the only weapon you allow me no no mars said i have given you too much of what you want odysseus i see now that i have been far too lenient with you i have bent rules for youeven broken one or two yes i was like a father indulging his only child i see that clearly now and the result is painfully predictable you are willful spiteful spoiled but now it must end his head snapped up tatiana come here tatiana did as he commanded arbat stuck her head out of the water began to chatter frantically volkov odysseus said warily what are you up to this is the end for you odysseus you will learn to behave in a proper way to be respectful to give full and honest answers to the questions put to you volkov shut up mars snapped he raised the gun aimed pulled the trigger all in one motion tatiana tumbled silently backward into the pool irina screamed the reverberations of the single shot echoed in the pool room lara watched with wide eyes the corpse in the pool sinking then rising rolling slightly with the lapping of the saltwater against the coping arbat stopped her furious clicking she swam slowly to tatianas corpse poked at it over and over as if she could bring tatiana back to life then she dived deep to the bottom of the pool you bastard odysseus said you hate me now dont you mars said why dont you come up here and stop me then as a real man would youre stupid volkov odysseus said like all wouldbe gods your mind is limited to the precepts of power but i think youll find that holding on to power is far more treacherous than gaining it mars waggled the gun i dont believe youre in any position to offer me advice his head swung around as he watched lara walk purposefully across the room odysseus seeing where she was heading shouted no lara stay away from there a slow smile spread across marss face i see that there are truly no secrets from you odysseus i was right in the end to suspect these two women lara had reached the far side of the room she took out a set of keys put one in the lock of a narrow wall cabinet somehow you worked your magic on them didnt you very impressive both tatiana and lara were highly skilled kgb agents until they came under your curious spell odysseus heard the past tense shouted volkov no its enough now you must learn your lessons my son mars said and they are by definition hard lessons your spitefulness has made them so mars waited until lara had opened the cabinet before he shot her twice in the back laras body was thrown aside as if by an invisible fist she had been holding on to the top of the cabinet door and it swung open to reveal the contents of the arsenal a vertical line of loaded kalashnikovs ready for any emergency the welloiled semiautomatic machine guns gleamed in the low light ah god mars smiled down benevolently at the top of the heros bent head good he said gently you are beginning to learn the true parameters of power he reached out almost as if he were a prelate about to bless a petitioning acolyte but not quite yet mars said he twined his hand in irinas hair jerked her head back once again irina cried out and odysseuss head came up his eyes were a dull black what is it you want volkov if you have to ask the question you still have a ways to go mars held irina down with one massive forearm pressed the muzzle of his gun into her mouth soon odysseus youll give me everything i want wont you ill give it to you now the hero said dully only dont kill her oh i have no intention of killing her odysseus shes far too valuable for that and as you will see i can be a benevolent caesar no i am going to hurt her a little at a time in between im going to ask you questions and each time you give me an answer that is incomplete or false i will hurt her some more you know i dont think you can conceive of just how long this process can be drawn out dont do this are you pleading now odysseus oh you are a sorry excuse for a man youre even worse than valeri denysovich is that so both mars and the hero turned at the same instant by christ mars said it is you comrade valeri emerged from the shadows im sorry it took me so long to get here mars petrovich but there were many complications to surmount mars looked around where is pokov where are my men they couldnt make it im afraid mars let go of irina stood up facing valeri his face registered shock and confusion youre here by yourself how did you get into this fortress past my guards theres a way valeri said its been done often enough he looked around at the carnage my god what have you done to lara and tatiana how do you know them i know a great deal comrade valeri said but i fear its too late to begin explaining and anyway i doubt if youd understand mars looked from valeri to the hero and back again as understanding slowly flooded through him what an idiot ive been he said at last natasha wasnt only bringing odysseus limited distribution kgb files you stole she was ferrying white star intelligence back and forth the two of you are in this together odysseus has been helping you organize white star almost right valeri said youre still the dullwitted oaf im afraid dont bother trying youll never get it all during this exchange irina had slowly crawled away from the arena the two antagonists had drawn for themselves she could almost see their enmity crackling like lightning it was so palpable iceblue and indigo shadows filled the pool room there was a ghastly sense of blood heat as exposed as a white bone protruding through purple flesh she was sobbing silently the terror that filled her seemed to leak out her eyes as tears the pores of her skin as sweat it racked her like a terrible ague so that she shook uncontrollably her mind was at once numb and on fire she could not believe the depths of marss depravity the thought that he had once made her so content that she had happily contemplated becoming part of his family made her sick to her stomach but there was so much more as she watched with hollow eyes the harrowing confrontation between these two men who had once meant something to her she saw how removed she was from the mentality of men what drove them to such cruelty and violence she could feel the sickness in their souls permeating the room like an inimical miasma and she saw horrified how she had been infected by their hideously distorted lust for power control dominion over others she recognized at last how mars and valeri each in his own way had used her twisted her around the force of his personality as if forging a blade out of a slab of steel but she was not made of steel no matter to them they had tried in their infinite masculine arrogance to make her into steel and she saw the truth at last that there was no difference between mars and valeri in the end it did not matter what each wanted what each stood for because the two of them were so intent on getting what they wanted they made certain that nothing and no one got in their way irina saw them confronting one another and this new truth said to her leave them alone do nothing let their violence burn itself out naturally they will kill one another and that will be the end of it then she saw mars raise his gun fire she saw valeri stagger back his right shoulder red with blood it was too much no she screamed irina weeping could not understand what was happening inside her she wanted to do nothing to sit and watch these two men destroy each other but she could not to her horror she found herself next to the open arsenal cabinet now she was standing reaching inside she took down a kalishnikov her finger curled around the trigger and lowering the muzzle she walked toward the two men mars was aiming at valeri dimly she was aware of other figures in the shadows and she thought with terror of marss border guards kgb keep calm stop it mars she said as she advanced shut up mars snapped keep out of this irina valeri said mars was about to pull the trigger again instead irina did the sound was deafening irina and mars screamed at almost the same instant marss body was blown forward by the force of the fusillade of bullets and his body slid across the floor to come to rest at valeris feet tears were streaming down irinas face she dropped the kalishnikov rubbed the palms of her hands down her thighs she saw the blood leaking out of marss back and she slipped to her knees began to gag odysseus she whispered softly save me the hero reached up over the edge of the pool drew her slowly onto the coping slid her into the pool next to him arbat broke from the pool bottom came to nuzzle her bottle nose against irinas side oh arbat irina laughed then immediately began to cry again are you all right tori said coming up to where valeri knelt he was holding his shoulder staring down at mars i dont know he said something odd has happened ive thought about this moment for a long time i thought i would feel elated when it came but you know the funny thing is i dont i feel deflated empty he put his hand briefly on the top of marss bloody head almost as if a part of myself has died that was a damned stupid way to come in here russell said from the other side of him that sonuvabitch could have killed you with the first shot it was the only way valeri said wiping the sweat off his face if mars saw you he would have shot you both without a moments hesitation and it was far too risky to attempt to infiltrate this room one hint of our presence and mars would have had two precious hostages to defeat us with bullshit russell said we would have had time to you did not know mars as i did valeri said he took a deep breath and in any case he did not kill me with the first shot he looked away from mars for the first time up into russells face he was the finest marksman you know talk to me the hero said to irina i feel unclean she put her head against his shoulder hold me she whispered and when she felt his arms around her said mars was right violence does beget violence everything he said was true i seduced and i lied and i loved it then i was in so deep i betrayed natasha and valeri i didnt know what i was doing i didnt know who mars was when i told him but it doesnt matter thats just a rationalization i should never have betrayed the trust natasha put in me she was my friend and surely i had a hand in her torture and now this ive killed someone with my own hands now i am truly part of marss world if that is really how you feel odysseus said i cannot help you irina drew her head back she stared into his fathomless eyes what do you mean you must im relying on you no irina its time for you to rely on yourself i can help yes thats true but only you can save yourself from the violent world you fell so madly in love with and only if you want to the tension came into her frame and her blackness returned the blackness she recognized as her fear of the endless siberian winter the bars over her moon the country as her prison and a voice inside her said now you have nothing you re lost utterly lost irina could feel the tears welling hotly in her eyes but this time she fought them back just as she fought the voice inside her she did not have to be lost it was not preordained there were alternatives to being utterly lost and now she found that she wanted more than anything to explore those alternatives they would not be in america as she had dreamed but it was a foolish dream an adolescents wanting to run away from responsibility and if there was anything she could learn from the it was a sense of responsibility she stared into the depths of odysseuss opalescent eyes and in the silence of their communication told him that she was ready while russell saw to valeris wound ton went to where lara lay checked to see if she was still alive she wasnt then she walked to the edge of the pool bent down pulled tatiana from the water she rolled her over saw that she was dead too such a waste of life she thought sadly where will it end that was a question she had been asking herself ever since she had watched koi commit ritual suicide in an attempt to cleanse her spirit and her conscience of the blood staining it tori could not forget that moment as if it were fixed in time in her memory the blue of the sky the white of kois clothes the red of the blood flowing and the lights of kois mountains burning for her silently tori said a prayer for kois spiritand her own slowly almost hesitantly she walked along the edge of the pool her legs seemed to have lost their strength here was the hero the russian cosmonaut who had trained and lived with her brother greg the man who had last seen greg alive what strange fate that had brought her here and now that she was here tori found that she was almost afraid to approach him she heard the water purling against the coping she saw the iceblue and indigo shadows moving in mysterious patterns across the face of the water she heard the odd clicks of arbats language and all these things lent an otherworldly cast to the pool as if they were not inside a fortress in the heart of the ussr at all but in another time another place altogether tori saw arbat first and she was so surprised she did not know what to say the blue dolphin immediately broke away from where the and irina hung in the pool ducked her head swam up to where tori stood in a rush arbat leaped fully out of the water her nose brushed toris cheek and then her great sleek body was gone in one enormous splash hidden beneath the churning water tori stood very still her legs trembled and she looked toward the two humans in the pool irina swam over introduced herself im tori nunn tori said sitting on the coping weve come with valeri to help white star she extended her hand irina took it for a moment the two women stared deep into each others eyes what transpired then was there a silent communication of words of feelings or of something far more elemental something impossible to define in any case there was a sense of a shared emotion if not a shared destiny that leaped between the women when they touched im sorry tori said breaking the silence but i was stunned by what the dolphin did irina smiled arbat has very particular likes and dislikes its obvious she likes you a great deal she turned odysseus come meet tori shes one of the americans who irina stopped frozen by the look on odysseuss face is something the matter the hero swam slowly into what light there was in the shadowy pool room arbat surfaced next to him and he put his hand on her back tori watched as the emerged from the darkness her heart was pounding so hard she could scarcely breathe she could see his gleaming silvery skin first as sleek as arbats she saw the contours of his face the utter hairlessness of him and then she caught a glimpse of his opalescent eyes tori opened her mouth closed it with a snap opened it again she stared into his angel eyes greg tori the hero said god in heaven tori tumbled into the pool clothes and all she swam to where odysseus floated with arbat tears were streaming from her eyes dont odysseus said oh dont he stroked her head greg tori pulled him to her embraced him kissed his cheeks she held him and held him she did not want to let go and for a long time she didnt when at last she unclasped him she said but i thought you were dead we all did how is it the russians gregory nunn said viktor shevchenko and i were part of a secret experiment these bastards devised to see if exposure to measured amounts of cosmic radiation could counter the crippling effects of weightlessness then the eva event happened and viktor was killed i came home but was in a coma for several months when i regained consciousness the russians figured i was too valuable to give back to the americans i dont know how they convinced our people it was me who died in space but they did then they set about calling me viktor i suppose in order to try to indoctrinate me to my new life in a russian prison of course i had one all to myself but it was no less a prison for that tori russell said from the edge of the pool behind her the deadline she turned russ this is my brother greg it was the russian cosmonaut who died in space not him the russians have been holding him here hey jesus christ he squatted down what the hell have they done to you its a long story ill bet russell said his frown deepened are you okay its hard to say well one things for sure weve got to get you out of here i can tell you therell be a lot of people back home falling all over themselves to talk to you not so different from the russians russell cocked his head at gregs cynical tone what am i missing here time tori said to russell but she was looking past him to her brother russell said okay greg believe me i want to get the whole story but right now odysseus valeri interrupted coming up behind russell the kgb and the military have combined as we had suspected his right shoulder was wrapped with surgical tape at dawn today the order will be given to invade the baltic states of latvia and lithuania at the same moment the president will be assassinated by his own bodyguards so soon greg said were not yet altogether ready nevertheless were going to have to make do valeri said he winced with pain we are going to have to deploy the mands mands russell said yes gregory nunn said the mobile antipersonnel nuclear devices that bernard godwin has provided us with he nodded at valeri i agree its the only way to avert disaster he swam to the edge of the pool help me up valeri and russell bent down lifted him from the pool valeri used only his left arm but sucked in his breath sharply at the strain greg looked at him inquiringly and valeri grinned only a flesh wound he said not to worry the bullet went clear through him russell said only the muscle is damaged ive stopped the bleeding applied antibiotic cream and ive wrapped him well theres an excellent medical dispensary here still he must see a surgeon but not now valeri said during this exchange irina had climbed out of the pool now she went over to where the heros wheelchair sat she brought it over and as they sat him in it she covered him with an oversized towel as she had seen lara and tatiana do then as tori emerged dripping irina wrapped another towel around her began to rub her shoulders to bring up the warmth valeri wheeled greg over to the communications area and as greg began to set up he said mars was almost right but he never could have grasped the whole truthor believed it we have been building the concept of white star for years first we had to fight state repression then the peoples fear of that repression more recently as pockets of nationalism in georgia lithuania the ukraine and other sectors of the soviet union sprang up through our encouragement weve had to battle the divided nature of that nationalism the georgians cared only about georgia ukrainians only about ukrainians and so on he paused and they could all hear him breathing hard as he tried to block out the pain the shock had dissipated and the full brunt of the pain had set in of course he had refused to take a painkiller then eighteen months ago greg dropped into our laps like a star from heaven he continued gathering himself greg was the hero of the odingalaktika ii disaster he was of soviet descent being incarcerated and interrogated almost daily by the kgb he became a rallying point about which all the disparate nationalist elements could agree a symbol to which every splinter group could relate he was our rosetta stone our shogun bringing order out of chaos and he became the leader of white star they could hear greg on the shortwave talking in short bursts moving the frequencies every twenty seconds in a preset pattern from here valeri said the mands can be deployed quickly and efficiently but even so russell said its almost five in the morning the invasion will begin clear across the country not if the orders are never implemented valeri said the mands are hidden here in moscow he smiled actually right around the corner from the church where you found me theyre in the basement of the atomic energy administration on staromonetny street he nodded odysseuspardon me gregoryis seeing that our people get the mands immediately with them they can get to the generals in their villas in the lenin hills the kgb leaders in the lubyanka and lefortovo you see our people are highly placed and they need only go that far he bent down retrieved the kalishnikov that irina had dropped of course it wont be as straightforward as that it never is there will inevitably be complications and before its over some of us may die which is why i must go i must see that none of the generals slip our net and then i must confront the president to give him an account of this treachery firsthand isnt there anything we can do russell asked valeri smiled you and miss nunn have already done your part now you must stand aside and let us do ours at this stage it would not be helpful to anyone if news got out of american agents being involved in this crisis what will happen here tori said i dont know no one does valeri admitted but it is clear that some form of compromise between the russians and the national minorities must be hammered out a good degree of national autonomy is needed but no one in white star wants to cripple this country we just want the repression and prejudice against us to end after greg was finished on the shortwave russell took over to send a coded signal via the berlin station to mail central irina took tori into the shower and changing room showed her where tatiana and lara kept their clothes irina was in the shower and tori was just finishing dressing when greg wheeled himself in its good to see you tori you cant know how good tori knelt in front of him whats happened to you greg mom and dad will be so frightened when they see you he looked into her eyes said i dont think so what do you mean greg reached out gripped her shoulders they know tori mom and dad know youre alive her face was a mask of shock but how then something flashed in her mind russell saying haw the devil is bernard getting the funds to buy these nuclear weapons and with fingers half paralyzed she fumbled out the photo that ariel had pressed into her hands at the point of death but there must be something more to this photo whats so incriminating about it russell had said bernard could have gone to san francisco or any one of a million reasons tori looked past ariel in the foreground the bronze sundial the little girl playing in the park she saw bernard in the lower lefthand corner of the frame and then coming toward him coming to meet him the couple she peered through the gloom could it be did the photo show toris mother and father meeting bernard godwin in a san francisco park to discuss financing were ellis and laura nunn financing white star was it their money that bernard used to buy the mands from the japanese coalition and then it all clicked together tori said with a bit of wonder in her voice valeri contacted bernard and told him about you didnt he greg and then bernard went to dad he told him you were alive that this was dads chance to help free the people of the soviet union she saw the truth in gregs eyes jesus christ bernard wasnt content with roping me into his secret world he had to drag mom and dad in after me i dont think it was quite as simple as that greg said softly i think dad and mom decided on their own no no tori said heatedly you dont know bernard as ive come to he coerced themmaybe not directlydad isnt so easily coercible but even he has his weak spot you ive no doubt that bernard used you to get dads and moms backing i think youre giving too much power to bernard and not enough credit to mom and dad bernards gone too far this time she said grimly but dont you see the good hes done bernards opened up the door and for the first time in decades a new light is shining in but at what cost tori said greg you dont know how much blood has been spilled because of him i know how much blood has spilled here over the past eighteen months and how much more would have been spilled without his effortsand yours tori knew he was rightbut she also knew that bernard had to be taught a lesson his free reign above the law must be put to an end tori at least talk to dad before you make up your mind greg said well both talk to him tori said im taking you home no in the electric silence greg said im not going back to america i cant leave here not now theres too much to do ive made too many friends bound myself with too many unbreakable ties greg you cant mean it but i do seeing her stricken look he said how can i explain it to you he thought a moment did dad ever tell you the story of the zen policeman yes tori said so softly he had to bend close to hear her well thats me tori the zen policeman locked away at the crossroads of an eerie corridor in a strange structure in an alien land but ive come there for a reasonbelieve me ive had enough time to come to understand thatand its a reason thats larger than i am as an individual but what about our family what about home my family will come see me god willing and as far as home is concerned its no longer here for me i have another home its inside myself now tori began to cry greg greg ive just found you i dont want to lose you again ah tori who are you weeping for me or yourself he put his hand under her chin lifted her head up dont you see that you can be through living in my shadow she tried to laugh through her tears but wholl help me with mom and dad you know i cant cope with them without you you dont mean that tori you never needed me to intercede with mom and dad you just thought you did it was easier to want my relationship with them than to fight for your own he kissed her lightly this is your life tori have the courage to live it at that moment russell stuck his head into the room whats taking you so long ive gotten a reply from bernard he wants us back in the states right away irina came out of the shower cubicle with a towel wrapped around her she looked from greg to toris tearstreaked face is everything all right she asked its just the goodbyes tori said wiping away her tears i hate long ones she took russells hand stared once more into those angel eyes greg said give my regards to dianas garden as irina slipped an arm around his shoulders and then because he was anxious for her youll talk to dad promise me you will tori said ill give them both your love just before she turned away greg said enigmatically remember the zen policeman tori saw the small smile on his face and wondered at its meaning all during the long flight home home los angeles star town tori returned to los angeles and dianas garden in the midst of a dreadful heat wave that had kept polluted air inverted over the sprawling city for more than a week children and people over the age of sixtyfive or with breathing disorders were being warned to stay inside it was a los angeles not that much different from the tokyo they had so recently left russell told her he was staying at the airport to wait for bernards flight in from the east coast tori said that she was not going to stay they sat facing one another for a time in the dimly lit interior of the they both seemed in an emotional as well as a physical limbo they had slept fitfully on the flight home both still too tired to feel the full extent of their exhaustion at last russell said just before we landed we got a fax from bernard sending us his heartiest congratulations honestly i dont know whether to laugh or cry me neither i dont understand tori looked at him after all thats happened how can you wait for him here as if its business as usual ive still got a job to do russell leaned over poured himself coffee stirred in sugar after moscow we know it isnt so cut and dried is it he sipped some coffee is bernard guilty and if so of what and is it anything we ourselves arent guilty of as well im no judge in these matters tori and neither i suspect are you the truth is buried too deeply under conflicting layers of altruism and obsession in any case ive got to work things out with bernard during the debriefing come to some sort of compromise or ill have to quit the mall she smiled at least thats not the career man i used to know talking that russell slade is dead he frowned but you should be here when bernard arrives hell be here any minute debriefing or no debriefing bernard can wait tori said kissing him i cant my family comes first now besides im not ready yet to confront him i need some time to get this all in perspective if i dont know how i feel about him im sure to make a shambles of the debriefing russell said sure but something in his eyes gave her pause what is it russ listen he said holding on to her youre not going to pull one of your patented stunts and disappear over the horizon no she said seriously i dont have reason to do that anymore still he would not let her go we have so much to say to each other she touched him on the cheek are you afraid we wont have the time russell poured himself more coffee when i was in college i had a recurring dream about coming to the end of a vast flat featureless plain across which i had been walking for years in front of me was a sheer drop into blackness and i would wake up terrified because i did not want to take another step forward he looked at her now i think id prefer stepping over the edge than staying on that flat featureless plain then well step over it together tori said she threw her arms around him kissed him goodbye well have as much time as we need i promise you she went off the plane there was a sickly burnt smell in the brown air as if all of los angeles was on fire with her diplomatic credentials she passed quickly through customs and immigration she stopped to get some work done at the mall facility at the airport russell was so mobile he had insisted that the mall have stations at the airports in washington new york los angeles and san francisco it was there that tori ran into bernard godwin they stood in silence looking at one another for some time ah the prodigal returns bernard said oddly he seemed smaller than she remembered but that patrician countenance had not changed can i buy you a cup of coffee no id like a chance to talk to you russells waiting tori got her work back she signed the receipt with russells name thanked the agent bernard started all over again you and russell did one helluva job for you tori said at length only for you bernard thats nonsense and you know it tori said nothing whats the matter i gave you everything you wanted reinstatement a field command russell i even gave you your brother back bastard tori thought he deserves to be cut off at the knees and then she told him how hitasura had used him to further the manufacture and distribution of the supercocaine she saw the blood drain from bernards face by degrees he put one hand out to steady himself she did not make a move to help him when she was finished she said its important to remember that theres a price tag for everything bernard even freedom she left him there shaken and mute she had thought that telling him would make her feel better she was wrong when tori arrived at dianas garden laura nunn was over at universal shooting something called the black fox dossier it was a spy film she played the mother of the hero very fitting on the other hand to toris utter astonishment ellis nunn had taken the day off he had spent the hour from six to seven in the morning making his essential overseas calls from his den in the huge house laura nunns limo had picked her up at five to take her to the studio for makeup tori had arrived after her mother had left but before anyone else was stirring she had let herself into the house had left whatever baggage she had in the enormous entrance hall and had stolen up to bed she had given her parents no notice of her coming but as usual her room was immaculate ready for her she collapsed gratefully onto her bed when she woke up she looked out her window saw her father strolling beside the pool the sunlight already red and dripping with heat fell across his broad shoulders in a moment he stopped looked up toward toris bedroom window and she saw him full on she was immediately struck by this fact no matter how much time and energy he had spent trying to be american he still had that classic russian face it was a beautifully sculptured face rugged but somehow not harsh his eyes so similar to his childrens gave his countenance its splash of warmth and gentleness tori could imagine him striding purposefully down gorky street a half hour later she joined ellis nunn in the dining room where a prodigious buffet breakfast had been laid out he kissed her on both cheeks in the traditional manner dobro pojalovatz he said in russian welcome home im damn glad youre in one piece he gestured you must be starved at least your mother thought so she dragged maria out of bed at an ungodly hour to prepare all this mom was gone when i arrived shes on the set i got all the hot news from maria on my way downstairs mmm well maria must have seen your bags in the entrance and done this on her own she always did have a soft spot for you that was when tori trotted out the photograph the mall people had made at their lax airport facility ellis nunn took the revelation with admirable sangfroid imagine he said bernard and me caught in the act he bent over peering more closely at the sixteenbytwentyinch blowup of ariel solaress photo there i am with your mother coming to meet bernard by god thats eerie to see on film its a good thing the picture was taken by one of bernards own agents ellis nunn nodded yes i suppose it is when it appeared that neither of them was hungry they drifted outside they began to walk the grounds as ellis nunn loved to do first by the pool and then into the sundappled gardens the scent of lime was everywhere tori ducked her head why didnt you ever tell me about la lumiere dor she was speaking of the americanowned french firm koi had told her aboutwhich she now knew was owned by her fatherthat was the conduit for the mands hafnium what was there to tell i have subsidiaries in italy spain hong kong as well as france i never told you about those either it never occurred to me that youd be in the least interested tori snorted i think id have been interested in la lumiere dors extracurricular activities they were none of your business he looked at her oh dont look like that i d say the same thing to your mother if she ever asked which she never has but she was involved with the scheme that you and bernard bernard talked to her independently as a woman of means your mother has always made her own business decisions shes good at it and anyway it saves wear and tear on the both of us how exactly did bernard rope you into paying for these mands he told you about greg right well first of all bernard didnt rope your mother and me into anything we both went into this with our eyes wide open he outlined the risks tori again heard bernard godwins voice saying no matter what we become involved in we would never be brought before a court of law some risks she said ellis nunn stopped turned toward her i meant the risks to greg and you not to your mother or myself oh tori did not know what to say they continued their walk they strolled beneath the pergola losing themselves in the blooms and vines of high summer tori thought of her fathers tales of the georgian peasants toiling heroically in their fields what was it like there tori knew he meant russia its not like home aunty em he grunted and she remembered belatedly how he used to admonish her for using her wit at inappropriate times i found moscow strange she said immediately it was not what i had expected did you like it tori suspected that her answer was important to him so she thought about it for some time before she spoke i didnt hate it she said slowly i felt uncomfortable there but that may just have been the circumstances but it also had ani dont knowa haunting quality i guess you could say yes ellis nunn said and tori could see that he was remembering his childhood and that that past was as clear to him as was this dawning day you didnt fully answer my question about how bernard got you and mom involved i know there was silence for a time ellis nunn stopped them in the center of the pergola the wisteria twined over their heads creating a cool green bower how did greg seem to you changed tori said and she saw her father wince its only to be expected after what hes been through which is what even bernard had no idea what the russians were doing with him or why they were keeping him captive it seems that he and his russian cosmonaut counterpart were part of a highly secret experiment involving controlled exposure to cosmic rays good god tori could see her father shaking in a moment he said we must make a pact we will never under any circumstances tell your mother this but greg told me you knew what he looked like either he was mistaken or he was misinformed then she wont be able to see him his skin is silvery and slick like a dolphins hes hairless and there may be other changes by the time you get to see him ellis nunn sat abruptly on the romanstyle stone bench in the center of the pergola he stared at nothing ah he said softly what a world they remained like that for some time father and daughter near one another yet in other more important ways apart tori knew that her heart should go out to her father yet she felt nothing he was still as closed off to her as he had ever been she wondered what went on in his mind other than his quite obvious love for greg she could discover nothing into her mind crept memories of koi the essence of that last afternoon with koi glowed like a pearl in the viscera of her memory intense splashes of color the flash of the blade the first splash of blood so shocking the lights in the mountains glowing opening the door letting the light in wasnt that something that greg had said tori wondered how one persons death could open the door let the light in and yet it was so kois last moments had somehow changed tori in the same way they had changed koi herself i was also wearing white that afternoon tori thought her blood seeped onto me into me she was obsessed the way i was but being with her allowed me to look into the mirror of my own soul to see what for so long i had not wanted to see i was addicted to violence to the power wielding it gave me in a mans world but in her i saw how utterly corrupting violence is in the end koi understood that about herself so sad that she had to die so sad that she could not change as i will make myself change ellis nunn shook himself he became aware of tori watched for a time the look on her face he opened his mouth as if to say something then closed it silence seeped in around them like the twining vines of the wisteria laura nunn arrived back in dianas garden just before midnight she always seemed to have a knack of knowing where tori was in the vast house and so she swept into the library where tori sat curled in a chair reading stanley karnows vietnam a history darling its so wonderful to have you home again hello mother tori closed her book laura nunn frowned arranged herself in the lotus position at the foot of toris chair yoga keeps the body young and supple she laughed a little at the stilted phrase learned from her instructor tori knew she was nervous she sat up she had never known her mother to be nervous laura nunn said i understand you saw greg why didnt you tell me he was alive why did you let me go on grieving for him oh my darling dont you think your father and i werent grieving for the torture he was undergoing youre avoiding answering me ive never been very good at handling inquisitions tori moaned one question is not an inquisition mother its the tone im talking about not the number all right im sorry tori knew shed never get anywhere unless she acquiesced laura nunn nodded i was told not to by whom why your father of course tori regarded her mother for some time before she said was not telling me his idea well no laura nunn said as i remember it bernard godwin might have mentioned it do you know why one had to be patient like dealing with a recalcitrant sixyearold of course i do laura nunn said angry he wanted to spare you she nodded yes those were his words exactly i want to spare tori any unnecessary anxiety i think im going to need a better explanation than that you must ask your father then tori leaned forward im asking you dont do this to me tori its not my place youre my mother tori said heatedly it is your place laura nunn put her head in her hands began to sob tori watched her uncertain whether this scene was real planned or was simply another of her mothers adlibbed actors exercises i suppose you think im a foolish woman laura nunn said when her sobbing subsided sufficiently always involved in the latest fashions always throwing lavish parties no dont bother to deny it theres no point anymore she wiped her eyes sighed the truth is i detest all that the truth is im a simple country girl who is at heart far too insecure to risk being herself she tossed her head sniffled anyway im in the wrong city the wrong profession for that no one seems interested in finding out whats below the careful facade in this town when anyone bothers to scratch the surface they do it to draw blood not to discover whats underneath sort of like my profession tori said seeing it for the first time laura nunn cocked her head thoughtfully yes now that you mention it perhaps thats true but only in a way she reached out put her hand gently almost shyly on her daughters knee but youre so much more tori i mean youre the zen policeman arent you tori her heart thudding heavily could hear greg saying remember the zen policeman and his small smile that had stayed with her all the way home what do you mean well i shouldnt tell you this i suppose but well thats how your father thinks of you as the zen policeman she took toris hand in hers squeezed it oh i know you think hes hard and uncaring i know it hurts you to think that he loves greg and not you but thats so far from the truth its laughable the truth is that greg was always the difficult one he drove your father to distraction he was a weak child and always afraid of the dark of being alone and especially of being in the water i took to protecting him which im afraid angered your father farther a boy should look up to his father ellis once told me sternly not his mother anyway ellis fell madly in love with you from the moment i gave birth to you you were such a happy baby and you were strong and so very smart when he played with you you so delighted him you were going to fulfill his every dream and then inexplicably you left him you ran awayall the way to japan the other side of the world you abandoned him and he was utterly devastated once again tori heard bernard godwins voice saying well if life has taught me anything its this truth is a complex animal every time you think youve caught it by the tail it turns around and bites you on the ass but my leaving wasnt inexplicable tori said oh i know that my dear but your father couldntor wouldntunderstand you were his universe and you left him flat thats all he could see and hes been punishing me ever since no no lauras eyes widened oh how could you ever think such a thing who do you think roused maria out of bed this morning to make sure everything you liked to eat was ready for you when you awoke hed never admit it of course no ellis has been punishing himself hes convinced he failed you in some way otherwise he reasons why would you have left so suddenly so utterly she rose up kissed tori warmly on the lips were so proud of what you do she smiled a little do you see now why he became involved with bernard it was only partially for gregs sake and for the sake of his own soviet heritage bernard gave us no guarantees that what we would do would help greg in any way but your father saw a way to become if only peripherally a part of your life again he never admitted that to me but i can assure you darling that this was his main reason for accepting bernards offer laura nunn stroked toris hair wiped away her daughters tears and smiled you know in the beginning bernard said he could give us no assurances that greg would be protected he said he had no agents whom he could trust enough and do you know what your father said bernard youre wrong you have the zen policeman tori found her father taking his laps in the pool he had come home early from work but had not sought her out it was late in the afternoon of the following day the light slanted in through the palms and the cropped norfolk pines illuminating the surface of the water ellis nunns powerful shoulder muscles as he worked up and down the length of the pool tori in a onepiece bathing suit slipped silently into the water she was immediately reminded of greg and felt a pang of mingled joy and sadness for a while she did nothing but parallel her father and he intent on his exercise did not let up his pace though surely he was aware of her presence when finally he broke off he said its nice having you in the pool with me again they hung in the water with the california sun burnishing their faces the leaves rustled briefly as the ghost of a breeze came up dad tori began im sorry i left you ellis nunn turned away but tori swam in front of him you know sooner or later i had to leave she searched his face dad she took a deep breath it wasnt anything you did your mothers been talking to you he said tightly dont be angry with her it was time for me to know i think she understood that you shouldnt know these things she moved closer to him why not youll think im weak he lifted his head up the sunlight struck him im not weak you know i know dad she watched him dont you think its important i understand who you are he looked at her finally why did you do it why did you run away tori was still for some time i left because i was stifling here everything was so unreal the parties the money the people it got so i was lost in it alllost in the glitter of the forest dont you see dad i had to go far enough away to find a space for myself that wasnt cluttered by all of this you hated it here didnt you no tori shook her head dont think that i was so lost i couldnt possibly have known what it was i felt try to understand dad only time could allow me to do that ellis nunn looked into his daughters angel eyes ill never forget you were such a beautiful baby you used to love to crawl across me and laughing pound your tiny fists against my chest so it was true there were other things beside his childhood in russia that he remembered with fondness he sniffed rubbed his nose we never let each other inside did we why was that do you think maybe we were always too much alike we each had expectations and they were unfulfilled because they were unrealistic ellis nunn thought about that for some time then he nodded you were always a smart girl he said that was your doing dad tori said ellis nunn reached out for his daughter crushed her against him dobro pcjalovatz papa tori said welcome home gregory nunn was sleeping on arbats back irina floated beside him the worst was over valeri and his white star moscow contingent had managed to keep a semblance of order as they rounded up the conspirators one of valeris men had been killed by a kgb colonel in lefortovo before control had been effected by the firing of a mand that had gotten everyones attention another had been wounded in the course of subduing a red army general valeri was now locked away with the premier trying to hammer out the preliminary guidelines to a compromise irina watched the play of light as it softly touched the heros face she wanted very much to be with him but he had been so exhausted and he seemed so close to a state of grace that she did not want to wake him but perhaps her thoughts betrayed her because at that moment his eyes opened irina felt the opalescent light from his gaze caress her like gentle sunlight did you sleep as well he asked a little mostly i was watching you sleep she was

it how can they refuse but i have no training i will train you myself he laughed i hope you arent claustrophobic irina said seriously how can you be so sure they will expend the time and money to send
