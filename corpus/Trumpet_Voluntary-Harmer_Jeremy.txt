 chapter one the silent house it seems impossible to feel so happy and so sad all at the same time laughter and tears not what you would expect for someone in my situation maybe in time the future in which i am so confident will cancel out the bad memories of the past theres so much to look forward to after all but theres so much to remember too it all started on the day that my wife disappeared well no thats not quite true it had started a long time before that only i didnt know anything about it that just shows you how stupid i was things were happening right in front of my nose and i never even realised i should have seen the signs but i was blind to them on that particular day i came home after a rehearsal i opened the door and walked into the house i put my viola case on the floor took off my coat and hung it up then i took my viola into our music room i wanted to look through some of the new quartet music before the next rehearsal thats when i noticed my wifes old trumpet the one she had played for the last ten years it wasnt in its case it was on top of the piano as if shed abandoned it in the middle of a practice that was strange my wife always left her instrument in its case perhaps she had just gone upstairs for a minute but then i noticed the silence in the house you could feel it i went into the kitchen there was a coffee cup in the sink it hadnt been washed that was strange too my wife never left dirty cups in the sink i went upstairs the bed was unmade now i was really worried then i noticed the cupboard it was open emptier than usual suddenly i started to get frightened i ran into the middle bedroom the room she used as an office i opened the cupboard door there one of our suitcases was missing for a moment i stood there my mind refusing to accept what was in front of my eyes i thought somebody had taken her clothes and stolen her suitcase then i remembered the trumpet on the piano perhaps she had gone somewhere but where why hadnt she told me then i thought oh no perhaps someone has kidnapped her forced her to go away but something told me this wasnt true and i sat down on the chair in front of her computer i tried to think but all i could see was her face last night in that italian restaurant smiling at me through the candle flame she had been so kind so beautiful we hadnt argued at all it was the happiest evening for ages i thought everything was all right again i looked out of the window at the park behind our house half past five in the afternoon on a beautiful late august afternoon children were playing in the sunshine the old man was walking his dog talking to it sometimes before pulling it forward on its lead he walked his dog at the same time every day malgosia and i used to watch him and laugh together but lately we hadnt been laughing very much at all and thats when i knew suddenly that she had gone for good thats why she was so loving yesterday she was saying goodbye i rushed downstairs to the hall my heart beating far too fast i couldnt find our address book in its usual place i ran into the music room and got my electronic organiser from my viola case my fingers were shaking so much that it was difficult to make the damn thing work but i found rosemarys number in the end and dialled it rosemary was my wifes best friend rosemary i said when she answered where is malgosia wheres she gone who is this she answered confused derek is that you yes i said of course its me where is she derek whats the matter you sound terrible what are you talking about malgosia i said where is she i dont know rosemary said i could hear her children in the background isnt she there of course she isnt here thats why im asking you i shouted theres no need to talk to me like that she said angrily i forced myself to calm down and apologised rosemary asked me to tell her what the matter was so i did youre not going to like this derek she said when i had finished but i havent got any idea where she is i mean i knew you werent that happy together what i interrupted what did you say she must have been worried by the tone of my voice oh nothing she said nothing just that margie thats what she called her said that sometimes you and she well that life wasnt always very much fun so you knew she was going to leave i insisted no no of course i didnt rosemary replied and i wondered whether to believe her look derek she went on im sorry ive got to go but ill ring you this evening all right i dont know anything about this honestly you cant go now i cried i was desperate hey derek she said cutting in its wednesday isnt it yes but so have you rung the theatre they might know something the theatre of course why hadnt i thought of that i slammed down the telephone receiver without saying goodbye then i picked it up again and dialled the number of the drury lane theatre royal thats where malgosia was playing trumpet three nights a week in the musical miss saigon in a few minutes i was talking to duncan gardner the musical director of the orchestra for the show duncan i said is malgosia there no of course not why of course not i asked shes left the band he said sounding surprised shes what derek he said whats going on i dont understand she said that she was going away i thought she was going somewhere with you do you know where she was going i asked derek what on earth is going on did she say where she was going i asked again no she just said she was leaving england leaving england yes he said leaving england i sat there with my mind in chaos leaving england but where was she going the world is a big place derek derek are you all right i heard duncan say sure i replied im fine and i put down the receiver i looked at myself in the mirror above the telephone and saw my terrified face the face of a man whose wife had left him i felt like a fool i didnt want to make the next call but i couldnt think what else to do i dialled the number of malgosias parents in warsaw perhaps my wife had run back to poland her country the country she had left when she came to study music in london ten years before someone picked up the phone in warsaw they spoke in polish which was not surprising of course but it is a language i have never been able to use hello i said is that teresa teresa is malgosias mother the voice on the other end said something more in polish i couldnt understand a word of it can i speak to teresa i said this is derek from england malgosias husband there was a silence at the other end of the line then the voice started speaking again quickly trying to tell me something i suddenly realised that it was malgosias grandmother she didnt speak a word of english and i couldnt say anything in polish so i said goodbye and put down the phone i went to the kitchen and got a bottle of wine i opened it and poured myself a glass and drank it then i poured another and another i wondered what to do it was beginning to get dark outside i thought of malgosia sitting at the kitchen table opposite me the two of us sitting in silence there had been a lot of silence recently i thought of malgosia practising in the music room the beautiful sound of her trumpet echoing through the house would i ever hear that sound again i thought of malgosia sitting in her office tapping at the keys of her computer investigating all those sites on the internet talking to people all over the world while i stayed downstairs watching television suddenly i sat up straight thats it i told myself thats it the computer maybe i would learn something from the computer i ran up to her office and switched her machine on i went straight to her emails hoping to find some clue some indication of where she might have gone and i was instantly rewarded there was a message in the file marked incoming mail which she must have read earlier in the day i pointed the mouse at it and clicked when the message appeared i read it and then read it again trying to understand it the words in front of me just didnt seem to make much sense malgosia where are you ill try and ring you but in case i cant get through things are getting a bit difficult get here quick otherwise ill be in trouble youll love rio i promise tibor tibor it was the first time i had heard that name for many years of course it might not be the tibor i was thinking of but somehow in my heart i knew immediately that it was and i felt all the anger and hurt all over again there was a loud knocking at the front door i switched off the computer and went downstairs so much had happened that i couldnt think straight tibor rio did that mean rio de janeiro i opened the door two policemen were standing there mr armstrong one of them said yes i answered whats happened is something wrong the police only come to your door when something terrible has happened is mrs armstrong in the first policeman asked ignoring my question malgosia armstrong he said pronouncing it with an s sound instead of the sh sound it should have no no she isnt why do you want her are you sure she isnt here sir the second policeman said of course im sure i answered back why whats this all about we just want to ask mrs armstrong a few questions said the first policeman questions what about i asked i think sir said the first policeman it would be a good idea if we came inside dont you chapter two tibor and malgosia the first time i saw my wife she was laughing it was in the canteen at the royal academy of music in marylebone road london i had arrived there two weeks before to start my three year course as a music student studying the viola as my first instrument my parents hadnt wanted me to be a music student even my mother for whom music was almost as important as eating and breathing and who wanted me to love music too thought that it wasnt the right kind of career for me if i wanted to get on in the world instead she and my father wanted me to be a doctor like he was but i was never very good at science and anyway i hated the sight of blood i was probably a bit of a coward i suppose i wasnt very good at sport either i suppose you could say that i was always crazy about music my mother was a fantastic pianist when i was a child she didnt earn money from it except for the few pupils who used to come to her for lessons at the weekend but all through my childhood i would hear her playing beautiful music sometimes late on summer evenings as i lay listening in my bed i learned to love the sound of her playing as i went to sleep later i realised that music for my mother was a secret world that she felt safe in a world where my father was on the outside looking in a world where she was the boss and where her imagination was set free i think my mother wanted me to discover that world too so i started violin lessons when i was only six i loved it immediately and some of my happiest memories of childhood are of the times when i made music on my little violin and my mother accompanied me on the piano later my teacher told me that i could change to the viola because then i would get into all the orchestras i wanted to there are never enough viola players he told me so youll always be wanted and he was right the moment i started on the viola i got into school orchestras and later youth orchestras with very little trouble although violas are only slightly bigger than violins you have to play them differently they have their own unique sound theyre not superstars like violins but they make all the nice noises inside the music all the beautiful harmonies violas are modest but theyre charming warm and loving everything i hoped i could be gradually as i went through school i spent more and more time doing music and less and less time studying anything else in the end my parents had to admit that i would never get to university with my poor marks but a career in music was just a possibility and so even though my father really disapproved and he told me so about three times a week he agreed to let me go to music college to study viola and piano it was all i could do and it was all i wanted to do i have a clear memory of that morning when i met malgosia it was two weeks into my three year course i came down the stairs after a viola lesson which had demonstrated to me how much i still had to learn i wasnt having much success socially either and just occasionally i wondered whether my father had been right i opened the canteen doors still nervous about being a new boy still unsure about whether i really belonged there i walked into the canteen and queued up to get some coffee behind me i could hear people talking and laughing mens voices womens voices i paid for my coffee and turned round there was a large group of people around a table they were all listening to someone sitting next to the wall although i didnt know many of the other students yet i recognised the person who was talking he was famous at the academy he was a third year student and his name i had been told was tibor arkadi he was half english half albanian and one of the characters at college he was a brilliant pianist and trumpet player and he was studying conducting everybody said he would be the next solti a karajan for the twentyfirst century they said he made magic when he stood up in front of an orchestra they said people would do anything for him anything at all with him they took musical risks they would never take with any of the other conducting students and he got the girls one thirdyear viola player who had talked to me third years dont usually talk to first years said that everyone had to fall in love with tibor at least once she had she said but she was over it now i wasnt convinced by that last bit i stood and looked at him he was sitting back in his chair a tall thin darkhaired man with bright laughing eyes and a wide sensual mouth even i could see that he was incredibly goodlooking even i could tell that he knew it i dont think i have ever met anyone before or since who was so sure of himself he looked up and saw me standing there a frightened first year with a pile of music in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other i thought he would ignore me but instead turning to the people he was with he said now who have we got here what new musical being is this they all turned round and looked at me laughing at the way he had asked the question and thats when i saw malgosia she was laughing too her beautiful head thrown back on her long neck her mouth open to reveal perfect white teeth her eyes shining with happiness she was easily the most beautiful woman i had ever seen with long red hair falling over her shoulders i couldnt take my eyes off her hey whoever you are stop staring at malgosia and tell us who you are tibor had spoken again and i had to tear my eyes away from the redhead even then i knew somehow that tibor was dangerous im derek i said derek armstrong well derek armstrong youd better come and join us it felt like an order i looked for somewhere to sit come on you polish beauty he said to the redhead move up so that derek can sit on your chair too he was laughing at me but i could not refuse i sat down and was immediately aware of malgosias intoxicating perfume and tibors irresistible charm so said the handsome student of conducting whats your instrument then what do you study piano i replied nervously and viola ah he smiled the viola the people round the table laughed you have to get used to that if youre a viola player its the instrument that everyone makes jokes about hey said a young man on my left whats the difference between a viola and a trampoline oh no not that old one tibor complained i dont know it said malgosia at my side she had the most beautiful voice crisp like april frost and what is a what do you call it a trampoline its a thing that gymnasts jump on do cartwheels boing boing explained the joke teller making movements with his arms oh said malgosia oh i see and she said a word in polish to show that she understood since nobody else spoke her language it was difficult to tell if she had got it right so what is the difference between a viola and a trampoline well said the person on my left you have to take your shoes off to jump on a trampoline there was a silence while the people who did not know the joke thought about it and then they laughed so did i even though i had heard the joke many times before you have to laugh to show that you dont mind people making fun of you its like all jokes though when viola players tell viola jokes i think theyre funny but when other people do it i get all angry heres one i heard yesterday tibor said and instantly everyone turned towards him perhaps you know it derek i still dont know why he paid attention to me that day perhaps he was bored perhaps he was looking for a new victim i dont believe he ever liked me i dont know i managed to say it depends ok he answered lets see here goes imagine that you are lost in a forest a terrible dark forest and you are very frightened and you want to leave the forest but you dont know the way he paused for dramatic effect yes asked the joke teller on my left yes go on thank you justin tibor said so there you are terrified and afraid and its getting dark and suddenly you see figures coming towards you in the darkness you realise that they are a pink elephant a good viola player and a bad viola player and you know that one of them can tell you the way out of the forest who do you ask he looked round the group nobody answered you dont know he asked well then ill tell you you ask the bad viola player because the other two only exist in your imagination and he laughed and then everyone laughed and for some reason i went red did you like that joke malgosia asked me a couple of minutes later tibor had got tired of me and was talking to someone else yes i had to say i dont think you did not very much she said well its ok ive heard it before yes she said but why do people make all these jokes about viola players it is not the same in poland i dont know why do people make jokes about irish people or bavarians or polish people i said that is only in america i think malgosia said but perhaps it means that we have something in common something that is the same for both of us she turned to me and looked at me with those big blue eyes of hers and i knew that i was lost hey malgosia tibor said getting up were going over to a greek restaurant in charlotte street do you want to come me she said in surprise me she was obviously delighted that he had asked her yes yes of course she got up forgetting me immediately and they all marched out of the canteen leaving me sitting there wondering if she or tibor would ever speak to me again and whether i wanted them to or not chapter three rachel tibor and malgosia became lovers of course even when i think about that now it hurts after all this time it still hurts but there was nothing i could have done even if i had known how to she fell for him almost immediately perhaps it was the scene in the canteen that did it for her perhaps it was later in some pub or cafe that she looked at him and felt the joyous pain that love can be i dont know i only know that when i realised what the situation was i thought i would die with unhappiness because i was crazy about her too absolutely obsessed with the thought of her and though we were the best of friends and she came to cry on my shoulder every time tibor ignored her or cheated on her and even though i was sure she was very fond of me still she didnt love me like i poor fool loved her instead i had to watch her eyes light up with excitement every time tibor walked into the room i had to learn to grin and bear it every time she cancelled one of our visits to the cinema or a folk club because she was going to be with him i had to accept that compared to tibor i would always be second best one afternoon a few weeks into that first term i went into dukes hall because i could hear the sound of a trumpet i pushed open the wood and glass doors malgosia was on the empty stage making the most beautiful noise i had ever heard another student was accompanying her on the organ they were playing the trumpet voluntary one of the most famous english trumpet tunes there is i stood and listened until she had finished then she saw me and smiled that was beautiful i told her i love purcells music its not purcell malgosia said everybody thinks he wrote it but it was actually written by someone called jeremiah clarke ive been reading about it did you know she went on he killed himself for love its the kind of thing they did in those days isnt it romantic no i laughed its stupid if you ask me ah she replied dreamily you are just a man an english man but to die for love that takes a more passionate soul than yours perhaps at the end of the first year when the summer holidays began malgosia went back to poland to be with her family right up until the moment she left i had this dream that she would invite me to visit her there but somehow i knew that she wouldnt my parents who knew nothing of my romantic depression wanted me to go on holiday with them but with the arrogance of youth i couldnt stand the idea i was much happier busking on the streets of london playing for cinema queues and shopping tourists with the new student quartet i had joined at the end of the summer term our first violin player carl robins was rather uneasy about playing mozarts eine kleine nachtmusik ten times a day because hed rather be attempting shostakovich and bartok and rachel merino our cellist was uncomfortable with the long metal spike which allowed her to play standing up still as matt jenkins the second violinist said its good performance practice and were earning quite a bit of money too noones complaining about that it was true people seemed to like the way we played and my open viola case soon filled up with small change we earned even more when a law student who lived with me came to help us by going round our audiences with a hat asking for donations ken a nigerian wasnt very keen on the music we played but he was a magician with the hat he almost ran around the crowds that were listening to us smiling at them laughing and joking telling them we were poor refugees anything to make them put their hands in their pockets it looked like it was going to be a good summer sometimes i even forgot about malgosia but not for long one evening as we packed up our instruments for the day rachel suggested that we go to a pub by the river in chiswick where she lived the next day was sunday so we werent going to play and anyway we needed a break the others didnt want to go all that way because its a long journey from central london but i had nothing better to do so i agreed it was a lovely evening rachel and i sat outside and watched the life of the river in front of us there were birds the sounds of a great city all around us planes starting their final approach to heathrow airport rowers shouting orders at each other and a little police boat making its way down river its blue light flashing as it went as fast as it could towards some emergency i liked rachel she was quiet and gentle she had light brown hair and pretty brown eyes set in a round pleasant face when she smiled she looked like a happy child and you knew you could trust her she was very easy to be with that night we sat and talked about what we hoped for the future i told her i wanted to make enough money as a musician to have a nice house travel a bit that kind of thing she told me that her dreams were much the same she wanted children one day she said but for that shed need to find the right man well its no good looking at me i said as a joke i know that you fool she said laughing at me you cant see anybody anyway not while malgosia is in the way i blushed maybe i replied i didnt like talking about it can i say something rachel asked nervously it depends what it is i replied around us people were talking and laughing as the night got darker i saw the lights of a party boat travelling along the river in front of us its just that well i know malgosia is beautiful i mean really beautiful i wish i was beautiful like that and i do like her but shes crazy about tibor and anyone whos crazy about tibor well she stopped and looked at me wondering how i would react well what i answered i understood what she was saying i think but i didnt like anyone criticising malgosia oh god now youre cross with me rachel said sorry sorry but its just a pity to see you and her shes not right for you youre wasting your time wasting your life on her and youre not getting anything back it doesnt look good thats my opinion well i snapped back without thinking i dont care what your opinion is ok me and malgosia well were i wanted a word that meant more than friend but i couldnt think of the right one were special all right so its none of your business just keep out of my affairs ok rachel had gone red and i had gone too far my only excuse is that i was very confused then and still very young but i suppose if i am honest that wasnt it it was because rachel had said something that i didnt want to hear because it was the truth now i think that if only i had listened to her then if only i had understood what she was trying to tell me i might not have made the decisions that i did and my life might have turned out very differently we finished our drinks in silence i tried to start conversations again once or twice but she only answered with yes or no so it wasnt much good in the end when closing time was called by the pub landlord we just said goodbye and i caught the tube back into london as the train made its way noisily through the darkness i thought about the conversation i had just had and i realised that it probably meant the end of the quartet oh well i thought i can join another one or well find a new cellist it doesnt matter and then i suddenly saw rachels face rachels sad gentle face and perhaps it was the drink or perhaps it was because it was a warm summers night or perhaps i was just lonely i dont know but anyway at the next station i got off the train walked over the bridge and got on the first train which was going back the way i had just come half an hour later i was at the door of rachels house i rang the bell the door opened derek rachel said in surprise i thought you had gone home i was going to i replied and then i just thought but i didnt really know what i had thought so i kissed her instead she didnt seem to mind so i kissed her again and it was very nice and soon just kissing didnt seem to be enough and well you can imagine the rest the next morning we couldnt look at each other we had gone too far too fast all i could think was that i had somehow betrayed malgosia which was ridiculous since she didnt love me and all rachel could think was that i had used her it was raining when i reached the tube station i didnt feel good and wondered how to cheer myself up when i got back to my house the first thing ken said to me was where have you been you look awful thanks i said thanks a lot hey dont you worry about it you can sleep it off whatever it was ken said i dont know i answered well how about a coffee while youre thinking about it he offered so we sat and talked and i told him about rachel even though i knew i shouldnt but i needed someone to talk to well he said when i had finished my story of the previous night things like that dont happen to me over here not yet anyway youre just lucky then why dont i feel lucky i asked him well now he laughed i cant help you there maybe youre crazy or something yes thats probably it and we laughed and after half an hour in his company i felt better because he didnt seem to think that i had done anything terrible and because he let me tell him about malgosia and he didnt say that i was wasting my time the next day the quartet met up outside covent garden tube station as we had done every day since we started busking i wasnt sure whether rachel would be there but she had already arrived when i got out of the lift which had brought me up from the depths of london and walked out into the sunshine she avoided my eyes and wouldnt talk to me at first but later when we were setting up at one end of the old market building and the other two were getting their violins out of their cases she came up to me derek she said can we have a quick word yes i said nervously its just this she announced seriously looking away from me what happened happened i know that but its not going to happen again is it no i said and i meant it right she said in a controlled way and you want the quartet to continue dont you yes yes i think so so can we just be friends she asked i wonder how much that cost her if thats ok i said i felt a great sense of relief to be honest i had expected more problems than this yes it is ok she said and started to walk away but then she turned back came right up to me and for the first time that day she looked me full in the eyes one last thing she whispered i dont want anyone else knowing about our knowing about it and we wont talk about it ever again ok ok i agreed she relaxed then smiled at me walked away again and before long we were halfway through the first movement of the mozart and the money was falling into kens hat but one afternoon two weeks later when we broke for lunch rachel refused to go on playing and she wouldnt say why and that was the end of our little band at least for the time being we watched her walking away her head down she hadnt said goodbye to anyone what was that all about carl asked as rachel disappeared round a corner does anyone know whats going on we all looked at each other nobody had any idea what about you ken matt said as our moneycollector came towards us with four pints of beer on an old bar tray from the pub behind us what about what ken answered why did rachel go off like that do you know me said ken why should i know dont ask me must be some musician thing why are you asking me hey i told him dont be so defensive im sure it wasnt your fault but of course it was his fault and my fault rachel and ken had been walking towards the pub together ken told me later and hed asked her how she felt about me now and rachel had said what do you mean and ken had answered you know after that night of yours that night together and rachel had stopped in the middle of the street gone bright red and said who told you that how do you know that did derek tell you that her voice getting louder with every question then shed marched past ken packed up her cello told us she was leaving and walked away without a word of farewell the summer holidays ended and the autumn term at the academy began there was no sign of malgosia the first day and she hadnt answered either of the letters i had sent her so i was pretty miserable i tried to talk to rachel but she refused to speak to me i asked her begged her to play with us again and all she said was how can i play with you again you told ken all about us didnt you why should i spend any more time in your company than i have to things also werent going well with my studies my viola teacher was ill and the man who took her place for that first week didnt like me and i felt the same about him my piano playing wasnt getting much better either carl and matt wanted to get another cellist for our quartet but somehow i could not agree to that i had already done enough damage there and i still hoped one day that rachel would change her mind and ken wouldnt talk to me because i had lost my temper with him about what he had said to rachel so i suppose you could say that my life was a mess i was playing badly i didnt have many friends and the person i thought i loved had disappeared from my life but not for long one evening six days after term started i was sitting in my room watching a bad old hollywood movie on my small television when someone knocked at my door i opened it ken stood outside hi i said come in you havent been around for a few days where have you been dont worry about where ive been he replied not looking me in the eye youve got more important things to think about what do you mean theres someone downstairs to see you he said and she doesnt look very happy who is it i asked him i dont know he replied ive never seen her before but shes really lovely if youre not interested just let me know id love to try and cheer her up i left him and walked downstairs the front door was still open it was beginning to get dark outside and a heavy rain was falling malgosia was standing in the passageway with two suitcases her beautiful hair dripping wet and a look of complete misery on her face chapter four the new trumpet i was really excited when tibor came to warsaw malgosia told me as i put on the kettle to make her a coffee i went to meet him at the airport i had told my family all about him they were a bit suspicious because he was the first man i had talked about like that but they were interested to meet him i gave malgosia a cup of coffee she had dried her hair and changed into some fresh clothes she looked thinner and whiter than i remembered so what was the problem i asked you met him at the airport it must have been fantastic malgosia was so involved in her own thoughts that i dont think she heard the note of bitterness in my voice oh it was fine at first she replied he was so pleased to see me and i well i was ecstatic he came out of those sliding doors with a big grin on his face and we threw our arms around each other and i it sounds great i said i really didnt want to hear the details of this happy romance after all well it was i drove him back to my parents house and everything was absolutely fine even my grandparents got on with him although he doesnt speak any polish but he speaks a bit of russian so they managed to communicate in a limited way and i think they liked him at first we had a lovely few days in warsaw and then i took him to see krakow one of our most beautiful cities and we travelled around the country my sister came with us too it was a very happy time when we got back to warsaw everything still seemed to be going well tibor and my father were soon very friendly with each other but when my father asked him about his plans he said he was bored with music he just wanted to be incredibly rich and live in the sun i have a dream of great wealth he said and nothing to do except spend it thats some dream my father said he had been in prison under the old political system because he was a member of a banned trade union now he works in a hotel his life hasnt been nearly as exciting as he had planned well not so far anyway malgosia stopped talking and slowly drank her coffee one night i had to go out malgosia started again after a few minutes to my friend irenas she was going to get married the next day so all of her girlfriends we had organised a party for her we had a wonderful time we laughed a lot and im afraid to say we drank quite a lot too so at the end of the party i stayed at irenas house i rang my father to say i wasnt coming home he said that tibor and my sister had gone out for a drink i was pleased they were getting on so well you always want your family to like your boyfriend dont you anyway i woke up very early and because irena was sleeping soundly i left the house without disturbing her i caught an early morning tram when i got home i let myself in quietly i wasnt feeling very good as you can imagine i hung my coat on its hook i kicked off my shoes i made a cup of coffee i didnt want to wake anyone but in the end i realised that i was feeling so bad that i would have to go back to bed so i went into the room i shared with my sister malgosia paused frowned and then continued and my sister anja was there of course fast asleep so was tibor next to her in her bed for a moment i didnt recognise him or perhaps i didnt want to recognise him thats nice i thought shes got a boyfriend and then it hit me and i dropped the cup of coffee i was carrying it made a terrible noise and coffee went everywhere tibor woke up at that point he looked a bit surprised anja opened her eyes too and when she saw me she let out a little scream something like oh no and i started screaming too i mean i know what tibor is like ive always known ever since i met him but i thought he had changed i thought he really loved me and the one place you feel safe you know is in your family but my sister my sister i couldnt believe that she would do that i couldnt believe he would do that the noise woke my parents of course and they came running into the room to see what was happening soon everybody was shouting and i said some terrible things tibor left later in the morning and since then its just been getting worse and worse anja and i we fought all the time and yesterday i said some unforgivable things to my father he must have realised you were upset i said to be helpful yes malgosia replied miserably but i asked him why he loved anja more than me and why hed been prepared to fight for his union in the old days but now he wouldnt even stand up for me against my sister i called her a lot of names i threw something at her then my father threw me out of the house so ive come here to you she said its the only place i could think of ive lost tibor ive lost my family i have no home anymore what am i going to do and she burst into tears much later i put her in my bed and after she had cried some more she fell asleep and all night i sat and watched her malgosia and i got married three years later and i thought i was the happiest man alive the woman who i worshipped as if she was a god had agreed after a great deal of persuasion to become my lover and then in the end my wife for her even second best was better than nothing in the end malgosias parents and grandparents came for the wedding though her sister anja didnt there was still an icy distance between her and malgosia my parents were on their best behaviour too when they had first met malgosia they had expressed their concern my father had even gone so far as to say i dont think shes really your type son shell cause you pain im sure of that and i had been terribly offended and we had an argument but on our wedding day they were all smiles and i was grateful to them for helping to make it such a special occasion i liked my new motherinlaw she was much calmer than her daughter you must not to blame malgosia if she is always exciting she told me in her rather broken english you must understand the mix up with that tibor and before it was a difficult time her childhood with the politics police are coming often she is very romantic now very what is the word passionate yes passionate but i think you know that already i think she is lucky my daughter she kissed me on the cheek you will be careful of her she asked and i said yes thats exactly what i would do it was such an easy promise to make such a difficult promise to keep the trouble started a few years later by then our quartet was doing well rachel had stopped feeling angry in the end back in those days at the academy and the four of us had stayed together ever since improving our playing developing a musical understanding between us that made it all worth while malgosias career was going well too she was getting work in musical shows in the west end both of us did some teaching as well and our lives seemed to be very comfortable although malgosia often looked bored and we had some days when we hardly spoke to each other but all marriages are like that i thought so i didnt worry very much but then one day when i was practising in the music room the phone rang i was just about to put down my viola and go to answer it when i heard malgosias voice coming from the kitchen and for some reason i half listened i couldnt hear what my wife was saying of course but it was a long conversation and sometimes she was silent but sometimes she talked urgently in a low voice i nearly went to listen to the conversation properly to see who it was she was speaking to but the piece of music i was working on was very difficult and the quartet were due to play it in a concert next day so i kept on playing after twenty minutes my curiosity got the better of me i opened the door as i did so i heard malgosia say goodbye in a loud and unnatural voice i walked into the kitchen who was that i asked rosemary she said that was a long conversation i went on wanting to see what she would say well yes were friends shes got problems malgosia answered in a badtempered kind of way what problems i asked though i knew that rosemarys husband had left her i just wanted to see how my wife would answer i suppose subconsciously i knew that something was wrong you know ted has left her and she has to look after the children on her own and hes not giving her enough money the usual look she said suddenly as if a thought had just come to her im going for a walk do you mind a walk i replied stupidly why do you want to do that malgosia never went for walks on her own i dont know im just feeling a bit on edge a bit depressed about rosemary probably so ill just go and walk it off ill come with you i said i didnt like her to feel sad no she answered immediately id rather be on my own and before i could protest she had walked past me taken her coat from the hall and walked out of the house slamming the door behind her when she came back she was calmer she said she was sorry she asked me to understand that she was a difficult person sometimes that was just how she was i knew that already of course and i loved her very much and so i said of course i understood only please i said pathetically do think of me sometimes of how it feels to be me poor derek she said and kissed me and the next day when i came home from the concert i had played in with the quartet malgosia was waiting for me she had cooked a special meal and there was an open wine bottle on the kitchen table why arent you at the theatre i asked surprised she was playing in the band for the phantom of the opera at that time i have taken a few days off she said sweetly come on derek darling sit down and have a glass of wine youre not working there for a few days i asked why not because i need some time to myself i need to be alone to think about some things what do you mean i need to be alone how are you going to be alone i asked her well i wasnt going to say this straight away she sat with her back to me and spoke in a soft nervous voice but now that were talking about it well im going to go away for a few days if thats all right i didnt say anything this was typical of malgosia sudden decisions surprises always doing things for herself it is what i loved about her it was what caused me pain look derek im sorry i know you think im selfish i know i cause you trouble sometimes but i couldnt live without you you know that i know i answered believing her i always believed her but whats all this about going away just for a few days thats all i just want to disappear be by myself have time to think but what about i asked again what do you need to think about life my past my parents us the music everything she said everyone needs time on their own sometimes youre going to birmingham for two days next week with the quartet i thought it was just the perfect time ok even if i agree with you where are you going i asked i dont know i havent decided maybe scotland she said dreamily and so i let her go she didnt tell me where she would be staying and she didnt get in touch with me while she was away but i was out of the house as well so it wasnt too much of a problem i just thought poor old malgosia such a complicated woman so intense so special so different of course she needs her space her time away theres nothing wrong with that when she got back she was happier than i had seen her for some time there was a brightness about her an excitement a sparkle in her eyes she came running into the house and flung her arms around me oh derek she said like some actress in a movie which i suppose is what she was its so lovely to see you she told me she had been in a convent in the north of scotland a hiddenaway religious order somewhere id never heard of she said she felt much better now much calmer she said that many of her doubts about herself were over with she made me happy and so i never asked her where she went i trusted her looking back i cant believe that i was so naive but she was so different so wild and passionate just as her mother had told me her troubled childhood had affected her that terrible business with tibor all that had made her the person she was i still couldnt believe my luck that she had agreed to marry me even though i knew that i fell far short of her ideal but in time that thought faded and i learned to be happy ten months later she went away again now i realise that it was the same pattern as before although at the time i didnt notice first a telephone call malgosia said it was rosemary or a musician friend or somebody i cant remember then two days later she suddenly announced that she needed some time on her own again she seemed troubled i even wondered if she was ill in some way but i let her go back to that same convent or so i thought where they didnt have any telephones she said so i couldnt get in touch with her when she came back she was happy as before bursting with life recovered alive i thought again that these days of reflection were for her better than a visit to a psychoanalyst better than the drugs she might otherwise have taken it happened twice more each time malgosia came home a different person and for a time after she returned we were as happy as we had been at the beginning of our relationship before we started arguing not talking to each other or even what was worse being extremely polite when she came back from the last trip she brought a new trumpet with her she said she had come across it in a music shop in glasgow on her way back shed had a few hours before her train left for london shed fallen in love with the instrument the moment shed set her eyes on it she said she hoped i didnt mind she knew id understand it was going to make her playing even better i asked to listen to it but she said not yet she wanted to get used to it first practise on it learn its funny ways and manners then i could hear it i understood how she felt but i was a bit offended that she wasnt involving me in the strange relationship that every musician has with a new instrument it was almost as if she was cheating on me she kept it shut in its case she had only shown it to me that first time when she arrived back home and even then shed just opened the case quickly and let me look inside before shutting it up again the new trumpet stayed in the corner of the music room for weeks once i dont know why i tried to open it to have a look inside but it was locked when i heard malgosia practising which she had started to do with the door closed it sounded the same as usual to me as if she was using her old instrument and then one night about three and a half weeks after she had returned from that last trip i came home but malgosia wasnt in the house and there was a message on the computer from tibor and while i was trying to understand why tibor was in contact with her after all this time and while i was trying to absorb the fact that my wife had probably gone to rio de janeiro without telling me there was a knock at the door and two policeman were standing there we just want to ask mrs armstrong a few questions they said before i knew it they were in my house and because malgosia wasnt there they questioned me instead chapter five deciding on priorities have you ever been to scotland sir asked one of the policemen a middleaged man who obviously ate and drank more than was good for him scotland i said stupidly as i think ive already said i wasnt thinking very clearly yes sir the man said its that place just north of england have you heard of it oh very funny i replied how could he be so sarcastic at a time like this glad you enjoyed my joke sir he said without smiling but whats the answer have you ever been to scotland yes of course i replied with my family when i was a child and ive played in the edinburgh festival with my quartet about three times yes three times we had our first great success there the edinburgh festival is one of europes great artistic events when was that sir when did you play in the edinburgh festival the last time i said about two years ago so you havent been to scotland for two years said the other policeman a younger man with very short hair and a nasty look in his eyes thats right officer ive just had this crazy idea i said and then i added if you listen to what i say you wont have to ask me questions more than once what do you think of that lets get one thing straight the shorthaired one said you can help us or you can be difficult if you want to be difficult thats your decision of course but we can make your life very uncomfortable now for example we can have this conversation here in the comfort of your own home or better still we can take you down to the police station and question you there what do you think of that im sure that wont be necessary said the fat policeman he was obviously the nice one in the pair im sure mr armstrong will help us in any way he can wont you sir i suppose so i heard myself saying i just wanted them to go so i could try and decide what to do though i already had a pretty good idea good thats better now then sir the shorthaired one went on you say you havent been to scotland for two years what about your wife well yes shes been a few times she came up to the festival to hear us play the first time we were there i said remembering how happy we had all been but its difficult for her to get away from her own work sometimes so she didnt come with us on the other two occasions we played there yes it must be difficult for her getting away said the unpleasant policeman with a nasty tone in his voice and thats the only time your wife went to scotland the first policeman asked yes i started and then i suddenly remembered i mean no shes been there a few times on her own to get away you know to get some personal space we all need it sometimes dont we i stopped they were both looking at me strangely and when shes been on her own the shorthaired one said where has she been exactly i thought i heard excitement in his voice she goes to a convent i replied a religious order its a very private place i see sir said the first policeman and where would that be the convent i dont know i said it suddenly sounded silly even to me im sorry sir said the nasty one what did you say look i protested i know it probably sounds strange but malgos my wife well she is quite a nervous person so she goes off for a bit of peace and quiet you know its perfectly ok i trust her completely you see she doesnt have to give me the address or anything i mean why should she if she wants to get away from it all do you know of someone called the overweight policeman glanced down at his notebook tibor arkadi tibor the shadow in my relationship ever since we had met ever since malgosia had turned up at my door at the beginning of my second year at college her hair wet from the rain her heart broken by the man who had fooled around with her sister well yes i replied trying to stop my voice trembling he was a student with us and where might that have been asked the fat policeman at the royal academy of music i answered automatically and have you seen him since then the shorthaired one said no no i havent i replied truthfully what about your wife he went on has she seen him i hesitated two hours ago i would have said no of course not but that was two hours ago since then id seen the email but then again malgosia was my wife and if she hadnt told me about tibor i was sure she wouldnt want me to tell the police well sir asked the friendly one has she seen him no no im sure she hasnt i replied well sir thats about all then said the nasty one suddenly i dont think we need to bother you anymore he got up as if to go excuse me i said can you tell me what this is all about well let you know as soon as we have anything to tell you he said oh by the way where is she your wife shes not here shes gone away and where would that be said the larger man not to scotland i expect no i said she hasnt gone to scotland did she bring anything back from scotland ever said the younger policeman anything special the older policeman looked as if he was annoyed at the younger mans interruption no i said miserably remembering how she never even brought me back a bottle of scotch whisky or a tin of shortbread biscuits but then it suddenly dawned on me the new trumpet oh no i was beginning to piece things together and although i wasnt anywhere near the truth yet i wasnt completely wrong either yes sir the policeman went on he must have seen the look on my face i never had a chance to answer suddenly the fat policemans radio started making noises and when he pressed a button on his chest i heard something like code code and an address repeated over and over again sorry sir but we have an emergency we have to go said the shorthaired one well see ourselves out code policeman in trouble the older one said you drop what youre doing when you get a code they both ran from the room at the door the older one said well be back sir tomorrow to continue our interesting conversation dont go anywhere will you all right i said and closed the door behind them then i ran into the music room there must be something special about the new trumpet malgosia had bought even if the case was locked i was determined to find out but when i got into the music room and looked in the usual place i realised that i wasnt going to discover anything her new trumpet wasnt there there was just her old one lying on top of the piano rosemary was surprised to see me standing outside her front door at half past eleven at night derek she said in amazement what are you doing here she looked at the suitcase i was carrying i was just on my way to bed she said rosemary my wifes best friend is an editor for a big fiction publisher in london her husband her exhusband by then was a choreographer hed gone off with one of the dancers in a show he was doing leaving rosemary broke and depressed but before hed left her hed taken rosemary to an openingnight party of a musical where malgosia was playing the two women had met got on well immediately and had become best friends it helped that rosemary lived near us of course i quite liked rosemary too but she was malgosias friend rather than mine sometimes when the two of them were talking i felt like an outsider sometimes it was even worse and i might just as well have been the enemy i could understand why rosemary was upset of course her husband had left her and she was badly hurt but it didnt seem terribly fair to me not all men are the same surely i hadnt done anything bad to her i hadnt even done anything very bad to my own wife except bore her im sorry to turn up like this i told her i wouldnt do it under normal circumstances honestly i wouldnt but i need your help if its about malgosia i dont think i can tell you anything she said nervously she hadnt opened the door any wider i mean i dont think i should look rosemary please i said let me in im begging you derek she replied starting to close the door i think youd better go desperation makes you behave in funny ways im not a violent man or anything and normally if someone tells me to go i go straight away aggression isnt part of my make up at least it didnt use to be before all this started but after the afternoon and evening id had i wasnt going to be put off that easily i crashed into the door and when rosemary tried harder to close it on me i forced my foot inside and then we fought to see whether she could shut me out or i could force my way in i won in the end i am stronger than she is and i was more determined the door crashed open and rosemary was thrown against the wall of the passageway where she stood wideeyed and confused i shut the door behind me did you know about this i asked her without any introduction did i know about what she replied she was hardly whispering she must have thought i was about to attack her or something oh come on i had started shouting even though i didnt mean to did you know about tibor what has she told you please derek rosemary said edging away from me please dont shout youll wake the children please derek she was frightened my anger disappeared immediately look rosemary im sorry im really sorry but i am desperate and i do need your help i think malgosias in trouble the police came and asked me questions about her even if you dont want to help me you must help her all right all right come in she said but just for a moment ive got a busy day tomorrow ive got a book to finish the woman who usually looks after the kids is ill i dont know what im going to do she led me into the kitchen do you want a drink she asked a coffee a glass of wine coffee please i said i think ive had enough wine this evening yes she said i can see that you look terrible thanks i said i sat down now that i had got here i felt suddenly very tired whats this all about rosemary said from over by the sink where she was filling the kettle so i told her i told her about the email message about rio de janeiro and tibor i told her about the police and the questions they had been asking me i told her everything i knew she didnt say much she just listened why didnt you ring i asked her suddenly you said you were going to ring yes i did im sorry she said handing me my coffee but i didnt know what to tell you i didnt know what i could tell you its not really my business you see what malgosia does what you do anyway i couldnt betray a friend rosemary i told her you above all people should know what its like when your husband or your wife starts behaving strangely dont you think i have a right to know malgosias my friend she replied simply so what was she doing in scotland do you know that not exactly no rosemary said she was speaking quietly now sympathetically i do know she met someone up there and that it made her very happy im sorry derek she said she must have seen my face but i dont know who it was perhaps it was this tibor and you approved of that i asked of course not its not my style i told malgosia so too but she said she couldnt help it she said it was like an illness an addiction a need she couldnt control but just lately she started talking differently how do you mean i asked feeling suddenly frightened she was really thoughtful about something she wouldnt say what she just said that something was going to happen that she was going to have to do something and that she might have to leave she said that she didnt know if it was the right thing to do or not but she wouldnt give me any details what could i say i thought she was just being silly i told her to make a decision she should either choose you or whoever the other person was then she wouldnt have anything to worry about and she said that might have been possible once but that now things were much more complicated i think well i thought then that she was being asked to do something she didnt really want to something like that youre going to follow her arent you rosemary said a little later because it was obvious yes i replied of course what else can i do but the police will be back and if malgosia really is in trouble theyll keep me here to ask me more questions thats why i came to you they wont look for me here i need to stay the night is that all right ill be gone tomorrow poor old derek rosemary said yes its all right i hope you find her i hope shes all right i didnt sleep much that night on rosemarys sofa and when i did finally manage to sink into unconsciousness it seemed only a few minutes before i woke to find rosemarys two small children looking at me curiously i crawled out of the sleeping bag she had lent me and climbed into my clothes i found rosemary in the kitchen pouring cornflakes into the childrens bowls theres coffee in the pot she said i drank a black coffee no sugar then i told her i would be going in a couple of hours which airport she asked what flight are you taking i dont think im going to tell you i replied looking up from my cup if the police come here id much rather you didnt know anything i left at nine fortyfive rosemary came to the door derek she said standing on the front doorstep her expression much warmer than it had been the night before i hope you find what you want so do i i told her and derek she said i know you think i dont like you but i do really its just that well i thought malgosia was my friend will you forgive me theres nothing to forgive i said dear derek she said softly and kissed me on the cheek before going back into the house and closing the door behind her when i left rosemarys house i went straight to the quartets practice room only rachel had arrived hello dee she said she had been calling me that for some time now why have you got your suitcase with you wheres the viola i cant do it i said i cant do this practice not today or this week i dont know for how long for some time i felt really bad about this i knew i was letting my friends down what what are you saying rachel asked im afraid ive got to go away for a bit i repeated theres something ive got to do what she said a look of anger was beginning to appear on her face what have you got to do i cant explain i replied its personal its personal she exploded what on earth does that mean what about the quartet thats personal well it is to me anyway what are we going to do if you just disappear where are you going anyway brazil brazil whereabouts rio de janeiro i think i said unhappily derek rachel said her voice softening derek whats the matter somethings wrong isnt it somethings terribly wrong i wish i could tell you i said to her and i really did rachel was probably my best friend we had forgotten the problems of our youth now we seemed to work well together and i found her company relaxing it was easy to laugh with her it was easy to be ordinarily happy it was a joy to see her smile carl walked into the practice room hello he said everything ok then he looked from one to the other of us and saw that everything was not all right at all when i told him i was going away for a bit he didnt say anything for a moment then he looked at me and in a quiet voice asked how could you how could you after all this time then he sat down and his head fell into the front of his large black overcoat matt on the other hand was absolutely furious he went red in the face and started shouting how can you do this to us he yelled were all in this together were a team a family were just about to do the most important concerts of our lives and you say youve got to go off to south america because of some personal problem with malgosia i suppose i think youd better decide where your priorities are thats what i think jesus he finished and walked across the room to stare out at a grey february sky look i said matt carl rachel all of you i wouldnt do this if i knew of any other way honestly im really really sorry you will be carl said if you come back and find someone else sitting in your place im sorry i said a chill settling on my heart at the thought of what i was risking i really am you dont know how sorry i am they were all standing there now looking as miserable as i was what could i do i walked out into the street and shouted for a taxi where to mate the driver asked me heathrow i told him heathrow airport chapter six breathtaking views from the rooftop terrace of my hotel high up above the twentyfifth floor the view of rio de janeiro was breathtaking like everybody else i had seen pictures films tv programmes and travel magazines which featured this most famed of south american holiday destinations but nothing had prepared me for the dramatic beauty of the place the sky was bright blue and the sun was hot on my face below me i could see the long curved strip of copacabana beach even from this height it was possible to make out groups of people playing volleyball or lying on the sand and the cars moving up and down the seafront seemed to glow with heat and excitement over to the right a rocky cliff rose up above the beach limiting the extent of the almost white sand while to the left the extraordinary lump of sugar loaf mountain a great big icedlolly of a rock almost seemed to be smiling at me inviting me to visit or perhaps thats just how it seems now looking back i could see a cable car hanging from the wires that snaked towards its summit out here in the bright glare of the sun i still felt miserable but already it was a different kind of misery more immediate more alive like a sharp pain with the promise of relief there was something almost exciting about it on the roof of the rio atlantica hotel there was a large swimming pool poolside chairs and a bar i had come up here last night when i had arrived and now even though i knew i had a lot to do i couldnt resist it and so an hour after breakfast here i was all english and whiteskinned wearing my swimming trunks ready for a swim the water was warm when i dived in and for a few minutes i swam around just enjoying the luxury of it all not much more than twentyfour hours ago i had been sitting in my house with two english policemen asking me awkward questions on the other side of the world now here i was in the bright sunshine and already some of my troubles seemed thousands of miles away this was another world a world without musicians and disappearances a world where malgosia and i malgosia how could i have forgotten her even for a minute even in the warmth of this exciting new place i opened my mouth in surprise and immediately swallowed a litre of water i started to cough and swallowed more water i made my way to the side of the pool coughing and spluttering are you all right said a cheerful singing voice which glittered like the sun on the water yes i coughed im fine and coughed some more here said the new voice heavily accented warm and friendly let me give you a hand i looked up straight into the sun i screwed up my eyes there was a woman standing at the poolside i pulled myself out of the pool still coughing and flicking my wet hair out of my eyes i looked at the person who had been talking to me she was probably a bit younger than me dressed in a bright green bikini her skin tanned a dark brown the thick black hair falling in tight curls over her shoulders she had the biggest smile i had ever seen youd better be careful she laughed that white skin of yours is going to burn bright red in the sun that is if you dont drown first i should have been insulted but she sounded so cheerful that i had to laugh with her ill be careful i said but thanks i am sandra she said welcome to rio this is your first time in rio i answered yes im derek by the way from england ah from england queen elizabeth prince charles the tragic story of princess diana well theres a bit more to it than that i said feeling slightly defensive anyway where are you from me said sandra i am a true carioca whats a carioca i said a carioca is someone from rio de janeiro the most beautiful place in the world dont you think its difficult to tell i said i havent been to all that many places well anyway my new friend continued are you going to buy me a beer isnt it a bit early i answered its never too early sandra replied anyway you look as if you need one we walked over to the bar i was amazed at how quickly the water dried on my skin i ordered two beers so said sandra taking a sip from her bottle are you here on holiday not really i answered not on holiday so what is this business she asked no i replied it isnt business i stopped i didnt quite know how to explain are you being mysterious on purpose said the beautiful girl beside me sounding a little annoyed no im sorry im not i said its just that well its a bit difficult to explain why i am here try me she said and i suddenly realised that i knew absolutely nothing about her it was probably just the foreign sky and the fantastic place i was in that had made me talk to her so freely in the first place look i protested i dont know anything about you anything at all i know that sounds rude but not rude she laughed just rather boring still if you really want to know my brothers the manager of this hotel and so i can come here any time i want and have a swim in safety whats wrong with the sea i asked oh nothing really but rio is not always very comfortable there are some difficult people about anyway she went on now that you know more about me you can answer my question why have you come to rio im looking for someone i said wow she laughed that sounds dramatic who are you looking for my wife it sounded so stupid so humiliating and someone else ah said my friend she has left you yes no i dont know i had started now and i didnt know how to stop and when i had told her just about everything she said nothing for a bit and you really want to find her sandra asked yes of course i said thats why im here whatever the consequences she insisted yes yes of course all right she said standing up as if to go meet me in the lobby downstairs in fifteen minutes and ill take you to see someone he might be able to help you oswaldo morales was a large man with gold rings on his short fingers and an expensive gold watch strapped around his large wrist he had thin black hair combed forward across his sweaty skull and his brightlycoloured shortsleeved shirt was stretched tight across his large stomach he was smoking the biggest smelliest cigar i have ever seen and he sat behind a large wooden desk the kind teachers used to have in their classrooms which was covered with papers ashtrays three dirty coffee cups and a telephone that must have been at least sixty years old there were two filing cabinets on his left with halfopen drawers an old airconditioning machine which was completely ineffective rattled away noisily behind him sandra he cried taking his feet off the desk and getting up awkwardly how are you my love how nice to see you he edged his way around the desk and kissed her on the cheek my he said you are looking beautiful as always and you are looking well the same as usual too sandra said yes i know replied the fat man its terrible but what can i do i dont have any time for exercise and anyway i hate it and the only other possibility is to cut down on the amount i eat and drink and frankly my dear that is too terrible to think of his accent was more difficult to understand than sandras i wondered if they were speaking english just for my benefit anyway he went on i suppose this is the englishman you told me about when you rang he smiled at me yes yes thats me i replied the room was very hot and the smoke made it difficult to breathe maybe it was the jetlag but i was feeling rather ill and you want me to find someone for you i think he said standing close your wife i think is that right mr er armstrong i said derek armstrong can you find her i mean are you any good listen here derek armstrong said the large man sounding more amused than offended i can find anyone if theyre in this city it may take some time and it may take money though im not very good at collecting money as you can see but i always get there in the end by the way mr armstrong what do you do when youre at home im a musician a viola player i replied a musician eh i could have been a musician too why i could be that italian whats his name luciano pavasomething if i had a voice that is and he slapped his stomach and laughed the thing i found out about oswaldo is that when he laughed really laughed everybody else ended up laughing too he was cheerful disorganised dangerous and really good fun to be with over the next few days we became firm friends i think though he was only one more strange person in this strange extraordinary land i was in a land with hidden dangers and many surprises now then he said when we had all stopped laughing it is time we got down to details why do you think your wife is in rio de janeiro perhaps she is somewhere else are you sure that she is in brazil pretty sure i said and i told him about the email on the computer i told him about tibor about the old days when we were music students about the stories from poland i told him the story of my life i told him that my wife had disappeared and that the police had come looking for her when i had finished nobody said anything for a minute sandra lit a cigarette adding to the unbearable fog in the hot room well well oswaldo said finally and if i find your wife and this tibor what then i havent the slightest idea i told him i havent really got that far all right all right but you are here that is all i need to know for the moment youve given me quite a lot to go on do you have a photo of your wife with you that would be most helpful i pulled my wallet from my back pocket and took out two small pictures of malgosia the kind you get in those photo booths at stations and airports will these do she is beautiful your wife oswaldo sighed dreamily this is what ill do he announced suddenly ill start making enquiries at the airport and ill talk to some of my musical contacts maybe this tibor person has been involved in music here if he was a music student all those years ago but with your english police getting all interested in your wifes movements my nose tells me he tapped the end of his nose with his finger that this doesnt have much to do with music at all still we shall see i will contact you in twentyfour hours when i have found out something now go back to your hotel sandra this poor man looks as if he will pass out right here in my office and then we will have to carry him home take him away at the door i looked back at the large private detective he was sitting in his chair again leaning back his hands behind his head staring at the ceiling so what did you think of oswaldo the cuban sandra asked me as we drove fast through the streets cuban i replied i assumed he was from here well he is really all the foreigners who come here if they stay long enough they become cariocas too oswaldo is one of us now and by the way dont be fooled he may look extraordinary but hes good at his job can i ask you a question i said to her as the taxi pulled up outside the hotel of course said my beautiful companion why are you helping me like this i asked her it had been puzzling me all day what you think i am trying to pick you up you think this is a pull no no i didnt mean that i said embarrassed and wishing that i hadnt asked but youve been so nice to me its my day off i was curious thats all i like what do you say being nosy i enjoy talking to englishspeaking people anyway she laughed what makes you think youre such a good prospect anyway one jetlagged british man a little sunburnt already whos miserable because he cant find his wife now tell me whats so special about that we were inside the hotel lobby now where the airconditioning worked fine look said sandra i can tell youre tired why dont you go up to your room have a shower go to bed and sleep for a couple of hours then what do you say we can go and have dinner what do you think of that i think thats wonderful i said sleepily and waving goodbye i walked over to the lift and made my way to my room i woke up refreshed looking out of the window i saw copacabana in the evening light and for a moment i felt happy but only for a moment the telephone rang in my room and i answered it it was sandra waiting for me down in the lobby when i stepped out of the lift she was there with another man about my own age this is paul she said a friend i thought youd like to have a friend a colleague hello said paul in a recognisably british accent which surprised me because from his brown skin and cheerful clothes i would have assumed that he was from rio pauls one of the ones i told you about sandra laughed an adopted carioca hes been here too long hell probably never go back what do you do here i asked him as he walked towards the entrance teach english he said i came out here on a oneyear contract and ive sort of stayed you must like it here i told him yes and no i mean of course i do its the most exciting place ive ever lived but it drives me crazy too come on sandra said to the two of us and we got into a taxi twenty minutes later we were in a cable car swaying upwards towards the summit of pao de azucar sugar loaf mountain looking down made me feel distinctly nervous is this thing safe i asked of course it is dont be such a baby sandra laughed at me just think of the view you are going to have she was right from the restaurant at the top of the mountain we could see out over to santos dumont airport with planes taking off towards us every few minutes for a moment it was worrying but each time the planes turned to the left before they got to sugar loaf mountain and disappeared into the night the ponte aerea air bridge paul said backwards and forwards to sao paulo planes leave every fifteen minutes i enjoyed that meal the view was fantastic and the company was excellent sandra was beautiful and funny and paul was good company kind and agreeable i came here because my wife left me he told me at one stage so i suppose we have something in common but at least she didnt just disappear i knew where shed gone to was it bad i mean difficult for you i asked him at the time it was terrible yes but i got over it in the end time you know and brazil one of the greatest countries on earth and people like sandra here are you two i asked i had been puzzled by their relationship oh no once perhaps eh sandra were just good friends sandra said definitely paul was about to say something but then there was a ringing sound sandra reached into her handbag pulled out a mobile phone and answered it dont you just hate those things paul said unless theyre yours of course he grinned showing me the phone strapped to his belt youve got to have one of these here i mean apart from the classes i give at the institute i do private classes so i have to keep in touch with my students sandra talked briefly into the phone in portuguese then she listened for a couple of minutes before pressing a little red button to switch her mobile off that was oswaldo she said looking at me he thinks hes found your tibor he wants to know what you want to do now chapter seven voices in the distance tell me again where were going i said to oswaldo as we drove along by the sea angra dos reis oswaldo replied swerving to avoid two motorcyclists who suddenly appeared on our right playground of the rich well some of it is anyway its on an inland sea people say its beautiful they have holiday homes out there you dont sound as if you like it very much i said trying not to watch the road in front of us since my companion didnt seem particularly interested in it i felt i shouldnt be either oh its all right i suppose he laughed but me i prefer cities lots of people cars noise bars all that kind of thing i need to be surrounded by people a lot of people and to feel them hear them living their noisy complicated lives all around me thats why i do this job i suppose it gives me an excuse to poke my nose into other peoples business find out what theyre doing and why find out who they are god i love the life i lead he dug me in the side with his elbow and for one scary moment he only had one hand lightly on the steering wheel for what seemed like hours he was looking at me not the road he rolled down the window and threw out the stub of his cigar we travelled on in silence and i wondered what we would find at the end of our journey were in luck oswaldo had said when i talked to him from my room after sandra and paul had dropped me back at the hotel i think ive found this tibor guy so if youre right we can probably find your wife too what do you mean i asked where is he how did you find him hey wait a minute oswaldos large voice bellowed down the phone line not so fast ok just calm down ok ok but just explain sure well i went off to the airport like i told you i was going to i took those photos of your wife the ones you gave me in my office and i started by checking all the direct flights from london two days before you arrived you were right by the way right i replied wishing hed get on with his story what about she used her maiden name to travel she didnt buy a ticket as malgosia armstrong but as malgosia kowalewska she came in on a british airways flight and luckily one of the airport policemen who was keeping an eye on the baggage hall is a friend of mine weve done each other some favours in the past and well this man reinaldo he noticed your wife the red hair he said was beautiful he couldnt take his eyes off her she reminded him of an actress he was especially keen on when the doors opened he saw her go through to the crowd of people there and out there youre not going to like this bit go on i said through clenched teeth go on oswaldo please all right she went up to a man waiting there and my friend says she flung her arms round him he remembered that particularly because he thought how lucky the guy was but it didnt surprise him because this guy was always lucky a man with powerful friends someone the police knew a lot about but someone theyd never managed to pin anything on even though he was a real bad guy so who was he i asked knowing the answer perfectly well but hoping against hope that it wasnt him i could see my wife throwing herself into his arms i wished the picture of the meeting oswaldo had just described wasnt so clear in my mind he was tibor arkadi as you suspected so then i think to myself find out where this tibor is and weve found mrs armstrong and the best bit is i didnt even have to go looking for information about where he lives because everyone in the police force knows where he is reinaldo told me so now i know where we will probably find your wife where where is he about two hours drive from rio im going to go out there tomorrow morning ill be back in the afternoon with some definite news im coming with you i told him immediately without thinking about it thats not a good idea oswaldo said sounding suddenly serious my friend told me about this tibor you see hes a very dangerous man very dangerous people who come into contact with him have died reinaldo says and i believe him now listen im used to that kind of thing its my job but you im coming i repeated if you ever want me to pay you im coming it was the only thing i could think of to persuade him you can only come oswaldo sighed down the end of the phone line if you promise to do exactly what i tell you to do and now here we were speeding along the road to find my beautiful wife in the arms of tibor the exconductor who according to the stories reinaldo had told the cuban detective had added danger smuggling and murder to the list of his charms and i didnt know if i was more scared of oswaldos driving or of what we were going to see there oswaldo said pointing through the trees at the house below us thats the one thats tibors place it was a large bungalow sticking out of the steep hillside which went down to the water the inland sea at the bottom of the slope i could see steps leading down to a jetty where two powerfullooking speedboats were tied up on three sides of the house there was a large wooden terrace looking out over the sea i could see other houses on the curving hillside to the right and the left the inland sea stretched away into the distance between high hills it was a scene of great beauty it was quiet too occasionally a snatch of conversation from one of the houses came to us on the light wind or the sound of a car in the distance otherwise it was very peaceful at least we thought it was but then behind us we heard the sound of a plane getting nearer and nearer i looked behind me and there it was a small seaplane painted dark blue with golden rays on its wings flashing over our heads so low you could almost touch it look oswaldo said its going to land we watched as it came down cutting a great white scar in the water before turning round and heading back towards the wooden jetty below tibors house when it got near its destination the engine was switched off and the plane drifted in towards us two men got out and walked towards the house below us three other men walked out from the house on to the terrace and looked over the rails two of them wore white suits and face masks like something from a science fiction film they were carrying cases and a strangelooking machine then the third man the one in normal clothes turned round and i caught sight of his face for the first time in more than ten years thats him i cried shocked despite the fact that i was seeing what i had expected to see thats tibor even after all this time i recognise him he looks the same a bit fatter quiet oswaldo hissed you want them to hear us to see us one of the men with tibor looked up at that point and for a moment i thought we had been discovered but then he turned back to say hello to the two men who had arrived on the plane they all started to talk urgently then tibor and one of the new arrivals went back into the house while the whitesuited men walked towards the plane oswaldo and i crawled down the hill keeping out of sight until we were much nearer the house we could hear a conversation some shouting and then suddenly i heard a voice i was sure i recognised a female voice malgosias voice that was enough for me i got up from behind the tree we were using to hide and started running down the hill before i knew what was happening id been hit by something like an express train from behind and i fell to the ground with a surprisingly fast oswaldo on top of me his big plump hand covering my mouth to stop me from crying out you crazy englishman he hissed what the hells the matter with you he took his hand away from my mouth i heard malgosias voice i managed to say im sure of it yes he replied in a whisper maybe you did but youre not going to solve any problems by just going in there and asking to see her are you oswaldos nose says that would land us both in a lot of trouble a great deal of trouble it will be much better if we just wait and watch watch and wait then we can decide what to do so you stop behaving like a lovesick frog and do what i tell you that was the agreement wasnt it yes i gasped wishing hed remove his great weight from my legs yes but no buts he hissed urgently look still lying on the ground i looked at the terrace tibor had come back out of the house with another whitesuited man who was carrying something heavy something large something with long red hair and then i saw malgosias head fall back as they started down the steps that led to the jetty i am not cut out for heroism or dramatic gestures im a viola player i love music i love compromise im even a bit boring thats why i probably behave a bit stupidly in dramatic situations whether at rosemarys front door or on a brazilian hillside this time there was no stopping me malgosia i cried malgosia and ran down the hillside theyd heard me now tibor turned round and looked to see where the noise was coming from the other man stopped two more men ran out on to the terrace and looked up they pulled out guns malgosia i cried again and i saw her raise her beautiful head and i thought i heard her say derek derek please help me but then there was a great bang and something hit me hard on the side of my head i felt my legs go weak and the day went all dark on me i heard running feet and more shouting but now the noises seemed to be getting further and further away and then suddenly there was complete silence strange noises voices in the distance footsteps going up and down somewhere near echoing on a stone floor there were unfamiliar smells too i seemed to be floating in a great black sea cut off from some other world just the other side of the ocean derek i heard a voice say thousands of miles away derek can you hear me hes still unconscious somebody else said hadnt i heard that voice somewhere before i tried to open my eyes but my eyelids were like anchors stuck in the mud of some deep river look i saw his eyelid move a third voice said just wishful thinking said the first voice then the voices faded and i was back in my silent black world mr armstrong mr armstrong this time the voice was nearer this time i was determined to open my eyes i managed to raise the corner of one eyelid with what seemed like a great effort i was blinded by bright white light and shut it again there was someone by the side of my bed my bed i was in a bed what on earth was going on i forced my eye open again and managed to keep it open for a second longer i was in some kind of a room with lightgreen painted walls i could see someone in a white coat standing next to me a white coat oh no there was a picture starting up inside my head a picture of two spacemen carrying something carrying something like a sack of potatoes something with beautiful red hair malgosia i managed to whisper malgosia what was that what did you say said the person beside me in a foreign accent what did you say but i had already made too much effort the comfortable dark was asking for me again the light faded the voice disappeared the next time i opened my eyes sandra was standing there i blinked in surprise derek she said her eyes widening in surprise derek youre conscious derek what are you doing here i managed to say where am i anyway hospital of course where else oh its so good to see you conscious wait ill go and tell the others back in a minute nurse i heard her call as she left the room i looked around me it was a hospital all right there was a television on one wall a large window with a view of the hills behind rio and lightgreen walls with nothing on them at all i looked down at the bed there were tubes coming out of my arm i moved my head ouch it hurt i put my hand up to the pain but there was a large bandage around my forehead derek a friendly voice said as oswaldo came into the room are you all right please say you are all right im all right i think my head hurts oswaldo i replied it was difficult to talk you remember my name at least he laughed sandra had come into the room with paul and a nurse who was soon busy taking my pulse they were all looking down at me and smiling you all right old chap paul said yes yes i am i replied and i managed to sit up a bit more can somebody please tell me what im doing here so they did they told me how id run down the hill when id seen malgosia being carried to the plane they told me how id shouted her name and how tibors men had looked round and how one of them had shot at me you are a lucky englishman oswaldo laughed you certainly are i mean the bullet hit you right here he said pointing his finger at the side of his head and you should be dead really but the bullet did not go in he used his finger again it went across the side of your head made a nasty mess you were out cold but it never touched that little brain of yours too small i think and he laughed how did i get here i asked them to try and give myself time to think youve got oswaldo to thank for that paul said he just picked you up and ran he got you away and brought you here that was four days ago yes and youre too damned heavy oswaldo said so dont ever be that crazy again ok ok i said weakly i was beginning to feel bad again and i wanted to go to sleep but there was something else i had to ask what about malgosia i said but nobody answered me come on i said i was desperate to find out before i fell asleep again derek this isnt easy sandra said i know youve come all this way to find your wife you nearly got yourself killed too but well this is going to be difficult for you so i dont really know how to tell you tell me what i said i was beginning to feel really awful again she means that your malgosia isnt here anymore thats what oswaldo said bluntly shes gone gone i repeated gone where shes very ill i heard the detective went on very ill what do you mean shes very ill will somebody explain whats going on i asked desperately please listen old chap paul said oswaldos been making enquiries it seems they took your wife up to recife three days ago thats in the north east of brazil then they put her on a plane to europe europe i said confused now and terribly worried where in europe poland sandra said warsaw oswaldo thinks shes gone to warsaw chapter eight theres nothing for you here warsaw on a cold rainy afternoon the exact opposite of rio de janeiro in brazil everything had been bright blue in warsaw that day as i arrived from the airport everything was grey the concrete apartment blocks dull against the wet afternoon the tower of the palace of culture that old communist monument disappearing into the damp clouds yet i loved poland i had always been happy here malgosias family had made me welcome the first time i had come even anja the one who had betrayed her sister had been polite though between her and malgosia there was an icy formality when malgosia and i had been to visit her family they had shown me the old parts of the city theyd taken me to krakow and gdansk driving over the long roads of this proud country with its unbeaten spirit keeping its identity despite the efforts of one foreign power after another over the long course of history to squash its character it made me realise where malgosia got her brighteyed intelligence and her deep dark passion everyone i met had always been friendly and i had felt at home not this time though now i was in a taxi unhappy and confused my head still bandaged my mind trying to come to terms with all that had happened to me over the last week my body tired and hurting that terrible plane smell in my hair and on my clothes and i was desperately worried too worried about what my new brazilian friends had told me worried about what i would find in warsaw the taxi stopped outside malgosias parents apartment block i paid the driver in the zlotys i had changed at the airport and rang the bell a voice came through the intercom a voice so like malgosias that just for a moment i was fooled malgosia i said hopefully its derek derek said the voice that i suddenly knew wasnt malgosia at all derek why have you come wheres malgosia i shouted into the machine let me in anja please all right said the tinny voice at my ear i suppose youll have to come up the buzzer sounded and i pushed open the door i took the lift up to the fourth floor when i stepped out into the corridor i saw that the door to the flat was open i walked inside anja was standing there waiting for me her arms folded her hair was cut short she wore heavy black glasses she watched me as i struggled in with my suitcase she didnt look welcoming at all what on earth are you doing here was the first thing she said and then almost without taking breath my god whats happened to you you look absolutely terrible i feel terrible all right i replied angrily my wifes run off with someone else ive been questioned by the police ive travelled halfway round the world ive been shot at and nearly killed now my wifes supposed to be very ill and i dont know why or where she is but i know its pretty damn serious so of course i look terrible ive just about had as much as i can take all right poor old derek she said nastily am i supposed to feel sorry for you i dont care whether youre sorry for me or not i told her i just want to know where my wife is oh all right she said youd better come in would you like a vodka or something i think youre going to need it she led me into the kitchen took a bottle from the freezer and poured a small measure into a glass go on she said itll do you good well it certainly cant make me feel worse than i do already i took the glass from her and emptied it in one swallow she filled my glass again arent you going to have any i asked her she wasnt hostile any more she looked lost like a child i dont think so she whispered ive had quite a lot already it suddenly occurred to me that the apartment was very empty when id been there before there were always people around malgosias parents her grandmother and grandfather her brothers where is everybody i said at the hospital she answered in a flat toneless voice at the hospital theyre all at the damned hospital she had started to cry anja i said with increasing terror anja for gods sake tell me whats going on my sisters dying thats what going on maybe shes already dead and im not there why not i shouted at her why not because i dont dare because i cant bear it because she was my best friend before tibor but that was years ago i told her you must have got over that by now oh you fool she replied her eyes suddenly bright flames almost unable to get her words out tibor and i when he was in europe every time he came here for years and then she took him away from me she took him back and now shes dying and i cant bring myself to go and see her god i hate this life she reached for another glass and filled it with the icecold vodka she drank it quickly and had another and another if you want to go and join the party she sneered her cruel look back again youd better go to the central hospital but hurry now you dont want to miss the show they all looked up when i went in malgosias mother smiled a brief little smile and then turned back again to look through a window at a pale figure lying on a bed behind the glass it was malgosia her waxen features white against the flaming red of her hair malgosia i whispered stupidly she wouldnt have been able to hear me anyway malgosia whats the matter nothing is the matter anymore her father said turning towards me his eyes were full of tears youre too late derek where have you been it took a bit of time for his words to sink in it took me time to realise that malgosia couldnt hear me in there it took me time to realise that after all my journeying i had finally found her and it wouldnt do me any good at all i dont know how long i stood there in that room with her family i was too tired to feel anything too shocked to understand what had happened too alone to feel any warmth from the people around me it was as if a hand of ice had gripped me and was slowly freezing all the life out of my body i might have gone on standing there forever but malgosias mother came up to me come on derek she said taking me by the arm theres nothing we can do here wed better leave her now come back with us theres a lot we need to talk about though none of it really matters anymore we walked out of the hospital we got into the family car and drove back through the streets of warsaw in silence when we got back to the apartment anja was nowhere to be seen nobody mentioned her absence the vodka bottle on the kitchen table was empty somebody made some coffee we all went into the lounge we sat down in a black silence that seemed to suck the air out of the room i felt as if i couldnt breathe instead of the questions i wanted to ask there was a blank space in my brain where nothing moved nothing was happening malgosias father managed to ask his questions though what kind of a husband do you call yourself was his first effort what kind of a husband that lets this happen jacek please her mother stopped him and then said something quickly in polish but it didnt seem to calm the unhappy man i asked him a question he insisted in english again so the least he can do is give me a reply i looked up at his face all twisted with grief im sorry was the only thing i could think of to say im sorry but i dont understand i dont understand anything you dont know why she was in brazil you dont know how she managed to get poisoned her father asked angrily his words like gun shots in the tense silence he had come to stand over me and i could smell the cigarette smoke on his breath poisoned i repeated i hadnt the slightest idea what he was talking about you didnt know you didnt know about this malgosias mother said please i said to her to all of them in that room i dont think i can take any more of this i dont know anything about poison the last time i saw malgosia in london i mean there was nothing wrong with her at all except that she was about to leave me and i didnt realise it and now well my god i just you see i was having difficulty getting my words out look i told them since things had gone way too far for me to worry about my pride any more malgosia left me all right she left me to go and join tibor remember him that bastard her father said hasnt he done enough damage in this family the outside door opened and slammed shut anja came into the room the perfect time i heard her mother mutter under her breath what said malgosias sister obviously drunk have i missed something why arent you all at the hospital with my sister who i love she screamed and started to cry her grandmother went to her then and started to talk to her in a low quiet voice when she told her that her sister was dead anja started up a low terrible moaning which seemed to go on and on i wished she would just stop even when her father made me go with him into the kitchen we could still hear it the inhuman noise of someone who was going to feel guilty for ever but i had other things to worry about because what malgosias father told me was that my wife had died in the end bleeding unstoppably completely unable to breathe both typical symptoms of someone who had been poisoned by some form of nerve gas some kind of chemical agent nerve gas i repeated stupidly yes though they still have to do more tests they havent been able to identify what type it was yet all the doctor will say is that he thinks she must have been exposed to some deadly chemical a few days ago thats his guess anyway a few days ago i said still without understanding brazil and you know nothing about this her father asked looking at me suspiciously with eyes red from weeping no no honestly look im just trying to absorb what youre telling me im trying to come to terms with whats happened and to tell you the truth im not doing very well im not doing very well at all i desperately wanted to go on talking drinking coffee vodka anything to deaden the pain i was feeling but suddenly i could do nothing i felt my legs go from under me and yet again blackness washed over me like a wave and i passed out the funeral was as bad as a funeral could be grey rain coming at us almost horizontally from a grey cold sky the voice of the priest at the graveside taken away from us by a bitter wind the tears of the mourners invisible in the wet cold i had recovered some of my physical health but the colour of my mind was the colour of the sky and i watched the ceremony with an uninvolved kind of despair when it was over we all went back to a hotel near the family flat and drank tea and vodka some of malgosias friends from school had come and they tried to talk to me to sympathise but only two of them could speak english and i wasnt really listening anyway i had run out of things to say to my inlaws my exinlaws i suppose and they didnt seem to know what to say to me anja walked up to me dressed in black a black hat covering her face black glasses hiding her bruised eyes almost black themselves from so much weeping she was swaying slightly a cigarette in one hand a glass in the other and now what she said in a slurred voice what are you going to do now brotherinlaw the one nobody ever fought over anja i managed to reply im sorry for everything that has happened im sorry you are so hurt and god knows im feeling sorry for myself so the last thing i need is for you to come up to me now and be so damned horrible just leave me alone please theres nothing for you here anymore she said drunkenly like a spoiled child go home derek go home and in the end it seemed like good advice though without malgosia i didnt really have a home anymore still i didnt belong here not now the next day i caught a flight back to london it was a bumpy journey with turbulence almost all the way most of the time i half slept as the plane bounced through the skies seeing horrible images in my half dreams images of hospitals and speedboats beaches and bodies malgosia and tibor in a terrible musical dance of death across the glassy surface of the water and then just before we landed i seemed to be with my quartet again rachel smiling at me on my right carl and matt on my left and when i woke up as the plane turned into its final approach to heathrow i was actually smiling but not for long the truth came home to me almost immediately as the british airways boeing went through its final descent and i sank back into the despair i had fallen into the moment i saw malgosias body lying behind the glass in that hospital room i didnt think then that anything least of all music would ever pull me out of that when the plane landed it taxied away towards the terminal building but then unexpectedly it came to a stop the captains voice came over the loudspeakers this is your captain again ladies and gentlemen im sorry weve stopped but weve got some visitors who want to come aboard im sure it wont take very long and then well make our way over to our landing gate as soon as possible at the front of the plane the flight attendants were opening the door i looked out of the window and saw steps being driven up to the plane followed by a police car its blue light flashing in the darkness two men ran up the steps and when they entered the plane i knew at once who they were they made straight for my seat mr armstrong said the older of the two policemen who had visited me two weeks ago in london i am glad to see you to see that youve returned perhaps youd like to come with me and this time his shorthaired companion said we dont want you running off again do we so youd better put these on before i knew it he had fitted handcuffs around my wrists and i was led down the aisle of the plane in front of all those people down the steps into the police car and away towards whatever fate had in store for me chapter nine a walk by the river were sorry to hear about your wife the nice policeman in the front said as the police car crawled onto the m motorway for the journey into london it must have been a shock or perhaps it wasnt such a surprise said the one with short hair who was sitting next to me in the back perhaps you were expecting it if you play with dangerous substances someone always gets hurt in the end look i said feeling totally exhausted with my wrists handcuffed a dressing still stuck to the side of my head since we last met ive had a really terrible time ok i dont know anything about how my wife got to be like she was what dead you mean the man sitting next to me said nastily sergeant please said the man in the front that was not very nice sorry guy he said sounding remarkably unsorry yes i said evenly i didnt even have enough energy to protest against this unfeeling cruelty i have no idea how she ended up dead i know that she was poisoned with some chemical agent but i dont know what or how it was nothing to do with me my god i said to them my voice rising slightly as i realised that i had nothing left to lose dont you think i would have stopped it happening if i could have done if id known anything about it well as to that mr armstrong my companion sneered how can we be sure i mean you sound convincing but then you would wouldnt you whether you knew about this or not how do we know youre telling us the truth you know what i said realising suddenly that i meant it i couldnt care less if you believe me or not theres nothing you can do to me thats worse than whats happened over the last two weeks so if you want to imprison me question me beat me up make up evidence against me any of the things ive heard that policemen do well go on go ahead i am in your hands and theres absolutely nothing i can do about it they stopped talking after that and i suppose i must have slept because the next thing i knew we had stopped at the back of a police station in central london wake up mr armstrong said the nicer of the two wake up i opened my eyes they felt as if they were attached to lead weights i wanted to go back to sleep come on derek my shorthaired tormentor said surprising me with his use of my first name time to get out and answer a few questions dont you think i climbed out of the car and they led me through a back door down a long corridor into a room where an older policeman sat behind a desk with a large book turn out your pockets please sir he said what i asked sleepily what for oh come on said my companion you must have seen films about the police surely were bringing you in for questioning arent we so this is the bit where we take all your possessions anything you might have on your person which you could use to harm yourself and the custody sergeant here he writes it all in his big book that way you cant come back and say we stole your wallet or anything like that got it i got it they took my wallet my passport my watch the belt from my trousers my credit card an old comb a packet of peanuts id pocketed from the plane a photograph of malgosia a little notebook i carried around with me with notes of things i had to do my electronic organiser and a cassette tape of mozarts symphonia concertante for violin and viola played by two friends of mine which id forgotten i had with me when i left england then they took me to a cell pushed me in and shut the door it smelt pretty bad in there but i was pleased the room was empty i sat on the hard concrete bench facing the door and wondered how long i was going to stay i wondered if they could tell me why my wife had died i wondered who i could call to get me out of the situation i was in and then i wondered why i should care once or twice over the next four hours the little metal window in the door would open and id see a policeman looking in at me one of them even asked you all right mate can i get you a cup of tea from the machine and i was so amazed at this gesture of normality that i agreed when it came the liquid was hot and sweet and after the dryness of the aeroplane cabin and the dryness of my soul it was curiously refreshing finally just as i was drifting off to sleep again the door opened and my nice policeman came in how are you mr armstrong he said i see theyve been looking after you i smiled weakly at him the situation was so absurd and his words were so inappropriate for the mess i was in that i couldnt help it well said the policeman im glad to see that youre in a better mood itll make my job much easier would you like to come with me i walked out of the cell the shorthaired policeman was standing in the corridor the two of them walked me past the custody sergeants desk up a flight of stairs and into an airless little room with a table five chairs a fluorescent light above us and a tape recorder we sat down me on one side of the table the two policemen on the other the shorthaired policeman switched on the tape recorder and said who we were and what the time was then he looked at me you are allowed to make one phone call you know he said do you want to make a phone call i was going to say no but then i suddenly thought of someone i would like to come and help me yes please i said so we all got up again marched out of the room and into the corridor to where a payphone was fastened to the wall i stopped well said the nicer of the two go on make your call thats a bit of a problem i told him i had to give that sergeant all my money didnt i can you lend me p they both complained a bit at that but eventually the younger policeman put his hand into his pocket and gave me the coin i dialled a number and for what seemed like an age nobody answered but they did in the end and in the background i could hear a recording of a beethoven quartet hello said the voice hello can i help you rachel i said the relief in my voice making me sound almost happy rachel im back in london and i need your help rachel sent her mother i had forgotten that her parents were both lawyers i had met rachels mother once or twice before when she had come to listen to the quartet i remembered her as being warm and pleasant an older version of her daughter but somehow stronger and more sure of herself she had always been very nice to me in the cell with the police she wasnt particularly warm or pleasant at all but she was strong and assertive my nice and nasty questioners found her almost impossible to handle every time they asked me a question that she didnt like she would forbid me to answer or she would lecture the two policemen on the rules for police interrogations rules which she knew in a great deal more detail than them and she did it with such a severe face such a hard determination that my two tormentors who had no doubt come across many lawyers before but who had obviously not met anyone like rachels mother were finally reduced to almost complete silence and by the time we had finished had ended up telling us far more than they had intended the interview started when the nice policeman asked me what i knew about seratraxel seratraxel i repeated whats that a chemical agent the shorthaired one said a kind of nerve gas i suppose youd call it odourless no smell takes about four or five days thats enough the older policeman said well mr armstrong i dont know anything about sera whateveritis i replied come on the shorthaired one continued you dont expect us to believe that do you my client has said that he doesnt know what it is rachels mother said so you will have to take his word for it you are not allowed to go on asking a witness the same question again and again that was the way she talked they tried a few more times though asking all sorts of clever questions each time rachels mother stepped in to protect me though since i knew very little anyway they would never have got much out of me next they started asking me about scotland had i ever been to dundonnell dundonnell i answered ive never heard of it well it appears that your wife knew where it was the older man said she might have but i dont where is it i asked them right up in the north of scotland on the shores of little loch broom just south of ullapool the nicer policeman said its a lovely place a lonely place i expect your wife told you about it about the hotel there the one she stayed at more than once the only one there is in dundonnell she probably told you about the research station just up the mountain there she did tell you all about that didnt she no no ive never heard any of this before i told him truthfully but the pieces were suddenly all beginning to fit look derek the shorthaired policeman said nastily all this i dont know doesnt impress me you know i wasnt born yesterday i suggest that you knew your wife went up to dundonnell to meet a man called tibor arkadi a man we cant get at because hes in brazil where youve just been i suggest that you knew that around the time your wife and her companion were up there the last time some seratraxel was stolen from the government chemical weapons research station and whats more that you know where that chemical agent is now because weve searched your house from top to bottom you see but we cant find it and let me warn you derek armstrong if you dont tell us where it is pretty damn soon were going to shut you away for a very very long time so whats it going to be the truth or the rest of your life in jail chemical agents rachels mother said unexpectedly at a government research station i thought this country had signed a convention to ban chemical weapons research fool the older policeman snapped at his colleague you talk a little bit too much its not what you think he said to us just some research the armed forces are doing to find out what our enemies are up to thats all if you say anything about it noone will believe you anyway wed lock you up straight away so you wont want to talk about it will you they asked me more questions and i told them what i knew when rachels mother would let me but it wasnt much and in return they told me that they had been sent reports of a man answering tibor arkadis description meeting a worker from the secret research station the worker died in a car accident the older policeman said but we think he took the seratraxel and gave it to mr arkadi a most convenient accident the shorthaired one said but by then id heard enough and once rachels mother had stopped the policemen asking any more questions we left the police station where to now she asked but i hadnt the slightest idea what to do next i didnt have any idea about anything really so when she said that rachel had offered to put me up at her house if i didnt want to go back to my own place i agreed with the suggestion because i couldnt think of any reason not to come on rachel said to me its a beautiful day i think you need some fresh air i looked at her she was worried about me i could tell i suppose that wasnt very surprising really i had been staying in her house for over two weeks and in that time i admit it i was terrible company i slept a lot i went for walks by the river and made rachel very nervous she told me later because she was afraid that i would throw myself off a bridge or something i hardly said a word and in all that time rachel my friend my companion never complained my bandage was off and i had stopped taking the tranquillisers her doctor had given to me rachel had been to my house to get my viola and bring me my post which i hadnt been interested enough to look at yet and a couple of changes of clothes now she had decided that i needed organising so shed rung matt and carl asked them round and with her sister whos an excellent pianist we had just played through the quintet by elgar and while we were playing i had only thought of malgosia and policemen and men with guns firing up at me about three or four times instead of every minute as i had been doing recently thats the thing about music of course it demands all your attention all your concentration once we were in the middle of the first movement i had my first moment of real peace since malgosia had left if peace is surrendering yourself to the demands of musicmaking as i was doing admittedly i wasnt playing my best but i got through it and though matt and carl looked vaguely disapproving rachel smiled over at me after each movement a smile of real encouragement real hope we stood up leaving our instruments on the chairs matt invited rachels sister for an early evening drink and carl said he had to phone his parents rachel took me by the arm and walked to the door outside it was warmer than i had expected the sky was a bright autumn blue and there wasnt a cloud in the sky we turned right and walked down to the path that runs alongside the river thames other people were out too an elderly couple walking their dog a sweaty jogger pounding past us with the ticka ticka ticka of her walkman echoing tunelessly as she brushed my shoulder on her energetic journey look said rachel as we were passing a pub that seemed vaguely familiar remember that place she was smiling broadly the evening light glittering in her pretty eyes i remembered the place all right from that night back when we were both students and for a second even after all these years i felt embarrassed disaster inn she said and laughed and there was something so innocent about it that i laughed back at her i felt incredibly grateful that she could joke about it now it was a subject we had not mentioned for a long time dee she cried you laughed you actually laughed i cant believe it that must be the first time for days yes well there hasnt been much to laugh about i said but look im sorry really sorry ive been so terrible youve been so kind i dont know how ill ever be able to thank you poor dee she said holding my arm tighter what are we going to do with you i dont know i replied watching two boats with eight rowers each racing under putney bridge the cries of the coxes in the back of each boat ringing across the water like ghosts its just that i cant stop it you see i cant get that picture out of my head the man in his white protection suit carrying malgosia to that plane and the hospital and that bastard tibor and derek rachel said using my full name for once turning me round and making me face her derek i know you must be hurting we all know that and im not trying to say its not important or anything please believe me but now its time to stop it its over the past has passed its the future we should be thinking of its the future that matters to you to me and before i could stop her she had kissed me and suddenly as if i had always known this i felt an overpowering sense of love for her and a great tide of relief washing over me i dont know how you sense these things but then and there as the evening light cast its gentle shadows over the rivers edge i knew with absolute certainty that i could trust this woman that i had always been able to trust this woman with my life rachel i whispered help me you silly fool she said tears in her pretty eyes of course ill help you ive always helped you help you do what i told her and she started to protest but she must have seen my determination so in the end she stopped talking and we held each other as the tide came in and the water rippled over the mud then we turned and walked back to the house i kept looking at her as if she was someone i had never met before someone i had never really seen before for the first time since the day when i had come home to find my wife gone i felt as if something positive might happen but there was danger too back in rio where i had suddenly realised that i had to return chapter ten sugar loaf mountain for a moment i thought i wasnt going to be able to make it the sweat was pouring down my face and my fingers were slipping all over the place the others werent much better either rachels left hand was sliding on strings that were threatening to go out of tune because of the heat i saw her frown as she played fighting the heat but then suddenly we were there the fast presto at the very end of schuberts death and the maiden quartet and however hot and bothered i felt i just had to keep playing to keep up with the others faster and faster as the movement rushed towards its climax and amazingly we played the final chord with a burst of energy that none of us were really feeling in the front row of the audience i saw paul dig oswaldo in the side to wake him up the cuban detectives head went back and his eyes opened wide with fright until realising where he was he started clapping along with everyone else bravo the beautiful sandra cried wildly enthusiastic and her call was taken up by the rest of the brazilian audience so that we received almost a standing ovation from the five hundred people in the hall all right all right carl whispered across to me as we stood to take our bows i admit it you were right he was talking about the long discussions we had had with me trying to persuade him to come to brazil for a concert tour and him saying it wasnt worth it noone would appreciate us there but i went on it would be a wonderful opportunity i told him we could really make a name for ourselves in latin america it would be a good way of starting again i knew i had nearly destroyed the quartet i told him and this was my way of trying to make it up to all of them in the end i persuaded him and matt even rachel agreed but it was more difficult for her because she knew that my motives werent just musical and she knew that what i was thinking of could be very dangerous i think we were both nervous actually having just discovered each other properly for the first time the last thing either of us needed was to lose the other rachels love was bringing me back to life i could feel the pieces of myself putting themselves back together like a multidimensional puzzle all the bits falling into place all the failures and sadnesses falling away from me i noticed that now when the sun shone i heard the music of the birds and the lap of water my past with malgosia and the terrible thing that had happened to her was shared knowledge between us something rachel and i could talk about openly she knew that the one thing i could not yet do was lose the hatred i felt for tibor my rival of course we had both discussed the possibility that my anger was really directed at malgosia or myself for all those years when i had tried to love someone who never felt the same about me it is certainly true that when i looked back at my marriage i felt this cold sense of failure but there was something else that was far stronger a conviction that people like tibor should not be allowed to play with other peoples lives when the decision to come to brazil had been taken our agent started working right away contacting the brazilian embassy the british council anyone she could think of and pretty soon we had a tour planned taking us from recife to porto alegre from sao paulo to salvador and of course at the end of a very successful series of concerts here we were in rio for our last performance paul had helped with the organisation and tonights concert was the result of all his efforts we had a party after the show people came up to us and congratulated us paul was really pleased with the result of his efforts and sandra who had loved the music was obviously fascinated by carl matt seemed to be having a good time too surrounded by a group of admiring men and women as for me i found myself standing on my own for a moment while rachel went to get us another drink hes agreed oswaldo said quietly coming up to me pushing out clouds of smoke from his enormous cigar hell meet you not for the first time i suddenly felt almost uncontrollable fear i wished i hadnt started this for the thousandth time i wished i had never heard of tibor arkadi hell be on sugar loaf mountain tomorrow at two oclock oswaldo went on making sure that noone else could hear us hell meet you in the restaurant he says he wont talk to you unless you come on your own how do i know that he wont have a whole army of his friends with him i asked you dont but youre the one asking for this meeting remember not him so you have to do what he says great i replied suddenly all my plans everything i was going to say sounded stupid rachel returned with two glasses she looked from oswaldo to me and then back again tibors going to meet him she asked the detective oswaldo glanced at me and i nodded yes he told her tomorrow oh god rachel said suddenly gripping my arm please be careful ive only just found you i couldnt bear to lose you so soon when i got out of the cable car the sun hit me right between the eyes i took my sunglasses out of my pocket and put them on i walked towards the restaurant on legs that seemed to be moving by themselves it was like doing a really frightening musical audition where you walk into a room and its all silent and three people are there waiting for you to play ready to judge you and youre so scared that you seem to do everything automatically all the time wishing you could be somewhere else your heart beating loudly in your ears sure that you are going to fail but knowing that now there was no turning back thats how it was as i walked towards my meeting with tibor except that it was worse i thought about rachel back at the hotel about oswaldo who i knew would be coming up sugar loaf mountain any minute now even though i had told him not to they couldnt help me though either of them tibor was sitting against one of the large windows in the restaurant so that his head was almost in silhouette and his face was in shadow he was wearing dark glasses himself and when i came up to him his expression did not change mr derek armstrong he said icily how nice to see you again after all these years you still play the viola i am told yes i replied furious because just when i really didnt want it to happen my voice was shaking but you abandoned music i am told boring was his reply playing the same old dead composers music again and again youd know a lot about death i suppose i told him ah tibor said malgosia yes well you certainly dont waste time in small talk do you i didnt mean for her to die you know that wasnt part of the plan what plan i asked feeling suddenly angry what plan wasnt playing with her emotions enough for you wasnt causing chaos in her family enough for you wasnt ruining anjas life amusing enough you had to destroy malgosia too my god what is it that makes you do all these things well well tibor replied nastily the little viola player is making brave speeches isnt he maybe you have got a backbone after all despite what she said that hurt that really hurt but i had to keep calm if i wanted to learn the truth if i wanted to survive this meeting otherwise id jump over the table and try to kill him and that would probably be the end of me go on then i said trying to sound as normal as possible tell me how did malgosia get poisoned why did you go back to her after all those years and if i tell you what then whats in it for me said my wifes lover turning away from me in a calculated gesture of scorn your messenger that ridiculous cuban said you had something for me something i would want thats why i agreed to meet you here oh ive got something for you i replied taking a small packet from my pocket its this well he said puzzled now by what i was doing what is it just a little chemical compound i replied looking straight at him and taking a small glass container from the packet its called seratraxel i believe i found it in malgosias jewellery box just before we left england with a note telling me what it was i think she must have put it there as a kind of insurance policy in case you tried to mess around with her except that it didnt work for her did it and i want to know why not tibor was staring hard at the glass container in my hand i dont believe you youre bluffing he said a slight smile playing on his face she gave me all the seratraxel she brought over here im afraid youre wrong there i told him she kept some of it back i could see the uncertainty the fear on his face now heres the plan i went on im going to unscrew the stopper from this little glass tube i held it up in front of him and then im going to give it to you i reckon youll live for about five or six days after that tibor looked at me he believed me now he stood up he was going to try and get past me i saw him signal to someone behind me but i had been ready for this i stood up too right in front of him and held out the glass phial as if to drop it you wouldnt dare he whispered his face had gone white for the first time he looked less sure of himself it would kill you too well of course it would you fool i told him i enjoyed saying that but then i dont have anything left to live for do i you took my wife away from me so i might as well get something out of finishing my miserable life by ending yours whwhwhat about the other people in the restaurant he stammered drops of sweat beginning to appear on his forehead running down his temples tough just their bad luck wrong place wrong time weve all got to die sometime after all now why dont we sit down again and go on with our conversation i had him in my power he sat down heavily he wiped his face with a napkin from the table in front of him what do you want he said trying to reestablish some authority the truth i told him just the truth for example why did you do it why did you get in touch with malgosia again why did you involve her in your horrible little crimes why on earth did she have to die and if i tell you youll stop messing about with that nerve gas oh yes in fact you can have it im sure the extra will come in useful i said all right he agreed all right what do you want to know how did my wife die it was her decision tibor said a stupid decision she nearly killed us all what on earth are you talking about women are strange dont you find he asked i could see him thinking of what to say to me i held out the glass phial again all right all right he said look malgosia agreed to bring the seratraxel over here we put it in the three valves of a trumpet and she brought the trumpet over here i didnt realise that shed kept some for herself he looked over to the other side of the restaurant where two men his bodyguards i imagine were watching us as we spoke i had to go on quickly why did she agree to help you i asked him wasnt it dangerous she loved me he said simply what exactly were you doing tibor i asked amazed at his sudden selfcontrol what were you up to why would you want this deadly chemical anyway that is something you do not have to know all i can say is that some people you dont need to know from where needed the formula for this particular chemical agent and they were prepared to pay a great deal of money to get samples for them to analyse i havent the slightest idea what they are going to do with it thats not my concern of course its your concern you cant just wash your hands of something like this its criminal my voice was getting louder people were looking at us tibor laughed oh dear is the little viola player worried because its a bit criminal of course its criminal everything i do is criminal in your terms in your boring little life and you know what i like criminal i like my life i like the money the power the danger these are things you will never understand so how did she get sick i asked him ignoring his speech she opened up one of the containers she did it on purpose she knew what she was doing he was looking uncomfortable youre telling me that malgosia exposed herself to this stuff on purpose but why what could have made her do such a thing look tibor said gesturing with his arms he was suddenly desperate look i liked malgosia all right ive always liked her i liked her sister too it was fun to see them go crazy over me you know i liked that especially and it was good to have someone like anja waiting for me when i was over in central europe it passed the time on my visits there but i got bored with her in the end so i got in touch with malgosia again for fun come on dont look at me like that youre a man you know the score were all the same underneath anyway he continued quickly seeing the anger in my face malgosia was so grateful i couldnt believe it after all that time and then i suddenly realised she could help me with my little problem of how to get the nerve gas from scotland to brazil noone would suspect a musician after all noone is going to search a trumpet case so we gave her the trumpet and i came back here i told her to wait until i contacted her he stopped he folded his arms tibor i said to him you havent finished no he agreed unwillingly no i misjudged it you see i was negotiating with my clients trying to get them to pay more keeping them waiting only i got it wrong and they got really angry you know if we dont get the seratraxel sample in the next few days you will be in trouble that kind of thing i believed them so i had to email her and ring her get her to come here immediately good old malgosia she came straight away you still havent finished i said when his voice died away for the second time look he started again she knew what i was like i never promised her anything honestly from the very beginning all those years ago she knew what i was like but she must have thought that because shed done this thing for me that i would be grateful or something she asked me to marry her you see shed get a divorce she said we could live together forever here in brazil anywhere she said shed always wanted that his words were coming out at great speed now as if he wanted to get the story over with quickly as if he was unbelievably ashamed of himself and i told her not to be so stupid i told her she was living in a land of makebelieve the idea of it me tibor settling down with one woman i laughed at her and well i shouldnt have done it i suppose but how was i to know what she would do what did she do i yelled at him though i knew of course she opened up one of the containers he sighed looking away from me i only just had time to run out of the room i slammed the door got the people to come down from rio with their chemical suits all their chemical equipment they cleaned the place up in no time it was too late for your wife of course but you know that i mean i knew she liked me but honestly derek he said using my first name as if suddenly we were friends to kill yourself for love thats just ridiculous she must have been mad or something so that was it i had my story and suddenly the fury which i had managed to keep bottled up inside me exploded i started to unscrew the stopper from the little glass tube what are you doing tibor cried aghast what do you think youre doing if it was good enough for malgosia its good enough for you i said with a forced laugh stop it stop it the man in front of me yelled standing up you dont know what youre doing oh but i do i replied i know exactly what im doing and i took off the stopper thats when tibor lost it completely he leapt on to the table and jumped over me he fell badly on the floor but he picked himself up and half ran out of the restaurant i followed him holding the glass phial out in front of me like some religious offering i could sense his bodyguards running behind me tibor kept looking back at me as he tried to run faster on his injured ankle he climbed the steps to the cable car station people were just getting into one of the cars for the journey back down to ground level tibor pushed past them knocking one old lady to the ground watch out he cried in portuguese hes got poison and when people didnt move out of his way he changed it hes got a bomb he shouted hes got a bomb people ran away then tibor rushed into the car and tried to close the door pulling desperately on the control handle to start his descent i reached the concrete platform a few seconds later the car started its journey i wrenched open the door and jumped in just as we moved away from the platform and the mountainside dropped vertically away from us keep away from me tibor screamed as we gathered speed keep away from me or what i shouted back at him or youll kill me its a bit late for that isnt it i moved closer towards him he jumped past me and ran back to the door wrenching it open in his turn an alarm bell started ringing tibor edged out of the car and started climbing its side now we were rocking backwards and forwards violently as we travelled downwards i followed malgosias lover out into space when i think of it now i go cold with fear i cannot believe that i ended up on the roof of a cable car with nothing between me and the ground except hundreds of feet of empty space but then i was working on autopilot hardly conscious of where i was quite able to climb up the side of the swaying cable car out there in space id have climbed mount everest if you had asked me and when i got onto the roof close to the wheels as they turned over and over on the thick steel cable i found tibor crouching there shivering with fear the strong man made weak the unfeeling lover suddenly feeling real emotion for the first time probably in his horrible life he looked pathetic here i said holding up the glass phial you can have this it isnt seratraxel anyway its malgosias favourite perfume thats all just my little joke to remind you of her and i threw it at him poor old tibor he obviously didnt hear me he didnt understand me anyway he jumped up in horror lost his balance and for a terrible moment he tried desperately to keep his footing on the edge of the car his arms waved around in panic half sounds half words came from his terrified mouth he knew he was going to fall and then he was gone and i was left emptyhanded as the wires sang and the oiled wheels turned over and over in the warm afternoon air chapter eleven romantic love it wasnt a fancy wedding no white dresses or churches or anything like that it didnt seem appropriate somehow but it was still one of the happiest days of my life my second marriage and for once the sun shone and i knew i was never going to regret this day rachel looked absolutely beautiful shed made herself a red and blue dress that was just right for her beautiful figure and seemed to pick out the light in her warm brown eyes i had bought a new suit and the registry office which was crowded with friends and family was full of sunshine for the brief ceremony afterwards we went back to her mothers house and had one of the best parties i have ever been to carl and matt played violin duets and then a friend of matts set up with his band and we danced to old hit tunes even my parents got up and danced at one stage and looking at them i realised how pleased i was that we had reestablished contact again now that i was with a woman they really liked it was strange this feeling of happiness it didnt seem right somehow i wasnt used to it but as rosemary had told us a week ago you cant live in the past forever the things that happened to you werent your fault you arent responsible for tibor she told me and i know that you blame yourself for what happened to malgosia but she made her own decisions not you thats what ive been trying to tell him rachel agreed with her they had become good friends my soontobesecond wife and my first wifes best friend they had got to know each other when we came back from brazil and i had felt i had to let rosemary in on everything that had happened so i told her about seratraxel and disappointed love about the hole where tibors heart should have been and about how when tibor had disappeared off the cable car roof i had suddenly realised that i too might fall i knew i wasnt brave enough to climb down the side of the cabin again but then i realised with relief that there was a skylight in the roof and i managed to break it and fall into the interior of the car where i lay shivering with fear and misery until the cabin came to a stop i got out with shaking legs to see rachel and paul and a bunch of policemen waiting to talk to me it was oswaldo who saved the situation he had reached the top of sugar loaf mountain just as tibor had run from the restaurant with me in hot pursuit he managed to persuade the police that tibor had gone crazy and that i had tried to save him pretty soon instead of treating me like a murderer they started to think of me as a hero and for a day i was the darling of the press without getting any information from me because i did not trust myself to say anything the reporters built up a whole story about a courageous englishman a musician who had tried desperately to save the life of a stranger and then we left brazil and flew back to england i knew i had to get home before more people started asking more questions and this time when i got home with help from rachels mother i went back to see my two policemen friends and told them everything that tibor had told me for all i know secret services all over the world are still hunting down tibors clients and contacts at least i hope they are and that was pretty much the end of that except for the nightmares when i wake from some fresh terror to hear rachels gentle voice in my ear telling me that everything is all right and it is all right i keep telling myself it is all right but theres this dark pain in my heart which i am trying hard to move but which i fear may never go away i have experienced things i had never looked for and i even ended up killing a man or at the very least contributing towards his death and however much i tell myself that he deserved it still i cant help believing that i did something terribly wrong so when rachel tells me i am good i tell her i believe her and she is content and maybe just maybe in time she will convince me that she is right when our wedding band had a break for a drink the four of us our quartet played a cheerful piece by haydn the lark and then we gave our audience some of matts arrangements of popular songs and everyone clapped it was rachels idea that we should play not just because thats what we did together but also to celebrate the fact that wed just got our first recording contract and that after our honeymoon we were starting on a tour of the british isles things were looking good i told myself as we packed up our instruments when the band started again and if i could just stop thinking of malgosia they would get better and better later as it began to get dark and the music had turned from fast and furious to slow and peaceful rachel and i found ourselves talking to rosemary matt and carl and sandra who had flown over from rio for the wedding though i suspect her visit was more to do with seeing carl again than it was to see me getting married are you really all right now matt said after all the things that happened to you come on matt rosemary said shed only met him that afternoon but matts like that they were already good friends now is hardly the time its all right rosemary i told her before turning to the others dont worry matt ive never been righter you know i should have done this years ago got together with rachel properly i mean and if i had well think of all the things that might not have happened its not your fault sweetheart rachel said you know its not your fault she kissed me and the others clapped romantic love matt laughed doesnt it make you sick are you jealous said rosemary of course not matt replied and then he blushed well maybe just a little well dont be rosemary said happiness doesnt come very often you know and all of us me and you matt sandra there and carl maybe were all going to be happy one day maybe not but meanwhile lets just celebrate these two lovely people on this fabulous day then she sat down rather heavily i think she had drunk a bit too much champagne noone would believe your story if you wrote it down carl said suddenly its too fantastic too extraordinary yes why dont you write it down matt asked looking hopefully at rosemary for support but getting no reply no rachel said theyd think hed made it all up so he can write it as a novel matt replied and everybody laughed i dont think so i said i want to live in the present and the future not the past its whats going to happen next that matters i put my arm round my new wifes shoulders what happened back then all that is over finished ive left it all behind but of course i lied the past is always with us the end
