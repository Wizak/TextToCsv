 the hashish man by lord dunsany i was at a dinner in london the other day the ladies had gone upstairs and no one sat on my right on my left there was a man i did not know but he knew my name somehow apparently for he turned to me after a while and said i read a story of yours about bethmoora in a review of course i remembered the tale it was about a beautiful oriental city that was suddenly deserted in a day nobody quite knew why i said oh yes and slowly searched in my mind for some more fitting acknowledgment of the compliment that his memory had paid me i was greatly astonished when he said you were wrong about the gnousar sickness it was not that at all i said why have you been there and he said yes i do it with hashish i know bethmoora well and he took out of his pocket a small box full of some black stuff that looked like tar but had a stranger smell he warned me not to touch it with my finger as the stain remained for days i got it from a gipsy he said he had a lot of it as it had killed his father but i interrupted him for i wanted to know for certain what it was that had made desolate that beautiful city bethmoora and why they fled from it swiftly in a day was it because of the deserts curse i asked and he said partly it was the fury of the desert and partly the advice of the emperor thuba mleen for that fearful beast is in some way connected with the desert on his mothers side and he told me this strange story you remember the sailor with the black scar who was there on the day that you described when the messengers came on mules to the gate of bethmoora and all the people fled i met this man in a tavern drinking rum and he told me all about the flight from bethmoora but knew no more than you did what the message was or who had sent it however he said he would see bethmoora once more whenever he touched again at an eastern port even if he had to face the devil he often said that he would face the devil to find out the mystery of that message that emptied bethmoora in a day and in the end he had to face thuba mleen whose weak ferocity he had not imagined for one day the sailor told me he had found a ship and i met him no more after that in the tavern drinking rum it was about that time that i got the hashish from the gipsy who had a quantity that he did not want it takes one literally out of oneself it is like wings you swoop over distant countries and into other worlds once i found out the secret of the universe i have forgotten what it was but i know that the creator does not take creation seriously for i remember that he sat in space with all his work in front of him and laughed i have seen incredible things in fearful worlds as it is your imagination that takes you there so it is only by your imagination that you can get back once out in aether i met a battered prowling spirit that had belonged to a man whom drugs had killed a hundred years ago and he led me to regions that i had never imagined and we parted in anger beyond the pleiades and i could not imagine my way back and i met a huge grey shape that was the spirit of some great people perhaps of a whole star and i besought it to show me my way home and it halted beside me like a sudden wind and pointed and speaking quite softly asked me if i discerned a certain tiny light and i saw a far star faintly and then it said to me that is the solar system and strode tremendously on and somehow i imagined my way back and only just in time for my body was already stiffening in a chair in my room and the fire had gone out and everything was cold and i had to move each finger one by one and there were pins and needles in them and dreadful pains in the nails which began to thaw and at last i could move one arm and reached a bell and for a long time no one came because every one was in bed but at last a man appeared and they got a doctor and he said that it was hashish poisoning but it would have been all right if i hadnt met that battered prowling spirit i could tell you astounding things that i have seen but you want to know who sent that message to bethmoora well it was thuba mleen and this is how i know i often went to the city after that day you wrote of i used to take hashish of an evening in my flat and i always found it uninhabited sand had poured into it from the desert and the streets were yellow and smooth and through open swinging doors the sand had drifted one evening i had put the guard in front of the fire and settled into a chair and eaten my hashish and the first thing that i saw when i came to bethmoora was the sailor with the black scar strolling down the street and making footprints in the yellow sand and now i knew that i should see what secret power it was that kept bethmoora uninhabited i saw that there was anger in the desert for there were storm clouds heaving along the skyline and i heard a muttering amongst the sand the sailor strolled on down the street looking into the empty houses as he went sometimes he shouted and sometimes he sang and sometimes he wrote his name on a marble wall then he sat down on a step and ate his dinner after a while he grew tired of the city and came back up the street as he reached the gate of green copper three men on camels appeared i could do nothing i was only a consciousness invisible wandering my body was in europe the sailor fought well with his fists but he was overpowered and bound with ropes and led away through the desert i followed for as long as i could stay and found that they were going by the way of the desert round the hills of hap towards utnar vehi and then i knew that the camel men belonged to thuba mleen i work in an insurance office all day and i hope you wont forget me if ever you want to insure life fire or motor but thats no part of my story i was desperately anxious to get back to my flat though it is not good to take hashish two days running but i wanted to see what they would do to the poor fellow for i had heard bad rumours about thuba mleen when at last i got away i had a letter to write then i rang for my servant and told him that i must not be disturbed though i left my door unlocked in case of accidents after that i made up a good fire and sat down and partook of the pot of dreams i was going to the palace of thuba mleen i was kept back longer than usual by noises in the street but suddenly i was up above the town the european countries rushed by beneath me and there appeared the thin white palace spires of horrible thuba mleen i found him presently at the end of a little narrow room a curtain of red leather hung behind him on which all the names of god written in yannish were worked with a golden thread three windows were small and high the emperor seemed no more than about twenty and looked small and weak no smiles came on his nasty yellow face though he tittered continually as i looked from his low forehead to his quivering under lip i became aware that there was some horror about him though i was not able to perceive what it was and then i saw it the man never blinked and though later on i watched those eyes for a blink it never happened once and then i followed the emperors rapt glance and i saw the sailor lying on the floor alive but hideously rent and the royal torturers were at work all round him they had torn long strips from him but had not detached them and they were torturing the ends of them far away from the sailor the man that i met at dinner told me many things which i must omit the sailor was groaning softly and every time he groaned thuba mleen tittered i had no sense of smell but i could hear and see and i do not know which was the most revolting the terrible condition of the sailor or the happy unblinking face of horrible thuba mleen i wanted to go away but the time was not yet come and i had to stay where i was suddenly the emperors face began to twitch violently and his under lip quivered faster and he whimpered with anger and cried with a shrill voice in yannish to the captain of his torturers that there was a spirit in the room i feared not for living men cannot lay hands on a spirit but all the torturers were appalled at his anger and stopped their work for their hands trembled in fear then two men of the spearguard slipped from the room and each of them brought back presently a golden bowl with knobs on it full of hashish and the bowls were large enough for heads to have floated in had they been filled with blood and the two men fell to rapidly each eating with two great spoons there was enough in each spoonful to have given dreams to a hundred men and there came upon them soon the hashish state and their spirits hovered preparing to go free while i feared horribly but ever and anon they fell back again to their bodies recalled by some noise in the room still the men ate but lazily now and without ferocity at last the great spoons dropped out of their hands and their spirits rose and left them i could not flee and the spirits were more horrible than the men because they were young men and not yet wholly moulded to fit their fearful souls still the sailor groaned softly evoking little titters from the emperor thuba mleen then the two spirits rushed at me and swept me thence as gusts of wind sweep butterflies and away we went from that small pale heinous man there was no escaping from these spirits fierce insistence the energy in my minute lump of the drug was overwhelmed by the huge spoonsful that these men had eaten with both hands i was whirled over arvle woondery and brought to the lands of snith and swept on still until i came to kragua and beyond this to those bleak lands that are nearly unknown to fancy and we came at last to those ivory hills that are named the mountains of madness and i tried to struggle against the spirits of that frightful emperors men for i heard on the other side of the ivory hills the pittering of those beasts that prey on the mad as they prowled up and down it was no fault of mine that my little lump of hashish could not fight with their horrible spoonsful some one was tugging at the halldoor bell presently a servant came and told our host that a policeman in the hall wished to speak to him at once he apologised to us and went outside and we heard a man in heavy boots who spoke in a low voice to him my friend got up and walked over to the window and opened it and looked outside i should think it will be a fine night he said then he jumped out when we put our astonished heads out of the window to look for him he was already out of sight
