fattys train this morning have you forgotten that hes coming home today but hes not arriving till the middle of the morning is he said her mother theres plenty of time please dont gobble like that i expect bets wants to go and lay a red carpet down for fatty and get a band to play to welcome him said her brother pip with a grin thats what youre in a hurry about arent you bets got to go and round up the band and see that all their instruments are polished dont be so silly said bets crossly and tried to kick him under the table he dodged his legs out of the way and she kicked her fathers ankle instead he put down his paper and glared oh dad im sorry said bets please im very sorry i meant to kick pip you see any more of this kind of behaviour at breakfasttime and you can both go out of the room said mr hilton and raised his paper again leaning it against the big milkjug there was a dead silence for a minute or two except for the sound of spoons in the porridge bowls are you both going to meet fatty asked mrs hilton at last yes said bets glad to have the silence broken but i want to go round and collect buster first fatty asked me to thats why im in a hurry i suppose youre going to give old buster a bath and then dry him and then brush him and then tie a red ribbon round his neck said pip well well that will take half the morning certainly are you going to wear your best dress to meet fatty bets i think youre horrid this morning said bets almost in tears i should have thought youd be pleased to meet fatty too its maddening that his school should have broken up after easter instead of before like ours did it means well go back before he does pip stopped teasing bets yes its a silly idea some schools breaking up before easter and some after im coming to meet fatty too of course and ill go and collect buster with you ill even help you to bath him i wasnt going to bath him said bets you know i wasnt pip do you suppose fatty will be in disguise just to have a joke with us i hope to goodness you are not going to get mixed up in any nonsense again these holidays said her father entering suddenly into the conversation again im getting tired of having that fat policeman mr goon round here complaining of this and that as soon as that boy frederick appears on the scene something always seems to happen well fatty cant help it said bets loyally i mean mysteries keep on happening dad you cant stop them the papers are full of them theres absolutely need for you to be mixed up in so many said her father that boy frederick or fatty as you so rightly call him ought not to poke his nose into them leave them to the police oh but fattys much cleverer than our policeman mr goon said bets anyway i dont expect there will be time for anything exciting these hols pip changed the subject quickly he didnt want his father suddenly to forbid him and bets to have anything to do with any possible new mystery as he had done once before he had a kind of feeling that that was what would happen if he didnt hurriedly change the subject dad the gardener is still away he said is there anything you want me to do in the garden just to help out mr hilton looked pleased ah i wondered if you were going to suggest giving a bit of help he said now you come into my study before i go and ill give you a list of jobs id like done theyll keep you out of mischief anyway pip heaved a sigh of relief he didnt particularly want to do any gardening but at least he had headed his father off the subject of mysteries it would have been dreadful if he had been forbidden to take part in any during the three weeks that were left of the holidays he gave bets a frown to make her understand she was not to mention fatty again after breakfast pip disappeared into the study with his father he came up to bets later as she was making her bed he looked rather rueful look at this list whew dad must think im a supergardener ill never do all this bets looked at the list please go and do some now she said you dont want to spend all the afternoon doing it fatty might want us to go to tea or something i wish i could help you ill make your bed and tidy your room anyway will you be ready to start at twenty to eleven pip fattys train gets in just before eleven and i must collect buster pip heaved a mournful sigh as he looked at his list of jobs once more all right ill go and start now thanks for saying youll do my bed and tidy up see you later at twenty to eleven bets went out into the garden to find pip he was just putting a rake away and looked extremely hot is it time he called gosh ive been working like ten gardeners rolled into one you look as if youre going to burst into flame at any minute said bets with a giggle youd better wash your hands theyre filthy ill go on ahead and collect buster dont be long she ran down the drive happily she was tremendously glad that fatty was coming back at last bets was very fond of him she thought he must be the cleverest most ingenious and certainly the kindest boy in the world the things he could do those disguises of his and the way he thinks out things and the daring things he does she thought as she turned out of the front gate and up the lane oh im glad fattys coming back things are always dull without him its quite true what dad said things do begin to happen when fatty is around somebody whistled loudly when she got into the main road and she turned quickly it was larry with daisy his sister they waved madly and began to run are you going to meet fatty so are we where is pip isnt he coming bets explained im on my way to collect buster she said pips just coming wont old buster be pleased to see fatty i bet he knows its the day hes arriving i bet he does agreed larry hell be waiting for us his tongue out panting to go but oddly enough buster was not waiting mrs trotteville fattys mother was picking daffodils in the garden when the three children came up she smiled at them going to meet fatty it will be nice to have him back wont it yes very said larry wheres buster mrs trotteville we thought wed take him along in the kitchen i think said mrs trotteville i havent seen him for a little while he would keep treading all over the daffodils so i sent him in larry daisy and bets went to the kitchen door and called loudly buster hey buster come along were going to meet fatty but no buster appeared there was no scamper of short eager legs no welcoming volley of barks the cook came to the door hes not here she said he did come in a minute or two ago but off he went again hes probably gone off with the bakers boy he likes him goodness knows why hes a cheeky little monkey that boy well well have to go without buster said larry disappointed how maddening of him to go off just at this time fatty will be disappointed they set off to the station joined by a breathless pip wheres buster dont say hes gone off just when we want him not at all like buster they hurried on do you suppose fatty will play a joke on us and turn up in disguise said bets i do hope he doesnt i just want to see him nice and fat and grinning all over his face we shall be jolly late if we dont hurry said larry looking at his watch look isnt that the train coming in now and were not nearly there buck up they bucked up and arrived at the station just as the train began to pull out again the passengers had got out and were now walking down the platform two or three were waiting with their luggage for a porter look theres old buster said pip suddenly would you believe it sitting under that seat look all by himself watching sure enough there was the little scottie patiently waiting there how did he know that fattys train was due now said bets in wonder however did he know so thats where he ran off to the station he was on time too and we werent clever old buster wheres fatty said daisy as the crowd of passengers came up to the door where the ticketcollector stood i cant see him yet he may be in disguise just to test us and see how bright we are said pip look at every one very carefully especially people with glasses they stood silently behind the collector as every one surged past giving up tickets a big bustling woman a pair of schoolgirls a man with a bag two young soldiers in khaki each with enormous kitbags on their shoulders two men bundled up in thick overcoats both wearing glasses was one fatty they were both about his build one said something in a foreign language as he passed by the four children stared after him doubtfully he could be fatty they turned to watch the rest of the passengers but there was no one who could possibly be fatty at the end came buster all alone bets patted him thinking that he looked sad so you missed him too did you she said buster was he one of those bundledup men there was now no one left on the platform except a porter come on said larry making up his mind fatty must have been one of those men well follow them we cant have old fatty tricking us as easily as this a little bit of help the four children went out of the station and looked up the road where had the men gone there they are said larry look just at the corner but whos the man with fatty said pip puzzled he never said anything about coming back with somebody look theyve shaken hands said daisy i expect ok fatty just fell into conversation with him to trick us a bit more come on im sure the man whos gone off to the right is fatty hes got his walk somehow and hes going in the right direction said pip its fatty all right they hurried after him when they got to the corner they paused now where was he there he is talking to that woman said larry hurry they hurried the man his coatcollar turned up wearing thick glasses over his eyes was saying something very earnestly to a thin little woman with a shoppingbasket the four came up behind him and listened with amusement oh fatty fatty i seek my sistairs house you will tell me pliss the house it is called grintriss never heard of it said the woman looking most suspiciously at the bundledup man pardon where is zis house asked the man anxiously i said never heard of it said the woman theres no house called grintriss that i know of whats your sisters name her name is francoise emilie harris said the man going suddenly very french never heard of her either said the thin little woman looking more suspicious than ever why dont you ask at the postoffice pliss what is zis postoffis began the man but the woman walked off impatiently leaving him standing there with his bag pip nudged larry this is where we come in he said in a low voice well tell old fatty we know where his sister lives and that well take him there and well lead him straight to his own house thatll show him weve seen through him come on wheres his school trunk said bets pulling pip back as he started off after the man are you sure its fatty hes sent his trunk carriage forward of course said pip come on look at that walk its exactly like old fattys they set off after the man daisy suddenly thought of something where was buster she looked round but he wasnt there what happened to buster she said surely he didnt stay behind i was just wondering why he didnt know it was fatty and dash round his legs he would have if hed been with us said pip he didnt recognize him in that crowd at the station and hes probably patiently sitting under the seat again waiting oh poor buster said bets look fatty has stopped another woman what a scream he is the second woman had no patience she just shook her head and hurried off larry put his fingers to his mouth and let off a piercing whistle making the others jump dont said daisy you know youre not allowed to do that its a horrible noise and makes people awfully angry its stopped old fatty anyway said larry pleased look hes turned round hes gone on again said bets with a giggle lets catch him up hes going the wrong way home now they hurried after the man well pretend we dont know its fatty said pip well make him think hes deceiving us but well have the laugh all right when we take him to his own house instead of to his mythical sistairs house they caught up the man and he stopped peering at them through thick glasses he had a small black moustache his coatcollar was turned up and not much could be seen of his face ah some children you will help me yes said the man i look for my sistairs house vous cherchez la maison de votre soeur said pip in his best french the man beamed at him oui oui it is called grintriss grintriss oh yes we know where that is said larry most untruthfully playing up to fatty for all he was worth this way please everybody knows grintriss a very nice house big one too beeg no my sistairs house is leetle said the man vairy vairy leetle grintriss it is called oh yes grintriss vairy leetle said pip er do you feel the cold monsieur you are well wrapped up i have had the bad cold said the man and he sniffed and gave a hollow cough i come to my sistair for a leetle holyday holiday you mean said daisy and the four of them began to laugh thats a nasty little cough youve got very nasty the man coughed again and bets began to giggle didnt fatty know they were pulling his leg how often had she heard fatty cough like that when he was disguised as some poor old man they all went up the road together the man hunched up in his bulky coat he pulled his scarf over his chin as they met the wind at a corner we are soon at grintriss he asked anxiously this wind is too too too windy said pip obligingly thats the worst of winds theyre always so windy the man gave him a sudden stare and said no more larry guided him round the next corner and over the road to fattys own house mrs trotteville was nowhere to be seen larry winked at pip well take him up to the front door and leave him there he said falling behind to whisper well just see what old fatty says then they marched him in firmly at the gate and right up to the front door here you are said pip grintriss i expect your sistair will answer the door herself ill pull the bell for you he pulled the bell and banged on the knocker too then the four of them retreated to the front gate to see what fatty would do would he swing round take off his glasses and grin at them would he say one up to you you win the door opened and the house parlourmaid stood there an argument seemed to arise though the children couldnt hear all of it the maid raised her voice i said theres no one here of that name and whats more ive never heard of a house called grintriss either bets suddenly heard quick footsteps coming up the road and then a familiar bark she ran through the gate sure that it was busters bark she gave a shrill scream buster fatty its fatty oh fatty then that wasnt you after all fatty she rushed down the road and flung herself into fattys arms there he was as plump as ever his eyes laughing his mouth in a wide grin fatty that wasnt you then oh dear whats all this about asked fatty swinging bets into the air and down again gosh bets youre getting heavy i soon shant be able to do that why werent you at the station to meet me only buster was there now all the others were round him too astonished fatty how had they missed him you are a lot of donkeys said fatty in his cheerful voice i bet you met the train that comes in four minutes before mine buster was much more sensible he knew enough to wait for the right one and there he was prancing round the platform barking like mad when he saw me i looked for you but you were nowhere to be seen oh fatty we must have met the wrong tram and weve made an awful mistake said daisy troubled we thought you might be in disguise just to play a joke on us and when we couldnt see you anywhere we followed a man we thought was you and oh fatty he asked us the way to some house or other and we took him to yours well said fatty and roared with laughter you are a lot of mutts wheres this poor fellow wed better put him right the man was even now walking out of the gate muttering and looking furious as indeed he had every right to be he stopped and looked at the name on the gate ha you do not bring me to grintriss this is not grintriss you are wicket you treat a sick man so he began to cough again the children were alarmed and felt very sorry however could they explain their mistake he would never never understand he stalked up to them blowing his nose with a trumpeting sound wicket wicket he repeated very bad wicket he began to shout at them in french waving his arms about they listened in dismay suppose mrs trotteville came out it would be even worse to explain their silly mistake to her than to this man a bell rang loudly and a bicycle stopped suddenly at the kerb a very familiar voice hailed them now then whats all this mr goon groaned larry old clearorf he would turn up of course buster danced round mr goon in delight barking furiously mr goon kept a watchful eye on him thankful that he had on his thickest trousers nasty little yapping dog he said call him off or ill give him a kick fatty called buster and the scottie came most reluctantly oh for a bite at that big loudvoiced policeman goon spoke to the bewildered frenchman whats all this have these children been annoying you ill report them if so the man went off into a long and angry speech but as it was all in french mr goon didnt understand a word he debated whether he should ask fatty to translate for him but how was he to trust that fat boys translation fatty looked at goon with a gleam in his eye dont you want to know what hes saying mr goon he said politely i can just catch a few words now and again er he doesnt seem to like the look of you im afraid it sounds as if hes calling you names mr goon felt out of his depth these pests of children again and this foreigner who appeared to be quite mad and that nasty little dog longing to get at his ankles mr goon felt that the best and most dignified thing to do was to bicycle away immediately so with a snort that sounded like gah he pushed off from the kerb and sailed away down the road followed by a fusillade of barks from the disappointed buster thank goodness said daisy fervently and all the five agreed its nice to be together again the frenchman stared after the policeman in surprise in france policemen did not behave like that they were interested and excited when a complaint was made to them they listened they took notes but this policeman had said gah and gone cycling away extraordinary he began to cough fatty felt sorry for him and began to talk to him in perfect french trust old fatty to know the right thing to do the others stood round listening in admiration really fatty might be french how does he learn french like that wondered daisy nobody at our school could even begin to talk like that really fatty is a most surprising person the man began to calm down he took a little notebook out of his pocket and opened it i will show you the name he said grintriss why should nobody know this grintriss house he showed fatty something written down on a page of a notebook the others peeped over his arm to look oh greentrees said daisy why ever didnt you say so you kept saying grintriss yes grintriss repeated the man puzzled all the time i say grintriss pliss where is zis house its greentrees said daisy pronouncing it slowly and carefully grintriss said the man again and now where is zis house i ask of you for the last time he looked as if he were going to burst into tears fatty took his arm come on ill show you no tricks this time well take you there and off they all went together fatty suddenly jabbering in french again down the road round the corner up the hill and into a quiet little lane in the middle of it was a small and pretty house smoke curling from its chimneys greentrees said fatty pointing to the name on the white gate ah grintriss said the man in delight and raised his hat to the two girls mesdemoiselles adieu i go to find my sistair he disappeared up the little front path bets gave a sigh and slipped her arm through fattys what a shame to welcome you home with a silly muddle like this fatty we meant to be on the platform ready to give you a wonderful welcome and only buster was there and wed gone off after somebody who wasnt in the least like you yes but thats the worst of fatty when he puts on a disguise grumbled pip he never does look in the least like himself come on fatty lets take you back home now your mother will be wondering whats become of you mrs trotteville was quite relieved to see fatty and the others trooping into the hall she came out to greet them frederick did you miss your train how late you are welcome home again hallo mother what a nice smell from the kitchen smells like steak and onions buster what do you think wuff said buster ready to agree with every word that fatty said he dashed round fattys legs galloped behind the couch appeared again and then threaded his way at top speed between all the chairs jetpropelled obstacle race said fatty hey buster look where youre going youll knock me over he always behaves like that when you first come home said mrs trotteville i only hope he gets over the excitement soon i simply darent walk a step when he goes mad like this hes a darling said bets i know how he feels when fatty comes home i feel rather the same myself fatty gave her a sudden hug well dont you start racing round the furniture on allfours he said tell me any mysterious mysteries or insoluble problems cropped up this last week what a shame you all got home before i did nothings turned up yet said pip but i bet something will now youre here adventures go to the adventurous you know i do hope nothing does turn up said mrs trotteville or i shall have that silly mr goon round here again now the one i like is your friend superintendent jenks they all stared at her superintendent you dont mean that chiefinspector jenks is a superintendent now said larry my word hes going up and up isnt he we knew him first when he was an inspector said bets remembering and then he became a chiefinspector now hes a superintendent im glad hes getting very very highup isnt he i hope hell still like to know us i expect he will said mrs trotteville smiling oh dear i do wish cook would keep the kitchen door shut when she is doing onions what a smell came in here then keep the door shut when its steak and onions said fatty in horror shut did you say shut out a heavenly smell like that mother dont you realise that i have as usual been halfstarved all the term well its a pity you werent said his mother looking at his tight overcoat those buttons look as if they are just about to burst off your trunk has come frederick do you want to unpack it and get ready for lunch straight away were having it early as i thought you would be hungry mother i do love you when you think things like that said fatty in a sudden burst of affection im starving cupboard love said his mother amused at fattys sudden hug can all the others stay to lunch as well asked fatty hopefully yes if youd like to share your bit of steak and onions round said his mother but not even fatty could rise to that and so he said goodbye to the other four very reluctantly they can all come to tea this afternoon if you like said mrs trotteville ill get in plenty of cakes frederick do control buster hes gone mad again it really makes me giddy to watch him buster behave yourself said fatty and the mad little scottie turned himself miraculously into a quiet and peaceful little lamb lying down on fattys feet and licking his shoes come back at three said fatty and took the others to the front gate well have a good old talk and you can tell me all the news solong he went back to the house sniffing for steak and onions again i suppose frederick you dont know anything about a bulkylooking foreigner who came to the front door this morning and told jane that this house was grintriss and wanted to force his way in and see some sister of his do you said mrs trotteville when fatty came back he kept talking about some wicket children when jane told him this wasnt the house you hadnt anything to do with him i suppose you havent been up to your tricks again already i hope of course not said fatty looking quite hurt poor fellow i found him at the front gate and we all took him to the place he wanted to go to greentrees down holly lane oh mother theres that heavenly smell again do you mind if i go and smell it even nearer i havent seen cook or jane yet very well but dont try lifting fried onions out of the pan said mrs trotteville oh frederick its very nice to have you back but i do wish i always knew what you were up to please dont get mixed up in anything alarming these holidays pips mother was saying to me only yesterday that everything has been so peaceful this last week there was no answer fatty was already in the kitchen sampling halffried strips of onion while cook and jane giggled at him and promised to provide him with new gingerbread hot scones and homemade raspberry jam when the others came to tea that afternoon they loved fatty a caution thats what he is cook told her friends honestly you just never know whats going to happen when master frederick is about fatty enjoyed his lunch thoroughly and told his mother all about his last term he appeared as always to have done extremely well though there may be something on my report about the er the advisability of sticking to my own voice he said making his mother look up in surprise its all right mother it just means that my ventriloquism has been rather successful this term one of fattys talents was the ability to throw his voice and he was now a very fine ventriloquist indeed but unfortunately the masters at school did not approve of this as much as the boys did fattys class had spent one whole morning searching for an apparently injured man somewhere up in the school attic the groans had been tremendous and had caused a great sensation when it had been discovered that it was merely a ventriloquial stunt of fattys there had been another sensation but not a very happy one for fatty in fact he hadnt felt it wise to do any more ventriloquism that term which was he thought a great pity he would get out of practice at three oclock exactly there was the tramp of feet going down the garden to fattys shed fatty saw larry daisy pip and bets passing by under his window and hurriedly stopped his unpacking he shot downstairs with buster and went to join the others in his big shed at the bottom of the garden this was playroom storeroom changingroom anything that fatty wanted he had a key for it and kept it well and truly locked there were too many disguises and odd clothes that he didnt want grownups to see his mother would certainly have been astonished to see some of the old things he had picked up at jumble sales dreadful old hats ragged shawls voluminous skirts corduroy trousers downatheel boots hallo said fatty appearing just as the others were looking in at the shed window to see if he was there ill unlock the door i slipped down just after dinner to light the oilstove it should be nice and warm now they all went in it certainly was nice and warm the sun slid in at one window and lighted up the inside of the shed it looked dusty and untidy ill clean it up for you promised daisy looking round i say its nice to meet like this again isnt it all the five findouters together with nothing to find out said pip i like it best when weve got something exciting on hand and remember fatty we go back to school a whole week before you do so there isnt a great deal of time to get going on something we can always practise a bit suggested larry you know go out in disguise or do a spot of shadowing or watching yes we could do that said fatty i want to practise my ventriloquism too ive got out of practice this last term oh yes do practise that begged bets lets make some plans right said fatty obligingly we will a few little plans many ridiculous plans were discussed that afternoon over a really supertea cook had kept her word and there were lashings of hot scones and raspberry jam new and very sticky gingerbread with raisins in and a big round chocolate cake with a special filling made by cook buster had dog biscuits spread with potted meat and approved of this very highly its threetreatsinone for him explained fatty first he gets a fine sniff at the biscuits and potted meat then he gets a fine lick at them then he gets a wonderful crunch at them threemealsinone so to speak wuff said buster thumping his tail bard and what is more said fatty cutting himself a huge slice of the chocolate cake what is more we can have every bit of this cake to ourselves pottedmeatbiscuits take the whole of busters attention he hasnt even seen this cake yet and when he does it wont be there said pip not if i can help it anyway they got back to their plans again fatty was in an uproarious mood and made them all laugh till they choked what about taking a clotheshorse with us larry and going into the main street and pretending to be workmen chipping up the road suggested fatty just you and i larry pips not big enough yet to pass as a workman we could put the clotheshorse round us like workman do hang a red flag on it and chip up the road dont be an idiot said larry wed get into an awful row i bet old goon would let us sit there all morning chipping up the road said fatty hed never dream of asking us what we were doing fatty im going to dare you to do something said daisy with a sudden giggle look im trying to sell these tickets for our church sale i dare you to try and sell one to old goon easy said fatty very easy give me one ill sell it tomorrow that shall be my little task what shall i do asked larry er let me see yes what about you putting on overalls taking a pail and a leather and going to clean somebodys windows said fatty oh no said larry in alarm nothing like that yes do do begged daisy and bets only youll have to choose a house that is all on one floor a bungalow for instance said pip you wont need a ladder then and there wouldnt be so many windows to clean larry as windowcleaner thats good do i have to ask if i can clean the windows said larry looking desperate i mean i cant just go to a house and start cleaning can i they might have their own regular windowcleaner yes thats true you must ask first said fatty solemnly and if you get any payment you can buy one of daisys sale tickets oh i say said larry thats a bit hard it occurred to him that these sudden plans were rather a mistake what shall i do said pip with a giggle they all looked at him you can shadow goon sometime tomorrow said fatty firmly shadow him so that he doesnt know youre following him do it really properly all right said pip i can do that i think what about the girls well think of something for them to do when weve done our tasks said fatty now any one want this last bit of gingerbread or shall i cut it into five it was duly cut into five any one seen superintendent jenks these hols asked fatty handing round the gingerbread jolly good that hes promoted again isnt it super said bets yes super intendent said pip and everyone punched him no none of us has seen him were not likely to see him either unless we have something in the mystery line to solve i wish hed hand us over a few of his cases said fatty stacking the plates together im sure we could help i mean weve had a good bit of experience now havent we the only thing is goon always knows about the cases too and he does get in our way when were both working on the same mystery said daisy i wish we could work on some more clues and suspects and all the rest it is such fun they got out some cards and began to play a game it was nice to be all together again things werent the same somehow without fatty he said and did such ridiculous things and nobody ever knew what he would do next pip looked at his watch after a tune and sighed i must go he said come on bets we shall only get into a row if were late why does time always go so fast when you dont want it to dont forget pip and larry youve got jobs to do tomorrow said fatty slipping the cards back into their case report here tomorrow after tea and ill have the money for goons ticket ready for you daisy she laughed it will be more difficult than you think she said come on larry as fatty cleared up the shed when the others had gone he wondered how he could get mr goon to buy the ticket he ran his eye over the clothes hanging up at one side of the shed he must certainly disguise himself for goon would never never buy a ticket from him if he went as himself ill go as an old woman and pretend to read his hand thought fatty he believes in that sort of nonsense it should be fun pip was also planning his own task when should he shadow mr goon of course it would be easiest to do it in the dark but he didnt know what time goon went out at night and he couldnt very well hang about outside his house for hours no it would have to be in the morning when goon went out on his bicycle pip would take his and follow him he would pretend that goon was a suspect a burglar or a thief and track him wherever he went so next morning pip got his bicycle and set out to the street where the policeman lived there was his house with police above it in big letters pip got off his bicycle propped it against a big tree and then quietly let all the air out of one tyre now he could mess about with the wheel pretending to pump up his tyre and nobody would bother about why he was there even if he had to wait for half an hour or more he did have to wait a good time and got rather tired of pumping up his tyre and letting the air out again but at last mr goon appeared wheeling his bicycle out his trousers neatly clipped in at the ankles pip was surprised to see a skinny little boy of about eleven following goon to the door goon shouted a few words to him mounted his bicycle ponderously and rode off up the street pip slid on to his saddle and rode off too goon didnt seem to have the slightest idea that he was being followed he sailed along waving to this person and that in a very condescending manner he got off at the front gate of a house propped his bicycle up against the fence and went to the front door pip waited beside a hedge out came goon again and rode down the road and into the main street he got off at the postoffice and went inside pip got tired of waiting for him and thought longingly of icecreams he was just near a shop that sold them he suddenly decided to nip in and get one but while he nipped in and got one mr goon came out and sailed away again on his bicycle pip only just managed to spot him crammed his icecream down his throat so that he almost froze himself and raced after goon on the way he passed mrs trotteville fattys mother she had buster with her and as soon as he saw pip and heard his voice calling out good morning he left mrs trotteville and raced after pip no buster not this morning go back theres a good dog shouted pip but buster laboured after him panting fatty had gone out without him so he would go with pip but buster couldnt keep up with pip on his bicycle and was soon left behind he followed at a distance still panting mr goon had gone down a lane that led nowhere except to a farm pip just managed to see him disappearing round the corner he guessed what he had gone to the farm for the farmer had been complaining bitterly that his sheep had been worried by dogs goon must have gone to get details of the dogs oh well pip could sit under a hedge and wait for goon to come out again it was a bit dull shadowing him really he wondered how larry was getting on with his windowcleaning pip got off his bicycle hid it in a ditch and then crept through a gap into the field sheep were there with some fat woolly lambs about three months old they were skipping about in a ridiculous fashion pip sat with his back against a hawthorn tree and watched them suddenly he heard the scampering of feet and loud panting breath and in another second buster had flung himself on him through the gap in the hedge he licked pips face and yelped for joy found you he seemed to say found you oh buster said pip stop licking me he pushed buster away and the dog ran out into the field in a wide circle barking some nearby lambs started away in alarm and ran to their mothersheep and then a loud familiar voice came through the hedge ho so its that fat boys dog that chases farmer meadows sheep is it i might have guessed it ill catch that dog and have him shot ive just this minute been to the farm to get particulars of sheepchasing dogs and here ive got one caught in the act mr goon came crashing through the hedge and pip at once sprang to his feet buster wasnt chasing the sheep he cried indignantly he came to find me hes only arrived this very minute ill catch that dog and take him off with me said mr goon simply delighted to think that he could find such a good reason for catching buster but it wasnt so easy to catch the scottie in fact it was far easier for buster to catch mr goon as the policeman soon realised when buster kept running at him and then backing away in the end he had to shout to pip to call him off pip called him and goon just had time to mount his bicycle and pedal away at top speed i wonder where fatty is groaned pip i must find him and tell him about this blow you buster what did you want to follow me for now youre in for trouble fatty enjoys himself pip got on his bicycle and rode off buster ran beside him keeping a good lookout for mr goon he would have very much liked another pounce at his ankles but goon was out of sight on his way home visions of a nice hot cup of coffee wellsugared and a slice of homemade cake floated in his mind pip rode to fattys house but he wasnt there blow said pip i suppose hes gone off to sell his ticket to goon i wish id seen him i bet he looks exactly like some old woman shopping in the town fatty had had a most enjoyable time in his shed choosing a disguise to wear when he went to sell the ticket to mr goon he had chosen a rather long black skirt a black jumper a shapeless darkred coat and a hat he had bought at the last jumble sale it was black straw and had a few darkred roses in the front fatty put on a wig of dark hair and made up his face putting in a few artful wrinkles here and there he looked at himself in the mirror and grinned then he frowned and immediately the face of a cross old woman looked back at him out of the mirror i wish the others could see me thought fatty theyd hoot with laughter now wheres my handbag the handbag was a very old one of his mothers in it was a powdercompact a handkerchief and a few hairpins all of which fatty kept there for use when he disguised himself as a woman he delighted in taking out the powder case and dabbing powder on his nose as he had so often seen women do his mother would have been most astonished to see him he unlocked the door of his shed and opened it a little listening was any one about or could he slip safely out into the road he could hear nothing so he slipped out of the shed locked the door and made his way up the sidepath through the shrubbery as he went through the bushes a voice hailed him hey you what you doing there it was the gardener looking with interest at the shabby old woman fatty immediately went all foreign he flapped about with his hands moved his shoulders up and down and said ackleeetaoomipoggywo cant you speak english said the gardener see theres the kitchen door if you want anything tipplyopplyericacoo said fatty in a most grateful voice and slid out of the gardeners sight he grinned to himself his disguise must be pretty good if the gardener didnt see through it he decided that it would be quite a good idea to go on being rather foreign it was so easy to talk gibberish fatty could go on and on for a very long time apparently speaking in a foreign language shrugging his shoulders like his french master at school and waggling his hands about he made his way down the road nobody took the least notice of him which was very good fatty decided that he looked rather like one of the faded old women who sometimes sat on committees with his mother he came to the road where goon lived and went up to his house was goon in fatty knocked at the door it opened and a skinny little boy stood there the same skinny little fellow who had followed goon to the door when pip had been waiting for him the boy looked at him with sharp eyes mr goons out he said theres only my mum in shes cleaning if you want to leave a message ill call her ah zat would be kind said fatty giving the boy a sudden beaming smile i vill come in he pushed past the boy and went into goons office he sat down spreading out his skirts and patting the back of his hair with his hand ill fetch me mum said the boy who didnt quite know what to make of this visitor was she a friend of mr goon ere mum theres a funny old foreign lady come to see mr goon fatty heard the boy say shes set herself down in the office all right ill see what she wants said mums voice mum then appeared at the officedoor wiping her hands on an apron fatty gave her a gracious smile and nodded her head i come to see dear mr goon he announced he is expecting me yes i dont rightly know said mum hes out just now will you wait im just cleaning out for him i come every morning i have to bring bert with me because its holidays but hes useful fatty beamed at the skinny little woman who really looked very like bert ikkledokkarunipie he said in a very earnest voice pardon said mum startled youre foreign arent you i had a foreigner once who lodged with me she was right down clever read my hand like a book ah so said fatty i too read the hand like a book do you really said mum and came a little farther into the room fatty racked his brains to remember who she was he knew he had seen her before then he remembered of course she was a friend of jane the house parlourmaid and sometimes came to help cook when they had a party he had heard them talking about her what was her name now ah yes mickle mum wiped her hands again on her apron and held one out to fatty whats my hand tell you she asked eagerly fatty took it in his and frowned over it ah your name it is mickle mrs mickle you live at at shepherds crescent coo said mum most impressed is that all written in my hand go on you have five sisters said fatty remembering the gossip he had heard and er er you have brothers how many it is difficult to see in your hand ive got six said mum helpfully perhaps theyre hidden under that bit of dirt there id have washed me hands if id known you were coming i see illnesses here went on fatty and children and cups and cups of tea and thats right broke in mum quite excited ive bin ill many a time and ive got five children bert there is the youngest and the cups of tea ive had well i must have had thousands in me life millions said fatty still bent over her hand fancy you even seeing them cups of tea there said mum she raised her voice bert this ladys a real wonder at reading hands you come and listen bert was already listening just outside the door he came right in when his mother called he looked at fatty disbelievingly where do you see them cups of tea he asked how do you know theyre not cups of coffee fatty decided that he didnt much like bert he thought it would be very nice indeed to read berts band and see a great many spankings there but bert didnt ask to have his hand read he kept them both firmly behind his back as if afraid that fatty would start reading them at once young bert already had quite a lot of things in his life that he didnt want any one to know about someone rode up to the front gate and got off a bicycle coo heres mr goon back already and i havent got the kettle on for his coffee said mum and disappeared at once mr goon opened the front door and came heavily into the hall mum called out to him mr goon sir theres a lady wanting to see you ive put her in the office mr goon went into the kitchen who is she fatty heard him say whats she come for i didnt make so bold as to ask her that said mum putting a kettle on the stove shes a foreigner by the sound of her funnylooking you know and speaks queer she read mums hand said bert slyly you hold your tongue young bert said mum sharply she read it like a book sir knew me name and everything one of these clever ones you ready for your cup of coffee sir yes i could do with one said goon ive been attacked by a dog this morning you dont say said mum did he bite you mr goon liked sympathy he enlarged quite a bit on busters lighthearted game with him its a wonder my trousers arent torn to bits he said the dog came at me time and again if i wasnt pretty nippy id have been bitten more than i was good thing i had my thickest trousers on well there now what a thing to happen to you mr goon said mum bert stared down at mr goons trousers to see if they were torn they didnt appear to be you going to report the dog asked bert i caught it chasing sheep said goon taking off his helmet very serious crime that for a dog i tried to catch it but i couldnt id give anything to have that dog here under lock and key id teach it a few things what would you give me if i got it for you asked bert goon stared at him mum was taking no notice she was busy at the cupboard with a caketin goon nodded his head towards the hall and bert followed him there fatty had heard every word he wondered whose dog this was that goon was talking about he knew that the farmer had been worried by sheepchasing dogs it never occurred to him that goon was actually talking about buster a whispered conversation followed fatty only caught a few words but he guessed the rest goon was arranging with young bert to catch the dog and bring it to him the sum of half a crown was mentioned fatty frowned how wrong of goon to do a thing like that he wished he knew whose dog it was he would certainly warn the owner goon appeared in the office looking rather pleased with himself and young bert went back to the kitchen fatty didnt get up he held out a gracious hand and bowed in a very ladylike way goon was rather impressed with this behaviour though not with fattys clothes still foreigners did seem to wear peculiar things sometimes what can i do for you madam said goon i am a friend of mrs trotteville said fatty truthfully a vairy great friend ah said goon impressed he was in awe of mrs trotteville you staying with her then i shall be wiz her for three wiks said fatty sticking to the truth i sell tickets for the beeg sale you will buy one yes er well can i offer you a cup of coffee said goon seeing mum coming in with a tray i hear you can read hands i suppose youll be doing that at the sale you would like me to read your beeg beeg hand now and you will buy a ticket offered fatty mr goon couldnt resist having his hand read mum fetched another cup of coffee and mr goon held out a large hand palm upwards to fatty how fatty wished that larry and the others could see him a few reports that evening after tea the five findouters met in fattys shed as arranged fatty was there first grinning whenever he remembered how he had read goons hand in his pocket were two halfcrowns that goon had given him for daisys ticket easy the others all arrived together fatty welcomed them he had orangeade and biscuits which everyone was pleased to see in spite of the fact that they had all made a very good tea not half an hour before now are we all ready well have our various reports said fatty you first pip you seem to be bursting with news i am said pip and poured out the story of how he had shadowed goon seen nun go to the farmhouse and waited for him in the field he told how buster had also shadowed him and burst on him as he sat watching the sheep and the lambs then old buster got excited and some lambs were afraid and scampered away making the sheep run said pip up came old goon and said that buster ought to be shot for worrying sheep good gracious said daisy surely he didnt mean that buster has never never chased a sheep has he fatty never said fatty who was listening intently go on pip theres nothing much more to tell except that goon was idiot enough to try and catch buster said pip and buster had a fine old game with him of course trying to nip his ankles it would have served goon right if he had nipped them the only reason that goon said that buster was chasing sheep was just so that he could report him but oh fatty buster couldnt be shot just on goons report could he dont worry ill see that he isnt said fatty grimly wed get on to chiefinspector i mean superintendent jenks at once its funny though when i went to see goon this morning he came in talking all about some dog or other that he wanted brought in for sheepchasing i bet it was buster though he didnt say the name but why did he tell you said pip surprised he might have guessed youd hear about it from me oh he didnt know i was sitting there in his office said fatty i was disguised of course ill have to think about this story of yours pip i have an idea that goon has made some arrangement with a nasty skinny little kid to catch buster son of a woman who was cleaning the house for goon i saw him at the door said pip remembering gosh hed never have the nerve to catch buster surely i dont know well have to watch out said fatty listen and ill tell you how i sold the ticket to goon daisy gave a shriek of delight oh did you really manage to oh fatty you are clever you must have been jolly well disguised well i was said fatty trying to be modest as a matter of fact i dont believe even bets here would have guessed it was me i went as a friend of my mother a foreign one rather downatheel you know old ladygonetoseedabit staying with dear mrs trotteville for three weeks every one roared oh fatty said bets its so true too you are a friend of your mother and you are here for three weeks marvellous i sold the ticket by reading goons hand went on fatty enjoying himself he stuck his great fat paw on my knee and i exclaimed over it and said how extraordinary it was and so it was with its enormous fingers and great fat palm i could hardly see the lines on it for fat what did you tell him asked daisy oh i told him his name was theophilus and that he had plenty of nephews one very clever one called ern said fatty everyone laughed mr goon disliked ern intensely i told him he would handle a lot of money went on fatty yes his wages every week grinned pip but the best bit was where i looked hard at his hand like this said fatty clutching daisys hand suddenly and making her jump he peered closely at it then held it away then peered at it again ha zis is a vairy peeculiar thing i see said fatty sounding like the frenchwoman again i see a fat boy a beeg fat boy there were roars of laughter at this oh fatty said bets you pretended you saw yourself in goons hand what did he say he seemed very startled said fatty in his own voice he said what that toad tell me more so you told him more said larry grinning oh yes i said bewaaaaare of zis fat boy there is some mystery here ze fat boy and the mystery are togezzer fatty paused and twinkled round at the others that made goon sit up i can tell you he said what a mystery go on tell me about it what mystery is it what did you say said bets with a sudden giggle i said i do not know zis mystery it will come but bewaaaaare of zis beeg fat boy oh fatty i do wish id been there said bets and the others all agreed fervently oh to have sat and watched fatty reading mr goons hand is that all asked daisy tell us it all over again no not now said fatty reluctantly we ought to hear larrys story times getting on anyway the result of all this amazing handreading was that goon handed over two halfcrowns for daisys ticket like an absolute lamb he even said that if i was going to be at the sale hed be along for another handreading to see if the mystery was any nearer he simply beamed at me oh dear what a wonderful morning you had said larry as fatty handed over two halfcrowns to the delighted daisy now ill tell my story yes tell yours said daisy you should have seen him dressed up as a windowcleaner fatty he borrowed an old pair of dirty blue dungarees put on a frightful old cloth cap that has hung in the shed for ages and made himself filthy hands face and neck honestly id never employ him as a windowcleaner he looked more like a sweep fatty grinned good work he said to larry go on tell us what you did well said larry i dressed up just as daisys told you and i took an old pail and a leather and off i went where did you go asked fatty well i remembered id better not choose a house that needed a ladder for upstairs windows said larry so i tried to think of a bungalow somewhere with the windows all on the one floor and i remembered seeing one next to that house called greentrees do you remember the one that that foreigner went to the man we mistook to be fatty oh yes i remember the bungalow too said fatty good for you in holly lane wasnt it a little place with an untidy garden standing a bit back from the road thats right what a memory youve got fatty you never miss anything said larry well i took my pail and my leather and walked up the path to the bungalow i knocked at the door was anyone in asked bets i didnt think so at first because nobody answered said larry so i knocked again very loudly and a voice said come in i opened the door and yelled inside windowcleaner is it all right to do the windows now and somebody shouted yes who was it did you see asked fatty no i didnt said larry anyway i got some water from a waterbutt outside and started on the back windows two of them there wasnt any one in the room there it was a bedroom with a single bed a chair and a table rather poor as i was doing these windows i heard the front door slam and somebody went up the path to the road i didnt see him or her it might have been was the house left empty then asked fatty i thought so at first but when i came round to the front to do the front windows i saw there was someone inside that room said larry and this is the queer part of my story everyone sat up at once queer how do you mean asked fatty well at first i thought there wasnt anyone in the room said larry and i thought id buck up and clean the windows and go glad to have finished the job actually when i was doing it i thought it was a bit silly and then i suddenly saw someone on the floor on the floor hurt do you mean asked pip no he didnt seem to be hurt said larry he seemed to be feeling the chairs he felt first one and then another muttering to himself all the time but what for asked fatty and who was he anyway i dont know he looked a very old man said larry he had a kind of nightcap on his head and he wore pyjamas and a dressinggown he kept feeling one chair after another underneath them and then he came to a chair that seemed to satisfy him he nodded and gave a chuckle extraordinary what did he do next asked fatty most interested he crawled over the floor to a kind of wheelchair and somehow got into it said larry his nightcap slipped off and he was quite bald poor old fellow he sat in front of some kind of stove and then he dropped off to sleep as i watched him didnt he see you looking in asked bets no i think hes almost blind said larry he had to feel for the chairs as if he couldnt really see them funny wasnt it yes very queer said pip i wonder what he was feeling all over the chairs for do you suppose he had got something hidden in one of them money perhaps possibly he might be afraid of robbers and have hidden his little hoard somewhere odd that he considered safe said fatty well its a peculiar story larry and its a good thing you werent a real windowcleaner a dishonest one might easily have guessed what the old man was doing making sure his savings were still safe i stripped off my dungarees in the bushes cleaned myself up a bit with the leather and went home said larry id really rather work on a real mystery than do all this pretend shadowing and disguising and windowcleaning it doesnt really lead to anything but larry was wrong quite wrong it led to quite a lot of things it led in fact to a really firstclass mystery where is buster for the next day or two fatty kept a sharp eye on buster wondering if the skinny little boy would really try to kidnap him but there seemed to be no sign of bert and then one evening buster disappeared fatty had gone out on his bicycle with the others to the cinema and had left buster safely in the kitchen with the cook who was very fond of him when he came back he sat down and finished a book he was reading and it wasnt until he had finished it that he realised that buster had not come scampering to be with him as usual he went to the door and shouted buster where are you it was halfpast ten cook and jane had gone to bed his mother and father were out playing bridge and the house was very quiet buster where are you yelled fatty again a voice came from upstairs oh master frederick is that you shouting you did give me a start isnt buster with you he wanted to go out at halfpast nine and we thought he heard you coming in to put your bicycle away so we let him out didnt you see him no jane i havent seen him since ive been in said fatty where on earth can he be ill open the front door and yell he stood at the front door and shouted buster buster but no buster came fatty was puzzled where could he have gone well perhaps he would come in when his mother and father came back but buster didnt it was a very worried fatty who greeted his parents when they came in at twelve oclock frederick why arent you in bed began his mother its midnight have you seen buster said fatty you havent gosh then where can he be hes probably gone to visit one of his friends and forgotten the tune like you do sometimes said his father get to bed now buster will be back in the morning barking outside at six oclock and waking us all there was nothing for it but to go to bed fatty undressed and got between the sheets but he couldnt help remembering the whispered conversation he had heard in goons little hall and berts mean little face had bert somehow got hold of buster buster didnt come barking at the front door in the morning he hadnt even appeared by breakfasttime fatty was by now quite certain that somehow or other the skinny little boy had managed to get hold of the little scottie he went out into the garden to investigate perhaps he could find something to explain busters disappearance he did find something he found a small bit of liver attached to a short piece of string fatty pounced on it frowning fiercely thats it that little beast bert must have come along with some liver tied it on a bit of string and drawn it along for buster to follow him and old buster leapt at it and got the liver and chewed the string in half then he must have followed bert and probably more liver till bert managed to slip a lead on him and take him off he threw the bit of liver away and went indoors angrily the telephone bell rang as he walked into the hall his father was there and took up the receiver hallo yes this is mr trotteville speaking whos that mr goon whats that do speak up please i can only hear a mumble there was a short silence fatty stood nearby listening mr goon now what was this i cant believe it said mr trotteville into the telephone buster has never chased a thing in his life except your ankles all right come and see me i dont believe it he put the receiver down and faced fatty that fellow goon says your dog buster was caught redhanded last night chasing sheep it couldnt have been buster said fatty it must be some other dog he says hes got buster in his shed now said mr trotteville hell be shot you know if this is true where was he last night someone came and enticed him away said fatty someone whos told a lie about buster who says they saw him chasing sheep a boy called bert mickle said his father goon says this boy was out walking in the fields last night and actually saw buster worrying the sheep he managed to catch him and slipped a rope under his collar he took him to mr goons but the policeman was out so the boy locked the dog into the shed there and hes there still now what are we to do its an absolute untruth said fatty looking rather white its a plan laid between them ill pay goon out for this whens he coming dad in half an hours time said mr trotteville ill have to see him i cant bear the sight of him fatty disappeared he knew quite certainly that buster had not been chasing sheep he also knew that the horrid little bert had told a lot of lies and he was sure that goon knew it and buster might be shot because of all that fatty raced down to his shed he put on a red wig inserted some false plastic teeth in front of ms own and dressed himself in an old suit with a butcherboys blueandwhite apron in front then he jumped on his bicycle and rode off down to goons house he stood whistling on the pavement opposite apparently reading a comic with great interest but all the time he was watching for goon to come out goon came at last and wheeled his bicycle out of the front gate he looked exceedingly pleased with himself and hummed a little tune as he rode off the butcherboy opposite scowled and folded up his comic leaving his bicycle beside the kerb he crossed the road and went round to the back of goons house he glanced at the shed in the garden a subdued but angry barking came from it then a scraping at the door fatty bit his lip that was buster all right he knocked at the back door mrs mickle came wiping her hands on her apron as usual youre wanted up at home mrs mickle said fatty message to say youre to go at once oh dear oh dear i hope my mothers not been taken ill again said mrs mickle bert im wanted up at home youd better keep on here till i come back mr goons out bert had better go with you said fatty firmly he wanted them both out of the way as quickly as possible no im staying here said bert thinking of the tarts and buns he could take out of the larder with both mr goon and his mother out of the house that was that bert was not going to move fatty could see all right he would make him mrs mickle took off her apron and fled up the street bert stood at the front door and watched her go fatty nipped in at the back door and hid himself in a cupboard outside the kitchen bert came back having shut the halldoor he whistled ha now for the larder fatty heard him go into the kitchen and open the larder door it creaked fatty peeped out of the cupboard a hollow voice suddenly spoke behind bert beware your sins will find you out beware bert turned round in a hurry there was nobody in the kitchen at all he stood there trembling a small jamtart in one hand who took that dog away last night said another voice which seemed to come from behind the kitchen door who took him away dont dont cried poor bert and the jamtart fell from his hand i took him i took him who is talking to me a loud growling came from another corner and bert yelled he looked round for the dog but couldnt see one then a loud meowing began meeeow meeeow but no cat was to be seen bert began to howl and tears poured down his cheeks mum he cried mum but mum was far away up the street fatty began again who told a lie who took that dog away ill tell the truth i will i will sobbed bert im a bad boy i am beware said the deep hollow voice again it was too much for bert he fled into the hall and out of the front door leaving it open as he went fatty heard the scampering of his feet and grinned so much for bert served him right trying to get an innocent dog shot fatty went to the garden shed he had with him a bunch of keys that he had seen hanging from a hook on the kitchen dresser one of them unlocked the shed buster flew at him barking in delight he careered round fatty and fatty picked him up and squeezed him till the little scottie had no breath left in his body he licked fattys face vigorously then fatty suddenly caught sight of something mr goons enormous black cat sitting high up on a wall watching buster out of sleepy insolent eyes he knew he was too high up for any dog to catch an idea came to fatty just half a minute buster old fellow he said and put the scottie inside the house shutting the kitchen door on him then he went to the great tomcat he stroked it and murmured flattering things into its prickedup ears it purred loudly most animals loved fatty it allowed him to lift it off the wall and fondle it he walked with it to the shed and took it inside he set it down on a sack that had evidently been placed there for buster and stroked it then he went swiftly to the door shut it locked it and took the keys back to the kitchen buster had been frantically scraping at the door trying to get to fatty fatty picked him up and went out of goons house across the road to his bicycle he put buster in the basket and rode off whistling shrilly like an errandboy thinking happy thoughts all right mr goon you can take my father down to see buster in the shed threaten to have him shot youll find nothing there but your own black tomcat fatty grinned at his thoughts and buster yapped happily in the basket why had he been shut up like that he didnt know but nothing mattered now he was with fatty and busters world was cheerful and happy once more fatty shot in at his sidegate and cycled down to his shed he tore off his errandboy things then he shut buster up in the shed with many apologies and went back to the house was mr goon still there well he could say what he liked buster was safe mr goon gets a shock mr goon had been at fattys house for about five minutes and was thoroughly enjoying himself he knew that neither mr nor mrs trotteville liked him and it was pleasant to mr goon to bring them such bad news about buster fatty sauntered into the room and mr goon looked at him triumphantly morning mr goon said fatty lovely april day isnt it got any mystery in the offing yet ive come about that there dog of yours said mr goon almost joyfully been caught chasing sheep again rubbish said fatty briskly never chased one in his life ive got evidence said goon going slightly purple and ive got the dog too see locked up in my shed i dont believe it said fatty ill have to see the dog first before i believe its old buster hes not the dog in your shed ill be bound mr trotteville looked at fatty in surprise fatty winked at him his father heaved a sigh of relief he had no idea what fatty was up to but he began to feel that somehow somewhere goon was not going to get away with this tale about buster goon went very purple indeed he turned to mr trotteville if youll be so good sir as to come along with me and identify the dog it would be a great help he said master frederick had better come too after all its his dog ill come all right said fatty you coming too dad yes ill get the car out said his father still puzzled over fattys attitude you can come with me frederick you cycle off goon and well be there as soon as you are mr trotteville went to get the car goon disappeared on his bicycle purple but still triumphant fatty went to the telephone oh is that mrs hilton good morning please may i speak to pip shant keep him a minute pip was fetched fatty spoke to him urgently pip listen no time for explanations i want you to do something for me right said pips voice sounding excited i say is this a mystery starting up no nothing like that listen now i want you to come up here quickly unlock my shed get old buster out of it and bring him down to goons house put him on a lead dont come into goons just wait outside till i come out tell you everything then click fatty put down the receiver he rubbed his hands and grinned aha mr goon you are going to be very very surprised he got into the car beside his father who glanced at him sideways i gather frederick he said that you are quite happy about this buster affair now but you possibly do not want to tell me why how right you are dad said fatty cheerfully ill just tell you this goon played a very dirty trick but its not going to come off there was silence after that mr trotteville drove straight to goons house and the two of them got out goon himself had just arrived and was astonished to find the house completely empty no mrs mickle no bert mr trotteville and fatty went in at the front door and at the very same moment mrs mickle and bert arrived at the back berts eyes were red and he looked frightened mrs mickle was in a rage she spoke to mr goon im sorry to have left the house so suddenlike mr goon but that dratted boy of the butchers came along and told me i was wanted at home so i left bert here in charge and rushed home and i wasnt wanted after all just wait till i get that butchers boy bert gave a sudden sniff mrs mickle looked at him in disgust and bert who i left here just to stay till you were back sir he come racing home howling like i dont know what scared of being left in your place alone and telling such tales as i never heard the like of in my life mr trotteville this is the boy who caught buster chasing sheep last night said goon i never said bert suddenly and burst into tears i never i never bert how can you tell stories like that said his mother why you stood there and told mr goon all about it this morning i heard you i never i never i never said bert and sniffled again hes a bit nervous i expect said goon surprised and most displeased you caught the dog yourself didnt you bert i never said bert who seemed quite incapable of saying anything else goon gave it up well the dogs in the shed and its the very dog bert brought in and put there himself i never said bert making mr goon long to box his ears the big policeman strode out through the kitchen and into the garden taking with him the keys of the shed he inserted one into the lock and flung the door open expecting buster to rush out and declare himself but no dog arrived instead mr goons extremely large black cat strolled out haughtily sat down outside the shed and began to wash himself goons eyes nearly fell out of his head fatty gave a roar of laughter and bert howled in fright bert had put buster into the shed and to see the black cat come out instead of the dog was quite terrifying to poor bert i never i never i never he sobbed and hid his face in his mothers apron goons mouth opened and shut like a goldfishs and he couldnt say a word the cat went on washing itself and bert went on howling well mr goon if its a cat that was shut into this shed and not buster i really dont think its worthwhile our wasting our time with you any more said mr trotteville sounding quite disgusted did you say that you yourself saw the dog that was put into the shed goon hadnt seen buster he had been out when bert arrived with the dog and he had just taken berts word for it now he didnt know whether bert had shut up a dog or the cat he glared at the boy as if he could bite him bert howled afresh he put his hand in his pocket and took out half a crown he held it out to goon here you are ive been wicked heres the halfcrown you gave me mr goon ill never go after dogs again for you well i think weve heard enough said mr trotteville coldly goon you deserve to be reported for all this ive a good mind to do so come on frederick but but i dont understand it said goon his eyes popping out of his head why i heard that dog barking in the shed i tell you hark isnt that him barking now it was pip was walking up and down outside with buster on the lead and buster had recognized mr trottevilles car parked nearby he was barking his head off in delight they all went to the front door and poor goon nearly fainted when he saw buster buster himself pulling on pips lead and barking frantically hallo pip said fatty in a very ordinary voice thanks for taking buster for a walk slip him off the lead will you no no dont said goon finding his voice suddenly wait till im indoors he shot into the house and slammed the door fatty grinned at his father i should like to know how the cat took the place of the dog murmured mr trotteville getting into the car with fatty and buster pip got in too puzzled but grinning all over his face tell you when we get home said fatty my word i wouldnt like to be young bert right now young bert was indeed having a bad time mrs mickle was crying bert was howling and goon felt rather like howling himself he felt a fool an idiot to bring that highandmighty mr trotteville down to show him a dog locked up in his shed and then his own black cat walked out gah bert told a peculiar tale of voices in every comer when he had been left alone in the house goon looked round uneasily voices what did bert mean he suddenly remembered fattys ability to throw his voice just like any ventriloquist could fatty have been here no impossible the more goon thought about it the more impossible everything seemed he looked at bert with so much dislike that the skinny little boy decided hed slip off home what with his mum cross with him and mr goon looking as if hed like to eat him up and those voices he had heard life wasnt worth living so bert slipped off home i think pip and i will get out of the car and have an icecream dad said fatty to his father as they drove down the main street i somehow feel like one you can have one too buster right said his father and stopped im glad busters all right frederick ill hear all about it later fatty and pip got out with buster i say do tell me whats been happening said pip come in here and ill tell you said fatty goon tried to play a very dirty trick and it didnt come off come along and over three icecreams fatty told the horrified pip the dreadful story of how buster had nearly been shot for doing something he hadnt done pip almost choked over his icecream look theres larry and daisy and bets said pip suddenly lets have them in and tell them too but it turned out that the other three had already had icecreams and were now on their way to fetch something larry left the leather behind in the garden of that bungalow whose windows he cleaned the other day explained daisy and mothers been hunting for it everywhere so we thought wed better go and find it in the bushes its sure to be there still well all come and then you can come back home with me and ill tell you a most peculiar tale said fatty most peculiar isnt it buster not a mystery is it asked bets hopefully as they all went along together fatty shook his head theres not even the smell of a one he said look isnt this the place larry that little bungalow there yes said larry and went into the garden he came back quite quickly looking rather scared i say theres somebody shouting like anything in that bungalow it sounds as if theyre yelling police police police really come on well see whats up said fatty and they all trooped in at the gate fatty went to the door it was shut from within came a curious croaking shout police police fetch the police whatever can be the matter said fatty id better go in and see the old man in the bungalow the five children and buster went up the path the front door was shut fatty went to look in at one of the windows and the others followed green curtains were drawn back to let the light into the room in the middle of the room sat an old man in a small armchair he was beating on the arms and shouting police police fetch the police its the old man i saw when i cleaned the windows said larry whats the matter with him why does he want the police they all looked at the old fellow he had on a dressinggown over pyjamas and a nightcap that had slipped to one side of his bald head he had a small beard on his chin and a scarf tied loosely round his neck by the stove stood a wheelchair with a rug halffalling off it and on a shelf nearby was a small portable radio within reach of the old mans hand the children could hear it playing loudly somethings upset the old fellow said fatty lets try the door and see if its unlocked they went back to the door and fatty turned the handle the door opened at once they all went in buster too the old man neither heard nor saw them he still sat in the chair beating its arms and wailing for the police fatty touched him on the arm and the old fellow jumped he stopped shouting and blinked up at fatty with watery eyes he put out his hand and felt along fattys coat who is it is it the police who are you im someone who heard you shouting and came to see what was the matter said fatty speaking loudly can we help you what has happened it was clear that the old man could hardly see he peered round at the others and drew his dressinggown around him he began to shiver look you get back to the fire said fatty id take one arm larry you take the other the old fellow has had a shock of some kind hes trembling turn off that radio bets the old man made no objection to being helped to his own chair he sat down in it with a sigh and let daisy arrange his cushions and rug he peered at them again who are you all fetch the police i say he said and his voice quavered as he spoke do tell us whats the matter said daisy but he couldnt hear her and she repeated the question loudly matter matter enough my moneys gone he said and his voice rose to a howl all my money now whats to happen to me how do you know its gone said fatty loudly didnt you keep it in the bank or the postoffice banks i dont trust banks wailed the old fellow i hid it where nobody could find it now its gone where did you hide it asked larry what whats that said the old man cupping his hand over his ear speak up i said where did you hide it repeated larry a sly look came over the old fellows face he shook his head i shant tell you no thats my secret it was hidden where nobody could find it but now its gone tell us where you hid it and well have a good look for ourselves said daisy loudly but the old man shook his head more vigorously than ever you get the police he said i want the police two hundred pounds thats whats gone all my savings the police will get it back for me you get the police fatty didnt in the least want to go and find mr goon goon would turn them all out and not let them help at all he would be bossy and domineering and a perfect nuisance when did you miss the money he asked the old man just now he said about ten minutes ago i looked for it and it was gone oh im a poor old man and people have robbed me get the police we will said fatty comfortingly just tell us when you last saw the money do you remember course i remember said the old fellow pulling his nightcap straight but i didnt see it im nearly blind i felt it it was there all right when was that asked fatty patiently last night said the old man about midnight i reckon i was in bed and i couldnt sleep and i sat up and worried about my money you see im all alone here since my daughters gone away well i got out of bed and i came in here and i felt for my money it was there all right i see said fatty so somebody must have taken it between then and now has anyone been to see you this morning yes yes of course he said but im muddled now i misremember who came except my granddaughter of course she comes every day and cleans round shes a good girl and the grocer came but i misremember you get the police theyll find my money for me a big tear fell from one eye and rolled down his cheek bets felt very sorry for him poor old man all alone and worried about his money where could it be had it really been stolen or had he just forgotten where he had put it if only he would tell them well have to tell goon said fatty to the others its a pity we might have been able to clear this up ourselves if wed had a chance the five children suddenly heard footsteps coming up the path who was it there was a loud knock at the door then the handle turned and a man walked in he stared in surprise at the children buster barked loudly hallo said the man he was young and smartly dressed who are you are you visiting my greatuncle hallo uncle how are you oh wilfrid is it you said the old man putting out a hand as if to find out where wilfrid was wilfrid my moneys gone what gone what do you mean asked wilfrid didnt i tell you somebody would rob you if you didnt let me put it into the bank for you its gone its gone said his uncle rocking himself to and fro where did you keep it asked wilfrid looking all round i bet its not gone uncle youve forgotten where you hid it maybe up the chimney or under a floorboard im not telling anyone said the old man i want the police im tired i want my money and i want the police well go and telephone for the police if you like fatty offered i see there are telephone wires leading next door i expect theyd let me use the phone what are you doing here anyway said wilfrid suddenly nothing we just heard the old man calling said fatty thinking it better not to say that larry had gone to find the leather he had left behind in the bushes and had heard the old man shouting as he passed the bungalow anyway well go and telephone now the police will be up in a few minutes im sure goodbye said bets to the old man but he didnt hear her he was moaning softly to himself my money now what shall i do all gone all gone the five of them went out with buster they went down the path and walked beside the fence till they came to greentrees they went up the path to the blue front door fatty rang the bell a pleasantfaced woman answered it she looked very french and fatty decided that she must be the sister whose house the bundledup man had tried so hard to find excuse me said fatty politely do you think i might use your telephone the old man in the bungalow next door has been robbed and we want to tell the police the woman looked startled a robbery next door oh the poor old man yes come in and use my telephone it is in this room here she spoke english extremely well but had a slight accent which was rather pleasant she was very like her brother dark and plump she took them into a room off the hall a couch stood by the window and a man lay on it coughing he turned as they came in henri these children want to use the telephone said the woman you do not mind enter i pray you said the man and then stared ah he said zeese children i have seen before nestcepas yes said fatty we guided you to greentrees you remember yes grintriss said the man with a smile he looked quite different now without his bulky overcoat scarf and pulleddown hat younger and pleasanter he coughed you will pardon me if i lie here i am not so well of course said fatty i hope you dont mind our coming here like this but the old fellow next door has been robbed of his money or so he says and we want to tell the police fatty took up the receiver of the telephone police station he said a loud sharp voice answered pc goon here whos calling er frederick trotteville said fatty i just wanted to tell you that there was a loud snort from the other end and a crash goon had put down his receiver in a temper fatty was astonished gosh i got goon and as soon as i began to speak to him he crashed back the receiver said fatty i suppose hes still furious about buster well ill try again he got the police station once more and again goons voice answered look here mr goon said fatty will you go to the bungalow called hollies in holly lane theres been a robbery there any more of your nonsense and id report you to headquarters snapped goon im not going out on any wildgoosechase and have you come back here and shut my cat up in the shed again ho yes i mr goon listen shouted fatty this isnt a joke its crash goon had put down his receiver again fatty put down his and stared in comical dismay at the others goons mad he thinks im spoofing him what shall we do ring up superintendent jenks suggested daisy its the only thing to do fatty i will said fatty itll serve goon right goon takes charge fatty rang through to police headquarters in the next town and asked for superintendent jenks hes out said a voice who wants him er this is frederick trotteville said fatty wishing the superintendent was in i just wanted to say that a robbery has been committed at a bungalow called hollies in holly lane peterswood and the old man whos been robbed asked me to tell the police you want to ring up peterswood police then said the voice i have said fatty i er i cant seem to get hold of them perhaps you could ring through to tell them right said the voice robbery hollies holly lane peterswood and your name is frederick trotteville said fatty ah yes i know friend of the super arent you said the voice in a more friendly tone right sir leave it to me and so once more the telephone rang at goons house and once more he answered it snatching it up angrily sure that it was fatty again hallo hallo whos that he barked a surprised voice answered this is headquarters is that pc goon a boy called frederick trotteville has just pah said goon unable to help himself what did you say said the voice still more surprised nothing just coughed said goon what about this here boy he reports a robbery at the bungalow called hollies holly lane in your area said the voice goons mouth fell open so fatty hadnt been trying to spoof him there really had been a robbery what a pest of a boy playing tricks on him and bert and the cat and getting away with buster and now finding a robbery what a toad of a boy are you there said the voice impatiently have you got what i said er yes yes said goon scribbling down a few notes thanks all right ill go right along youd better said the voice puzzled and annoyed there was a click goon stared at the telephone and clicked back his receiver too now hed get a rap on the knuckles for making fatty ring headquarters why hadnt he listened to him when he telephoned he got out his bicycle and yelled to mrs mickle be back in half an hour i expect have my dinner ready this is an urgent job the five children had not left greentrees by the time goon cycled up they were talking to the frenchman whose name turned out to be henri crazier they told him all about the old fellow next door i can see the front gate and front path of the bungalow from my couch said henri i got my sister to put the couch here because its a pleasant view and i can see people who come and go down the road they all looked out of the window you must have seen us going in then said fatty did you oh yes said henri first i saw zis boy what does he call himself larry he went in and up the path and then he came running back to you and you all went up the path and in at the frontdoor larry went red he hoped to goodness that henri wasnt going to ask him why he had first gone in at the gate it wouldnt be at all easy to explain how it was that he had left a windowleather in the bushes fortunately his sister came bustling in just then her name was mrs harris and her husband who was away was english she carried a box of french chocolates very rich and creamy oh thanks said daisy and took one they all helped themselves and then there came a sudden exclamation from henri see the police have arrived sure enough mr goon was wheeling his bicycle up the front path next door the door opened as he came and the young man wilfrid appeared he said something to goon and they both disappeared into the bungalow well now perhaps the old man will be happy said fatty my word what super chocolate we dont get chocolates like that here mrs harris wed better go said pip looking at his watch do you know its almost one oclock good gracious mother said we must be back by five to buck up bets the five said goodbye to henri and his sister you will come again said the sister henri is so bored he has been very ill and now he comes to me to how do you call it to convalesce come and see him again thank you we will said fatty hoping fervently that mr goon would not also take it into his head to go and see henri and his sister and ask them if they had noticed visitors at the bungalow that morning it might be very awkward to explain larrys visit there an hour or so before blow that windowleather and yet if larry hadnt gone to find it he wouldnt have heard the old man shouting gosh i never got mothers windowleather after all said larry what an idiot i am ill slip in and get it now no you wont said fatty firmly youll leave it there we dont want goon to come rushing out and asking you what youre doing you can get it when goons not there they all went home fatty was thinking hard why wouldnt the old man say where he had hidden his money it was silly of him because he might have made a mistake when he hunted for it it might quite well still be in the bungalow in some place he had forgotten larry said that the old fellow was crawling about feeling under the furniture the day he went to clean the windows thought fatty why feel so much of the furniture did he sometimes put the money in one place and sometimes in another or perhaps he divided it up it might be in notes and put in several places thats quite likely well its not a real mystery only an ordinary robbery goon will soon find the robber hes only got to get a list of the people who visited the bungalow this morning and weed them out that afternoon goon arrived at fattys house he asked for fatty and jane showed him into the study that fat policeman wants you master frederick said jane when she found fatty i hope buster hasnt got into trouble again wuff said buster and danced round jane fatty debated whether to take the little scottie into the study with him or not he thought he would it might keep goon in his place so in marched fatty with buster at his heels goon was standing at the window frowning he was feeling angry about a lot of things he was angrier still when he felt buster sniffing at his heels come here buster said fatty oh wont you sit down mr goon anything i can do for you goon swung round eyeing buster balefully that dog had that tiresome bert locked him up the shed the night before or hadnt he he couldnt get a word out of bert now goon sat down heavily and took out his bulky notebook ive come about the robbery he said well tm not guilty said fatty smoothly i do assure you i i know youre not guilty said goon looking as if he wished fatty were what i want to know is how did you come to be around there just when the old man was yelling blue murder he wasnt corrected fatty he was yelling for the police pah said goon you know what i mean seems a funny thing to me the way you kids are always about when anything happens snooping round prying interfering with the law if thats all youve come to tell me you might as well say goodbye said fatty getting up i mean i can easily bike over to the superintendent this afternoon and tell him everything i dont want to interfere with the law i want to help it we couldnt help being there just at that moment well good morning mr goon goon looked extremely startled now you sit down he said trying to speak pleasantly im only just saying what a remarkable thing it is that you always seem to be around when these things happen nothing wrong in saying that is there you mentioned something about snooping and prying said fatty ah well im a bit upsetlike said mr goon taking out an enormous handkerchief and wiping his forehead with it lets forget it i dont want to interview you but the laws the law its the last thing i want to do today see you again but ive got to ask you a few questions seeing as you and the others were the first on the spot so to speak ask away said fatty but dont be too verbose ive got plenty to do goon wondered what verbose meant something rude hed be bound he determined to look it up in the dictionary when he got back verbose he began to ask fatty a few routine questions what time had fatty and the others been there anyone about anything disarranged in the livingroom what had the old man said fatty answered shortly and truthfully thankful that goon had no suspicion that they had actually gone to the bungalow garden to fetch something goon imagined that they had been out for a walk and had heard the old mans yells as they passed thats all said goon at last fatty thought that he had asked the questions very well he had left nothing out that might be useful goon looked at fatty er i suppose youve got your own ideas about this already he said oh yes said fatty ive no doubt it will be quite easy to find the robber didnt the old man give you a list of the people who had been to visit him this morning well he seemed so muddled said goon he might have been remembering yesterdays visitors hes old and forgetful i wouldnt be surprised if that money isnt still there somewhere er hm what do you think about it all fatty wasnt going to give goon any help at all he remembered how goon had given bert half a crown to catch buster he got up suddenly not wanting to look at the fat policeman any more good morning he said to goon and showed him out very firmly let goon find out what he could fatty didnt mean to help him tea at pips the five met that day in pips playroom at halfpast three mrs hilton had said they might all go to tea and had sent pip and bets out to buy cakes from the bakers they had staggered in with baskets full and had arranged all the goodies themselves on big dishes they were set on the table ready for tea why do you put them under our noses like this groaned daisy look at those macaroons all goey and luscious what a frightful temptation and look at that gingerbread cake and that fruit cake said larry we never seem to have such nice teas as you do pip oh its only when people come to tea that mother goes a splash like this said pip buster youve got your favourite titbit dogbiscuits spread with potted meat sniff buster sniffed shot out a pink tongue and the biscuit disappeared with one crunch oh buster manners manners said fatty you dont see your master doing things like that do you everyone laughed pip got out some cards and shuffled them fatty told them of goons visit to him that afternoon how you could bear to be polite to him when you knew he had planned to have buster shot i dont know said pip well i wasnt awfully polite actually admitted fatty also i was a bit afraid hed ask why we were there i wish to goodness youd taken away that windowleather larry i wouldnt put it past old goon to snoop round the garden and find it blow said larry mother keeps on asking about it i really must get it soon i would have bought a new one but when daisy and i looked in the ironmongers shop this afternoon the big ones were about fifteen shillings fifteen shillings i call that wicked ill get it from the bungalow garden for you said fatty you mustnt go bursting in at the garden gate in full daylight and come out waving a windowleather ill go tonight and get it when its dark i shouldnt have gone in daylight anyhow said larry a little offended im not quite an idiot but id be glad if you got it for me actually because its difficult for me to slip out at night its easy for you you can always say youre taking buster for a walk i usually do take him for a run last thing at night said fatty ill go tonight and ill bring the leather here to you tomorrow are we going to go and see that old man again asked daisy are we going to treat this as a mystery a rather small one i know and try to find out who the robber is or are we going to let goon get on with it and not bother about it at all ourselves well i dont actually think theres much mystery said fatty either the money is still there hidden and the old fellow has forgotten where or someones taken it who knew it was hidden if so it can only be one of his relatives i should think quite a straightforward case anyway i somehow dont want to have anything more to do with goon after this buster business i just cant bear the sight of him right then we dont count this as a mystery said daisy well just go on hoping what i was going to say was that the person who would really know who visited the old man this morning would be that frenchman mr henri he lies on that couch and watches everyone who passes and he has a jolly good view of the bungalows front door yes youre right said fatty he would be the first one wed ask for a bit of information but i think well leave this to goon to tell you the truth im a bit afraid of somebody asking about a windowcleaner somebody may have spotted larry and wed look rather foolish if it came out about his cleaning the windows i always thought it was rather a silly thing to ask me to do said larry i said so at the time well maybe it was a bit mad said fatty well forget it come on whose deal is it well just have time for a game before tea they had a hilarious game and an even more hilarious tea during the game buster discovered that by sitting on a chair he could reach his plate of pottedmeat biscuits and he devoured every one of them without being noticed he then quietly jumped down and went and lay by bets isnt he good and quiet today said bets patting him hes usually too silly for words when we play cards and dont take any notice of him last time he smacked all my cards out of my hand i remember didnt you buster wuff said buster in a quiet voice he was beginning to feel very guilty larry tickled him buster didnt jump up and caper round as he usually did he just let larry tickle him larry looked at him closely why dont you wag your tail he said i say dont you think busters gone rather quiet buster old fellow whats up busters tail remained quite still without a wag bets looked at him in alarm he cant be feeling well buster good dog stand up buster and wag your tail buster stood up looking the picture of misery head down and tail down what a fuss the children made of him he was patted and petted stroked and fondled ought we to take him to the vet said bets fatty do you think anythings wrong well try him with one of his favourite pottedmeat biscuits said fatty getting up he saw the empty plate at once buster you greedy pig how dare you show such bad manners when i take you out to tea im ashamed of you go to the corner oh whats he done cried bets as poor buster walked to the nearest corner and sat there face to the wall eaten every single one of his biscuits whilst we werent looking said fatty i never heard a single crunch did you bad dog buster no bets youre not to go to him look at the plate next to his biscuits too it looks as if buster has been taking a few licks at that macaroon well id rather he was naughty than ill said bets making up her mind to slip buster a bit of macaroon at teatime oh buster what a thing to do buster made a moaning sound and hung his head still more take no notice of him said fatty another word from us and hell burst into tears it wouldnt matter hed lick them all up said bets thats the best of being a dog if you upset a dish you can always lick up the mess now dont even mention busters name said fatty firmly hes in disgrace come on its my turn to play buster had to remain in the corner while the five children had their own tea bets spilt some runny strawberry jam on the clean tablecloth get something to wipe it said pip you really are a messer bets im a dog im going to lick it up said bets and she did which made them all laugh tea became more and more hilarious until pip laughed so much that he fell off his chair and pulled a plate of cakeslices on top of him the door opened and mrs hilton looked in what was that crash she said is anybody hurt oh pip what are you doing on the floor with cakes all over you please get up remember you are the host be hostly pip said bets and pip began to laugh again buster came out of his corner hopefully when he saw the pieces of cake on the floor no buster the floor is perfectly clean and we can eat the slices ourselves thank you said pip has mother gone oh dear i really must be hostly shall we let buster stay out of his corner im sure he must be very sorry now so much to busters joy he was allowed to join the others again and was so pleased to be in favour that he went round licking everyone in all the bare places he could find really we need a towel said daisy thats the third time youve licked my knees buster theyre dripping with lick the evening went too quickly fatty exclaimed when he looked at the playroom clock whew almost seven oclock you have your supper at seven dont you pip gosh yes and weve got to go and wash and get tidy said pip scrambling up sorry to rush you off but you know what our households like everything on the dot the gong will go in a minute see yourselves out will you fatty larry daisy and buster went downstairs quietly and out of the garden door it was getting dark its a pity we havent a mystery on hand said larry lighting his bicycle lamp i feel like one somehow its nice when weve got our teeth into a good juicy mystery well one may turn up at any time said fatty your lamp all right daisy goodbye then well see each other sometime tomorrow they all cycled off parting at the corner fatty yawned he had slept very little the night before because he had been so worried about buster he felt very sleepy now ill go to bed early he thought ill take a book and read ill soon be asleep so much to his parents surprise for fatty was usually rather a late bird he went up to bed about a quarter to nine with buster at his heels he had a bath and was soon settled into bed he opened his book and read a page or two and then before he had even turned out his light he was fast asleep halfpast nine struck ten oclock halfpast ten eleven everyone in the house was now in bed and fattys light was the only one left on buster lay quiet for some time then he stirred why hadnt fatty taken him out for a run he leapt on the bed and woke fatty up with a jump gosh its you you little wretch said fatty sitting up suddenly i thought you were a burglar or something whats the time almost halfpast eleven now dont say you want a walk at this hour because you wont get one im going to turn out the light see it was just as he switched off his lamp that fatty remembered something blow blow blow i never went to get that horrible windowleather blow he thought about it well he must go and get it he had promised larry and anyway it was important he swung his feet out of bed and dressed hurriedly well be back soon he said to buster well only be a few minutes but he wasnt back soon fatty had a most peculiar midnight adventure strange happenings fatty went cautiously down the stairs with buster buster always knew when he had to be quiet he almost held his breath as he padded downstairs at fattys heels out of the garden door buster whispered fatty and buster led the way down the sidepassage fatty unlocked and unbolted the door quietly and closed it again he locked it behind him then he and buster made their way to the backgate and slipped out into the road buster liked this it was exciting to be all alone with fatty late at night smells seemed much stronger than in the daytime shadows were more exciting buster jumped up and gave fattys hand a small lick were going to that bungalow called hollies fatty told him got to collect something for larry if i cant find it youll have to sniff about for it buster wuff said buster happily and ran on ahead up this way down that round a corner and by a lamppost the streetlights went off at twelve soon it would be midnight and then there would not be even a lamp to break the darkness it was a very cloudy night and the clouds were low and thick fatty felt a spot of rain he put his hand in his pocket to make sure he had his torch between the lampposts the way was very dark yes his torch was there good ill need it when i creep into the bungalow garden thought fatty ill never find larrys leather without a light he came to the turning into holly lane the street lamps suddenly went out twelve oclock fatty got out his torch he simply couldnt see a step in front of him without it on this dark night he came to the front gate of the little bungalow it was all in darkness fatty stood and listened not a sound could be heard he could go and search in safety he opened the front gate shut it softly and went up the path with buster he turned off to the side of the bungalow and went into the little thicket of bushes there he switched on his torch and began to hunt around he couldnt see the windowleather anywhere blow larry he came up against a fence the fence that separated the bungalow garden from the one belonging to mr henris sister he stood and considered the matter could the wind possibly have blown the leather over the fence he wondered no leathers are such heavy things when wet as larrys was on the other hand the wind might have dried it and it would then become dry and light the wind might take it then there has been quite a breeze fatty climbed over the fence torch in hand he hunted all about the garden there it was very much tidier than the garden of hollies he began to get into a panic where was this tiresome leather surely goon hadnt found it he heard a noise and switched off his torch it was the sound of a carengine coming up the road fatty thought he would wait for the car to pass and then have one more look but the car didnt pass it seemed to stop quite nearby fatty frowned why didnt the car go through some gateway and on into its own garage so late at night then he remembered that there was a doctors house opposite possibly the doctor had come home for something and gone into his house for it he would come back in a few minutes and drive off again to a patient so fatty crouched under a bush and waited with buster by his side the cars engine had been turned off fatty could hear no footsteps at all but he suddenly thought he could hear a bump or two and surely that was somebody panting he was puzzled it all sounded rather nearer than the doctors house surely the car wasnt outside hollies if so what was going on fatty crept back to the fence that separated the two gardens he climbed over it cautiously lifting buster up too and putting him down in the bungalow garden ssh buster he whispered quiet now buster froze still he gave a tiny growl as if to say funny goingson somewhere then was quite quiet fatty crept between the bushes and stopped suddenly he could see a torch bobbing along about two feet above the front path somebody was there carrying it somebody who was panting hard somebody who wore rubbersoled shoes too for not a footstep could be heard fatty suddenly heard a whisper so there were two people then who were they and what in the world were they doing surely they werent kidnapping the old man fatty frowned he had better find out about that poor fellow he slept in the back room of the bungalow that was where larry had seen his bed if i slip round to the back and shine my torch in at the window i could perhaps see if the old man is there or not he thought so he crept round the bushes once more and came to the back of the little bungalow the window was open fatty was just about to shine his torch through the opening when he heard a noise someone was snoring snoring very loudly indeed the old man was safe then fatty stood and listened for a while and then made his way back into the bushes he really must see what was up he heard the sound of the front door closing very quietly he heard a tiny little cough but he caught no sound of footsteps going down to the gate he stood and listened his ears straining for the slightest noise he heard another door being shut the door of the car perhaps yes that was it then the carengine started up suddenly and began to throb almost at once the car moved off down the road fatty leapt to the front fence and shone his torch on it he saw only a dark shadow as the car drove away his torch could not even pick out the number what a peculiar business thought fatty what did those fellows come to fetch or perhaps they brought something ill go and peep in at the front windows but thick curtains of some green material stretched across the front windows with not a crack between them to shine his light through fatty went to the front door and tried it no that was now locked it was all most mysterious what were the midnight visitors doing in the bungalow fatty went to the back and took another look through the window this time he shone his torch on the old man yes there he was on his bed fast asleep his nightcap all crooked beside him was a plain chair and a small table there didnt seem to be anything else in the room at all fatty switched off his torch and went round to the front he was puzzled to know what to do for the best he didnt like to wake the old man he would be sure to be in a terrible fright if fatty awoke him suddenly and how was fatty to explain to him about the midnight visitors the old man would be so terrified that he wouldnt go to sleep again it will have to wait till morning said fatty to himself im not going to ring up goon for one thing he wouldnt believe me for another thing there may be a simple explanation and for a third thing i cant see that it will matter waiting till morning so he went off with buster at his heels puzzled and halfdoubtful about leaving the old man all by himself with midnight visitors coming and going he let himself in at the gardendoor and he and buster went upstairs very quietly they disturbed nobody buster curled up at once in his basket and went to sleep fatty lay awake thinking over everything for a few minutes and then fell off to sleep as suddenly as buster he didnt wake till full daylight the breakfast gong was sounding through the house fatty leapt out of bed in a hurry gosh i must have been sleepy he said he stirred buster with a bare foot wake up sleepy head youre as bad as i am he didnt remember about his midnight adventure for a minute or two he was so much engrossed in dressing as quickly as he could then he suddenly remembered and stopped tying his tie whew was it a dream or real buster do you remember our midnight walk too if you do it was real buster did remember he gave a small wuff and leapt on fattys warm bed get down said fatty well im glad you remember our walk last night too funny business wasnt it buster shall we pop round to that bungalow immediately after breakfast just to see whats happened if anything so after breakfast fatty got his bicycle and set off slowly with buster running beside him panting this will do you good tubbyone said fatty severely why is it that you always get so fat when im away at school cant you possibly go for walks by yourself buster was too much out of breath even to bark fatty turned into holly lane and rode up to the bungalow the door was shut but the green curtains were now pulled back from the windows fatty peeped in to see if things were all right he got a terrible shock mr goon was there a most important mr goon and with him was mr henri from next door the old man was nowhere to be seen but what startled fatty most was that there was not a stick of furniture in the front room it was completely empty not even a carpet on the floor he stood gaping in at the window mr goon swung round and saw him he stepped to the window and flung it open scowling you here again what have you come for nobody knows about this yet whats happened said fatty mr henri began to explain about seven oclock zis morning he said but mr goon interrupted him he didnt want fatty to know more than could be helped interfering toad fatty wasnt going to be put off however he had to know about this he spoke rapidly to mr henri in french asking him to reply in french and tell him everything so to the accompaniment of mr goons scowls and snorts mr henri explained everything in french he had awakened at seven oclock that morning and had heard somebody yelling his bedroom faced towards the bungalow at first he hadnt taken much notice and fell asleep again then he said in his rapid french then i awoke later and the noise was still there shouting shouting always so i dressed and came to the bungalow to see what was the matter go on said fatty it was the old man shouting said mr henri still in french the door was locked so i got him to unlock it and when i came inside i saw that this room was quite empty except for the curtains which had been drawn across the windows so that nobody might see into the empty room the old man had awakened this morning and staggered out to this room and when he found everything gone he yelled the place down its a mystery said fatty amazed and goon swung round sharply mr goon were in the middle of a mystery again got any clues suspects and clues mr goon didnt feel that he could possibly stand any cheek from fatty at that moment he was completely mystified he had no clues at all and he simply couldnt imagine when how or why all the frontroom furniture had been removed you clear orf he said to fatty this has got nothing to do with you its a job for the police i must just go and see how the poor old man is said fatty and brushed past goon to go to the back bedroom goon scowled he looked round the room helplessly except for the stove which kept alight all night the fender one lamp and the green curtains there was nothing left in the room what was the point of taking all the furniture away it wasnt worth much anyway fatty was talking to the old man who was almost weeping with shock my money first then my furniture he moaned all my money then my furniture whats to become of me didnt you hear anybody asked fatty no no not a thing did i hear he said fatty stopped questioning him it was plain that he was too upset to say anything sensible mr goon made a few notes in his black book i must know the granddaughters address he said shell have to come along here and take this old fellow to her home he cant stay here alone with no furniture hey dad whats your granddaughters address it be marlins grove marlow said the old man but you wont get me there that you wont its full of pesky old women always grumbling and nagging im not going there but you cant stay here all alone with no furniture shouted mr goon half because the old man was deaf and half because he was angry dont yell at him like that said fatty seeing the poor old fellow cower back mr henri touched goon on the shoulder my sistair she is vairy kind he said in his broken english she has a small bedroom zis old man can stay there till his granddaughter arrives well that would help a bit said goon putting his notebook away will you lock up after you i must go back to my house and telephone all this to my chief its a funny business cant make it out first the money then the furniture he turned to fatty and youd better go home he said theres no call for you to meddle in this always snooping round what made you come up here this morning i just cant think wherever i find trouble i find you it took quite a time to explain to the trembling old man that the people next door would help him but when he understood he seemed to think he would like to go there mr henri went to tell his sistair everything and sent a gardener to help fatty to take the old fellow to his house between them they carried him there and kind mrs harris soon got him into a warm bed ill just keep him warm here till his people come she said i dont mind driving him over to marlow if it will help what an extraordinary thing to happen taking away his furniture in the middle of the night i never heard even the smallest noise fatty went back to the bungalow he had a good look round he was just as puzzled as mr goon there was no doubt that the old man had hidden his money somewhere in his furniture perhaps in several places but the money had gone so why take the furniture wondered fatty well have to get busy on this there should be at least a few clues and everyone who visited the old man yesterday morning up to the time he discovered that his money was gone is on the list of suspects fatty examined the bedroom the bed was a plain iron one with an ordinary wire spring nobody could ever hide money in that the mattress was thin and poor money might have been hidden in that but no it would have to be sewn up again each time the old man took it out he was too blind to do that anyway it was clear that nobody had unsewn and then resewn the mattress all the threads were dirty and had obviously been untouched for years the pillow was thin and hard fatty took it off the slip and looked at it no nobody had ripped the pillow and resewn it he looked at the floorboard there were no marks anywhere to show that any had been taken up all were nailed down fast the chimneyplace was no good for hiding anything either the stove fitted too closely well it beats me why did somebody take the risk of coming at midnight and carrying out all the furniture when the money had obviously been stolen said fatty unless unless they were sure it was still there somewhere in the furniture they didnt like to risk coming and making a really good search so they took all the furniture meaning to search it at leisure he thought about that no that seems silly but then everything seems a bit silly buster dont you think this is rather a silly mystery wuff wuff said buster quite agreeing he wasnt very interested in this little house not even the smell of a mouse he pawed at fattys leg all right im coming said fatty ill just lock the door id better leave the key with mr henri he locked the door and then went to have one more look for larrys leather in the daylight no it was gone he hoped that larry wouldnt get into trouble over it fatty made his way to the house next door after fixing a bit of paper to the front door of hollies on it he had written key next door just in case the granddaughter should come back mrs harris answered the door and told him to come in we are having a cup of coffee she said you must join us my brother would like a word with you too fatty also wanted a word with mr henri he thought it would be distinctly useful to have a list of all the people that mr henri had seen going to the hollies the morning before one of those people must have been the thief who took the money mr henri was ready to tell all he knew he was just as much interested in the matter as fatty was he had already made a neat list and he showed it to fatty fatty ran his eyes down it there were six people on the list lady with papers or magazines windowcleaner grocers boy man in car number ert carried bag man welldressed young stayed for only a minute young woman stayed a long time fatty read the list again quite a long list he said it will be a bit of a business checking all these i wonder if the old man could help a bit with some of them he said his granddaughter came to do some cleaning said mr henri so that must be the young woman and he says he thinks his nephew came but hes so muddled he doesnt seem to remember any of the others i can give you more details of course for instance the woman with the magazines of papers wore a red coat and had a hat with red roses in yes all the details would be a help said fatty what about the grocers boy he came on a bicycle with the name of welburn on the front of the basket said mr henri who seemed a remarkably observant fellow a redhaired boy did you notice if the windowcleaner had a name on his pail or bicycle asked fatty wondering if the cleaner had noticed how remarkably clean the windows of hollies had been after all larry had cleaned them only a day or two before no mr henri hadnt seen the windowcleaners name but he thought it must be the same that his sister had they could ask her well we can go through all these and see if any of them are likely to have taken the money said fatty but i think we can cross out the grocers boy for instance ah no said mr henri he was in hollies for quite a long time it might well be he oh yes youre right we must go into every one of these names said fatty well ill get the others to help theyll have to do some real detective work i can see he drank his coffee and talked a little longer mr henri was now back on the couch coughing rather a lot it is the excitement said his sister he is really much better come and see him whenever you like and ask him what you like it is a puzzle he would like to solve fatty said goodbye and went he was just walking home when he suddenly remembered that he had come on his bicycle where had he left it oh yes by hollies he went back to get it and wheeled it to the road a thought flashed into his head the car had taken away the furniture last night it must have stood just here in the road outside hollies front gate but now he was sure that it couldnt have been a car it must have been a small van of some kind perhaps a small removal van he looked down on the road it was not a good road and was muddy and soft just there the marks of wheels were plainly to be seen ah said fatty pleased im a jolly bad detective lately i nearly forgot to check up for wheelmarks and here they are under my nose the tyremarks were big and wide too wide for an ordinary car fatty decided much more like those of a small removal van he got out his notebook and sketched the pattern left in the mud by the tyres then he measured them across and entered the figure down in his notebook the tyre patterns were so plain that fatty thought the tyres must be quite new that might be a help near by was a lamppost and a mark on it caught fattys eye it was a straight brown mark almost a cut in the white lamppost fatty looked at it that van might quite well have run too close to it he thought anyway its worth noting down van may be painted a chocolatebrown and may have a scratch on wing about two feet from ground well were getting on i hope he shut his book put it into his pocket and rode off with buster in the front basket he wanted to call a meeting of the five findouters that afternoon this was a mystery after all and it needed getting down to because there were quite a lot of suspects what a bit of luck that i went to look for larrys windowleather last night he said to himself as he cycled home if i hadnt gone and heard all that noise last night and hadnt gone again to explore this morning old goon would have had the field to himself he wouldnt have told us a thing now as it happens i know more than he does wuff said buster agreeing thoroughly wuffwuffwuff fatty tells quite a story at three oclock that afternoon larry daisy pip and bets came along to fattys shed he was already there and on the bench at one side were two or three sheets of neatly written notes fatty was just reading them over come in he called and the four trooped in they looked excited fatty had already telephoned to them to say that there really was a mystery now and they wanted to know all about it all sorts of rumours are flying round fatty said larry is it true that somebody took away all the furniture in the middle of the night from hollies cottage and the old man was found lying on the floor because the thieves even took his bed fatty laughed how do people get hold of these things its true that the furniture went but the old man slept peacefully all through the robbery on his own bed they didnt touch that they did the job so quietly that he never heard a thing snored all through it how do you know that said pip a little scornfully you werent there well it so happens that i was said fatty surprising the others very much they stared at him you were there last night when the furniture was all taken away said larry at last well why didnt you stop them then because i had no idea what was being taken said fatty it was pitch dark and they did the whole thing so quietly but look let me tell you everything in its right order quite a lot has happened actually and weve got to get right down to this and really find out whats going on yes but just let me interrupt for a minute said larry did you find my windowleather mother was on and on about it this morning no i didnt said fatty im sorry about that but honestly it wasnt anywhere to be found all i hope is that goon didnt find it well hed think it belonged to the woman who cleans out hollies cottage said daisy well just have to buy mother another one larry blow said larry that really was a silly idea of yours fatty making me go and clean those windows yes but remember that it was all because of that that were in on this mystery said fatty it really began with seeing that old man crawling about jabbing at all his furniture and then us going to collect your leather and hearing him yelling for the police thats true said larry well all right ill say that a very silly idea happened to turn out well but thats as far as ill go fatty changed the subject he picked up his notes now listen he said ive written out a short summary of whats happened so far just to get our minds clear so to speak and ill read it then well discuss any clues and all the suspects and make plans ready yes this sounds good said pip settling himself comfortably on a box well get ready to use your brains said fatty buster sit still and listen too it disturbs me if you keep snuffling for mice in that corner sit buster buster sat his ears pricked as if he were quite ready to listen fatty went quickly through his notes the mystery begins when larry goes to hollies to clean the windows he saw the old man there crawling about poking at his furniture we know now that he was looking to make sure that his savings were safely where he had hidden them either the whole two hundred pounds in some particular chair or sofa or divided up and put into different places possibly in some carefully prepared hidden pocket under a chair or chairs oh that reminds me said daisy suddenly excuse me interrupting fatty but our charwoman told me she knew the old man when he was younger and he was an upholsterer so hed know very well how to make some kind of hidden pockets in furniture wouldnt he whats an upholsterer asked bets bets youre a baby said pip at once its some one who makes chair covers and curtains and stuffs couches and chairs and things isnt it fatty yes said fatty thats an interesting bit of information of yours daisy very interesting the old man probably made himself quite a lot of hidingplaces here and there in the upholstery of his chairs or sofas ill just add a note about it daisy looked pleased its a sort of clue isnt it she said a very small one i know it all helps to fill in the mystery said fatty i always think of our mysteries as jigsaws weve got a great many bits and pieces but not until we fit them together properly do we see the whole picture now then ill go on were listening said bets happily well we come next to when we all of us went with larry to find the leather he had left behind said fatty and we heard the old man yelling for the police he is certain that his money was in its usual place or places about midnight the night before but in the morning it is gone he doesnt discover that its gone however until six people at least have been to hollies cottage for some reason or other and all those six are suspects then till we prove them otherwise said larry good who are they fatty all in good time said fatty dont keep interrupting buster sit there is no mouse in that corner buster sat looking as if he knew better than fatty where mice were concerned fatty went on we decided at this point that it was only a question of straightforward robbery and that goon would be able to deal with it he said but last night i went to get larrys leather and as i told you i arrived just about the time the car or lorry or van came to remove the furniture out of that front room extraordinary said larry unable to stop himself from interrupting fatty went on to describe what he had heard actually i saw nothing he said and i didnt even know till this morning that the midnight visitors were taking away all the furniture i didnt know that they might have a van or a lorry i thought it was a car i imagined they might be kidnapping the old man but i both saw and heard him fast asleep on his bed in the back room what did you think was happening asked pip i simply couldnt imagine said fatty all i heard were a few thuds and bumps and pants and a whisper and it was all over quite quickly really well i thought id better go back to hollies early this morning just to see if i could find out anything and when i got there i had quite a shock why asked bets hugging her knees this is awfully exciting fatty well i found goon there and the old fellow of course and mr henri that frenchman you all thought was me in disguise hes staying with his sister next door as you know and he heard the old man yelling for help again early this morning so he went to see what the matter was and then called the police oh so goon was in on this pretty quickly said larry disappointed yes but i wasnt much later in arriving said fatty and wasnt i amazed to find no furniture in that front room of course i knew at once what had happened because id actually heard the men moving it last night though i didnt tell goon that of course what happened next asked bets nothing much goon went off leaving mr henri and me with the old man and mr henris sister said shed give him a room tin one of his relations came along so hes there now i had a good look round hollies but couldnt see anything to help me then i went back to mr henri and got a proper list of the people he had seen going to the bungalow yesterday morning theyre the suspects of course lets have a good look said larry but fatty hadnt quite finished ive only got one clue he said but it might be an important one he told then about the wellmarked prints of the tyres in the mud outside hollies and showed them the pattern in his notebook i think it must have been a small removal van he said because the distance between the front and back wheels was rather more than there would be in even a big car oh and the car or van may be a chocolatebrown there was a new brown mark on a nearby lamppost as if the vans wings had scraped it well it seems as if we have got to tackle the suspects said larry and look out for a chocolatebrown van which probably has new tyres of a certain pattern wed better all copy out that pattern fatty it would be maddening to see a chocolatebrown removal van with new tyres and not be able to check the pattern yes well will you make four tracings of the diagram in my notebook said fatty ill go on with the list of suspects and we can discuss them you can trace the markings while youre listening fatty turned to his list of six suspects he read them out one lady with papers or magazines dressed in red coat and black hat with roses two windowcleaner three grocers boy from welburn the grocers redhaired and was in the bungalow quite a time four man with bag came in car with number ert five welldressed young man who stayed for only a minute and six a young woman who stayed a long time quite a list said larry a windowcleaner too i wonder if he noticed how clean the windows were thats what i wondered said fatty with a laugh im going to have a word with the old man about these suspects he may be able to give me a few more clues about them then we must tackle each one i never much like that said bets im no good at it yes you are said fatty anyway doesnt your mother have welburns for her grocer you could hang about for the grocers boy and have a word with him when he brings your groceries you and pip could do that oh yes said bets glad that pip was to help her what about the lady with the magazines would she be the vicars sister it sounds rather as if it was somebody delivering the parish magazine yes i can easily find that out said fatty mother knows her ill go and see if she was delivering at hollies this morning if so shes not a suspect of course but we cant afford to rule any one out till weve proved theyre all right and we can look out for car ert said pip i wonder who the young man is and that young woman who stayed such a long time probably the old mans granddaughter said fatty shutting up his notebook she comes to clean for him pip you and bets get on with the grocerboy suspect larry you finish these tracings will you and let us each have one ill go and find out a bit more about these six people if i can daisy will you wander about with buster and see if you can spot that car ert remember right said every one and got up this was exciting a mystery they could really work on now who of all those six was the thief fatty gets going fatty went straight off to mr henri his sister mrs harris was quite pleased to see him fatty had excellent manners and the frenchwoman liked a boy who knew how to behave soon he was sitting beside mr henris couch well have you come to ask me more questions said the man in french we will speak in french will we not it is so much easier for me and you you talk french like a native you are a most accomplished boy fatty coughed modestly and restrained himself from agreeing wholeheartedly with mr henri i just wanted to ask you a few things about our six suspects he began ha mr goon also asked me many questions said mr henri he is a stupid fellow but he asks good questions they are welltrained in this your police oh said fatty disappointed to hear that goon had had the bright idea of questioning mr henri too blow goon well it cant be helped mr henri who of all these six people on our list went into the bungalow right inside i mean all of them said mr henri the door could not have been locked every one turned the handle and walked in what the windowcleaner too said fatty yes he too said mr henri by the way my sister says that he is the same one she has he came to do her windows first and then went to hollies does she think hes honest asked fatty perfectly said mr henri and a good cleaner but you should see him and question him frederick oh i will said fatty decidedly you told me too about the lady with the papers or magazines i think she may have been the vicars sister delivering parish magazines so i do not know what they are said mr henri but yes the lady may have been of that type she too went in but she did not stay long what about the welldressed young man you said went in for a short time asked fatty well he came again when you were there said mr henri you saw him quite welldressed did he not say who he was gosh that was the old mans greatnephew said fatty he called him uncle i remember so he came during the morning too did he before we got there and afterwards as well very interesting ill find out where he lives and do a spot of interviewing the young woman must have been the granddaughter who cleans and cooks for the old fellow said mr henri there was also the man who came in a car that is all is it not well which do you suspect the most i dont know said fatty i really dont the one i suspect least is the lady with magazines but even so ill have to check up the worst of it is goon has probably checked up too that makes it more difficult for me i mean a policeman has the right to interview people i havent mrs harris came in you will stay to tea wont you she said we are just going to have it fatty shook his head most regretfully im awfully sorry nothing id like better but i must go and do a spot of interviewing before mr goon gets too far ahead of me he shook hands politely thanked mr henri and let himself out it was about a quarter to five he was quite near the vicarage should he chance his luck and go and see if the vicars sister was in fatty decided that he would so he cycled away quickly and was soon riding up the vicarage drive he saw somebody just by the house kneeling on a mat weeding the vicars sister what a bit of luck fatty got off his bicycle and said good afternoon the vicars sister looked up she was a small kindly faced woman who knew fattys mother well ah frederick she said do you want to see the vicar well no i really wanted to see you said fatty i wont keep you a minute its about that poor old man whose money has been stolen i and my friends happened to be the first ones to help him when he discovered his loss and yes i was so sorry to hear about that said the vicars sister i had been to see him myself only that morning left him the parish magazine you know his granddaughter reads it to him and he was sitting in his chair quite happy listening to the radio it was going so loudly that i could hardly hear myself speak did you see anything suspicious at all asked fatty we couldnt see anything out of the way when we arrived there no everything seemed just as usual said the kindlyfaced woman i just left the magazine had a few friendly words and went such a pity to hide money in ones house a real temptation to thieves yes said fatty well thanks very much i didnt think you could help me really but you never know how did you know i called there yesterday asked the vicars sister looking suddenly puzzled oh i just heard that you did said fatty turning his bicycle round thank you very much my kind regards to the vicar and his wife one of the list of suspects said fatty to himself as he rode away i felt sure that woman with magazines sounded like the vicars sister anyway its quite quite obvious she had nothing to do with the money she didnt say if goon had gone to see her i suppose he hasnt or she would have told me well i should have thought he would have shot along to interview her even though he knew she wasnt really a suspect but goon had not thought of the vicars sister the description of the woman with the magazines had rung a different bell in goons mind aha a red coat and a black hat with roses didnt that sound like the woman who had sold him that ticket and read his hand the woman who had actually seen that fat boy frederick in his hand and a mystery also theres more in this handreading business than anyone would guess said goon to himself much more i dont reckon that woman who read my hand has got anything to do with the theft of the money but im pretty certain shes the woman with the papers who visited hollies yesterday morning so ill go and interview her and maybe shell read my hand a bit more maybe she could tell me more about the mystery she saw in my hand poor goon he had no idea that his visitor the woman in the red coat who had sold him the sale ticket had been fatty in disguise he cycled hopefully up to fattys house and rang the bell the woman had told him she was staying for three weeks with fattys mother so she should still be there fatty had just arrived back himself and was washing his hands in the bathroom he saw goon cycling up the drive and was puzzled now what did goon want he dried his hands and slipped downstairs going into the lounge where his mother was sewing jane came into the room almost at once mr goon the policeman would like a word with you madam she said mrs trotteville frowned she was not fond of mr goon show him in here she said dont go frederick it may be something to do with you mr goon came in helmet in his hand he was always on his best behaviour with mrs trotteville er good evening madam he said i wondered if i could have a word with the lady who is staying with you mrs trotteville looked surprised there is no one staying with me at present she said why do you think there is but but there must be said mr goon startled why this lady she came to see me the other morning and sold me a ticket for a sale of work five bob er five shillings i paid for it she said she was a friend of yours and was staying with you for three weeks i wanted to see her to ask a few questions i have reason to believe that she was one of the people who went to hollies where the robbery was you know on the morning that the old man discovered that his money was gone fatty turned round and poked the fire vigorously how marvellous how super goon really and truly thought that one of the suspects was the woman in the red coat who had visited him and read his hand fatty himself in disguise really mr goon i cant think why in the world this woman said she was staying with me said mrs trotteville very much on her dignity i have never heard of her in my life but but she sold me this ticket for five bob said poor mr goon in anguish five bob is it a dud then he pushed the ticket at mrs trotteville no it is not a dud she said i also have those tickets for sale she read my hand too wailed goon and the things she said were true he stopped suddenly no it wouldnt do to tell mrs trotteville what the woman had said about a fat boy fatty was having a violent coughing fit his handkerchief to his face his mother looked at him annoyed frederick go and get a drink of water mr goon im sorry not to be able to help you but i do assure you that i have no friend who goes about reading peoples hands some one has er deceived you still youve got the ticket you can always go to the sale there will be plenty of good things for you to buy mr goon made a peculiar noise half snort and half groan he got up said good evening and stumbled to the door that woman in the red coat who could she have been telling him fairy tales like that making him stump up for a silly sale of work ticket what a waste of money all the same she did warn him against that fat boy and she did know that a mystery was near strange most peculiar fatty appeared in the hall oh are you going mr goon he said do let me see you out very strange that that woman should have said she was staying here isnt it by the way how are you getting on with this new mystery for mystery it is you no doubt have plenty of clues goon looked at him with a surly face yes i have he said and one or two of them you wont like mister clever i told you youd poke your nose into things once too often what exactly do you mean by that said fatty wait and see said goon rudely fatty opened the door and goon marched out fatty called after him politely oh er mr goon did that woman who read your hand warn you against a fat boy by any chance she did did she well take her advice beware of him and fatty gently shut the door on a most bewildered mr goon now how did fatty know what that woman had read in his hand goon puzzled over that for a very long time indeed mostly about windowcleaners it was too late to do anything else that evening fatty decided that he would go and see the windowcleaner first thing the next morning then he would go to pips at ten oclock for the next meeting of the five by that time the others might have something to report too after the meeting ill see if i can find that young man the greatnephew said fatty and have a word with the granddaughter too by then we might be able to see daylight a little my word fancy goon going right off the track and coming up here to trace a woman who doesnt exist the woman who read his hand poor old goon hes got hold of a bit of jigsaw that doesnt fit fatty decided that he would dress up in old clothes the next day find the windowcleaner and pretend that he wanted some advice about going in for windowcleaning himself he might get the man to talk more freely if he thought he was not being interviewed id better go early or hell be off to work thought fatty and arranged with cook to have breakfast at an earlier hour than usual he was up in good tune and came down just as jane brought a tray of breakfast for him into the diningroom she looked in surprise at fatty my word are you going in for chimneysweeping or something she said where did you get those dirty old clothes dont you let your father see you i wont said fatty and began on his breakfast he propped his notebook in front of him as he ate considering all the facts of the robbery and the removal of the furniture pity they couldnt find out where the furniture was it would help matters a good deal he had the address of the windowcleaner mr henris sister had given it to him sixtytwo north street peterswood the other end of the town well ill be off fatty didnt cycle his bicycle was too expensivelooking to be owned by a young man who wanted a job at windowcleaning he set off at a good pace with buster at his heels it took him about twenty minutes to get to the address no was a smart little house with a television aerial on the roof evidently windowcleaning was quite a wellpaid occupation fatty walked round to the back door a man sat there cleaning some boots he looked up at fatty and fatty grinned hallo mate what do you want said the man liking the look of this cheerfulfaced fat boy just wanted to ask you if you could give me a few hints about your job said fatty i might like to take it up if any one would teach me he spoke in a rough kind of voice so that the man would not suspect him to be any other than he seemed the windowcleaner looked him up and down you seem a likely sort of lad he said i might do with a mate meself when are you free oh not for some time said fatty hastily marvelling at the ease with which one could get a job he then began to ask the windowcleaner a few questions how much did a ladder cost could one be bought secondhand were leathers expensive look here if you want a job at windowcleaning you come and be my mate said the man at last you and i would get on fine dont you worry about ladders and leathers ill supply those if you like to come in with me you go home and think about it and let me know right said fatty thats kind of you i say did you hear about that robbery at hollies i should think i did said the man taking up another boot to clean why i was cleaning the windows that very morning funny thing was though i hadnt cleaned them for a month they were as clean as could be i told the old man that when i went in for my money his granddaughter was there ironing the curtains and she seemed surprised to see me said another windowcleaner had been along a day or two before and hadnt asked for any money at all fatty listened to this with great interest hoping that goon wouldnt get suspicious if he heard about the other windowcleaner have the police asked you if you saw anything when you cleaned the windows that morning anything unusual i mean asked fatty no i havent seen the police said the man ive got nothing to fear ive been a windowcleaner for years and every one knows me anyway i couldnt have taken the money the granddaughter was there all the time ironing away yes that certainly rules you out said fatty thinking that the windowcleaner was another suspect to cross off well i must go thanks very much for your help if i decide to be your mate ill come right along and tell you the windowcleaner waved a shoebrush at fatty and the boy went round to the front untied buster from the fence and walked back home he was thinking hard why hadnt goon interviewed the windowcleaner he had had time didnt he know who the man was well he was one up on goon over that another suspect gone fatty arrived at pips just after ten oclock the other four were sitting waiting for him in pips playroom fatty was surprised to see such long faces whats up he said bets you look as if youre going to burst into tears fatty something awfuls happened said daisy simply awful goon found that windowleather larry used and it had our name on it daykin mother always marks all her household cloths good gracious said fatty if only id known that id never have let that leather lie there so long well were in an awful fix now said larry and really i cant help saying again fatty that it was a most idiotic idea of yours to tell me to go and clean windows you see goon saw the name daykin on the leather and he knows that my name is larry daykin and he immediately leapt to the conclusion that one or other of us five had played the fool and was the windowcleaner on the morning of the robbery whew said fatty and sat down suddenly this is a blow he sat and stared at the serious faces of the others did he come up to your house with the leather asked fatty of course he did said larry and whats more he took the leather away again saying something about its being a piece of evidence whatever that may be so mother hasnt got it back yet and he had us in larry and me and asked us outright if we had cleaned the windows of hollies two mornings ago said daisy but fortunately we were able to say we hadnt because as you know it was a day or two before that that larry cleaned them not the morning of the robbery but we felt awful we had to say it was mothers leather of course but we didnt dare to say that larry had cleaned the windows with it two days before the robbery we just kept on saying that we didnt clean the windows on the robbery morning and he kept on saying then how did this leather get into those bushes said larry hes most awfully suspicious about it its dreadful i dont know what will happen when dad comes home and hears about it i bet hell get out of daisy or me that i was idiot enough to clean the windows two or three days before that robbery hell think im stark staring mad ill go and see goon said fatty getting up i can put things right i think how asked larry well it so happens that ive been to see the actual windowcleaner who did clean the windows on the robbery morning said fatty man called glass good name for a windowcleaner nobody could raise even a smile well anyway this fellow says he did clean the windows that morning and when hed finished he went into the bungalow and the granddaughter was there ironing curtains or something he said and she paid him his money oh what a relief said larry looking more cheerful if goon knows that maybe he wont keep on trying to make me say i was there cleaning windows that morning too honestly fatty i began to feel that he thought id stolen the money im sorry to hear about this larry said fatty ill go and see goon now he went off with buster leaving four slightly more cheerful children in pips playroom daisy got up come on lets go out i feel quite depressed lets have some icecreams always a good cure for things that make us feel miserable fatty went straight to mr goons he saw the policemans bicycle outside and was thankful mrs mickle answered the door mr goon in asked fatty she nodded and showed him into the office the skinny little bert stood slyly in the hall fatty gave him a look hallo skinny bewaaaaaaare the beware seemed to come from behind bert and reminded him of those awful voices he had heard a day or two ago he looked behind him gave a yelp and disappeared no one was in the office but draped over a chairseat was larrys windowleather fattys eyes gleamed he spoke softly to buster buster look whats that fight it then fight it and buster leapt on the leather in delight caught it in his teeth and dragged it round the room shaking it and worrying it exactly as if it were a rat take it outside buster said fatty and buster obediently ran into the front garden with it growling most ferociously mr goon walked into the room thirty seconds later looking quite jubilant ha he had got larry and daisy into a fine old fix larry was the windowcleaner was he then he was one of the suspects on the morning of the robbery what would his father have to say to that but fatty soon made him look a little less jubilant oh mr goon he began i thought it might interest you to know that i have this morning interviewed the windowcleaner who cleaned the windows of hollies on the morning of the robbery a man called glass living at north street peterswood what said goon startled he told me he cleaned the windows then went into the bungalow for his money the granddaughter of the old man was there ironing and she paid him he couldnt have stolen anything under the very eyes of the young woman so i should think we neednt consider the windowcleaner any further what do you feel about it mr goon mr goon felt furious he cast his eyes round for the windowleather he would face fatty with that and see what he would say but where was the leather he couldnt see it anywhere are you looking for something mr goon asked fatty politely that leather said mr goon beginning to be agitated wheres it gone oh dear i do hope buster hasnt got it said fatty hes out there growling like anything mr goon would you like to see what hes got mr goon looked out of the window buster had torn the leather to pieces nobody would ever have known that it had once been a most respectable windowleather that dog said mr goon in a tone of such fury that even fatty was surprised ill go and scold him said fatty and went out by the way you didnt thank me for coming to give you information about mr glass the windowcleaner mr goon mr goon said the only thing he felt able to say gah a talk in the icecream shop fatty went straight back to pips house but the others were not there i should think theyve gone to have icecreams said mrs hilton i believe i heard somebody mention the word right thank you said fatty wishing he had his bicycle all this rushing about on foot would make him quite thin ill go and find them mrs hilton he went off with buster who still proudly carried a small bit of the windowleather in his mouth fatty stopped at an ironmongers in the main street and bought a magnificent leather it cost him sixteen shillings he stuffed it into his pocket and went on to the dairy the other four were there eating icecreams they were very pleased indeed to see fattys cheerful face is it all right asked bets eagerly and fatty nodded he ordered a round of icecreams for every one and two for himself as he was one behind the others i went to see goon he said and i told him how id gone to see the real windowcleaner this morning he was most annoyed i bet he was said larry he was just too pleased for anything to think hed got me pinned down as one of the suspects but what about the leather hes still got that hell come and flourish it at daddy tonight and make an awful scene buster come here sir said fatty and buster came from his mouth hung the last bit of the windowleather he wagged his tail well well well if buster hasnt taken it upon himself to remove that leather from goons office fight it and chew it to bits said fatty solemnly is that the very last bit buster wuff said buster and dropped it larry picked it up yes he said look theres a bit of the namemarking on this corner dayk oh buster youre the cleverest cheekiest best dog in all the world and he deserves a double icecream said daisy thankfully oh fatty i dont know how you do these things but theres simply nobody like you for putting things right going straight for them taking the bull by the horns tackling the fury of the storm putting the enemy to flight and all the rest of it said fatty grinning no but honestly i was really upset goon had something on us there and you and daisy could have got into a fearful row larry all through my fault but now mr goon cant do anything can he said bets happily he knows who the real windowcleaner was youve told him and he hasnt got the leather any more and mothers the only one who has suffered said larry shes lost her windowleather for good now oh i forgot said fatty and pulled the brandnew leather from his pocket he tossed it across to larry a present for your mother he said oh thanks said larry delighted mother will be so thrilled that she wont say another word about mr goons accusations tell her he made a mistake said fatty and a bad mistake it was for him fatty pip and i saw the grocers boy when he came with the groceries last night said bets remembering good for you said fatty what happened well pip and i kept biking up and down the drive waiting for him said bets and he came at last on his bicycle pip had let down his tyre so that it was a bit flat and he yelled out to the boy to ask if hed lend him his pump good idea said fatty so of course you just fell into conversation what did the boy say not much said bets your turn now pip you tell i asked him if he ever went to hollies where the robbery had been said pip and he was simply thrilled to tell us all he knew but it wasnt much tell me said fatty just in case theres something well he went to the front door as usual said pip he knocked and shouted grocer some one called bring the things in and in he went who was there asked fatty the old man was there with the radio on full strength said pip and a young woman the old mans granddaughter he said she called the old fellow grandad she was very busy sewing something green she told him to take all the things out of the basket and out them in the little larder so he did and that was all said bets he just stayed and listened to the wireless for a bit and then went yes mr henri said the boy was in the bungalow for quite a time said fatty that explains it well he couldnt have taken the money either the granddaughter was there all the time perhaps she took it said larry she had plenty of chance yes but why take it that morning when so many people seemed to be in and out said fatty anyway well know better when we see her she sounds a good sort i must say going up and looking after old grandad like that still you never know fatty took out his notebook and opened it at his page of suspects we can cross quite a few off he said he drew his pencil through grocer boy then he crossed out windowcleaner he also crossed out lady with magazines oh have you found out about her too asked pip interested yes said fatty and told them he also related how goon had gone wrong and had imagined that the lady with the papers in red coat black hat with roses must have been the funny old thing who had sold him daisys ticket for the sale and had read his hand and how goon had gone to fattys house to ask his mother if he might interview her every one roared oh you had told him that you were staying with mrs trotteville for three weeks so he thought the woman must still be there giggled bets whatever did your mother say oh she soon put goon in his place said fatty poor old goon hes getting a bit muddled over all this no buster you can not have another icecream that was a double one in case you didnt notice good old buster eating up that leather said larry patting him i must say it was a very fine way of getting rid of of what is it i want to say fatty a fine way of getting rid of incriminating evidence said fatty promptly no im not going to explain that bets use your brains who have we got left on the list of suspects now asked daisy craning over fattys arm to see oh man in car with bag ert fatty i looked all over the place but i couldnt see any erts and i didnt see either shall we stroll round again and look i feel it must be a local person right and then i think ill go and interview the smartly dressed greatnephew and find out what he wanted greatuncle for that morning said fatty he apparently went in for a very short while and then came out and if you remember he turned up again when we were there listening to grandpas laments about his money having been stolen yes the granddaughter had left by that time said pip where does this fellow live mr henri told me said fatty turning over the pages of his notebook here we are the old man told him the address because mr henri wanted to get in touch with his relatives no spike street marlow apparently both he and the granddaughter live at marlow though at different addresses when will you go and see them today asked daisy shall we come too fatty considered this yes on the whole i think it would be a good idea he said goon has probably interviewed them both by this time and if they see me coming along full of questions too they may resent it but if we all blow along full of innocent curiosity so to speak we might do better i cant go before lunch said daisy nor can larry weve got an aunt coming we could meet you about three though outside your house on bicycles well have tea at that nice little cafe in marlow high street yes thats settled then said fatty putting his notebook away come on out and well look for ert they paid the bill and went out buster still with his tiny bit of leather he growled at every dog he met dont be an idiot buster said fatty you dont really suppose any other dog wants your smelly bit of leather do you they looked at every single car they met or that passed them not an ert anywhere they went to the carpark and examined every car there which made the attendant extremely suspicious of them what are you looking for he called an ert said fatty whats that asked the attendant never heard of it there arent no erts here so you can go away youre right said fatty sadly there isnt a single ert to be seen theres mr goon said bets suddenly as they walked out of the carpark perhaps hes looking for erts too no he has other ways of finding out who owns any car said fatty the police can always trace any car by its number and mr henri is sure to have given goon the number old goon will be one up on us over the man with the bag and car ert buster ran out into the road barking when he saw mr goon riding by goon kicked out at him and nearly fell off that pesky dog he shouted and rode on at full speed buster youve dropped your bit of incriminating evidence said fatty disapprovingly pointing to the rag of leather that had fallen from busters mouth when he barked at goon buster picked it up meekly they all went to larrys house first in the drive stood a car hallo whos this said larry not our aunt elsie already surely no it isnt her car a man came down the front steps of the house carrying a neat brown case its the doctor said daisy hallo doctor holroyd hows cook much better said the doctor smiling round at the five children well there doesnt look to be anything wrong with you he got into his car started the engine and put in the gearlever he went off down the drive bets gave a loud yen and pointed ert ert look do look ert so it was gosh to think we all stood here with it staring us in the face said fatty after hunting for it all the morning man with a bag too why ever didnt any of us think of a doctor were not nearly as bright as we imagine said daisy good old bets she spotted it shall you go and interview him asked pip no im sure he couldnt help us at all said fatty he couldnt possibly have stolen the money every one knows doctor holroyd i expect he just went to have a look at the old man and then shot away again in his car all the same we ought to feel jolly ashamed of ourselves not to have spotted the number when it was right in front of our noses theres aunt elsie quick larry come and wash said daisy suddenly as a small car crept in at one of the gates goodbye you others they fled and the other four walked sedately down the drive see you at three outside your house called bets goodbye fatty goodbye buster hang on to your bit of of incriminating evidence a chat with wilfrid and a surprise every one was outside fattys gate at three oclock buster included ill have to put him into my bicycle basket said fatty marlows too far for him to go on his four short legs up with you buster buster liked the bicycle basket he sat there happily bumping up and down when fatty went over ruts he looked down on other dogs with scorn as he passed them it was about three miles to marlow and a very pleasant ride on that fine april day they asked for spike street when they got there it was a pretty street leading down to the river no was the last house and its lawn sloped down to the water the five got off their bicycles put them by this wall said fatty then well snoop round a bit to see if we can find the greatnephew wilfrid king is his name weve all seen him so we know what he is like they sauntered alongside the wall that ran round the little front garden of no they came to a path that led to the river they went down it looking across to the lawn that led down to the water they could see no one they came to the waters edge and stood there then fatty gave daisy a nudge a boat lay bobbing not far off and in it a young man lay reading a rather surlylooking fellow in smartly creased greyflannel trousers and a yellow jersey theres wilfrid said fatty in a low voice lets call out to him and pretend to be very surprised to see him then well fall into conversation remember weve just ridden over here to see the river its such a lovely day wilfrid however saw them before they could hail him he sat up and stared arent you the kids who heard my greatuncle shouting for help the other morning he said oh yes why youre wilfrid arent you shouted back fatty appearing to be most surprised fancy seeing you here weve just ridden over its such a heavenly day did you meet that fatheaded policeman asked wilfrid hes been over here today asking umpteen questions any one would think id robbed the poor old fellow myself oh has mr goon been over said fatty do come and tell us we think hes a bit of a fathead too but really fancy thinking you would rob your greatuncle poor old man i wonder who did ah said wilfrid and looked knowing what do you mean ah said larry oh nothing that policeman wouldnt see a thing even if it was right under his nose said wilfrid i told him that it was i who kept on and on at my uncle begging him to put the money into a bank its most dangerous to keep it in the house anyway it appears that a lot of people visited hollies that morning there are quite a few persons who might have stolen the money yes thats true said fatty its funny how many people went in and out all the time still the old mans granddaughter was there most of the time cleaning or something she can probably clear most of the ones who came yes she can clear me for instance said wilfrid she was there when i went in marians my cousin and she and i dont get on so i didnt stay long she actually wanted me to help her with the work me she said if i was going to stay long i could jolly well put up the curtains for her so i just walked out well anyway she can clear you as you say said fatty its a funny thing she can clear most of the people who went in and out except perhaps the doctor and he doesnt really need to be cleared oh is that so said wilfrid have you got a list of the suspected persons im there too i suppose you can be crossed off if marian the granddaughter can clear you said fatty handing him the list my word said wilfrid looking at it six of us and all crossed off except for marian and myself yes and you say that marian can clear you so youll be crossed off too soon said fatty perhaps marian has already seen mr goon and hes crossed you off shes out for the day said wilfrid i told him that so i dont expect hes seen her yet i say all of us will be crossed off except one except one said fatty watching wilfrid as he bent his head thoughtfully over the list did you know where the old man hid his money by any chance an angry look came over wilfrids face no i didnt he would never tell me i thought that if only he would i would take it and put it into the bank but now its too late somebody else has got it and you think you know who said fatty quietly wilfrid hesitated not for certain id better not say any more youre only kids but you might go and say something silly yes we might said pip who had begun to dislike wilfrid it was quite apparent to them all that wilfrid thought his cousin marian had taken the money but they couldnt help thinking that he would have had it too if he could we must go said fatty looking at his watch well i hope that marian clears you wilfrid its rather important that she should they went back to their bicycles and rode off to the little cafe they liked not a word was said till they got there they were early so there was no one else in the room they began to talk in low voices it cant have been wilfrid who took the money if he and his cousin dislike each other she certainly wouldnt have sheltered him if he had taken the money right in front of her eyes so he cant be the thief said pip well then who is it looks like marian said fatty well go and see her after tea what beats me is why somebody took all that furniture away the next night i keep going round and round that but i just cant see where that bit of the jigsaw fits into the picture i cant either said daisy the furniture was cheap stuff worth very little could the thief have imagined that the money was still there no i give up its a puzzle they had a good tea and then went to call at marians house hoping that she would be in here we are said fatty no merlins street why its a little hotel so it was a small boardinghouse beautifully kept the children rang the bell and a neat middleaged woman came to the door is miss marian king in asked fatty if so may we see her i dont think shes in yet said the woman ill go and find out come into the drawingroom will you they all trooped in an old lady was there reading she smiled at the children and nodded do you want to see some one she asked yes said fatty wed like to see marian king if shes in ah marian said the old lady shes a sweet girl good to her mother good to her old grandad and good to tiresome old ladies like me shes a dear we know she used to go and do all kinds of things for her grandfather said fatty glad to have some information about marian oh yes that girl was always thinking of him said the old lady taking him up titbits she had cooked doing his washing and ironing as particular as could be she was she told me she was going to take down wash and iron his curtains last time she went quite a job and kind of her too because the old man wouldnt be able to see them yes she did do the curtains said daisy remembering what had been seen by the grocers boy she must have been very fond of her grandfather oh she was said the old lady she thought the world of him and couldnt bear him to live alone and now i hear that the poor old man has been robbed of his money dear dear marian will be so upset fatty wondered why the woman who had opened the door had not come back had she forgotten they were waiting he decided to go and find out he slipped out of the room and into the passage he heard voices at the end and walked down the carpeted hallway some one was crying i dont know what to say about marian first that policeman comes to see her and i say shes out now these children where is she shes been gone for two days now people will say she took the money it isnt like marian to do this oh dear oh dear i do so hope shes not come to any harm another voice comforted her well you do as you think best marians a good girl that i will say and as for stealing money from her old grandad and shes so fond of him too why thats nonsense i do think you should let the police know tomorrow that shes missing i do indeed but theyll think shes run off with the money itll be in all the papers said the first voice sobbing my girl marian my only daughter as good as gold fatty went back quietly to the drawingroom he was worried and very puzzled this was something he hadnt expected where had marian gone could she have taken the money every one seemed to speak well of her and yet and yet why had she gone away fatty entered the drawingroom and spoke quietly to the others i dont think well wait he turned to the old lady and spoke politely if the maid comes back will you please say were sorry we couldnt wait thank you the old lady nodded thinking what wellbehaved children these were the five went out and collected buster from the post to which he had been tied he was delighted to see them dont say anything now said fatty in a low voice ive got some news they mounted their bicycles and waited until they were beyond marlow in a deserted country road fatty jumped off his bicycle the others did the same they went to a gate leaned their bicycles there and gathered round fatty puzzled at his serious face marian has disappeared he said i overheard her mother say so theyre terribly upset half afraid shes gone off with the money and worried about what the papers will say if they get to hear of her disappearance what do you think of that gosh said larry it really does look as if shes the thief after all shes the one most likely to have wormed herself into the old mans confidence and got his secrets out of him where the money was kept for instance yes there doesnt seem any other reason why shes gone said fatty well until she conies back we cant get much further in this mystery we dont know two important things where or why marian has gone and where or why the furniture has gone this is one of the most puzzling mysteries weve tackled yes and im sure that nobody could solve it even if they knew all we know said pip well lets get back theres not much more we can do now so they rode back to peterswood disappointed and puzzled well perhaps the simplest explanation was the right one marian had taken the money and gone off with it and yet what about that stolen furniture could that have been marian too they gave it up its too mysterious a mystery said bets mr goon certainly wont solve it an extraordinary find fatty was unusually quiet that evening the five of them with buster were down in fattys shed bets slipped her hand through his arm whats the matter fatty are you worried im puzzled more than worried said fatty i really am i cant believe that the granddaughter marian would rob an old man she had been looking after so lovingly and yet i feel certain that wilfrid hasnt got the money and whats more doesnt know where it is then is there somebody else a seventh person that we dont know about asked larry i did wonder if there could be said fatty some one who perhaps went round the back of the bungalow that morning of the robbery and got in without being seen mr henri could see every one going in at the front but not at the back yes thats true said daisy also i suppose it is possible that he wasnt looking out of his window every minute of the time thats so said fatty but i think the old man would have mentioned any one else mr henri had a good talk with him and is pretty certain there was no one else lets have a game said pip who was getting just a bit tired of all this talkytalk no you have one and let me think said fatty im at my wits end and yet i feel as if theres some clue that would give me the key to the whole mystery well anyway the moneys gone said pip so has marian its a bit fishy perhaps its still at hollies suggested bets in a place where nobody has looked i hunted everywhere said fatty its such a small place there really is nowhere to hide anything once you rule out the chimney and the floorboards theres no furniture now to speak of just the old mans bed a chair and a little table in that back room and a lamp a stove that old fender put in daisy and the curtains said bets they had to leave those i suppose in case old goon came by at night and shone his torch in at the window hed have discovered the bare room then of course oh come on do lets have a game said pip i know when im beaten theres something peculiar about all this something we dont know about fatty grinned suddenly all right he said im inclined to think youre right there are some bits of this jigsaw that we havent got it isnt that we cant fit them into the picture we just havent got them hand over the cards pip you never shuffle properly when the others went fatty walked part of the way with them buster at his heels it was a lovely evening and looked like being a glorious day tomorrow they went round a corner in a bunch and bumped into a burly form hey said a familiar voice cant you look where youre going oh good evening mr goon said fatty out for a little stroll solved the mystery yet oh yes said goon no mystery in it at all if youre talking about the hollies affair that is plain as the nose on your face its that girl marian fatty was thunderstruck what do you mean surely she didnt take the money you wait and see the papers tomorrow morning said mr goon enjoying himself thought yourself so clever didnt you well youre not has the money been found asked fatty you wait and see said mr goon again and look here i bin thinking do you know anything about that lady that read my hand mr goon looked extremely threatening and bets promptly went behind larry let me see now which lady do you mean asked fatty as if plenty of people read goons hand goon gave one of his snorts youre a pest he said but this time im on top see you watch the papers tomorrow morning he went on down the road looking very pleased with himself fatty gave a hollow groan i do believe that fat policeman knows something we dont blow him ill never forgive myself if we let him get the better of us it rather looks as if marian is the black sheep i thought she was said pip going off like that perhaps theyve found her money and all well have to wait for the morning papers said fatty well goodbye its sad to think this mystery is coming to an end while were still in the middle of it so to speak bets squeezed fattys arm perhaps something else will happen she comforted him you never know its not very likely said fatty and gave her a hug goodbye see you tomorrow all of you fatty was down early the next morning to see the papers there was nothing on the front page but inside was a whole column it was headed missing girl and missing money it then went on to describe hollies the old man the missing money the sudden disappearance of the furniture and now the disappearance of marian it didnt say that marian had taken the money but any one reading the news about the hollies affair would immediately gather that marian had taken both money and furniture now i suppose the hunt is on fatty thought every one will be looking out for marian i suppose her mother told the police the girl was missing or more probably goon wormed it out of her and reported it gosh i wish i could have been a bit cleverer over this mystery i do feel that ive missed something some clue that might have been the key to the whole affair fatty put down the paper and thought ill go round to hollies once more he decided for the last time just to see if any bright idea comes to me ill go by myself without any of the others ill just take buster with me he fetched his bicycle and rode off he soon came to holly lane and went into greentrees to get the key mr henri still had it the old man has gone to marlow he said they came to fetch him last night oh and so i suppose when he asked for marian and was told she was missing he made a fuss said fatty ill tell you something he told me said mr henri he said that marian knew where his money was he had actually told her and made her promise she would never never tell anyone fatty groaned so it looks as if she was the only one who knew and i must say things look bad for her now well if she took it she deserves whats coming to her may i have the key mr henri i know im beaten but i just want to have a last look round mr henri gave it to him and fatty went off next door he let himself in the curtains were drawn across the windows and the room was dark he switched on the light but it was very dim he drew the curtains away from the windows and the sun streamed in fatty remembered how marian had washed and ironed the curtains on the morning of the robbery surely she wouldnt have done that if she had been going to steal the money and clear out thought fatty it doesnt make sense in fact nothing makes sense he stood there looking at the fresh green curtains he had his hand on the sidehem that ran from the top of the window almost down to the floor it felt stiff and he rubbed it between finger and thumb funny said fatty and felt the hem a bit higher up then he felt it round the bottom of the curtains he held it to his ear and rubbed and squeezed a faint crackle came to him fatty suddenly grew excited tremendously excited he was filled with sudden exultation ive found the money i believe ive found the money gosh what a bit of luck he took out his pocketknife and ripped up the bottom hem of the curtain cutting the stitches the hem was now loose enough for him to insert finger and thumb he felt about and came across something papery he pulled it out gently and stared at it whistling softly it was a pound note rather dirty a pound note so thats where she hid the money to keep it from wilfrid who had begun to suspect that it was somewhere in the furniture he must have come and threatened her that he would search for it after she had gone that morning and so she ripped open the hems of the curtains she was ironing and sewed the money into them what an idea the curtain hems were packed with the pound notes fatty could feel them all the way round he debated what to do about it should he take the money out no he might get into trouble it would be perfectly safe to leave it there nobody had guessed so far and not a soul was likely to guess now anyway no one will come here said fatty and whats more ill make certain they dont he went out of the bungalow and locked the door he put the key into his pocket i shant take it back to hollies ill just tell mr henri ill keep it and ask him to keep an eye on any one who comes up to the front door wilfrids got a key thats certain but i dont think hell come again and marian certainly wont fatty was so excited that he found it difficult to keep his news to himself finding the money had suddenly shed light on all kinds of things marian had taken it she had hidden it in the curtains to make sure that wilfrid didnt find it if he hunted for hidingplaces in the furniture she hadnt even told the old man where she had put it in case wilfrid wormed it out of him and the old fellow looking for it after marian had gone that morning had thought it was stolen why had marian disappeared not because she had taken the money she hadnt had wilfrid anything to do with her disappearance it was almost certainly wilfrid who had come with some kind of van or lorry that night and removed all the furniture why probably because marian vowed that she hadnt got it but that it was still hidden at hollies the pieces are fitting again said fatty to himself jubilantly if only i could find marian or the furniture would the furniture still be in the van it would obviously be dangerous for wilfrid and his helper to unload it anywhere his people would be very suspicious to see furniture suddenly appearing in the house or in the yard he probably had to leave it in the van another thought struck him perhaps wilfrids family are in the house removal business maybe they have big vans and it might be in one of those gosh ill have to find out quickly fatty could hardly get home fast enough quick quick he might defeat goon yet and solve the whole thing before marian was arrested night adventure fatty rushed to the telephone directories in the hall as soon as he got home he wanted to look up kings of marlow were they furniture removers they must be he was certain they would be quick he must find kings in the directory there were a good many kings a king alec king bertram king claude king mrs d king all the way down the list of kings went fattys eager finger at last he came to the end of them he was bitterly disappointed not one of the kings was a furniture remover there was a butcher and a baker but the kings apparently did not go in for house removals fatty stared at the list in despair ill go down it again very very carefully he thought now then a king alec king bertram king butcher claude king dentist mrs d king edward king the king stables henry king wait now stables stables thats it thats it stables mean horses and horses mean horseboxes horseboxes means vans capable of removing furniture ive got it ive got it fatty threw the directory on the floor and did a most complicated jig up and down the hall with buster flying after him barking he knew that fatty was excited so he was excited too mrs trotteville suddenly came out from the lounge into the hall frederick what on earth are you thinking of i have a meeting in the lounge and you choose just this minute to act like a red indian oh mother im so sorry said fatty and in his excitement and jubilance he went up and hugged her but ive just made a great discovery and i was celebrating it so sorry mother well go and celebrate down in your shed said his mother and by the way please dont forget that your grandfather will be here by the eleven oclock train i want you to meet him fatty stared at his mother in the utmost dismay gosh id forgotten every word about it oh mother i cant meet grandad im so sorry but you must frederik said his mother shocked i have this committee meeting and besides you always do meet your grandfather he is only coming for the day and would think it very rude of you if you go off somewhere you knew he was coming fatty groaned yes but i tell you i forgot every word about it i promise you i did mother it isnt that i dont want to meet him or be with him i do but it just happens that ive got something very very important to do and it cant wait well either it must wait or you must get larry or pip to do it for you said mrs trotteville in an icy voice she went back to her meeting and shut the door fatty stared at buster who had put his tail down at mrs trottevilles annoyed voice thats done it said fatty just when im really on to something edward king the king stables marlow another bit of the jigsaw that was missing and now i cant fit it into the picture because grandads coming why oh why did he have to come today fatty was very fond of his grandfather but it really was most unfortunate that he should have to meet him and entertain him on this day of all days the old mans furniture will be in a horsebox he told buster it might be discovered at any moment but i want to find it buster what a shock for old goon if i produce both the money and the furniture he debated whether to telephone larry or pip and tell them his ideas no he decided if i get them to go over to marlow and snoop about for a horsebox with furniture inside they may make some kind of silly move and spoil everything ill have to put it off till tonight so fatty went to meet his grandfather and entertained him well the whole day any more mysteries asked the twinklingeyed old man in the middle of one i suppose well mind you dont let that fat policeman whats his name goop goon get the better of you i wont grinned fatty ill tell you all about it next time you come grandad he saw his grandfather off at six oclock that evening and then dashed round to pips fortunately larry and daisy were there too bets was delighted to see fatty oh fatty you do look excited has anything happened she asked plenty said fatty and poured out everything the finding of the notes in the hem of the curtains his idea about removal vans which now might be horseboxes or so he hoped and his determination to go to marlow that night and hunt for a horsebox full of furniture ill come with you said larry at once you and pip can both come said fatty well go and see the film called ivanhoe at the cinema first and then when its quite dark well go hunting for horseboxes cant daisy and i come asked bets no this isnt a job for girls said fatty sorry bets old thing you cant come to the cinema with us either because ivanhoe wont be over till late and you two girls cant wait about afterwards for us we may be ages all right said bets oh my goodness isnt it exciting fatty you really are very very clever fancy thinking of the curtain hems i didnt really said fatty honestly i just happened to be holding a hem and it felt well rather stiff but it does clear marian doesnt it she didnt take the money she merely hid it from wilfrid jolly good show why did she disappear then i wonder said daisy i dont know thats a bit of the jigsaw i just simply cant fit in anywhere said fatty still were getting on the three boys cycled off to marlow after an early supper buster unfortunately was not allowed to go with them as cinemas do not welcome dogs he howled dismally when fatty left ivanhoe was exciting and the three boys enjoyed it along with the excitement of the film was an added feeling of delicious suspense the thought of the snooping they meant to do afterwards they didnt even wait to see the short second film but came out into the clear night at the end of ivanhoe ive found out where the stables are said fatty i rang up and inquired kings thought i wanted to hire a horse but i dont the stables arent by the river they are away up on the hill they lighted their lamps and cycled quietly along a country road soon fatty turned to the right up a steep hill this is the way he said good here comes the moon we shant be in the pitchdark tonight they had to get off their cycles because the hill was so steep a private road branched off to the left and the boys walked up it they left their cycles in the shelter of a hedge buildings loomed up near by a horse coughed these must be the stables said fatty in a low voice keep quiet and walk in the shadows nobody appeared to be about the stabledoors were all shut a horse stamped occasionally and one whinnied a little where do they keep the horseboxes whispered fatty i cant see any here look theres another path up there quite a wide one said pip perhaps theyre along there they went up the broad path the moon suddenly shone out brilliantly and lighted every rut in front of them fatty stopped suddenly look see those tyremarks arent they the same pattern as the one in my notebook the one you copied larry you ought to know you made four copies yes they are the same pattern said larry and got out his copy he shone a torch on it though the moonlight was almost brilliant enough for him to read by yes its the same goody were on the right track wilfrid must have taken a horsebox to remove all the furniture and brought it away up here the path went on for quite a way and at last came out into a field no horses were there just then but the boys could see half a dozen in a field a good way down look horseboxes and lorries and carts said pip pointing sure enough neatly arranged in a big comer of the field was a fine collection of horseboxes the boys went over to them look inside each one said fatty there were four and none of them was locked the boys shone their torches inside but to their great disappointment each horsebox was empty save for a few bits of straw fatty was puzzled lets look at the tyres he said find a horsebox with newish tyres the pattern clearly marked but none of the horseboxes had four new tyres and the patterns on them were not a bit the same as the one fatty had seen outside hollies the boys looked at one another now what said pip dead end again better look round a bit said fatty it is possible that wilfrid hid away the horsebox with the furniture so they hunted round they walked across the big field and at the other side was a copse fatty saw a bridlepath leading into the bushes he followed it and suddenly came to a muddy piece where plainly to be seen were tyremarks and each of the three saw at once that they were the ones they were seeking out came fattys notebook yes these are the ones come on were on the trail now they followed the bridlepath and then neatly pushed into a clearing they saw a small horsebox brown said fatty and look heres a scratch on the back wing where it scraped that lamppost now were on the track the boys tried the door it was locked i thought it would be said fatty here give me a shoveup and ill look in at the window half a mo ive dropped my torch he picked it up and flashed it on then pip and larry hoisted him up to look into the window of the horsebox he saw that it was badly broken he flashed his torch inside yes the furniture is here he called softly all of it hallo wait whats this before he could say any more to the others a loud scream came from inside the horsebox it so startled pip and larry that they let go of fatty he fell to the ground with a bump the scream rang out again then came an anguished voice help oh help help me who is it whispered pip scared weve frightened somebody lets go no said fatty i know who it is its marian gosh she has been locked up with the furniture marian fatty rapped on the locked door i say dont be scared can we help you there was a silence and then a trembling voice came from the horsebox who are you just three boys said fatty are you marian yes oh yes but how do you know said the voice ive been locked up here for ages wilfrid locked me in the beast whew said fatty how long have you been there it seems as if ive been here for days said marian i dont know can you let me out i think i can force the door said fatty what a pity the windows so tiny marian you could have got out of it i smashed it hoping some one would hear the noise said poor marian and i yelled till i couldnt yell any more that beast of a wilfrid got a horse and dragged the box into some safe place where nobody could hear me ill soon have you out said fatty and took out a leather case of finely made tools small but very strong he chose one and began to work at the door with it something snapped fatty tried the handle and the door opened a whitefaced girl stood there smiling through her tears oh thank you she said ive been so miserable what made you come here tonight its a long tale said fatty would you like us to take you back to your mother shes frantic about you and what about food i hope youve had something to eat and drink while youve been kept prisoner yes wilfrid put plenty of stuff in the box said marian not that i could eat much hes a beast i agree said fatty i suppose he kept on worrying you to tell him where your grandfather kept his money how do you know about all this said the girl in wonder yes wilfrid got into debt and he asked my grandad his greatuncle to give him some money and grandad wouldnt wilfrid was very angry he knew grandad kept his money hidden somewhere and he asked me where it was and did you know said fatty yes i did said marian grandad told me a little while ago but often enough ive seen the old man grope about under this chair and that when he thought i wasnt there to feel if his money was safe but i never told a soul you remember that morning you washed the curtains said fatty did wilfrid ask you again for the money then to tell him where it was yes and i told him i knew but that i wouldnt ever tell a mean thing like him said marian he said he only wanted to borrow some and hed put it back later but i knew him better he would never repay it go on said fatty well that morning he said all right marian when youve gone i shall come back and hunt everywhere and ill find it you see if i dont and i was dreadfully afraid that he would so you were very very clever and sewed the pound notes into the hem of the curtains said fatty marian gave a little scream oh how do you know all this surely wilfrid hasnt found them oh ive worried and worried since ive been shut up here i wanted to tell grandpa not to be upset if he couldnt find his money id got it safe for him but i didnt have a chance its all right the notes are still inside the hems said fatty it was a brilliant hidingplace tell me what made wilfrid come and take away the furniture well that afternoon wilfrid came to see me at my home said marian he said hed been to hollies and grandad was moaning and crying because his money had gone and wilfrid accused me of taking it he said hed get the police if i didnt share it with him well well what a pleasant person our wilfrid is said fatty i swore i hadnt got the money i said it was still at hollies in the livingroom in a place hed never find said marian and i told him id get it myself the next day and take it to a bank where wilfrid couldnt possibly get his hands on it i see so he took a horsebox in the middle of the night and went and quietly collected every bit of furniture from the livingroom said fatty he meant to go through every stick of it at his leisure and find that money before you took it to the bank yes but he couldnt find it because it was in the curtains and he didnt think of taking those down said marian and oh dear when he went through the furniture and ripped it to pieces he still couldnt find the money of course so he got me up here by a trick pushed me into the van and locked the door but why said fatty puzzled oh he was quite mad quite beside himself said marian trembling as she remembered he said i could either find the money myself in the furniture or if i was lying i could tell him where id hidden the money in my own home and here ive been ever since shouting and yelling but nobody heard me and each day wilfrid comes to ask me if ive got the money or will tell him where it is hes mad he must be said fatty cheer up marian everythings all right well take you back home and tomorrow well deal with dear wilfrid will you come up to the hollies at halfpast ten well be there and you can take the money out of the curtains yourself oh yes i must do that said marian how do you know all these things its queer to find you three boys here in the middle of the night telling me all kinds of things you walk along with us to where weve left our bikes said fatty taking marians arm ill tell you how we know as much as i can anyhow larry take the number of this horsebox will you the boys took marian back to where they had left their bicycles passing the quiet stables as they went fatty told marian a good deal of his tale and she listened in amazement poor grandad she said he must have been so upset never mind hell be all right when he gets his precious money back how marvellous you three boys are finding out everything like that youre better than the police fatty took marian back to her own home its not so late as you think he told her its not eleven oclock yet look theres still a light in that sidewindow shall i ring the bell for you no ill slip in at the sidedoor and surprise my mother said marian she gave fatty a sudden hug i think youre a marvel ill be up at hollies at halfpast ten tomorrow morning without fail with some scissors to undo the hems she disappeared fatty waited till he heard the sidedoor open and shut softly then he and the others went to get their bicycles from the front hedge good work wasnt it he said with much satisfaction my word yes said larry gosh i was so scared when i heard marian screaming in the van that i let go of you fatty you came down an awful bump thats all right said fatty in great good humour my word what an evening who would have thought that wilfrid would shut marian up like that he must be in great need of money to do such a thing i have an idea that that smartly dressed young man is going to get into considerable trouble serve him right said pip he deserves it i think marian is a jolly nice girl i thought she couldnt have stolen that money they were now cycling quickly home pip began to feel uncomfortable i say he said im going to get into trouble too being out late like this i would as well if my people didnt happen to be out said larry youre lucky fatty your people never seem to mind im older than you are said fatty and wiser if you get into trouble tonight pip just say that something unexpected happened that you cant tell about but that everything will be explained tomorrow morning right said pip what are you going to do now fatty i bet i know youre going to ring up superintendent jenks quite right go to the top of the class said fatty well we part here see you tomorrow morning halfpast ten at hollies bring the girls too fatty put away his bicycle when he got home and let himself in at the sidedoor his parents were playing bridge in the lounge good he wouldnt disturb them he would telephone superintendent jenks from his mothers bedroom where there was an extension not from the hall he could say what he liked there he tiptoed to his mothers room and shut the door he went to the telephone and gave police headquarters number a voice answered almost immediately police station here is superintendent jenks in asked fatty if not ill ring his private number its important hes not here ill give you his private number said the voice banks thank you said fatty and rang off he telephoned again and got the private number he heard the superintendents voice almost at once yes what is it frederick trotteville here said fatty first of all my hearty congratulations sir on your promotion thanks frederick said the superintendent but i dont imagine that youre ringing me up at almost midnight just to tell me that no sir said fatty the fact is weve done a bit of work on that hollies affair hollies affair oh yes the old man whose money was stolen whose furniture disappeared and then the granddaughter vanished am i right said the super quite right sir said fatty er wait now came the supers voice let me hazard a guess frederick youve found the money youve located the furniture and youve got the girl am i right well yes sir said fatty with a laugh how did you know oh i had a report in two days ago from goon in the course of which he complained that master frederick trotteville was greatly hampering the course of justice chuckled the superintendent i imagined that meant you were getting on with the case a lot better than he was actually he said that it was pretty certain the girl had gone off with the money and should be arrested as soon as found did he well hes not quite right said fatty would you care to come along to hollies the bungalow where all this happened at halfpast ten tomorrow morning sir and ill have the whole affair neatly tied up for you right ill

frederick hows little bets is she in on this too oh yes we all are said fatty right sir well all be up at the hollies at halfpast ten good night fatty put down the telephone and rubbed his hands gleefully good good good he was about to do a delighted jig round the room when he stopped no his mothers bedroom was just over the lounge ft would cause quite a lot of trouble for fatty if some one came up to hunt for the elephant stamping round the room above ill go and find old buster he thought i can hear him scraping at my bedroom door now im coming buster good news old thing get ready to bark your head off buster hurrah quite a pantomime quite a lot of people walked up holly lane the next morning fatty larry daisy pip and bets went first talking excitedly bets and daisy had been tremendously thrilled the night before when pip and larry had crept in to tell them the news of the marlow adventure fatty went up the front path took the key from his pocket and unlocked the door mr henri at the window next door saw them and left his couch in a minute or two be was walking up the path good morning he said you did not leave me the key frederick and that young man what is his name ah yes wilfrid he was annoyed to find i did not have it he said he had forgotten his own key and wished to enter hollies to see that all was right oh he did did he said fatty thought hed have one more hunt round i suppose good thing he didnt he is coming back again soon said mr henri good couldnt be better said fatty the more the merrier would you like to stay mr henri there is going to be a bit of a do here soon you might enjoy it after all youve been in this affair almost from the beginning i stay with pleasure said mr henri beaming ah who comes now its marian said fatty he darted to the door to meet her she looked much better now she smiled round at the others then she saw the empty room oh how queer it looks without the furniture she said her eyes went to the curtains she put out a hand and felt one of the hems fatty smiled at her jolly good hems arent they he said marian i wonder if youd be sweet enough to go and sit in the back bedroom till we call you i want to produce you as a sort of well sort of surprise yes ill go said marian but let me leave the door open i want to hear everything youre setting the scene as if a play was going to be acted said bets giggling well a play is about to be acted said fatty now whos this it was mr goon he looked a bit puzzled as he rode up to the gate he got off his bicycle wheeled it up to the front door and put it against the wall fatty opened the door for him welcome he said mr goon scowled what are you doing here he said youd better clear orf the superintendents coming he wants particularly to talk to me about this here case ive got all my notes with me so just you clear orf and keep that dog away from my ankles or ill report him to the super sit buster said fatty my word mr goon what a sheaf of notes youve got wonderful work have you solved the mystery no mystery about it said goon scornfully that girl went off with the money and the furniture ill soon have my hands on her ive had information where she is really said fatty anywhere in this district goon snorted no miles away anyway im not saying any more youre not going to pick my brains me and the superintendent are going to have a good talk and youd better clear out before he comes get along now here he is said fatty as a sleek black policecar drew up at the gate and the superintendent got out with a plainclothes man behind him bets tore out to meet him he swung her up into the air if it isnt young bets well well how nice to see you again well daisy how are you larry pip frederick you all look very merry and bright i told them you were coming sir but they wouldnt buzz off said goon hoping that the superintendent would take the hint and send the five away but he didnt he asked who mr henri was and fatty explained goon rustled his sheaf of notes and coughed the superintendent turned and looked at him sharply got something to say goon he inquired well sir yes of course sir said goon looking hurt i supposed you wanted to see me about this hollies case sir if you could just send these kids away oh no they may have something to say that would help us goon said his chief they may even know a few things that we dont know goon looked most disbelieving theres really not much to this case sir he said just a bad girl who robs her old grandfather of his money gets away with his furniture too and does a disappearing act but i thought she was a girl of very good character goon said the super girls like that dont suddenly do wicked things how do we know she stole the money anyway she didnt said fatty to goons surprise nobody stole it youre potty said goon quite forgetting himself wheres this money then if nobody stole it the girl hid it said fatty she was afraid her cousin wilfrid would get it if she didnt put it somewhere safe pah said goon what a tale ill believe that if you show me where she hid the money right said fatty and stepped to the curtains he put his finger and thumb into the hem whose stitches he had snipped the day before and pulled out a pound note he displayed it to goon mr henri and superintendent jenks they all stared in surprise and goon gaped his mouth open in amazement see a pound note said fatty and took another from the hem rather as if he were doing a conjuring trick the hems of the curtains are full of these notes a firstclass hidingplace you remember that marian the girl was washing and ironing curtains dont you on the morning of the supposed robbery mr goon well wilfrid came and threatened to look for the money when she had gone if she didnt give it to him then and there and she was scared hed find it so she took it from its hidingplace wherever that was and undid the curtainhems to make a new hidingplace said the superintendent sewed them all up again too a most ingenious girl this marian mr goon swallowed two or three times he could find nothing at all to say mr henri laughed in delight very neat he said and now will you tell us where the lost furniture is yes pah said goon unable to stop himself what did you say goon asked his chief can you tell us where the furniture is no and nobody can said goon nobody saw it go nobody knows who took it nobody knows where it is ive had it searched for everywhere frederick can you throw any light on this subject asked the superintendent yes said fatty wilfrid and another man came at midnight and carried it out piece by piece gah said goon anybody would think you were there well as it happened i was said fatty it was taken away in a horsebox got the number larry yes okx and it is now in that same horsebox rather the worse for wear in a copse near the stables belonging to kings in marlow i can take you there any time you like mr goon youve got the money youve got the furniture but you havent got the girl said goon and ive had information where she is thats clever of you mr goon said fatty you tell me where you think she is and ill tell you where i think she is i have information here that shes gone across to ireland said mr goon and i have information that shes in the next room said fatty with a grin marian are you there and to mr goons undying amazement marian walked shyly into the room mr henri gave an exclamation he had wondered who marian was the superintendent glanced at his amazed plainclothes officer and winked quite a pantomime he said and the plainclothes man grinned and nodded he moved forward and asked marian a few questions where had she been since she disappeared why had she gone away he wrote down her answers rapidly while goon listened in the utmost astonishment i understand then that these three boys found you locked up in the horsebox last night he said and that your cousin wilfrid was responsible for detaining you there here wait a minute said goon unable to believe his ears you say these kids found her in that horsebox how did they know about it why wasnt i told frederick telephoned me last night said his chief quite rightly too it is possible that you might not have believed him goon goon collapsed his face went slowly purple and he turned and looked out of the window that boy that toad of a boy and now all we want to complete the merry little company is our friend wilfrid said the superintendent i imagine that even you cant supply him frederick fatty was about to say sorrowfully that no he was afraid he couldnt when he heard the frontgate click he looked out of the window and saw wilfrid yes wilfrid had chosen that moment to come back and hunt round once again for the money he saw that the door was now open and hurried to go inside he stepped over the threshold and stopped abruptly the plainclothes man moved casually beside him oh said wilfrid whats all this something happened then he saw his cousin and went very white marian what are you doing here you thought i was still in the horsebox didnt you said marian well im not im here ive come to get the money of grandads i hid away see in the hem of the curtains you wont get it wilfrid you wont have it to pay your bills wilfrid stared at the notes that marian was pulling out of the curtainhem he ran his hand over his forehead then he made a sudden backward dart for the door but the plainclothes man was there and a hand with fingers of steel gripped wilfrids arm and held him fast dont go yet wilfrid said the superintendent there are quite a lot of questions we want to ask you his voice was suddenly different from the merry kindly voice that the children were used to bets shivered a little the super was their friend their very good friend but to people like wilfrid he was an implacable enemy stern and unyielding wilfrid stood before him as white as a sheet trembling from head to foot johns you and goon stay here and let him tell you about the midnight move said the superintendent where he parked the van and everything then take him along to the police station ill be there in an hour right sir said johns the plainclothes man goon muttered something but nobody could catch what he said still as nobody listened it didnt matter poor goon he looked very downcast as the five children and marian went away with the superintendent mr henri went with them and said goodbye at the gate i have such a story to tell to my sistair he said please to come and see us soon au revoir where are we going asked bets hanging on to the burly superintendents arm well isnt there some place here that sells icecreams and macaroons said the big man i had an early breakfast and i dont often see you id like to stand you all a treat this morning marian too she looks as if she wants feeding up a bit been starved in that horsebox i expect marian i couldnt eat very much she said but im quite all right now thank you so is my mother she was so thankful to see me id still be a prisoner if it wasnt for these three boys ah here is the place i mean said the superintendent stopping outside the spotlessly clean dairy yes best macaroons i ever had in my life came from here in we go and in they went buster too much to the surprise of the little diarywoman who didnt expect quite so many customers all at once seven and a dog who was as good as a customer any day because he was just as fond of macaroons and icecreams as the children were er twentyone macaroons please oh i beg your pardon buster twentyfour i mean said the superintendent and a first round of eight icecreams and orangeade for everyone but the dog yes sir said the dairywoman and hurried away she brought the orangeade at once the other things are just coming she said the superintendent lifted his glass let us drink to the day when frederick trotteville becomes my righthand man he said fatty blushed with pride and they all drank heartily then fatty lifted his glass to my future chief superintendent jenks he said and everyone again drank heartily now only the superintendent had any orangeade left ah cant waste it he said to the five findouters and dog many happy mysteries yes we all wish them that many more mysteries and may each one be more mysterious than the last
