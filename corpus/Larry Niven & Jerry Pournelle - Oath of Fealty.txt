 the invaders elsewhere in los angeles it was late afternoon but here was only twilight the three invaders peering out of the orange grove were deep in shadow the sky blazed behind them and sent chinks of bluewhite light through the trees to make the shadows darker there was a fresh smell of fertilizers and crushed orange peel carried on the warm santa mia wind close ahead the eastern face of todos santos was a black wall across the world thousands of balconies and windows in neat array showed in this light as no more than a faceless void seen through gray leaves a sharpedged black rectangle blotting out the sky the invaders blinked as they searched through uncertain light and froze at the thunder of wings above nobody was about they had watched the grounds tenders leave they had seen no guards there the girl pointed her voice was no louder than the leaves rustle in the wind there the two boys stared until they made out a square outline barely visible at the base of the towering wail it seemed about mansized the big door she said were still a good way away it doesnt look it but that door is thirty feet high the little one is to the left of it i cant find it said one of the boys he giggled suddenly and stopped as suddenly he said nervous me the other boy was lean and sketchily bearded and he carried a black case on a strap he stared at tiny lights set on its top then said run for the big door until you see the little one on the count three two one go he ran holding the case in front of himself to cushion against shock the others lagged behind they were carrying a much larger box between them the leader was already taking things out of the case when they came puffing up this lousy light he panted bad for the guards too said the girl its late afternoon everywhere but here at night theyd know they couldnt see theyd be watching harder the other boy grinned well give em a hell of a shock there was a sign on the door below a large deaths head it said if you go through this door you will be killed it was repeated in spanish japanese chinese and korean subtle arent they the girl said she stiffened as the bearded boy pushed the door open there was no sudden wail of alarms and they grinned at each other for a moment of triumph they dodged through fast the bearded boy closed the door behind them life in the state of nature is solitary poor nasty brutish and short thomas hobbes leviathan the watchers joe dunhill polished his badge on his sleeve and plucked imaginary lint from the crisp blue of his uniform the door was still there still marked central security authorized personnel only he took a deep breath and reached for the small button at one side before his finger could touch it there was a faint buzzing sound and the door opened the room inside gleamed with steel and chrome and formica a policeman with metal sergeants chevrons on his collar sat at a desk facing the door there was nothing on the desk but a small tv screen yeah officer dunhill reporting for duty the older man raised an eyebrow bit early for the evening shift yes sir i thought there might be paper work my first day and all the sergeant smiled faintly computers take care of that dunhill he frowned oh yeah youre the new man from seattle pd guess you had a pretty good record up there want some coffee he turned to a machine on one side of the room uh guess so light and sweet please the sergeant pushed buttons the machine thought for a moment then whined faintly the sergeant held out a molded plastic mug here you go joe tasted experimentally hey thats good the surprise was obvious in his voice well of course itsoh youre new here look all the coffee machines in todos santos make good coffee we wouldnt have em here if they didnt boss lady bought a thousand of these even clichйs die joe dunhill thought whyd you leave seattle the question sounded casual and maybe joe thought maybe it is and maybe not todos santos made me an offer i couldnt refuse the sergeants smile was friendly but knowing dunhill i wasnt on the board that decided to hire you but ive heard the story i think you got a raw deal thanks yeah but i wouldnt have hired you if it was left up to me oh joe didnt know what to say to that not because you shot that punk id have done the same thing myself then why not because i dont think you can do the job i was a damned good policeman joe said i know you were and probably still are and thats the trouble we dont have police here the sergeant laughed at joes blank stare we look like police right badges uniforms guns some of us but we arent police dunhill were security people and theres a lot of difference he came over to put his hand on joes shoulder look i hope you work out lets go he led joe out of the reception room and down a long hail to a closed door did they tell you about the locking system we use here the sergeant asked not really well everybody in todos santos has an id badge theres some kind of electronic magicwell hell it might as well be magic for all i know it opens locks if youve got the right badge for it residents badges open their own doors that kind of thing security badges open a lot of doors he waved his own badge at the door in front of them nothing happened but not this one security centrals kind of special what happeils is we alert the inside duty officer they waited for a few moments then the door opened into a small dimly lit room the size of a closet the door behind them closed then another door in front of them opened onto a much larger and even more dimly lit room there were tv screens around all four walls banks of them with uniformed men seated in front of each bank in the center of the room was a huge circular console with dozens of dials and buttons more tv screens were built into the console a uniformed captain wearing a tiny telephone headsetmicrophone sprawled in a comfortable chair in the middle of the center console dunhill captain the sergeant said first day assigned to blake the captain nodded thanks adler welcome aboard dunhill isaac blake had a square face with roundness shaping under the square chin a square body also turning round blackandwhite hair with the white winning he lolled at ease before the bank of tv screens and sipped coffee every twenty seconds or so he touched a knob and the pictures shifted there seemed no order to the flow of pictures now the camera looked down on the heads of hundreds of shoppers strolling along a mall brightcolored clothing that looked strange because the light was artificial but the scene was so large that you expected it to be sunlight now a view of a big dining hail now a view through the orange groves looking up at todos santos standing a thousand feet tall whewthis is one big city even on a tv screen blake nodded yeah it still gets to me sometimes his fingers moved and the view shifted to look along one side wall seen from that angle the twomile length seemed to stretch on forever the kaleidoscope continued sparse traffic in a subway interior halls stretching far away people on moving belts people on es calators people in elevators a dizzying view down onto a balcony where a nude hairy man sprawled in obscene comfort on an air mattress thirty men and women seated at a long bench soldering tiny electronic parts onto circuit boards chatting gaily and working almost without looking at what they were doing the camera switched to the greensward beyond todos santoss perimeter where a dozen pickets lethargically marched about with signs end the nest before it ends humanty said one blake sniffed and touched buttons the scene jumped to a pretty girl in a miniskirt carrying a bag of groceries the camera followed her down a long hall from an escalator zooming along to keep her in closeup as she walked into a small alcove when she took her badge out of her purse the door opened and she went inside leaving the door standing open while she set the bag down on an eames chair for a moment the screen showed an expensive apartment meticulously clean thick rugs paintings on the walls the girl was unbuttoning her blouse as she came to the door and closed it like to watch the rest of that show blake muttered he turned a lazy smile toward joe dunhill of course we arent supposed to do that dunhill said nope cant either oh ive noticed you havent shown up the inside of any apartment i guess i wouldnt want cameras in my bathroom either oh weve got them there blake said but they dont go on without authorizationtheres one now he touched his headset captain ill take that interior call right the tv screen ificked to show a kitchen a small boy was pulling things out of cabinets scattering flour on the floor and carefully mixing in salt preparatory to pouring a bottle of sherry across the mess blake reached forward to a button under the screen he waited a moment then said into the tiny headset microphone maam this is central security somebody pushed the panic button in the kitchen and i think youd better have a look out there yes maam its safe but you ought to hurry he waited on the screen above a woman midthirties not very attractive at the moment because her hair was partly in curlers and partly in wet strings came into the kitchen looked down in horror and shouted peter then she looked up with a smile and moved closer to the camera thank you officer she said blake smiled back for no sane reason and touched a dial the picture faded joe dunhill watched in concentration sergeant adler had been right this was no kind of police work hed ever seen he turned to blake i dont get it you just skip around sort of of course there are exceptions like when somebody asks us to keep an eye on things but mostly we watch what we feel like after a while you get some judgment about the feels but wouldnt it be better to have assigned places instead of jumping around bosses dont think so they want us alert who can be alert just staring at one scene all the time the math boys worked it out how many of us how many tv screens each probability of troubleover my head but it seems to work joe digested that uhseems to me id be more valuable out on the streets responding to calls blake laughed after youve been here a year maybe theyll put you where you interact with stockholders if you work out the kaleidoscope above continued a moving beltway with some kids walking on a balcony above it blake touched controls and the camera zoomed in on the kids after a moment the kaleidoscope started up again think about it blake said in seattle you were a cop and out among the civilians you worried about making good arrests right best way to get promoted sure well in here its different blake suddenly frowned and set down his cup it took joe dunhill a moment to realize that blake was no longer interested in the conversation and another to see why he was staring it wasnt the screen at all a blue light to the side had lit up on the roof he said with a question in his voice then with more confidence visitor how did he get up there blake played with the controls the screen jumped with disconnected pictures flashing views of four square miles of roof the curtained windows of the sky room night club golfers on the golf course a view down onto one of the invertedpyramid shapes of an air well plunging down in narrowing steps each one story high and lined with windows then a forest of skeletal structures a childrens playground empty at the moment then another jungle gym with a dozen kids hanging like bats the olympic swimming pooi with a wide shallow childrens wading pool just beyond baseball diamond football field on the todos santos roof was every kind of playground for child or adult then beyond a low fence an empty area bags of concrete and piles of wood for forms cement mixer idle at the moment the camera zoomed to the mixer id badge blake muttered visitor badge must be stuffed into the cement mixer what the hell for and whats he doing up there the tv screen flowed across the roof again searching there cried joe dunhill yeah i see him doesnt seem to be carrying anything might have been though well have to search the roof detectors would have picked up anything metal and theres not a lot worth bombing up there but well have to look anyway the figure moved rapidly along the twelvefoot fence between him and the edge he was hunched over a caricature of a man sneaking he found a gap in the fence hesitated and moved into it blake grinned hah maybe we wont have to send anyone up after all hes found the diving board thats not the pool area i know sometimes i wonder about rand you know about tony rand hes the chief architect for this place rands high board isnt in the pool area ui watch if hes really a leaper we wont have to call anyone blake touched another button captain i have the bandit on the roof area looks like hes going to dive blake fiddled with the knobs the picture sharpened he had been following the fence for thirty minutes looking for a way to reach the edge the fence seemed endless and he wondered if he could climb it and if there were alarms todos santos was said to be very big brother then he saw the opening there was a cement mixer nearby and he pushed the visitor badge into it the badge wasnt his and told nothing about him but it was the last possible clue maybe theyd find it and maybe not he moved on to the gap in the fence there was a big sign watch your step he did not smile his long unhandsome face was dead calm as if he had never smiled and never would he turned into the channel of fencing it was just wider than his shoulders the channel ended in a steel ladder through the steps he could see the orange groves and parks far below then beyond them the tiny shapes of city houses some with the blue splash of a swimming pool all looking like miniatures he pressed his forehead against the cold metal and looked down a fifth of a mile down to the green landscape around todos santos a thousand feet to oblivion he climbed the steps the situation was strange the steps ended in a long narrow rectangle he tested it with his foot wood padded with burlap and it shook slightly a highdiving board he walked out on the board and looked down the balconies receded in perspective until they merged with blank wall the parkiand below was a green blur a view more mathematical than real parallel lines meeting at infinity so here was the end of a dull and thwarted life he was carrying no identification after a fall like that they would never know who he was let them wonder the board bounced as he shifted his weight butbut suppose he jumps joe dunhill asked well we dont advertise it but theres a net that comes out when he passes the spyeyes then we just collect him and eject him let him give his bad publicity to someone else blake told him does this happen all the time you dont look particularly interested oh im interested ive got five bucks in the pool see that chart blake waved at the far wall where chalk marks said laughing backed out jumped terrified thats this quarters talley work it out said blake the roof of this place is eight miles of sheer cliff we get every wouldbe suicide west of the rockies and some from new england and japan but the highdiving board is the only access to the edge and it does have a funny effect on people blake frowned and scratched his neck he sure looks like a jumper if he backs out i stand a fair chance to win the man stood straddlelegged at the end of the board brooding above a thousandfoot drop the picture of melancholy until a gust of wind slapped across him and suddenly he was dancing on one leg and waving his arms maybe not blake said the jumper was reflexively fighting for his life the gust died suddenly and he almost went off the other side of the board he wound up on hands and knees he stayed there gripping the board presently he began backing toward the ladder when he reached the steps he stayed stooped and backed down placing his feet very carefully leapers off captain blake called right got a detail going after him joe asked some of them laugh yeah its a funny picture isnt it youre going to kill yourself its the most powerful statement you can make about the way the world has treated you thats what rand says anyway and when you finally get there theres a highdiving board to add ten feet to the drop joe shook his head grinning they dont all back out once i watched a woman stand up there take off her overcoatshe wasnt wearing anything under it bounce once and take off in a really gorgeous swan dive he smiled then shook himself but the board turns off a lot of them rand isnt any dummy he built todos santos and hes still building it if you know what i mean hes always tinkering around id like to meet him you will fat chance joe thought what happens to the leaper one of the bosses will talk to him standing orders rand wants to know what makes them tick maybe think of ways to discourage them blake looked at his watch this one may have a wait theres a bigwig from canada coming in for a visit and all the brass will be busy can we hold him joe asked i mean civil rights and all sure some of us are real live cops blake said its a legal thing todos santos is legally a city sort of but the insurance is cheaper if most of us are security officers rather than peace officers but we are a city we even have a jail judges too but they dont get much work corporation people take care of civil matters and felonies go to the la county district attorney it sure is different here joe blinked and leaned closer to the screen hey what i saw a light flash that one urn tunnel area we better check thats critical territory he did things to the console and a row of lights flashed green nobody there who doesnt belong there you sure you saw sornething almost sure probably some maintenance troop had his badge inside a tool box blake yawned get me another coffee sure preston sanders ranked high in the todos santos hierarchy high enough to rate the enormous office furnished as he liked it with abstract paintings and maps of ski slopes a teakbordered tv screen nearly covering one wall showed motion pictures of ski events the ffickering motions shifting from thirdperson to overtheshoulder views of an expert taking the worlds steepest slopes and jumps generally drove his visitors to ask for something else but preston loved them the furniture was mahogany and teak even the panels of the desk console were covered with teak and there were dark wood borders on the tv screens on the desk and on the walls when sanders had explained the decor he wanted tony rand had characteristically remarked matched set eh sanders thought of that sometimes it was true enough sanders was the color of oiled teak and tony rand had meant the remark exactly as it sounded sanders looked up at rand who was doing his best to ignore the gutwrenching view of the olympic jump i used to wonder about you preston said you dont have any racial prejudice raised that suddenly by a black man the subject would have jarred some whites rand said should i and still not looking at the tv screen with its instant vertigo finished pouring coffee from the silver samovar he tipped a dollop of sanderss brandy carlos primero and far too good to be put into coffeeinto the coffee certainly its normal so i wondered and i finally got the answer you still think of todos santos as practice for building a starship dont you sure pres i built todos santos who should know better than me we could start building the ships right now the design is straightforward what we cant do is build a technological society thats selfsufficient with only a few thousand members did the directors know you thought that way im surprised they even let you work on this place they could have picked someone who thought it was an end in itself it isnt i dont think the directors think so they think its practice for better arcologies it is too were too dependent on los angeles but well learn what we didnt put in the design and the next one will have it brandy not just now ive got to see art before he gets tied up with a visiting firemansurprised you dont know about him sanders reached to the teak panel and turned a dial the olympic scene vanished to be replaced with a view of los angeles as seen from the top of todos santos i know about him i convinced bonner id be busy all day what was your great contribution to race relations well one day i said to myself here i am one of a couple of hundred black people in a building the size of a city and im art bonners deputy and heres tony rand flying a starship in his head with a single black man in the bridge crew then it came to me im the token alien and youre studying me rand grinned slowly token alien on the bridge interesting listen if youll tell me your token skin color ill tell you the shape of your token ears green pointed they grinned at each other rand said tell you something there are aliens on the bridge and you arent either of them and yes im studying them will you grant me that art bonner is a genius sure preston said without hesitation i know what the top job in this place involves nobody else could do it think youd catch me trying all right is barbara churchward a genius sanders frowned for a moment i dont work the economics department much art thinks so he frowned again aha i think i see what youre driving at right tony rand said now theyve both got those implants rands face took on a strange look almost sanders thought one of intense longing like an exile looking across the sea toward home wonder what its like to know anything you want to just by asking anyway we can think of both of them as mancomputer interfaces what i have to decide is just how important is the computer link they were both geniuses before the implant link went in the tv screen showed the phallic shape of the los angeles city hall jutting up through the smog sanders tuned the picture more sharply and the implants are hideously expensive preston said i see you have to decide if the officers of your starship need them anyway or of my next arcology so you tell me are those two just geniuses or are they now something more how the devil would i know just on the odds i thought you might be a genius yourself i mean the only black man in the command staff of todos santos must have had something more than the usual going for him oh you idiot query it doesnt take that it takes a certain amount of intelligence plus being willing to take the responsibilities for the orders you give and he stopped ifinching at the word he had been about to use and he looked to see if rand had guessed but his problem was just the opposite rand without the faintest idea of what he was talking about was waiting for him to all right preston said we play the politics game here it means a lot of interpersonal friction a lot of compromises between one guy who thinks hes got the right answer and another guy who thinks he does i get caught in the middle a lot maybe more than anyone because im more noticeable sanders shrugged so i put up with it i give in a lot even when i know im right there are people who would call that tomming tomming uncle tom but you give more orders than you take rand would never understand it was the trait that kept him out of todos santoss micropolitics you tried to manipulate him and suddenly he was somewhere else redesigning your closet space while you were trying to get someone fired which was why sanders generally felt comfortable with rand tony rand was no threat like art bonner he was someone you could trust all the way but if he ever does get involved sanders thought if he ever does hes going to be a dangerous man true maintenance was part of operationsbut the maintenance supervisors would probably side with the chief engineer if it came to a choice maybe not openly but sanders had a mental image of someone trying to lever rand and ending up with his sink connected to his toilet while his air conditioning poured out eau d skunk his face split into a wide grin rand said something do the name sir george reedy mean anything to you hes the chap you ducked out of meeting the canadian whos come to study todos santos ive been watching for his helicopter i thought youd changed the scene to be polite and tonysir george has an implant uh i guess hes worth talking to then rand looked thoughtful more than you know he got the implant as a favor someone owed his family i doubt that he was a genius before the implant went in oh ho rand glanced at his new toy a bulova dali watch as thin and flexible as the sleeve of his shirt uhi think i ought to see about some details he said maybe i can get free for the afternoon pres thanks rand left hurrying followed by that white grin the grin slipped away as sanders followed private thoughts his family had never been enslaved undoubtedly someone had been somewhere but from as early as the furthest back anyone could trace the sanderses had been free negroes working for the united states government in washington his father had been a public health service physician sanders himself had gone to the best private schools where they were so liberal they wouldnt even think the word nigger and how i hated those snotty bastards sanders remembered he looked down at his dark hands and wondered at himself so why dont i hate mead and letterman and the others the ones who get nervous talking to me he straightened remembering and used the console controls to change the view on the tv from eastward toward la to westward toward the ocean a joystick control moved the camera until he saw a brightly colored shape in the afternoon sky and he zoomed in on it frank mead shouting happily as he hung from the doublewinged hang glider mead wasnt overweight he was just big and it took a specially designed glider to carry him mead was one of them one who made no secret that he thought preston sanders was going to blow it one day so why dont i hate him preston wondered he makes me nervous but i dont hate him why because i dont share the black experience thats what my roommate at howard would have said or because were all doing something we believe in were running a civilization something new in this world and dont bother to tell me how small it is its a civilization the first one in a long time where people can feel safe if only they believed in me he got up from his desk it was time for his interview with art bonner ii management has been the success story of a century which has not been one of the most successful centuries in human history in the society which our history books describe everybody worried constantly about rank and precedence nobody today worries about precedence what all these managers worry about is talking to each other peter f drucker managements new role in the future of the corporation herman kahn the managers preston sanders walked briskly along the corridor called executive row not really noticing the thick carpets and the paneled walls dotted with paintings he considered what he had to cover rank ordering priorities for bonnerwho had a million demands to fill and couldnt possibly give sanders everything he wanted the anteroom to bonners office was a study in comfort designed by psychologists to make waiting to see bonner if not pleasant at least as minimally unpleasant as possible delores martine certainly contributed to that feeling sanders knew she was at least as busy as bonnerpossibly even more sobut she always had time to chat with anyone waiting get your work done dee preston said ive got a couple of things to sort out anyway all right mr bonner will be free in just a moment he got a satellite call from zurich from the big bosses the money people who owned todos santos its all right pres assured her really she nodded and began shuffling through papers leaving sanders to his reverie he wanted to think about the labor problem in air shaft but his thoughts strayed to deloresand art banner wonder what happened to those two they were obviously having an affair the year after arts wife left him whod want a casual visitor for a husband and father of her children but dee sees him all day they were at it hot and heavy for a while and then nothing wonder why hes off the phone now delores said thanks sanders went into the inner office art banner leaned back in the black leather chair and put his heels on the walnut desk despite the expensive furniture there was a junkyard look to the office model sailboats shelves full of bricabrac including the truly horrid souvenirs sold in stalls near the boat landings of a dozen touristtrap cities a couple of yachting trophies and mixed with all the nautical stuff were expensive executive toys of every conceivable variety most of them ridiculous there were also books opened and left on the credenza some piled two deep no one would accuse art banner of compulsive neatness the tv screen on the wall showed a holographic view of todos santos in all its complexity zurich problems again sanders asked a few opecs raising prices next month thank god weve got our own power sources bonner said if we can keep them thats my top problem sanders said bonner sighed yeah okay unload the bag pres but youll have to make it fast my visiting fireman is early for the cocktail hour he frowned slightly and the hologram faded from the tv screen replaced by a view from the roof looking toward the los angeles city hall a dark speck came toward them the building was a thousand feet in height rising starkly from a square base two miles on a side it rested among green parklands and orange groves and low concrete structures so that it stood in total isolation a glittering block of whites and flashing windows dotted with colors the sheer bulk dwarfed everything else in view magnificent sir george reedy crowded against the window of the los angeles fire department helicopter then turned in wonder to his host he had to shout above the thrum of the motor mister stevens ive seen it on tv of course but i had no idea maclean stevens nodded todos santos independency affected everyone that way and stevens was long accustomed to the reaction that didnt make him feel any better about it los angeles was a great city too if youll look out there beyond it sir george you can see the catalina island development closer on the mainland the city marina is just off to our right we think del rey and catalina are significant developments in their own way sir george reedy dutifully looked off toward the sea ah i was going to ask about that i saw it when we flew in the great white mass the iceberg i might have known stevens thought five hundred billion gallons worth of antarctic iceberg had been towed into santa monica bay los angeles water had never tasted better arizona san francisco and the sea gulls of mono lake had never been happier the berg sat out there in a kind of tub there were teams of climbers going up two faces and a dozen boy scouts glissading down snow near the bottom romulus corporation tows the icebergs here theyre the ones who built todos santos too there was no way to get off the subject of todos santos stevens gave in gracefully and called the pilot captain if youll just circle todos santos for sir george the whine of the turbines changed subtly as the big red chopper curled in a tight circle it traced the perimeter of the parks surrounding the huge building to their left was todos santos and its outlying moat of orange groves and green parklands reedy peered down then exclaimed did i see deer likely enough stevens said directly below them where they couldnt see was a ring of shabby houses and decaying apartments maclean stevens did not look down but he was acutely aware of what was below block after block a mockery to city government and all of stevenss hopes houses fllled with families without hope living on welfareand on the leavings from todos santos the turbine whines continually changed pitch as the pilot varied the speed and stevens hoped his visitor wouldnt notice eaters didnt usually shoot at the fire department anyway not anymore but what is that made of sir george asked this is an earthquake area yes they tell me its perfectly safe stevens answered the contracts require that the architect contractors and a lot of the work force have to live inside they put a lot of design sweat into it as to what its made of just about everything the supporting towers are steel trusses mostly the walls dont carry gravity loads and they can be anything that resists the wind stress composites like fiberglass reinforced with carbon ifiaments some of the more advanced compote tuffies lot of concrete on the lower levels see the gaps there the apartment complexes are assembled down below and hoisted into place as units sir george wasnt listening he had lifted his binoculars and was busily staring at the monstrous building fifty levels rose out of the parklands and orange groves below balconies jutted at each level at seemingiy random intervals yet with an overall pleasing pattern he couldnt have explained extralarge balconies protruded and these were covered with tables and chairs where groups of people in brightly colored clothing ate or played cards or did other things not noticeable even with binoculars from a mile away i say some of those people are naked stevens nodded not the diners and card players of course sir george must be spying on individual apartment balconies the inhabitants of todos santos were fond of sunbathing and the balconies were completely private from one another only airborne peeping toms could watch themas if anyone cared all that much in southern california evidently highranking canadians had different standards and what are all those below sir george asked he pointed to a series of low mounds obviously the roofs of underground buildings the mounds were covered with trees and shrubs but concrete driveways led downward to doors at each one stevens shrugged food factories mostly dairies chicken ranches processing sheds for the citrus groves sir george im not really an expert on todos santos youll get better information inside yes of course reedy turned away from his binoculared rubbernecking and looked at stevens with sympathy i forgot its not really part of your city at all is it arent you a bit jealous stevens controlled his face and the grimace he felt the question reminded him of the everpresent sour pain he felt in his guts recently of the wealth yes of the money that flows into it and goes out of the country of the taxes it evades i resent those sir george but i am not jealous of the people who live in that termite hill i see no sir i doubt if you do the bitterness was open now and stevens rushed on heedless of the consequences termites when youre inside notice the similarities caste system remarkably well developed warriors kings queens workers drones all represented and a strong tendency toward identical units within each caste he checked himself before saying more it would be better to let this visiting dignitary see for himself sir george looked an overweight fool and might be one but stevens thought he probably was not he ranked as a deputy minister and stevens had noticed that many englishcanadian officials feigned careless buffoonery i saw demonstrators reedy said yeah stevens answered several varieties too todos santos is not exactly popular with the younger generation why not maybe youll see for yourself and maybe you wont stevens thought maybeah to hell with it the helicopter had turned again and now cruised above a wellmarked ifight path across the orange groves toward the building as the chopper rose the roof came into view the enormous surface was cluttered it was cut into areas by four huge light wells each stepshaped with interior balconies they look like the box the great pyramid came in sir george quipped stevens laughed actually theyre bigger even with the light wells the remaining area was huge there were parks swimming pools miniature golf and a driving range heliports playgrounds with running children corner towers for penthouse residents the highest caste of all what powers it all reedy asked hydrogen stevens said theyve got a complex of nuclear breeder plants in mexico with pipelines running up to todos santos reedy nodded approval hydrogen todos santos doesnt add much to your la smog then no that was part of their contract with the federal government stevens paused some environmentalists are still unhappy though they say todos santos is simply exporting its pollution he was interrupted by the roar of the helicopter as the pilot let the bright red machine settle gently onto a painted circle at one corner of the massive building the roof was so large that it was difficult to realize they were hundreds of feet above ground level men waited for them a brisk wind whipped across the building the wind was cold in the late afternoon and they were glad to get inside one of the low rooftop structures the heliport reception area was not large most of the men in it wore uniforms and carried weapons the guards very politely photographed them if youll just put your hands on this identiplate please sir a guard lieutenant prompted the readout screen was hidden from view of visitors making it impossible to know what the guard found out machinery hummed and spat out two thick plastic badges maclean stevens executive assistant to the mayor of the city of los angeles and sir george reedy deputy minister for internal development and urban affairs dominion of canada their photographs filled half the badges faces and visitor was printed in letters of fire across them please wear these at all times while in the independency the lieutenant said thats very important what would happen if i lost the badge sir george asked his voice was very precise and clipped perfect oxbridge accent it held just the right note of incredulity and contempt and maclean stevens envied it the guard didnt seem to notice that he had been insulted sir it would be very serious our detectors would indicate someone without identification in the independency and officers would be sent it might be embarrassing to you might be dangerous too stevens said lieutenant how many people come in here and never come out sir the guard was frowning now skip it no point in harassing a rentacop the man might not know or stevens thought i might be wrong shall i take sir george or do we need an escort as you choose sir mister bonner the lieutenant lowered his voice as if in fear or reverence or both will be expecting you shortly if youre planning any delay en route please tell us so that we can notify him well probably take a quick tour through the mall thank you very good sir i take it you will not need a routing slip no ive been there before i know you have mr stevens the guard glanced down at the invisible screen have a pleasant stay in todos santos the holographic view of todos santos blinked a blue light and two small blue dots appeared in the heliport reception area my visitors will be here pretty quick pres art banner said anything you cant handle for me no but i want to say it again that hydrogen delivery schedule is very tricky art if the fromates manage to zap an input line this month were hip deep in trouble all right aiready you can have the overtime authorization for your cops bonner frowned bonners pause was momentary almost imperceptible and sanders wondered what his boss was listening to only it wouldnt exactly be listening either what would it be like to have data fed directly into your mind the comptroller wont like you much for it bonner said mead was screaming about budget overruns just yesterday but its your decision hell scream louder if those yippies shut down our power sanders said right have no pity on me i have to account to zurich you dont banners contract gave him complete authority within todos santos he was responsible to the money people whod built the city but they had no right to interfere with how he ran it of course they could always fire him take it as easy as you can banner said his voice became serious it isnt just frank mead zurichs going through cashflow problems just now the orbital construction shack eats money like mad but damn it do what you have to do its my problem and barbaras maybe she can pass a money miracle he turned to the tv screen and pointed the blue dots were moving rapidly downward here they come look weve settled the labor situation in central air control weve promoted three policemen weve got your memo blowing smoke up that vendors arse youre authorized overtime for your patrolmen which is what you came in here for in the first place enough abeady back to the cotton mines rastus yes baas it was easy to talk that way to bonner it hadnt always beenwhich was probably why banner did it pres thought art bonner was damned if hed have a thinskinned deputy you know how to sort the crap banner said well my people will be here shortly drinking and carousing at all hours no doubt the wild and happy life so guess wholl be on duty tonight yes sir sanders said bonner eyed him critically then he thumbed a button in the arm of the big chair delores yes sir the intercom responded dee if mac stevens and that canadian get here before im ready give them the number stall will you yes mister bonner thanks he cut the intercom okay pres whats eating you nothing the hell there isnt talk all right i dont like being in the worry seat chief if youve got to know he thought i like my job it isnt the work and it isnt the responsibility youve never given me anything i cant handle precisely so whats the problem the people out there dont like me as number one number two to you sure im their black man because im your deputy but not in that seat bonner frowned you been getting static who from ill no sanders spread his hands hopelessly dont you understand art youll only make it worse if you have one of your f amous talks withwith anybody about this its nobody in particular anyway they all resent having me in tap charge a lot of them may not even know they resent it the ones that do work like hell at hiding it but i cant make a mistake not even one neither can i bull puckey you cant make a big one i cant make one at all youre telling me to replace you because you cant handle the job if you think that do it i do not think that if i thought it id have replaced you a long time ago banner sighed and shook his head okay you know how to find me but for gods sake see if you cant buy me a couple of hours anyway sure i can always do that sanders said and if the big one comes up and i cant reach you yeah im in charge art i know that good now can i see my visiting canadian we finished sure for now well have lunch on this banner said see delores about when he looked at the array of screens around him they were all bordered nicely in green im giving you a clean board call me when you reach your office as of then youre in charge as sanders left he noticed that the blue dots had moved to a level far below executive row we can talk here if we keep it down the bearded boy sounded uncertain but there were no alarms and he grinned the others nodded and opened one of the boxes the girl took out a gas mask it was warm in the tunnel and she wiped sweat from above her eyes before she put it on iii custom reconciles us to everything edmund burke a tour of termite hill the reception lobby opened onto a roomful of elevators the executive suites are below stevens told sir george we can go straight down or we can take a quick look at this anthill before they assign you a guide but i thought we were expected dont worry about it banner has plenty to keep him busy and he knows exactly where we are really then there is some means of tracking these badges stevens nodded well take a quick swing past some of the outside corridors it wouldnt be fair to take you to the mall first thing whyever not too much to see theres every kind of store in the world and its pretty crowded reedy frowned if its so big why is it crowded surely there arent enough people living here to not the residents stevens said his face held a sour expression angelinos a lot of them come here to shop hell i cant really blame them its convenient all the stores in one place and the subway system to get them here but the money comes in and it never goes back out not back to la anyway but reedy gasped as the floor dropped from under him i say that was abrupt he watched the floor indicator blink rapidly i dont suppose you can restrict your people keep them from coming here how stevens asked we tried that once courts threw out the ordinanceand the voters wouldnt have put up with it anyway didnt matter though todos santos owns the subway system this place is the huband its easier to get from san pedro to the san fernando valley by coming through here than it is to drive a lot easier than riding the bus the elevator door opened onto a broad corridor were on level stevens said mostly small industry electronics assembly waldo operators waldo operators yeah stevens looked as if he were swallowing a live mouse its the latest way todos santos drains off money from la skilled machine operators are scarce a lot of them want to live in todos santos but there arent enough jobs for them here so they live here and work herethe lathes and milling machines are out in la and controlled by tv and a telephonecomputer hookup the technical name is teleoperated systems stevens led the way to a moving pedway watch your step they walked onto the moving black slideway this ones slower than some if you want to get to the other side of the building you go to another floor and catch a fast strip the ceiling was high and the entrances to the chambers off the corridor were no more than a series of closed doors at infrequent intervals there was a splitsecond view of the outside tubs of growing plants stood along some of the walls but there was never any illusion of being anywhere but in a building todos santos built the los angeles subway reedy asked sure they have the capital middle east oil money funneled through zurich also the equipment big semiautomatic tunneling machines matter of fact theyre digging a new one right under my office in city hall with their stuff they can dig for about percent of what it would cost us the inward side of the corridor was another jumble neat signs on the doors announcing electronic shops repair services light industries of one kind or another interspersed with small convenience shops sometimes there was a long series of doors blocked off each with a single sign westinghouse teledyne international security systems oerlikon barclayyamashito ltd stood out as some of the largest they ended at an elevator bank well now that youve seen the drab parts youre ready for the mail stevens said thats a sight not to miss the elevator dropped like a falling safe stevens watched reedys face as the doors opened reedy knew what to expect of course most visitors did and they still took several seconds to make sense of what they were seeing they were looking down a broad corridor that stretched diagonally through the ground floor of todos santos it was almost three miles long moving pedways in the center were a blur of human figures approaching and receding though they stood motionless lines met at infinity the pedways were flanked on both sides by walks and people strolled along these looking into shop windows going in and out of stores clumping to hold animated discussions where they would block the passage of others tiers of balconies rose high above them residents strolled along the balconies or idly leaned over to look down glasssided elevators clung to walls and moved at impossibly high speeds gigantic spaces and wails and a roof enclosing all that was what confused the mind but the real shock was to see all these shoppers taking it so lightly stevens chuckled tell yourself you can get used to anything he led the way out onto the floor they passed under an enormous sign private property permission to pass revocable at any time which means sir george asked exactly what it says stevens answered they stood looking for another moment then mac escorted his visitor onto the pedway strip sir george seemed accustomed to them most new shopping centers and airports had them although not as elaborate as these the outer strip was broad and had seats a series of much narrower strips separated it from another broad seatladen belt in the center each strip moved faster and faster until the inner one flashed past at fifty kilometers an hour they moved progressively across strips until they reached the fast one and sat next to the transparent windscreen partition that moved with them parallel lines converged ahead at the vanishing point there was a mediumsized city poised over their heads mac knew it but he had never been able to sense it not even here in this tremendous room through the plexiglas they could see the flicker of faces and bright clothing of passengers coming in the opposite direction a blur of humanity both sides of the barrier were lined with shops all doing a brisk business reedy noticed a branch of dream masters the chain of fantasy art galleries they swept past a side corridor that led upward to another level with more walkways and conversation areas more changes of level balconies overhanging the pedway itself with more shops there was no special order to the shops but the signs reedy frowned puzzled what was it about the signs on the shops see it the corporation permits advertising mac stevens said but they regulate the size of the signs and theyve got an aesthetics committee that sets up standards if art banner doesnt like something itll probably be found to be unaesthetic sportinggoods shops stationery clothing bicycles restaurants banks electronics music bookstores people moved in and out in random patterns the buildings had a fragile look not made to withstand weather sir george grinned at the sudden incongruous sight of a tobacconists shop built apparently of brick and as solidlooking as a mayan pyramid does anyone buy reedy asked no one seems to carry packages security stevens said visitors have their purchases delivered either to the exit plaza or directly to their homes residents dont usually carry much around either the guards dont like it i should think americans have a long tradition of telling the police off reedy said sure but the residents of todos santos are different i didnt say the guards wont put up with residents carrying packages they just dont like it and the residents dont deliberately annoy the guards theyd rather cooperate they had reached the opposite corner of the building and stevens led the way across the slow strips and finally to the corridor i dont see badges on everyone reedy said in fact not more than half stevens nodded and led the canadian to the end of the diagonal a series of exits funneled the traffic and they went through if we hadnt had unrestricted visiting badges wed have been stopped back there he said the mall is an open area they let in nearly anyone they only watch for known criminals and terrorists his lips tightened with their fast transportation system they siphon off a lot of business from the city he pointed down a long corridor east perimeter mall level mostly apartments of course the outside view is a first choice f or living quarters totally that seems a poor design no not totally theres a mix here as everywhere night clubs restaurants private clubs even some exclusive shops of course any business out here draws only customers from inside except for favorite customers with permanent visitor badges strange said reedy id think theyd want visitors why all the restrictions oh therere reasons stevens indicated a door as they approached it it slid open a redandblueuniformed guard stood inside the rentacop smiled pleasantly as they passed and headed for another bank of elevators about fifty people were waiting for elevators with them all had badges and very few bore the bright visitor label reedy looked at the badges and people saying nothing there was no way to characterize them pick fifty random citizens from any major city and you would find as much variety what was it about them that made them seem like a gathering of distant cousins reedy couldnt put his finger on it the elevator rose swiftly and deposited them at another moving pedway they were on the outside periphery and they passed apartments open areas leading to outside enclosed decks it was obvious that this was an affluent area all right sir george said ive been unable to work it out what is it about the peoplethe sameness they dont dress as flashily as one expects of southern californians but it cant be merely that stevens grinned termites np well i admit i dont know either not completely but did you notice how quiet it was even in the mall among those people whyyes not at all the noise level id have expected is it some regulation custom customs are very powerful here by the way i wouldnt be surprised if some company policeman were listening to us through those badges sir george looked at his badge as if he had discovered a poisonous spider on it do the residents put up with this stevens shrugged resident badges are different or so theyre told but sir george the residents want surveillance its another custom the law and order tradition is very strong in here a kind of siege mentality paranoia oh theyve got their reasons paranoids have enemies too stevens said here thats where were going the exit up ahead have you been following the news the fromates the friends of man and the earth society keep trying to sabotage todos santos not to mention various other hate groups and just plain gangsters out to extort money stink bombs hornet nests that kind of thing mostly but sometimes the terrorists come up with something really nasty like the grenade that killed a dozen people in the crown center arcology in kansas he shrugged helplessly my police havent had much luck at catching them outside so the company has its own police but doesnt that play into the terrorists hands reedy asked one purpose of terror is to provoke a reaction make things so bad that people welcome any change any change that will protect them stevens said the journey ended at another elevator plaza and they took an up car to the executive suite they emerged into thick carpets and walnut paneling it came to sir george that he was lost every resident of todos santos had known that moment of shock save only the children and tony rand one can lose ones way among city streets but being lost in todos santos was like being last in carlsbad caverns lost in three dimensions in a maze almost a cubic mile in extent the moment passed it didnt matter that sir george had followed an impossibly twisted path he had guides he wasnt trapped but there was always that moment maclean stevens was in his midthirties and very athletic while art bonner was ten years older and walked with a limp hed picked up in the army stevenss hair was light tan bonners dark and thinning on top with a bare spot his hair stylist had more and more trouble covering both were tall men over six feet banner perhaps an inch higher and twenty pounds heavier than stevens put that way the two men didnt look alike at all yet those who knew them and sometimes even visitors who met both casually were more impressed with their similarities than their differences it wasnt anything you could put your finger on certainly you would never mistake one man for the other but both looked at people in the same way and both spoke in the same tone the tone of command of a man so thoroughly accustomed to being obeyed that he did not have to raise his voice or resort to threats good to see you again mac banner was saying been a while stevens responded automatically art this is the honorable sir george reedy deputy minister for development and urban affairs for the canadian government sorry were a touch late but i took the liberty of showing sir george the shopping mall sure i know bonner said come in please have a seat drink weve got nearly anything you could possibly want and a lot you wouldnt you sound as if youre showing off reedy said he smiled broadly pimms cup if you please certainly mac the usual yes please bonner waved them to leather chairs and took another in the conversation group with them leaving his desk in the background the office lighting adjusted subtly so that only the conference area stood out there was a low hum in the background otherwise the office was silent quite a place you have here the canadian said im very impressed but he looked uneasy too much of the touch of strange and the moment of being lost was still with him thank you bonner said would you like to see more of it let me show you around he gestured toward the wall and the decorative art works vanished to be replaced by an enormous cutaway view of todos santos in three dimensions colored dots seemed to crawl through the holographic presentation it was all diagrammatic with the toorealistic lines of an architects drawing that vanished to show a montage of color pictures each a blur of motion shops people getting onto a moving pedway a riot of color sir george frowned why thats the route we came here by banner smiled thats right the diagram reappeared you see the moving dots those are members of my staff that we want to keep track of your badges are tagged vip so i was able to see where you went not that i paid a lot of attention but the route is recorded anyway there was a slightly louder hum here we are said banner he was having fun the solid black rectangle of a coffee table in the conversation group opened to reveal three glasses banner reached down and lifted the tray pimms cup talisker and macs royal gin fizz dont know how he can drink that mess cheers sir george laughed and was joined by the others well done i will admit i thought you had forgotten the smile faded into something else just whom do you have listening to us he demanded nobody art said ohmy apologies sir george i like doing this with drinks and food orders but believe me nobody is listening to us i used my implant to tell millie what we wanted and she took care of it i see sir georges eyes focused on nothing for a moment bonner grinned try again use your last name for the key ah thank you youre welcome ive given you a visiting vip access clearance mac have they made any progress on swinging an implant for you think the citys got an extra million bucks stevens asked hell we havent got an extra five hours overtime for a sanitary engineer stevens eyed sir george warily i hadnt known you were one of the elite reedy looked sympathetically at stevens dont rate it actually family helped psychic ltd once and they paid off with this he paused searching for words very useful gadget but you know you can communicate with a computer about as well with a good briefcase console reedy and bonner looked knowingly at each other it was a look that left maclean stevens out it was the look that sighted men might give each other in the presence of the blind well what would you like to see sir george banner asked as youve gathered were rather proud of todos santos i have us scheduled for dinner a bit early but weve plenty of time before then oh and mr rand our chief engineer will be joining us will we be eating in the commons stevens asked i thought schramms best hungarian food in the country hell mac im not trying to hide anything bonner said he grinned theres nothing alcoholic to drink there and the foods nothing special in commons but theres plenty of it shall i cancel out schramms commons by all means reedy said it was obvious to him that stevens thought he had scored a point in some complex game there was an awkward silence and sir george said into it as you know were thinking of building units like this one we must construct the housing at any event and the government is wondering if we should not do it rationally as you have there are a quarter of a million people here as i understand about that banner said millie could tell you but we ought to let mac listen in and we cant he looked thoughtful for an instant and words flowed on the wall screen total present unrestricted visitors in mall visitors with special passes nonresident workers unauthorized visitors detained prisoners whos the prisoner stevens demanded bonner looked thoughtful then said a leaper theyve got him in central security hes been under arrest for three hours theyll let him go by midnight if nobodys free to interview him before that afraid were holding one of your people in durance vile mac words crawled on the screen again how many residents are accommodated here design goal now resident resident in outbuildings roughly a quarter of a mifflon then sir george said bonner nodded in four square miles of building or about ten square miles of buildings and grounds thats about the highest population density ever achieved on earth anywhere remember the studies a few years ago that proved that if you pack a lot of people into a small area theyd all go insane doesnt seem to have happened maclean stevens chuckled banner threw him a threatening look then grinned where did you have in mind building sir george banner asked reedy shrugged there are a number of possible sites we have so much undeveloped land wont work stevens muttered banner said nothing and the two executives exchanged significant glances bonner is laughing about this reedy thought why id expect stevens to be negative about the whole idea lord knows he hates this whole complexdo all angelinos think that way but what is this joke they share and why when three of these arcologies have been more or less failures is todos santos apparently so successful despite being packed in among ten million enemies in greater los angeles iv where is the man who owes nothing to the land in which he lives whatever that land may be he owes to it the most precious thing possessed by man the morality of his actions and the love of virtue jean jacques rousseau kings and wizards the guard turned with a puzzled expression seems to be a glitch in tunnel captain what kind of glitch no visual the duty captain frowned in thats a critical area dont need intruders in he typed furiously on his console then looked relieved millie shows maintenance in that he said with overtime authorized yet the lucky beggars punch in an immediate repair request for the visuals hell its near dinner time theyll never get it fixed tonight the captain shrugged if they dont well send in a patrolman give em a chance though theyre in there aheady maybe they can take care of it he looked at his readout screen again and nodded looks all right nobodys opened any doors to the outside let me know when the visual comes on again sure the guard settled back and sipped coffee as the kaleidoscope began again anthony rand put down the telephone with a grimace it was always an unpleasant experience when genevieve called and he wasnt sure whether it was worse when they fought or when she tried to make up why the hell didnt she marry and get out of his life she was no bloody use when he was trying to make a career and when he hadnt risen fast enough to suit her shed walked out taking zachary and twothirds of his inadequate income with her now of course she wanted to come back she doesnt want to live with me she wants to live in tados santos tony thought and i will be damned if shes going to come here and live like a goddam princess off my status of course she had a bribe to offer zach aged eleven and she had same good arguments the boy needed his father but tony rand didnt have time to raise a sonhe barely had time to have the boy in for visitsand someone should take care of zach why not his mother and maybe their breakup hadnt been quite so simple and one sided she did have her side to the story he squirmed a bit as his body remembered genevieve suddenly against his will djinn had been wonderful in bed it had been too long since hed had a satisfying affair no time for that no time to make friends too bad you couldnt rent mistresses hed heard that was possible that there were women whod gladly pretend affection be attentive when you wanted them to be and selfreliant when you had no time for them he wished he knew where to find someone like that it wasnt so much that he was afraid to ask as that he hadnt any idea of whom to ask why not genevieve she was offering almost the same thing no ill be damned first his apartment was nothing like the others in todos santos it was large because his status rated a large place but much of the space was concentrated in one enormous room there was a small bedroom but he seldom used it because it was too far from the drafting table hed forgotten a good idea once while stumbling from bedroom to drafting table and that wasnt ever going to happen again the drafting table dominated a whole side of the big room a vast expanse of metal surface littered with drafting instruments and bordered by switches and buttons when he drew on it an image went into his computer files and was accessible in his office or on a job site another wall held awards framed scrolls and trophies books took up another there wasnt room for all the books he neededand where should he keep them here or in his office suite better to get them read into the electronic brains of todos santos somehow though storing his books in computer memory hadnt conquered the mess the room was still littered with letter trays full of papers magazines in half a dozen mahogany rack tables unanswered letters spilling out of drawers he was drowning in paper he envied the quiet efficiency of preston sanders or art bonner or frank mead their assistants almost invisibly took care of details tony had never been able to manage that it wasnt that he didnt have good people alice strahier was a good engineer and executive assistant and tom golden ran the procurement division and but good as his staff people were it wasnt enough they might protect him from mere detailsbut far too often hed found that details were the key to the problem he had to follow the minutiae because he didnt know what would turn out to be vital that led to his development of robot probes small devices with cameras and sound equipment which could move freely through todos santos under rands direct control if he sent out two or three of the small teleoperated devices rand could effectively be in several places at once see machinery and construction details in real time from both above and below and generally explore without leaving his bedroom good as the antwos were with their full twoway communications and their tv screen to show rands face hed found it necessary to get out and talk to the technicians and carpenters and pipe fitters and maintenance people talk to them himself because most construction people didnt like talking to an arrtwo even with rands tv image and he had to go himself his subordinates even the best ones didnt seem able to recognize an important point when they heard it and getting around todos santos took time which meant that the journals and magazines and letters piled up until he was hopelessly behind the phone rang genevieve again he wondered what in hell does she want this time hello he barked at the empty room strahier here chief the phone speaker said uh oh alice wouldnt call about something trivial oh ah yeah hello sorry to bother you at dinner time we have a problem on that carbon filament reinforcing lattice medland cant deliver on time sir nothing we need that stuff boy do we ever need it and its completely out of our control damn it all to hell how would we handle this if we were a space colony or a starship alice the schedules godawful tricky and thats why i called strabler said i tried alternate sources farbenwerke has the best delivery schedule but its still a fourweek delay but i did find a condominium going up in diamond bar that has enough to take care of us for a month and theyve got a strike so they dont need it right now we can buy theirs and have farbenwerke ship ours to diamond barbut theyll want a premium sounds like youve done your homework tony said yeah but itll cost us she said rescheduling around a fourweek delay costs one point six million the diamond bar deal costs nine hundred thousand i cant find any other choices pretty clear what we have to do rand said yes shall i talk to the comptroller yeah do that say this is toms job not yours mr golden has an anniversary party strahler said his wife would leave him if he missed it so i took it thanks alice okay make the deal sure will good night good night rand said finished with phone an expensive call he thought nine hundred thousand bucks no small sum oh well alice and tom would take care of it that was the kind of thing he thought of as a detail no matter how much money might be involved somebody else could handle it but if he hadnt got his hands dirty working on the sewage treatment system hed never have found out that the instrumentation pathway wasnt workable until the system was finished he shuddered at the memory theyd have had to tear out a concrete wall and delay completion of the new residential wing it was only by accumulating details that you found something like thatand the way the details fit together wasnt at all obvious which meant there was no rational filing system for them resulting in the mess in his apartment because you never knew when youd need an old memo or an article maybe rand thought maybe if i had an implant is that how banner keeps track of everything but pres manages without one and so does mead he put on a clean shirt it was time to meet bonner and stevens and what was his name reedy time to meet them for dinner the dining hail was large enough for six thousand people and served an entire level holographic panels along one entire wall gave the impression that it looked out over the sea sailboats moved on the bay and lights winked as sunset shadowed catalina island in the distance the great bulk of the iceberg in the santa monica harbor was outlined against the dying sunlight a mountainous island that shone too brightly to be stone thats lovely sir george said and quite realistic it ought to be maclean stevens told him theyve piped the view inside yep real time rand said proudly cost less than moving the dining hall theres never enough outside view area and he cut himself off he hadnt come to talk but to listen that was going to take careful control hed been told he talked too much and he supposed it was true although he never said anything he wouldnt have wanted said to him if he didnt know the information and certainly he had reason to be pleased at reedys response appreciative silence and another close look at the holographs pity the ceiling is so low reedy observed finally but even so the illusion is nearly perfect art banner laughed a short polite sound tony rand had no trouble reading bonners mind the cost of the holographic walls had been high enough without using up valuable space to give high ceilings to the common rooms rand had suggested it and got nowhere art hadnt wanted the holographs either but tony insisted and brought them in under budget too he was proud of that the commons wouldnt be nearly so nice without that illusion of looking out the room was filled with the buzz of conversation and clicking plates there were the random sounds of people in motion a good bit less noise than id have imagined for this many diners reedy said rand was about to tell him about the acoustic design wails subtly not parallel indentations at key places and the rest but reedy wasnt listening custom again maclean stevens said deeply ingrained custom developed pretty rapidly too doubtless there is selectivity reedy said those who cant adapt wont stay long the idea is to adapt the habitat to the inhabitants needs art banner said you seem to have done well reedy replied the tables were long and narrow with a pair of moving beltways down the center dirty dishes came from their right and a continuous stream of food and beverages and clean utensils poured from some cornucopia to the left take a place art banner said you can choose your own company or wait for someone to choose you no reservations reedy asked no its a random proposition banner led them to an empty stretch at a long table schedulings going to catch hell for this if it doesnt fill up he paused for a moment to stare at nothing thats the value of that implant rand thought hes just made a note with all the details and tomorrow millie will remind him to think about schedules reedy waited until he saw banner was attentive again then he said how can you plan without reservations bonner shrugged we manage stevenss voice was carefully controlled as he said residents must take a certain number of meals in the commons theyre not only charged for them as part of the services but they pay extra if they skip out too many times with that incentive its a simple matter of queuing theory mathematics not all that simple rand said reedy frowned that doesnt seem very pleasant they took seats reedy and banner on one side of the table rand and stevens on the other the moving dishes and foods seemed to distract reedy and made it hard for him to talk across the table bonner didnt seem to notice youll find clean plates coming along any second banner said i think youll like the meal and certainly its efficient pause tonights was only seven dollars twentyeight cents per person that well serve assuming the projections right if you see something you like just take it when youve served yourself put the rest back on the conveyor is that sanitary reedy asked certainly bonner snared a covered dish of chicken fricassee there are no more than four portions in a dish to begin with and weve empirical evidence too check our absenteeism due to minor illness reedy looked thoughtful quite low he said check the la rate for comparison not that they have as good data as we have but it gives you an idea rand watched them carefully in his office he could have got the same data just as quickly but here he would have to take out his pocket communications terminal type in the question and read the answer reedy and banner simply thought the question and got the answer piped into their heads without interrupting the conversation theres another reason for no more than four portions to a dish rand said if the fromates do get in and poison some dishes they wont kill many people oh dear is there much chance of that reedy asked he seemed to have lost his appetite almost none rand assured him the security agents watch all the time he waved toward the low ceiling reedy glanced around nervously as if feeling eyes on the back of his neck then plates and silver came past and he took them bonner handed him hungarian goulash and vegetables and bread quickly followed there was tea and coffee and milk and water and fruit juice the goulash was hot and smelled deliciously of paprika rand ate eagerly but reedy was still hesitant gets to you doesnt it maclean stevens said gently he began to eat not much you can do about it so enjoy your meal about what rand asked being watched all the time but were not watched all the time rand said the guards follow a random surveillance pattern what do you do if you catch them reedy asked saboteurs or even just pickpockets banner snorted thats a sore subject what happens is we turn them over to macs police and they let them go sir george lifted an eyebrow really mr stevens not quite close enough bonner said lets suppose we catch an angelino with his hand in a stockholders pocket suppose weve got him dead to rights a dozen witnesses we call the la police they come get him one of the district attorneys people comes out and takes statements so far so good but now the public defender gets in the act itll be some bright youngster just out of law school anxious to make a reputation so we get delays continuances every time the victim and our witnesses show up the public defender isnt available schedule conflict something until the day the victim isnt available and wham thats the day they insist on a speedy trial now damn it thats not fair mac stevens insisted its close enough mac and you know it if we want a conviction we have to spend hours and days in courtrooms and for what even if we do it the yoyo gets bail and probation so what do you do mr banner reedy asked we grit our teeth and play the game banner said and try to see that no repeat offenders get in here we do have the right to keep the bums away from our people and how would we do that on a starship tony rand wondered hmmm wed have to have criminal law justice if you will which is hard to automate and not my department the food was good and they ate in silence for a few minutes most had second helpings rand started to tell them about some of the problems hed had in getting the conveyor belt system working properly but he saw they werent interested finally sir george looked up and said surely theres a lot of wastage you cant possibly predict how much will be eaten we do better than you think banner said yes and they sell the leftovers to las angeles welfare institutions stevens said grimly churches skid row missions that sort of thing theres no waste because the los angeles poor live an todos santoss garbage now thats not true rand said the garbage goes to the pig farms he means that only the untouched portions are sold for human consumption banner said and hes right the real garbage feeds animals and mac you may not like feeding your welfare people on our leftovers but i notice you dont complain about the water we supply the sun fell into the sea and the iceberg offshore winked with navigation lights the darkness of the holograph was lovely but it made the low ceiling press down even more heavily sir george glanced around again i shouldnt think americans would like surveillance while they eat the corporation doesnt much like the expense of providing it either banner said now tell me what i should do despite everything the fromates do get into todos santos and they do try to poison people they dont think its poison stevens said lsd is poison bonner said if my people want to turn on theyll do it themselves they dont need help from eaters and slipping acid into the food isnt all the honorable friends of man and the earth do theyve also tried blowing up the kitchens as well as other parts of todos santos they triedwell their diseased minds come up with pretty ingenious stunts so we have to watch for them and we cant abandon the commons wouldnt if we could most of our residents like the commons some never eat anywhere else after all its our most democratic institution why do these criminals dislike you so much sir george asked surely they know your people are not unhappy here banner and stevens laughed together a shared joke which rand could have joined if he wanted to but the memory was too painful genevieve had lived with an ecofreak after she left tonys bed tony tried to be objective but he faiind it difficult the fromates claim to be ecologists banner said as if i didnt have some of the best ecological talent in the world available to my staff only they can save the earth arts not being quite fair stevens said ive got no use for terrorists but the fromates have a point they claim that if todos santos succeeds therell be no barrier to population growth not even famine and overcrowding can stop the population bomb until its too late for everyone and everything actually their best arguments are fiction theyre backing a movie made from an old science fiction novel the godwhale about how the human race crowds itself until no humans are left i take it you agree with them sir george asked no but they do have their share of truth todos santos uses enormous resources to produce an elite that enjoys he clamped his lips firmly together id rather you saw everything for yourself saw what rand wondered something not working right where i saw the demonstrators outside sir george said do you often have serious attempts at sabotage bombs that sort of thing more than i like banner said but they dont often get past security setting off a bombs pretty hard when the guards are looking over your shoulder isnt there anywhere the guards dont watch not many places a young family came over to their part of the table and sat next to art banner the man was about thirty and his wife considerably younger there were twa boys with them about six and eight years old all wore the neat slacks and wrinklefree shirts that seemed to be standard dress and all four wore resident badges like most resident badges these were personalized the parents had color drawings with their names in stylized calligraphy the childrens had cartoons the shirts had complementary patterns of wild color designed so that you could see from a distance that they were a family although each shirt was different the man sat next to banner and examined arts badge with care before he spoke i thought i recognized you mr banner good evening banner said pleasantly he looked at their badges cal and judy phillips the color had already told him they were resident stockholders and the badge identified his business executive row clothing rental th level mall bonner gestured to his companions mister phillips this is tony rand the chief engineer our visitors are mr stevens of the los angeles mayors office and sir george reedy of the canadian government phillipss eyes widened slightly he nodded pleasantly to the others then began to gather dishes for himself and his family he spoke in a low voice that they could just make out if they listened hard enough the newcomers talked only to each other for a while but when cal phillips was certain that banner was finished with his meal he said mister banner my shower is not delivering enough water banner frowned youve had maintenance in to check yes sir they say everythings fine but it isnt judy phiffips said i used to be able to rinse off completely and now i cant and theres been no water allowance reduction in our neighborhood where rand asked fortyfour west rring judy answered hmm could be the computer i dont think theres leave it to maintenance tony banner said he frowned for a moment all right someone will look into it thank you cal phillips said if youve a few minutes not tonight bonner said pleasantly i have to show my guests around if youll excuse us certainly cal and judy phillips chorused well have coffee at my place bonner said to his guests when they were away from the table and we can discuss the economics of the situation sir george expect that will bore you to tears tony was banner trying to get rid of him rand wandered why would he do that but it had happened before when there was diplomacy to discuss before they reached the outside of the common room bonner had heard five mare complaints been given three separate solutions to problems in garbage disposalone interesting enough that rand took out a notebook and wrote it downand had been encouraged not to give in to outside pressures from the teamsters when they reached the corridor people obviously recognized bonner but they didnt speak to him except to wish him a pleasant evening well head an up to my place banner said sure you cant join us tony definitely a hint rand decided thanks art but i think id better turn in early rand said he watched them get onto an elevator there were other residents in the elevators and they didnt speak to banner either as he led his guests to a corner of the th floor an apartment door opened as they approached he ushered them into a large carpeted room the view of the city was magnificent on two sides of them long lines of light that were streets overflowing with traffic dotted lines of empty lighted streets tall buildings with more patterns of light a bank of fog rolling in from the bay shrouding the iceberg its top far below them los angeles lay in splendor around them maclean stevens stood at the windows basking in the light now thats a city he said alive and lovely and free splendid sir george said really lovely especially from here banner added pimms cup again sir george thank you ill have brandycarlos primera be all right splendid thank you they took seats they watched the solid coffee table for a moment a duplicate of the one in bonners office customs again reedy said banner looked puzzled the residents they are permitted to speak to you in the commons but not in the corridors more or less banner said not so much permitted aswell as you say a custom maclean stevens started to say something but caught himself actually banner said anyone can speak to anyone in the commons if you hadnt been along theyd have talked my arm off they were being polite to outside visitors and why was everyone so interested in garbage disposal reedy asked its the problem of the week banner said every week we have something the residents are asked to think about if they come up with a good idea we use it works more often than you think i see and you eat in the commons regularly reasonably so im exempt from the requirement of course although im not so certain thats wise getting out and meeting the residents is just plain good politics if nixon had gone drinking in bars once in a while hed have served two full terms as president for that matter mac your mayor would benefit by getting out and meeting some random citizens sure with fifty bodyguards see banner said i dont need bodyguards not in todos santos i can go meet anyone i like ah here are our drinks the coffee table opened to reveal three large snifters of brandy reedy asked is an automatic bartender standard in all apartments its not automated maclean stevens said somewhere in this building a very human bartender poured those drinks bonner nodded agreement most places get deliveries by jitney to their outside door executive and luxury suites have direct conveyors a service reserved for the higher castes stevens said kings queens and drones he lifted his glass cheers thats a very old image mac banner lifted his own glass in reply cheers i suppose you could call the executives kings and queens and the major stockholders drones but whats the sense of it sir george mai doesnt like todos santosbut his wife wants to live here doesnt she mac stevens nodded sourly youll notice he doesnt say he cant afford to bring her here either banner said ive offered him nearly every job in my department stevens fidgeted nervously then glanced at his watch sir george i really must be leaving soon good heavens yes of course youll have tci get back to your family im very sorry you neednt leave banner said we have guest suites please stay on sir george what time is your first appointment in the morning well actually i had expected to return here thats settled then ill have a guest suite with same toilet articles laid out for you youve no family with you in los angeles he didnt say it as a question stevens wandered for a moment then nodded banner would have had millie check airline and hotel reservations i would enjoy staying over if mr stevens doesnt mind reedy said no of course not i can find my way out art can you have my chopper meet me sure stevens dawned the last of his brandy and stood be seeing you ill come by for sir george in the morning call city hall about an hour before youre ready to leave if you please well get him back to you bonner assured him he walked with stevens across the thick carpets to the entryway bring janice with you next time sometime when youre not showing the commons stevens nodded thanks the door slid open for him then closed poor mac banner said as he came back to his seat his wife really enjoys this place and mac thinks coming here is a chore excuse me a moment please he frowned in concentration reedy could hear the instructions that is he could hear millie listening to them maclean stevens leaving now full protection call lafd for his helicopter acknowledged banner said i expect youve got a few more questions millions reedy agreed i dont know where to begin uh i say mr banner i cant help noticing that your relationship with mr stevens is rather peculiar banner grinned broadly thats not the way id put it but yes mac is convinced that this place couldnt exist without los angeles to him were no more than a vampire sucking up sustenance from his city and since hes got an ungovernable mess out there naturally he resents our order and tranquility even mare i see and yet youre friends i wish we were closer friends hes a very good man sir george but then youve seen that yes is his theory correct by the way banner hesitated for only a second certainly in a way there have been several experiments in arcologies sir george this is the only one that has succeeded youre quite the largest and best financed banner nodded true but that isnt all of it i think we have had a lot of success not just avoiding deterioration weve had growth and improvement and we make a profit far the stockholders and financiers the earlier arcologies need massive tax subsidies todos santos pays taxes as few as possible but we pay sir george nodded agreement i know its the purpose of my visit why our independence and lack of tax strangulation bonner said quickly we make our own laws and no one outside bothers us dictatorial efficiency the first bloom of fascism i make the trains run on time i even build trains seriously i am being serious we do have efficient administration simply getting out from under the dead hand of government chopping out bureaucratic deadwoodthats worth a lot reedy nodded again thats the standard explanation but i am not at all certain that i accept the standard theories else id not be here i am looking for what the sociologists and economists may have missed mast of them hate you from theoretical principles or love you from others something else youve seen banner said security nobody has to be afraid in todos santos everyone in this place can talk to everyone else and not be afraid i think thats worth something too but what of stevenss theory banner smiled ill jump macs gun since hell tell you all about it tomorrow anyway but do keep in mind what i said without our communications upwards and downwards and sideways the rest wouldnt matter now mac stevens believes that without the resources of a big city to draw on wed never make tados santas anything like selfsufficient wed forget something vital and it would take time and effort to correct thats why he said you couldnt build an arcalogy out in your undeveloped lands i see but there was an experiment like that in india reedy leaned back in the comfortable chair and sniffed brandy back when the united states was sending aid to india the rockefeller foundation tried to build an instant industrial complex in an undeveloped village and farming region banner nodded millie has the details if youre interested yes and the project failed dismally for precisely the reasons ive mentioned sure sir george i wont try to hide from you just how much we depend on los angeles i know because millie monitors everything coming into this place i know where every dollar goes out of here too i think macs absolutely right you have to be near a big city near enough to draw on its resources or your arcologys going to flop economically socially in every way but certainly thats not enough by itself it cant explain your economic successes right banner said but you saw some of that tonight did i the phillips bay clothing rental obviously there was a need for that service we werent providing it but our people like to dress up for parties and weddings and such so we were imparting rental clothing and exporting money now phillips does it and the money stays right here mare than that hes buying stock with his profits and he brought in the capital to start the business reedy mused of course i can see why people with no capital resent you and youre wrong banner said i admit i checked on phillips so i know in advance but his storys typical he came in with nothing we loaned him the money to build up his business reedy thought that over do you do that often it seems risky win a few lose a few we do pretty well our director for capital development is very seldom wrong ah reedy smiled he wondered if arthur banner realized just how much he was revealing or cared and how would we go about locating such a magician banner grinned thats your problem weve got barbara churchward v then conquer we must for our cause it is just francis scott key command decisions tony rand was at loose ends there would be movies either in commons or on his tv or he could read same of the technical articles now cluttering up his working space but he wasnt sleepy and he didnt feel like working he had wanted to watch art banner and sir george together but art had made it clear that he would be in the way business fine art was no engineer but he had a way of smoothing things out so that the real work of todos santos could go on tony was still annoyed he punched for his own level and braced for the thrust there were slow and fast elevators you learned which were which art polled the residents regularly some hated waiting for elevators some hated the accelerations it wasnt hard to change the operating speeds to suit the users hmm delores had seemed glad to see him when he was in banners office earlier shed be up it was early could he drop by her place but on what excuse damn it why couldnt he learn how to pick up girls even with women he knew like delores he couldnt seem to change the relationship from business to social did other men have this problem he decided that delares wouldnt want to see him not at this hour without an appointment who would genevieve shed be glad hed been in love with her once he was still in love with her when she left and to be fair he hadnt been much of a husband too wrapped up in work irritable when interrupted unwilling to go places with her rude to her friends and glad enough when she decided not to go to conventions with him because she was always bored thered been plenty of danger signals he could see that now looking back at the last year they were married but he hadnt seen them then if i had he thought if id noticed how unhappy she was could i have done anything about it id have tried but tried what shed be glad if i called i could invite her to came visit bring zach and come stay a few days shed like that and dammit she used to be fun to have around am i still in love with her the elevator stopped at his floor somehow the idea of his empty apartment was unpleasant too unpleasant to face instead he took his pocket electronics boxcalculator phone computer terminal alarm clock and calendar an invention of his own that someday hed market when he had time to perfect itand plugged it into a jack in a panel near the elevator call box genevieves number didnt answer after twelve rings so now what the apartment was still empty dammit there had to be someone whod be glad to see him sanders pres would be on duty and he could use some company pres didnt like night duty on the worry desk rand entered the elevator again and punched for the operations level the olympic ski jumps were back on the screen in preston sanderss office evening tony said why cant you be addicted to reruns of the mary tyler moore show or at least watch the evening news i do watch the news sanders said and i generally get some work done when ive got night duty on the worry desk quiet tonight rand said ohtheres some kind of prob lem with water deliveries in west could you have maintenance check it out sanders laughed i logged that one in an riour ago how did your dinner go any conclusions about implants and genius havent made up my mind best way to find out would be to get my awn sure tomorrow morning a shrill tone shattered their conversation red flashed above the screen and the skier disappeared in midjump replaced by a redbearded guard captain breakin intruder on cring north tony stopped breathing burglars in the house sanders looked automatically at the holographic model tony rand didnt bother the north side was unfinished in large part nothing but girders and framework and the thin curtain wall that had been erected for appearances and environmental control but two main hydrogen intake lines and a fastube to santa barbara came in near ground level on the north side a red pinpoint winked on in the holographic display level and definitely out in the unfinished area visual sanders demanded getting it sir the guard said another screen swam then showed a dim figure on a narrow catwalk he wont know weve spotted him rand went around behind the desk to look over sanderss shoulder careful not to distract pres there wasnt enough light far details keep it that way a minute fleming whats he carrying sanders demanded cant make it out captain fleming answered no history on him he had a badge at one time or he wouldnt be here and he ditched it before he went into that area right sanders said rand felt beads of sweat pop out on his forehead and a cold knot began to grow under his belt this was no lost child and if he felt the tension what must sanders be feeling the black man looked calm enough a teener resident out to have fun rand suggested possibly sanders muttered he continued to stare at the screen but not likely not out there keep on it fleming youve sent men down there yes sir maybe you ought to call banner rand suggested that got him a scowl arts been drinking with the canadian sanders said afraid i cant handle the situation you know better tony protested was that what i was thinking two more fleming said excitedly two bandits accessway theyve got some kind of interference gear dont know what it is but we cant get an exact location interference rand shouted what in hell could they he fell silent thinking furiously recalling the details of the security system accessway that was a main hydrogen input tunnel a bright band sprang into view on the model the indeterminate location of two intruders deep underground the southwest pipeline complex that ran parallel to the tunnel showed up as a series of thick purple lines it makes a pattern pres said uneasily opposite sides both aimed at hydrogen intake lines thats our weakest spat weve got to get visual on those new bogies yes sir fleming said from the screen trying i can send men into the tunnel and alarm them hold that he looked up helplessly at rand christ if theyve got explosives they can make one hell of a mess tony could only nod agreement pres my arrtwos ive got one near tunnel maybe they wouldnt be suspicious of a robot maybe worth a try sanders said absently use that console over there to fire it up but dont do anything else without letting me know now let me think sure pres tony went to the console it wouldnt be easy controlling the robot with this standard input tony usually used joysticks and gloves with special sensors and other devices but there werent any of those closer than tonys officeand by the time he could get there this might all be aver sanders came to a decision he pushed another button an the desk console cut the hydrogen in those lines all the lines next to tunnel niner and the northside lines too millie what does that do to us we will go to flywheel drain no essential power loss for seventeen minutes after fourteen minutes we must begin phasedown power cuts to prepare for inevitable power losses do you wish more details the contralto voice spoke in impassive block capitals at least that was how rand always visualized them power cuts would negative phasedowns sanders said carry out previous order and use flywheel storage done not enough rand said we need those tony shut up sanders said fleming are you certain theyve got something that intentionally fouls up the detectors thats not an accident not bloody likely sir millie probability insignificant he turned to rand tony rand shrugged i dont know how they did it but i cant see that happening by accident he pointed at the fuzzy band on the hologram we aught to have intruders located to the decimeter im getting an infrared image now fleming said tunnel niner the screen showed a dim shadow of two figures each carrying something heavy the faces bulged like the snouts of pigs gas masks sanders said grimly millie do the images match anything in your memory probability of gas mask or deliberate simulation of gas mask percent oxygen mask percent probable if oxygen mask the tanks are very small simulation whats the chance of that sanders demanded insufficient data jesus tony get that damned robot of yours in there fast i cant pres whatever theyre using to interfere with our detectors is jamming my comm links with the arrtwo i cant help you a bit it had happened at last preston sanders had always known it would it was the reason he hated the worry desk sitting here always involved political decisions nothing else would be bucked up to the top duty officer that was hard enough and now the big one had happened while he was on duty ive got about thirty seconds to dither should i call the bass itd take him at least that long to get up to speed maybe i should have called him earlier probably would if tony hadnt suggested it oh damn it and what if arts not sober that la man has left but the canadian is still here one of the shadows in the tunnel bent over possibly to tie his shoes possibly to set off a bomb that would wreck the lines sanders made his decision his voice was calm as he said big one tunnel niner big stuff no drill execute his voice was calm but sweat dripped from his chin hed never been in the army and he had just killed two men deliberately in cold blood now we take care of the one on the north side sanders said stand by lights and snipers he doesnt look to be carrying anything heavy enough to do much damage right right said fleming make sure hes got nothing to penetrate the intakes and no bomb then catch the son of a bitch catch him alive and no alarms roger mister sanders captain fleming turned away from the screens and preston sanders sank back into his chair art banner drank a final nightcap with sir george reedy and left the canadian in the guest suite the perimeter corridor was dark and deserted as art limped slowly toward his empty apartment but he paid it no attention he almost turned to the elevator that would take him to deloress apartment but no shed made it clear that whatever theyd been it was all aver now shed be glad to see him but for what what do i want he wandered for the apartment not to be empty when i get there and thats impossible because who wants to live with a man who lets a city set his scheduleand loves it it was a wonder grace stayed five years actually delores will be glad to see me we can talk about next weeks schedule and shell make some tea and not fair she must have men friends one of them might be with her right now it would be literally no effort to find out he had only to think the question why not but there was a rising and falling note in his head it wasnt quite sound the implanted receiver fed directly into the auditory nerve and he could sense the difference from true sound for one thing there was no vibration but it was loud enough to startle him no matter how often he had heard it before he thought millie intruder alert single intruder northside level corridor ring c intruder apparently unarmed carrying nothing large two intruders carrying surveillance interference equipment and gas masks and other heavy equipment extent and nature unknown in access tunnel ohniner location impossible to determine mare information poured into his head everything millie knew about the situation the computers probability estimates the probable consequences of explosions in the penetrated areas all happening so quickly that banner was hardly aware of it lord gad banner said to himself he moved toward the fast lane of the pedway sanders has it affirmative hes in charge acknowledged he was automatically going toward the operations center and what do i do when i get there he wondered i left pres in charge hell think i dont trust him if i come in and take over he hasnt asked for help and theres the little matter of the brandy too am i competent to make decisions sanders has ordered lethal gas action in accessway niner millie told him christ almighty banner muttered he had seconds only to interfere if he were going to and he had no information pres is a good man he thought another part of his mind answered hed damned well better be banner walked rapidly along the pedway it was silly it wouldnt get him to the control offices more than a few seconds earlier but he did it vx released in accessway niner security is moving in on the intruder in northside area well thats that he was past his own apartment now not far to the elevator to the top floor that location was sffiy banner thought administrators ought to be either next to their own apartments or somewhere in the middle of the building but the designers had their own ideas what was happening to pres he began moving off the fast lane again an elevator was waiting far him of course and there were two uniformed men next to it all through todos santos the security people would be moving quietly into place just in case there were more to this attack than just three intruders in uninhabited areas maintenance and engineering and the fire department would be on alert too if the hydrogen lines went even if there wasnt a fire todos santos would came grinding to a halt it took energy to run the city less than the same people would need if they were scattered out in hundreds of thousands of buildings of course but it took plenty he limped off the pedway acknowledged the guards with a wave and entered the elevator twitching while it rose hows pres taking it hes killed two people the elevator loosed him and he ran for preston sanderss office angling sideways to favor the bad leg tony rand watched the black man with awe how can he be so damned calm about it he wondered maybe hes not hes smoking like a chimneyhave i ever seen him smoke before hes usually so fussy about emptying ashtrays and that ones halffull already he went to the shelf and poured a shot of brandy tossing it off almost laughing at the absurdity of his thoughts it came unbidden that hed put sanderss prize brandy in coffee this afternoon now he was drinking it like medicine brandy im still on duty sanders said fleming whats the status on that northside intruder hes spotted us hes hiding thank you maybe you ought to call banner now rand said millie already told him sanders said absently standing orders on anything this big hell be here in a moment he painted at the holograph where a blue star moved rapidly upward toward the operations suite id go easy on that brandy art will want you in on the conference two dead rand thought what the hell did they use to interfere with the surveillance art banner came in he took in the situation at a glance his eyes resting momentarily on the full ashtray status he asked you already know sanders said i gassed miner theyre getting men into survival gear to go inspect and intruder captured millie announced she used audio to speak to all of them fleming appeared on the screen got him another image formed a young man eariy twenties at mast long hair in back but cut short at the sides and in front scraggly beard which wasnt unusual cotton denim pants and jacket no weapons fleming reported we fluaroscoped him nothing and medical says no drugs he tried to put on he was high but weve got him convinced we know better that may have been a mistake sanders said mister banners here take aver mister banner i relieve you get delores up here will you and sandra im going to have to have some sleep before this nights over and you will too fleming send that intruder up here yes sir the images faded banner put his hand on sanderss shoulder relax sanders tried to smile it didnt work i killed them art both in cold blood sure tony get pres a drink it happened so fast all aver in a minute art what if its nothing like that kid no weapons nothing just trying to throw a scare into us they never had a chance tony rand brought over a brandy if they were trying to scare us they made it nicely he said here banner nodded agreement you made the right decision same as i would what if it wasnt nothing what if they had bombs all set to take out the hydrogen lines set off the hydrogen with a big whoosh big bonfire right in the park i wish it hadnt beenme it was and ill back you all the way it isnt zurich im worried about or the angelino police its me sure the bay was grinning that was the first thing tony rand noticed when lieutenant blake ushered him into sanderss office a wide triumphant grin we got an u on this one blake said sure im allan thompson the youth said his voice was pleasant and sounded educated my fathers a real estate broker in hollywood where are the others what others banner asked aw come on thompson said he was still grinning you gotta have them by now he shrugged maybe you dont that seemed to amuse him even more preston sanders had ignored his brandy and sat staring at the youth his eyes a study of misery the grin got to tony rand whats so damned funny rand demanded banner raised a hand in warning rand subsided we found a vip visitor badge outside the crawlway entrance to the unfinished section blake reported a mr roland thompson whos a favored customer for a number of places sure thats my dads badge allan thompson said okay so now you call him and tell him the prodigals in trouble again please sit down allan banner said carefully and tell us why you were crawling around on a catwalk a hundred meters above ground level this late at night it was fun man thompson sat with the attitude of an important visitor we thought what the hell theyre always talking about the security system at todos santos well just show em its not as goad as they think we banner demanded who are the others thompson grinned slyly so you really havent caught them yet thats choice well i better tell you cause its getting pretty late and sitting heres a bummer i dont guess youll let me loose until you round em up there are two diana and jimmy and they stayed in the stupid tunnel we got in from there was a sharp hiss as preston sanders took in a quick breath lieutenant blake looked grim hey whats the matter thompson demanded look they arent going to hurt anything allan were your friends carrying anything special equipment or anything like that banner asked casually it was difllcult to keep the strain from his voice tony rand leaned forward to listen he felt the same thrill of horror that banner did but he also wanted to know how did they do it oh some big boxes full of sand had dynamite painted on the outside you know just to show you and jimmy thats jim planchet hes an electronics genius he made something that he thought would really give your detection stuff fits what how did it work rand demanded hell im no electronics type thompson said but it must have worked if you havent got em yet art banner was posed in the characteristic way he used to talk to millie with his implant his face lookedstrange rand got up and went behind the desk so that he could see the tv screen that sanders was watching what had banner found out the screen showed jim planchet identification councilman james planchet of los angeles has a son age twenty named james evereti jr lord god tony said involuntarily what allan thompson squinted at rand did you say something no bonner said who is diana aw diana lauder kind of engaged to jimmy you know roams in the dorm with us i see well i hope the automatic systems havent harmed your friends banner said evenly lieutenant please take mr thompson to central security well have to hang on to you for a while allan what you did was highly illegal didnt you know that you mean unlawful illegals a sick bird thompson said we didnt mean any harm might even have done you a favor suppose wed been somebody really out to get you wasnt my idea anyway jimmys father kept spouting off about this place andtheres something wrong isnt there the boys grin faded jesus they werent hurt were they look mister they didnt mean any harm they didnt have any weapons or anything you didnt hurt them did you jesus councilman planchet will kill me if anythings happened to jimmy so it was your idea banner said evenly how can he be so calm rand wondered and pres just sits there staring at the brandy take him out blake banner said well talk to him later hey wait a minute tell me whats happened to jimmy and diana let me go you goddam rentacap what did you bastards do you cant handle me this way the door closed behind the guard and the struggling youth so thats that art banner thought kids out playing sanders said i dont want to believe it boxes full of sand art theyre as dead astheyre dead i killed them and they were just kids yeah get hold of yourself you did the right thing given what you knew suppose itd been fromates with a bomb sanders sat unmoving staring at a wall he couldnt see come on pres its all right rand said look they tried their best to make you think they were fromates right i thought so watching over your shoulder what else could you do medical get someone in here to take care of mister sanders banner thought acknowledged and get sandra on duty for everything except this i dont want to be bothered with trivia ms wyatt is just reaching her office tell her shes in charge as soon as she sits down and medical can give pres a shot to get him through the night but what the hell are we going to do tomorrow an la city councilmans kid and his girlfriend planchet jesus why did it have to be him he spouts off a lot but hes not really an enemy wasnt an enemy he will be now can we keep it a secret no thompson knew where the others were others might maybe not unwanted a thought crept into the darker part of his mind sorry kid you know too much banner pushed it away get me legal roust out johnny shapiro right now and get him up to my office acknowledged status security team not ready to enter detoxification almost completed estimate ten minutes until safe to enter well just have to wait rand watched impatiently banner giving orders and getting reports through his implant while tony knew nothing banner could have had the decency to put it all on the tv screen whats happening theyre flushing out the last traces of nerve gas banner said not important enough to send guards in there with protective suits not until its safer is it dont think so i tried to get a robot in but the comm link is still jammed why the hell cant your people develop something better than nerve gas something to knack a man over instantly but not kill him tall order rand said youve got one but it has to be inhaled these were wearing gas masks if you want something that works on skin contact and knacks them over before they know what hit them war gasses are all there is i suppose heres the route they must have taken banner said a thin line moved through the holograph a second screen showed what someone traveling that route would see twice the stark words appeared if you go through this door you will die si usted por esta puerta habria pasado usted habria muerto muy peligroso subtle we arent rand said and those were good locks on those doors anything more and we couldnt get through them ourselves maybe if i you too bonner said irritably look we took precautions at great expense dammit we arent morally obligated to design this place so that idiot geniuses cant hurt themselves what are we supposed to do sit back and let a pack of crummy bastards shoot our police poison our people bum the city put our people out of workand never fight back sure tony said but he couldnt help wondering if there wasnt something else he could have done a more foolproof design but these kids were anything but fools a young medical resident came in and gave preston sanders a shot later a security team brought out the bodies of jimmy planchet age twenty and diana lauder nineteen they had nothing dangerous with them only dummy bombs with garish cartoons a box of sophisticated electronic gear that rand thirsted to study and masks connected to scuba gear there were no weapons at all vi knowledge of human nature is the beginning and end of political education henry brooks adams eye of the storm lying on a strange bed in a strange city in a foreign country sir george reedy gradually realized that he wasnt going to sleep it was jet lag of course sir george had always suffered from biarhythm upset it was a pity because his work involved a good deal of traveling he would not have survived had he not learned to sleep on airplanes but having slept through the flight to los angeles reedy was now wide awake at midnight he was tired but not sleepy if he closed his eyes tight and clenched his fists and willed himself to sleep hed still be doing it came the dawn hed tried to force sleep often enough the trick was to take the additional awaketime as a gift and do something with it the day was full of undigested data anthony rand had mentioned stockholders who worked outside without ever leaving todos santos an intriguing possibility in a world running out of fuel what had rand called them waldos and a technical term hed forgotten millie sir george said in his throat reedy ready sir george what have you got on waldos waldo a system in which the motions of a human hand or hands are imitated by a mechanical hand or hands located elsewhere the idea was first concewed by robert heinlein for a short science fiction story waldo published in waldos or teleoperated devices were later developed for use in handling radioactwes then for any dangerous profession the mining of uranium or coal manipulation of dangerous chemicals work in vacuum on the moon the teleoperated tool may be of any size and may be mittenshaped rather than handshaped a routine may be recorded once using an operator then the program may be replayed indefinitely how many waldo operators presently reside here four hundred and ten reedy was at the window now looking out at a glowing carpet of light indeed los angeleswas beautiful from here does the todos santos air conditioning system filter smog yes with efficiency cost restricted sir george paced order me a large mug of chocolate and two ounces of bourbon done this science fiction writer what else did he invent did he make any money at it robert heinlein is credited with the ideas behind the linear accelerator launcher the moving walkway and the water bed no patents are on file reedy shook his head grinning typical but waldos now that would have a strong bearing on how much parking place canada must allot to a projected arcology what else should he be checking before he started digging f or real information tomorrow an arcalogy wouldnt work without a city nearby if true it was crucial what kind of city how near todos santos and los angeles were perhaps too close relations between the two seemed strained the kind of tension hed already seen couldnt hold forever reedy thought something would snap perhaps the canadian host city or its citizens should be given concessions of some kind that family in the commons they had been financed by tadas santos itself banner had said so how would that work millie ready what data have you on a phillips family man and wife and at least two children phillips calvin raymond and judy nee campbell independent stockholder residents married one time nine years to present children calvin raymond junior present age eight years patrick lafayette age six years cooperatwe owner unit percentage of ownership restricted information omit personal details reedy instructed how was his business financed interrogative director for capital development advanced corporate loan funds in exchange for one quarter interest in the business enterprise what security was given for the loan sir george scratched his ear the tiny voice in his head tickled note of hand on recommendation of miss churchward hed heard that name from bonner who is churchward director for capital development my word reedy said aloud query glitch is this kind of financial arrangement normal stockholders have opened businesses in todos santos using loans recommended by barbara churchward have since declared bankruptcy that was quite a good record reedy decided tell me about barbara churchward permission from churchward required churchward has present status no disturbances for routine matters is this an emergency no that will be all thank you the table opened to deliver sir georges hot chocolate he sipped enough to make room then added the bourbon the mix had put him to sleep on other occasions sipping he smiled out at the carpet of light no wonder the angelinos were bitter every previous arcology had begun its life as a hopefully selfsufficient entity todos santos had begun as a symbiote on los angeles now by searching out the people it needed by luring them inside with loans and concessions the cityinabuilding was making every attempt to become selfsufficient within los angeless borders just how necessary was churchward to the process might she be looking for a new career with a hefty rise in salary reedy made a mental note to find out that a man could be so lost in despair that he was prepared to destroy himself and that other men could mock him in the very act he would never have believed it the last of his illusions had burned out of him while he danced in the wind on the high board his anger was deep inside him too deep to show and turned against itself his face wasnt even sullen it was dead calm as he sat waiting waiting for what he didnt know and didnt care he had walked where the guards had led him and sat where they pointed the guards had found him leaning against the fence looking outward with tears running down his calm face he had felt the stubby fingers on his arm had followed the pull the guard had spoken in reassuring tones he had not heard the words they led him into an elevator dawn like a falling stone out to this room where he waited the door opened he did not bather to look up but people were talking i dont know tony i dont know whats going to happen now but i swear they looked like they were going to blow up the hydrogen lines i was there i came dawn to see the equipment they carried its nat in here oh whos he voices grew clearer as heads looked into the roam him oh hes a leaper we pulled off your high board jeez patterson weve got worse problems than him theyve got mr sanders doped to the eyes mr rand what do we do if the angelino cops come for him nothing pres killed two saboteurs and captured a third that third one was lucky pres had every right to kill him too los angeles isnt going to do a thing to him yes sirbut the kids werent carrying dynamite dammit it was just a box of sand how will that look to a grand jury he looked up to see tony shrug and say blake those three did their damndest to convince us they were ready to wreck todos santos id say they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams think of it as evolution in action a bark of laughter and a sober voice it wont stop there tony god im glad im not banner answering laughter so is everyone else tonight they closed the door they had forgotten him again he resented it he resented their laughter it mocked his coming death they remembered him an hour later the stubbyfingered guard led him back to the elevator and took him down and put him in a subway car and said things he didnt bother to hear he had already made his decision thomas lunan zapped the electronic gizmo and drove the jaguar into its garage he wrestled two bags of groceries out and set them down then busied himself with locks an enormous metal bar across the steel garage door then the police lock and two deadbolts to let himself out the smaller door for humans once outside with his packages he had to set them down and lock up his apartment was three blocks away and he had to carry the groceries the streets were well lighted though and busily traveled it was one reason hed selected that garage the apartment building had been a house before it became old and rundown dilapidated wouldnt have been too strong a word the hail carpet was threadbare and the walls hadnt been painted in years there were only two apartments in the ancient house he climbed one ifight to his own and unlocked it the locks were nat new and didnt appear particularly good although in fact they were recommended by a firm of security consultants hed interviewed inside everything was different his apartment was tastefully furnished and everything was bright and clean his stereo and tv were expensive and new some of the paintings on the wall were originals but from the outside youd never know there was anything worth stealing which was the idea lunan was rather proud of the method hed hit an he wanted to live near the beach and couldnt afford the expensive beach communities therefore it had to be venice with its old houses built in the s but venice was a highcrime area so how could he enjoy his expensive possessions without being ripped off obviously he had to live in a way that kept anyone from knowing he had anything worth stealing the car was the toughest part if he parked the jag near the building someone was bound to get the idea that its owner had good loot theyd follow him home and rip him off lunan lived alone and his job kept him away for weeklong intervals that was bad enough but worse would be far a street gang to come when he was home which was why he was careful going from his car to his apartment and so far it had worked perfectly he turned on the news but paid little attention to it keeping an ear tuned to alert him to anything unusual unusual for him meant a lead on a hot story lunan was in trouble not he told himself big trouble but trouble just the same he hadnt had a big story in months and the station director was breathing dawn his neck if he didnt find something pretty quick theyd assign him something and hed worked too long and hard for his high status as a roving investigator to go back on assignment worse the associate producer who handled assignments didnt like him and neither did most of his reporter colleagues theyd give him dull crap not all dull crap of course he was too good for that but any dull crap was tao much the trouble was he hadnt had an idea in a long time and he lived on ideas lunan didnt do stories the way others did didnt chase ambulances or go to fires or hang around the police station he didnt do what the others would call news at all his specialty was indepth interviews digging out big humaninterest stories that explained the world so what to do now he estimated that he had about two weeks before they called him in and put him back in the pool not very long how in hell was he to find something big in two weeks he decided to fall back on a technique that had worked for him in the past go fishing wander out peoplewatch talk with anyone he could find and let matters develop it sounded haphazard and it was but luck had been with him in the past hed gotten two pulitzer nominations that way so where to go he put on a classic the beatles and relaxed with a glass of chivas regal and after a while he remembered that he hadnt visited the santa monica mall in quite a while why not maybe something good would come of it the leaper left the subway at the flower street exit in central los angeles there were buildings here not high by todos santos standards but high enough the men who had mocked him in todos santos would read of his death and they would be sorry but would they know it was important he was carrying no identification and no suicide note he had only the money the todos santas guard had thrust into his pocket he had decided to die anonymously now that was not enough he must leave something he stood between the empty track and the walls scrawled with obscene messages and gang symbols while halfthoughts formed in his mind he searched his packets for a magic marker until he found it he stood before the wall and presently inspiration came he printed in large letters over a message that had almost been washed away think of it as evolution in action now that was good it was not too proud it was the statement of a man who had done one last service to the human race by ridding it of a chronic loser he would scrawl it on the parapet or wherever just before he jumped and this man tony would recognize it for his own words he turned and walked briskly toward the exit stairway big jim planchet poured himself another bourbon and settled back into his study chair he thought that his visitor was finally getting to the point george harris had spent a lot of time talking about nothing and it was late time for planchet to rejoin his other guests an the patio you know i go to jail every week harris said councilman planchet frowned i guess id heard about it in fact he knew almost as much as harris did hed had to check it out because he wanted to be sure that having harris on his campaign finance committee wouldnt cause him trouble with his los angeles constituents george harris had falsified his income tax returns been caught and convicted of tax fraud at his trial hed said hed done it in protest against washington policies that he refused to continue paying for that may nat have helped him get the judges sympathy in addition to his fines harris had to spend four dozen weekends in the county jail they let him out on sunday nights so he could conduct his business but every saturday morning he had to go back not many knew where harris went on weekends and most of those who did felt sorry for him doesnt everybody cut his tax return as close as possible there were same who thought harris deserved a medal so there wasnt any problem about remaining friends with george which was just as well since planchet had known him for years i need help harris said big jim planchet frowned look george that was a federal court if your lawyers cant get you out i sure cant i know that harris said impatiently most people think i got off easy i guess i did compared to what it would be like if they kept me inside all week but jim i cant stand much more of it this was going to be embarrassing planchet could tell harris tough old george harris was about to break down and cry and that wouldnt do at all they werent that good friends harris would regret it later andlook george i know its not pleasant but not pleasant jim its sheer hell no human dignity at all the jailers are sadists every week its the same speech from one of the fat slobs im real easy to get along with real easy but you give me trouble and ill make you regret it just remember that them rules you see pasted on the wall got nothing to do with what really goes on in here remember that and well get along fine every week he says that and he means every ward of it they enjoy their work jim they like waking us up at fourthirty in the morning they like herding us to the showers in lockstep they like rousting us into a holding tank and keeping forty men crowded into a cell meant for six i come in every saturday at eight in the morning i have to be there at eight they dont even let me in until nine but god help me if im not there at eight to sit out front for an hour then jammed into a holding cell for processing every damn week they know im coming so whats all this processing but i dont dare ask and you wouldnt either yeah well and thats not the half of it harris had broken the barrier of reluctance to talk now the words rushed out in a flood breakfast at five and its not edible soggy bread eggs cooked in fish oil at five am on sunday they say breakfast has to be early because most of the inmates have court appearances and need to be ready by eight maybe thats so but on sunday and for lunch theres the same damned bread and greasy meat sausage wrapped in rubber with rubber potatoes they are they bounce when you drop one jail isnt supposed to be fun george i know that but do they have to take away every last shred of dignity are they reforming me how im not a criminal no the judge thought you were something more dangerous a rebel damn it hitler was treated better when they jailed him after the munich putsch sure and if theyd treated him worse maybe he wouldnt have tried it again planchet thought make it easy on tax evaders and thered be a tax rebellion all over the country and what would happen to the poor then george was protesting nuclear power plants but the same logic could be used to protest welfareand welfare was a lot less popular than power plants he really didnt have a lot of sympathy for george harris on the other hand there were those campaign donations and harris seemed to have influence with some heavy people in real estate a good man to be friends with and the people they put me in with jim one weekend i had a cell by myself the toilet didnt work it had overflowed all over the floor but that was the best weekend i had yet the animals they throw me in with i guess that could get pretty bad planchet said what do you want me to do the jails county not city i dont have any control over it thats the sheriffs department but cant you do something we try every now and then a judge declares that jail cruel and inhuman and theres a big brouhaha about reforms but it never amounts to anything yeah but what can i do im at the end of my rope jim i suppose planchet said he lifted a microphone from a desk drawer emil see if you can get mr george harrisspelled like it soundsset up for vip treatment at county jail hes on one of those weekend detention work furlough programs reports on saturday morning and gets out sunday night at least try to get him a better class of cell mate county owes us a couple call in one of our favors he put the microphone back in the desk there my assistant will get on it in the morning harris looked genuinely relieved cant promise planchet warned but i think things will change for the better a little better anyway thanks thanks a hell of a lot he drained his glass oh about your fund raiser i think i can get some of the guys at the athletic club to buy tables itd be easier though if youd show up once in a while he looked accusingly at planchets middle which was beginning to hang over the councilmans belt if youd been that out of shape you wouldnt even have made the team at usc suppose youre right planchet said that had been a long time ago when jim planchet was a star running back that hadnt hurt his political career either george patted his own flat stomach you ought to keep in shape jim work out sometimes weekends in the pokey dont seem to have hurt you that way planchet said hell they dont the only way to exercise is regularly every damned day and can you see me doing exercises in a cell with a screaming queen but leave out how flabby youre getting you ought to get to the club to meet the boys play a little poker once in a while youd be surprised how many friends you can make losing a couple of hundred bucks planchet nodded good advice now when da i do it i dont even have time to see my own son whats the problem planchet shrugged todos santos mostly lot of businesses in my district losing customers to that termite hill not much i can do but they sure want me to try harris nodded in sympathy yeah they bring in their own construction people too buy everything from their favorites for a while i thought i had a deal lined up selling them some electrical supplies but they found somebody inside their shop to take care of it for them your constituents have a legitimate complaint todos santos is exempt from most of the regulations that drive our businesses under sure but that was the only way theyd build the place planchet said fifteen years ago los angeles had been glad to get todos santos terrorists had tried to start riots by starting fires in one of the ghetto areas it had worked fine they threw so many firebombs that they started a firestarm and burned down square miles of city leaving a hideous angry scar a lot of people homeless and unemployment soaring when the consortium that owned todos santas offered to rebuild and create a hundred thousand jobs and solve the freshwater problem in the bargain congress and the state legislature and everybody else had fallen all over themselves to give the money people the incentives they demanded probably a mistake planchet thought but it looked like a good idea at the time you ever have to talk money with todos santos harris asked not too often planchet got up and put his glass on the bar harris continued to talk as he followed planchet to the party be glad you never did theyve got a female shark youd have to do business with beautiful woman but cold as that iceberg they have out in the harbor hard as nails when the waiter brought the check barbara churchward took it before the young man across the table from her could protest his look of dismay was interesting and idly she wondered if he were worried about the deal he was trying to swing or if he simply couldnt accept the idea of a woman paying for dinner it never hurt to be nice she thought its all right ted she said we own half of this place i get a goad discount not that it mattered a lot mr binghanipton was in for a disappointment possibly several if shed correctly read his intentions for the rest of the evening not that it would be particularly unpleasant to let him show her his earnings report or whatever he was likely to use to induce her to his guest suite on level he was handsome he was intelligent he was personable but she never mixed business with pleasure as he was about to find out and for that matter she wasnt going to do any business with him tomorrow either it had looked like a good deal if a trifle complicated shed recently acquired a company that had an excellent outside sales farce in fact the salesmen were better than the production staff if she had a goad home product line to add to their wares they could handle it fine and mr ted binghampton represented an undercapitalized company that made excellent lawcost vacuum cleaners that her sales force could peddle door to door with very little retraining the only problem was the iceberg tennaha electric had a generous pension policy how many of its employees were average if there were a lot of them the initial profits would be high but after a few years things would come apart millie she thought has sam come up with the figures on the age structure of tennaha yet data flowed into her mind age of employees pension entitlement average turnover average age when hired when the stream was finished she examined what shed learned from long experience she controlled her expression but inwardly she frowned tennaha was an oldsters outfit old craftsmen they werent hiring new people and they had a lot of elderly craftsmen who wouldnt be around more than a decade no goad as shed suspected the iceberg was just too big she toyed with the idea of buying tennaha out skimming the cream and unloading but that involved the risk of finding a sucker she could probably do that the inflated downstream cost load was well hidden and it had taken a lot of investigation to nail it down but she couldnt be sure of a sucker when she needed one besides she had a better use for the sales force there was another company cmc inc small located right here in los angeles that was vulnerable to a stack takeover and that looked like a much better deal she had two of her people out talking to the employees if the key ones were willing the whole outfit could be moved into todos santos adding to ts capabilities the money would stay in ts banks and credit unions available for additional investment rather than moving outward to columbus where tennaha had its plant there were a lot of advantages to that todos santos was exempted from most of the stupid regulations that businesses outside had to live with if they bought tennaha theyd have a hell of a time strepmlining the place what with equal opportunity and antiage discrimination and all far better to import the capability than acquire an outside firm of course the management of cmc wouldnt want to sell out to todos santos but that was a technical problem only the right offer to the stockholders at the right time and the directors wouldnt know what hit them they were a pretty naive bunch anyway a couple of the directors werent so bad and those shed keep on but most would have to go hey came back ted binghampton said youre a million miles away oh sorry barbara said i guess i was i can never tell what youre thinking she gave him her best smile which she knew was pretty good theres luck until she found out if the key cmc people would move to todos santas it would be best to keep the tennaha deal alive she listened idly as he said something about what a pleasure it was to do business with a lovely woman shed heard that before and she could respond with the proper smile without listening she didnt have to listen she had a totally objective appreciation of her attractiveness high after all playboy had once offered to do a spread on her when she was just getting started in business now that was flattery thank god shed had sense enough to refuse although at the time she sure could have used the money back then she was young enough and naive enough to think that physical attractiveness was terribly important all the evidence said it was shed made plenty of money by modeling enough that shed had to pay some attention to what was done with the money and discovered that she liked business it was the most exciting game in town it hadnt hurt to be a pretty young thing who could talk like an ingenue either not then she was popular at parties where she met a lot of other young women with money models movie and tv stars the whole panoply of hollywood society and after a while she was managing their investments before that phase of her life ended shed built a multimilliondollar investment counseling firm in which she still owned a percent nonvoting interest shed also earned enough to pay for her implant and that was invaluable while the people she negotiated with fumbled with papers and tried to remember figures she had all the data available simply by wanting it and we have some new production figures ted was saying i didnt bring them down to dinner but if youd like to go over them now i can show you she was considering how to refuse politely when the warbling began inside her head and she knew she had real trouble vii those who would treat politics and morality apart will never understand the one or the other john viscount morley of blackburn night meetings the conference had started when tony rand came back to executive row he entered quietly and took his seat at the big mahogany table most of the rulers of todos santos were there art banner at the end of the table with preston sanders next to him sanders ware a strange expression haunted eyes in a face relaxed by tranquilizers barbara churchward even more beautiful than usual in a gold lamй gown that probably cast two thousand dollars her red hair swept up into a sculptured helmet her eyes focused on nothing next to her was frank mead his buttocks overflowing the comfortable chair his face in a perpetual scowl as comptroller mead worked for banner and churchward but he also reported directly to the board in zurich rumor had it that mead was amast as powerful as bonner certainly no one wanted to annoy him needlessly there were others colonel amos cross chief of security a thin dapper man going bald in a handsomely distinguished way the young medical resident whod given sanders the shot look ing very out of place among the mighty and john shapiro the head of the legal staff selfconscious in a shirt open at the collar usually he wore a fullvested suit and conservative necktie they were all looking at tony rand banner frowned learn anything some they had one signal generator that put out a code millie interprets as routine maintenance another that bollixed up the capacitance detectors and a couple of others i wont understand without a few hours work any conclusions from that banner asked good brains at work how could anyone that smart be that stupid tony how did they know what theyd need tony shook his head some of its logical but they couldnt have guessed the frequencies and theyd never have guessed the codes to open locks meaning they had an inside source frank mead asked its likely tony said probably somebody who has access to millie but ive no idea who i dont either banner said i hate to think of anyone as disloyal mead asked whose staff would he be an yours rand asked mead shook his head none of my people know a damn thing about electronics i dont myself look if weve got a goddam traitor in here we have to get rid of him certainly banner said well see what we can do in the morning but for now we dont need another penetration colonel are your troops on alert yes sir cross said he smoothed dawn his nearly invisible pencil mustache then put his hands together and laid them carefully on the table where he could watch them ive doubled the watch in central and weve got teams with dogs out walking the perimeter also with your permission id like to see just whos had access to millie banner nodded agreement ive already got millie working up a report for me tony is it possible theyve got a way to get information out of millie without leaving any record sure you do it all the time so does barbara and your depu ties and delores anyone with an implant or with a terminal and unrestricted access arent there records of whos called up what file and when barbara churchward asked sure tony said but the accession records arent secure almost anyone could alter them why is that mead demanded seems awfully loose to me well tony said every time you put in closed ifies you complicate the programs complex programs are hard to maintain we can do it but it will get expensive banners lips tightened okay thats another problem thatll have to wait until morning he took in a deep breath planchets kid of all people hes more powerful than the mayor he can really hurt us and weve got to assume hell try scapegoat sanders said hell want a scapegoat me well he wont get you bonner said johnny whats the legal situation not goad shapiro said for the moment were all right were a police department and weve notified ourselves but its been an hour and by now we should already have called the county coroners office once we do that the das men will take jurisdiction away from us can we fight that shapiro shook his head decisively no sir no way tados santos has a lot of legal immunities but were still a part of la county and the state of california nothing we can do about that id like to ignore it frank mead said bury em deep and say the hell with la county be serious frank bonner said a hundred people know about the breakin not to mention the thompson boy mead raised hands the size of small hams yeah i know it was just a thought he brought his hands down flat on the table in a gesture of helpless rage but damn all planchets going to hurt us just now when the cash flows a mess its just a bloody lousy time to fight la theres never a really good time for economic warfare churchward said to no one in particular john what happens when we do report this banner asked will they try to arrest mr sanders probably they dont have to but given the political situation they will if planchet insists on it i dont like that much frank mead muttered preston sanders laughed it was a horrible sound but mr mead youve always been so certain id screw up now its happened mead was shocked hey sanders i dont deserve that theres no need for that pres barbara churchward said her voice was smoothly professional art we know what happened here do we need pres any longer banner frowned hes my deputy and doped to the eyes churchward said i suggest you let him get a goad nights sleep i suppose youre right one thing we make clear though los angeles does not put sanders in jail they can interview him all they want to but right here are we agreed there was a chorus of assents except for shapiro the lawyer looked worried not going to be easy to do art if they decide to arrest him how do we stop them for the moment hes too ill to be moved dr finder you take care of that take pres down to your hospital and keep him there no visitors without my approval only dont say its my approval say its dr weintraubs wont that do it johnny shapiro nodded slowly i suppose best get a couple of shrinks into the act we have to have a plausible reason for this im not crazy sanders protested damn it i am not crazy nobody says you are banner snapped but its best if we say youre emotionally upset which he certainly is tony rand thought pres its all right just go dawn and babble once in a while you know think up some good stories for the city shrinks like you see green snakes crawling out of the air vents and flying purple people eaters in the bathtub if you lack imagination ill come help you sanders giggled banner nodded to the medical resident and dr finder stood after a moment sanders got up and let finder lead him out of the room he said it not me frank mead said after the door closed behind sanders and he did screw it up what would you have done banner demanded waited for security to catch the upstairs intruder mead said and tried knockout gas letting them blow up the hydrogen input lines tony rand said thats not too bright better than starting a war with los angeles thats enough from both of you bonner said we are not here to go over what happened were here to decide what we do now understood the first thing wed better do is call the coroners office shapiro said the longer we put that off the worse we look all right banner agreed ill have sandra do that flaw he paused for a moment with his head tilted to one side there now weve got less than an hour before it hits the fan next who should tell councilman planchet if he has any special friends in todos santos millie doesnt know about it maclean stevens barbara churchward said call him and let him notify the councilman good thinking i suppose id better do that now excuse me bonner left the room to go to an adjoining office well need statements for the press churchward said i suppose sandra can get the pr people on that ill check with art now shes doing it rand thought telepathy well not quite she tells millie millie tells banner and vice versa but its as close to reliable telepathy as im ever going to see and there will be all kinds of economic impact churchward said sales of ts products in the la area will fall like a falcon i wonder if well have food shortages before this breaks it wouldnt be a bad idea to lay in supplies you sound as if youre preparing for a siege frank mead said not a bad analogy john shapiro said and not a bad idea either the man lay sprawled across the concrete stairs a dozen steps below the subway exit beneath the bruises his long face had never been handsome and the wrinkles formed a permanent sulk his skull was distorted it had been pounded repeatedly against one of the steps his clothes were worn and dirty but they had been expensive the rookie who had discovered him walked away wobbling a little and looking greenish lieutenant donovan politely ignored him he watched as a lab man turned out the pockets nothing the muggers whod killed him picked him clean there was nothing in his packets but a pocket pack of kleenex and a magic marker pen donovan wondered why they had left those solving muggings is like bailing out a lifeboat with a teaspoon he thought he wouldnt waste much time with this one hed been on his way home when he saw the meat wagon pull up and had come over to look otherwise hed never have came to the scene muggings were for lowergrade detectives not homicide lieutenants wonder what he was doing here damn fool of all the places to get off the subway the trains are safe enough but not this station damn fool donovan had given up crying for them but he had to go through the motions it was still a murder no witnesses no way to find anyone whod been riding the train theyd either come forward or they wouldnt but there was another possibility there was an access way into the uncompleted tunnel system right here in this station the todos santos crews were working back thereif he stood very quietly he could hear it the humming roar of their big digging machine burning its way under city hall maybe one of their crews had come out to use the can or something not likely but it was possible he made a note to call the ts tunnel foreman or he thought i could go in there now and talk to their people that would be interesting ive never seen one of those big machines working and id like to and this is as good a chance as any sir the rookie cop was back stifi looking a bit greenish his eyes avoided the dead man ive found something if youll bring that pen that was in his pocket he led the way downstairs broad lines in blue ink a freshly printed message among the other messages less obscene than most think of it as evolution in action if thats a dying message its not likely to name his murderer said donovan youre right though it matches the niaii mc iiin d шf marker he probably wrote it another reason to talk to the ts tunnel crew maybe they saw him writing on their door i wander what he meant we cant ask him said donovan and forgot it or thought he had maclean stevens kept his emergency phone on a fiftyfoot cord rooted in the central hall that way he could move around the house while tied up on the phone in particular he could reach the coffee cup and the liquor cabinet and when he got calls on that phone he often needed to this time he needed both during a marathon bargaining session on the costs of digging new subways art bonner and tony rand had introduced stevens to the habit of lacing strong coffee with brandy now as he listened to banner he padded barefoot out to the kitchen to put on the coffee then to the front room for brandy then he decided not to wait f or the coffee all right art ill tell him stevens said god damn itoh hell ill tell him he put dawn the phone and poured two fingers of christian brothers he was tossing it off when jeanine came in in her lumpy flannel nightgown as usual when she was disturbed at night she looked both irritated and wide awake youll tell wham she asked councilman planchet his sons been killed oh no macmac it will kill eunice stevens nodded yeah who was that one of your police art bonner her face showed surprise then shock then went blank but art what happened to jimmy he was killed breaking into todos santos and now ive got to call mr planchet she came over and held him for a moment her head buried against his shoulder then she was all business again ill get your coffee and your slippers no need for you to catch cold which was the way she handled any emergency and why mac couldnt conceive of life without her he held the telephone without dialing this was going to hurt big jim planchet was in many ways more powerful than the mayor mayors lasted two or three terms at most but a city councilman could be reelected forever this was planchets fourth term and his second as council president he made himself dial the number it buzzed four times then a thick sleepy voice said yeah mac stevens there was a significant pause stevens wouldnt call without a damned good reason yes mac what is it theres been an accident at todos santos stevens said your son was involved he paused just long enough to let that sink in to let planchet guess there was worse coming hes dead mr planchet dead did you say de td but i just saw him at dinner the voice lowered spoke conspirationally accident you said what kind of accident jimmy and diana lauder yeah i know her nice kid broke into todos santos they were both killed by todos santos guards brake in killed by guards mac that doesnt make sense my kid wouldnt have hurt anybody why would the guards kill him the todos santas people say they were carrying a lot of complicated electronic equipment and boxes of what looked like dynamite the guards thought it was a real attack by pro mates another long pause then ill be out as soon as i get my clothes on meet me at the east main entrance of the box i wouldnt advise it mr planchet theres nothing to see your son and diana arent there any longer and the area where it happened isis contaminated contaminated how with poison gas they gassed my kid gassed him planchet was shouting in rage then his voice fell again where is he theyre taking him to the coroners labs to the morgue jesus i dont wanti cant take eunice to the morgue whatwhat can i do stay there mac advised get some friends over your clergyman ill look into this for you yeah do that there was another long pause they gassed him macmac i want to see justice done here justice im assuming the district attorney will decide to prosecute shapiro said thats a fairly safe bet and assuming that the first step is a preliminary hearing the da will try to convince the judge that a crime has been committed and that they have a prima facie case against sanders he looked thoughtful for a moment its not customary to put on a defense at a preliminary hearing but my immediate thought is that we ought to our defense will be that theres been no crime at all only a justified action what are the chances of winning banner asked not good the judge will be under a lot of pressure here are two dead bodies unarmed harmless kids were we justified in using deadly force its going to be a sticky decision and most of the precedents are against us we could win but i doubt it suppose we do barbara churchward said what do we do with sanders put him back to work banner snapped it would be costly churchward said i think you ought to consider it carefully shes right mead said planchet isnt going to forget this his kids been killed and as long as sanders is here to remind him hell be coming at us hes my deputy i need him we need sales too churchward said i dont mean to suggest that we dump him out but the romulus corporation has a lot more enterprises than todos santos and will we be doing pres any favors by keeping him here where hell be surrounded by people wholl call him a murderer every chance they get romulus is a big company art they can find pres a good post somewhere else prisoner chasers banner muttered sir shapiro prompted old army story never knew if it was true but we all believed it that if a soldier assigned to guard prisoners ever shot one they lined him the cost of the cartridges gave him a carton of cigarettes and transferred him to another post what were proposing to do with pres johnny suppose we lose this hearing then hell be bound over to the state for trial shapiro said and well try to convince a jury that he acted properly i think weve got a fairly good chance of that and we can always play legal games to get it declared a mistrial and there are appeals and and meanwhile pres is in jail well probably out on bail and spending his life in courtrooms banner said id like to think we can take better care of our people than that how shapiro asked bonner shrugged thats not all the bad news shapiro said what now you can bet that within a week someones going to file for an injunction to make us dismantle our defenses make us get rid of the lethal gasses and theyre very likely to get that art very likely weve always been on shaky ground with that stuff shit fire colonel crass looked sad we can increase the physical security try to keep intruders out of the system in the first place but its hard to see just what more we can do the vx was a backup in case physical security failed turned out we needed it or thought we did churchward said same thing colonel cross said uhin this preliminary hearing how much of our system do you have to make public a lot shapiro said i have to establish just how tough it is to get into that tunnel show that these werent just casual trespassersand that sanders had good reason to know they werent i thought so tony were going to have to rework the system again rand nodded agreement he had already thought of that and was mulling aver ideas it will take time i can delay the preliminary hearing shapiro said for months if youd like i dont like barbara churchward said this thing is a financial disaster anyway keep it hanging fire and its worse what about this injunction bonner demanded how long can you delay hearings on that a week maybe two shapiro said no guarantee of longer not long enough but it will have to do rand said i dont like to be crass about things frank mead said but theres this problem i have how much is all this going to cost a lot banner said and i dont think of one thing we can do about it me either mead said look art im on your side sure you are tony rand thought support banner all the way like you did pres but its not up to me mead said its up to zurich and theyre bottomline people were fighting for our lives art banner said this whole project could go down in bureaucratic regulations the way the rest of the countrys going so barbara youre going to have to live with delays and frank youll sign same big checks with a smile and ill talk to zurich frank meads jaw tightened but he didnt say anything no choices banner said rand needs time to redesign the defense system and until thats done we dont dare show a court the system we use now weve got to delay johnny buy us time as much as you can tony you and the colonel get to work shouldnt somebody ask pres rand asked sure well talk to him in the morning banner said okay we all know what were supposed to do lets get to it viii justice consists of an enduring and unalterable intention to render to each what that person deserves aristotle serendipity thomas lunan relaxed on one of the circular benches in the santa monica mall smiling looking about himself sometimes sipping a small coke thomas lunan had presence he carried a tangible selfsatisfaction and a nice smile passersby usually smiled back he was too well dressed to be a bum too sedentary to be doing anything but goofing off in a minute or so hed move on perhaps to a drugstore perhaps to another bench a block down every other reporter would be out at todos santos or in the la city hall two kids dead one a pretty girl one a city councilmans boy both unarmed both harmless the story of the year and thomas lunan was in the santa monica mall it wouldnt make sense to the city editor it didnt make sense to lunan except that he trusted his instincts his luck his moira the crowd meandered past some struggled with bulky clusters of paper bags isolated shoppers swung wide of halfadozen collegeage boys and a girl mostly lunan was ignored others shared his bench they generally refused his offer of conversation when nobody was watching he sometimes talked to himself lunan called it legwork a young girl came past even lunan wasnt sure what made her stand out but she did she was vivid in a crowd of blurred faces her walk her hair her style of dress the curious way she treated the people around her moving obstacles to be avoided or objects of curiosity a todos santos girl he stepped briskly forward pardon me miz her reaction was curious she looked around the mall then she looked over thomas lunan yes im a reporter for the los angeles trib youve heard about the murders last night she almost walked away ive heard she spat her anger showed what do you think about it she debated with herself to speak perchance to be misquoted lunan knew that reaction but she was young probably under twenty she would speak they were not murders she said her voice very much under control now but the district attorney is going to charge uh sanders with murder lunan said mister sanders was doing his duty the angelinos have no right to interfere in our internal affairs he was diffident i wonder did the situation require such drastic action yes how can you be so certain i mean you cant know much about what happened there was very little in the news this morning i know exactly what happened and i dont need to read it in angelino papers either mister bonner showed us this morning she saw his puzzled frown on the tv our cable station mister bonner the general manager of todos santos this morning he showed us exactly where the invaders were and what wouldve happened if theyd set off a bomb he would have hated losing her but he risked it they didnt have a bomb your angelino children did their best to pretend they were fromate saboteurs carrying a bomb she said how can they complain when they were treated like saboteurs think of it as evolution in action ive heard that before lunan thought in the city room unidentified mugging victim wrote it just before somebody pounded his head into jelly where did you hear that phrase from mr bonner she frowned trying to remember no i dont know where i heard it from one of the guards when i was leaving this morning too bad it wasnt bonner lunan thought it would make a better story if it had been said by a high official of todos santos think of it as evolution in actionwell its certainly true that two of them arent complaining i notice you name the fromates directly lunans microphone projecting from his shirt collar stood just beyond and below his chin like a hatpin tiny as it was it made some people nervous but not this girl who else she asked they broke up a concert with wasps only last week they tried to put lsd in our water theyre proud of doing things like that not bombs no theres another group that takes credit for bombs and grenades she said the ecology army something like that but theyre all fromates who else hates us that much she had more to say about atrocities real and fancied against todos santos some lunan knew about others he would have to look up in the ifies and of course she knew all about the kansas city incident where terrorists had killed a dozen arcology dwellers when she stopped for breath he offered to buy her some iced tea he was beginning to think hed struck gold let the other reporters dig for facts the key to this affair was the conflict between two cultures how had todos santos become so paranoid why did they react so strongly their official statement on the news this morning said they regretted the necessity of sanderss action sorry theyd killed two kids sure but stressed the necessity of defending themselves and that was what lunan wanted the key two cultures so different that lunan could spot a todos santos girl in a milling crowd of shoppers although he wasnt sure how hed known she was about eighteen she could have spent most of her life inside the towering balconied walls he wanted the flavor of todos santos the life the attitudes the philosophy your angelino children like that he let the conversation drift away from the murders drift where it would he asked questions listening is a fine art and lunan had mastered it her name was cheryl drinkwater she was a student at todos santos university where she was a sophomore in engineering her father was a waldo operator lunan had found out quite a lot about her and it wasnt hard to get her talking about life in todos santos and we used to jump just as the elevator was starting down she said if youre careful you can touch the ceiling then get back before theres weight sounds too bloody fast for me like a roller coaster cheryl was amused if we slowed them down itd take twice as long to get anywhere wouldnt it weve got a hundred levels to get around in narrow chin upturned nose brunette hair streaked with blond she was lovely not beautiful in the sense of classic beauty but lovely just the same when she laughed lunan wished for a photographer maybe later she knew little of the fromates beyond their constant sabotage attacks when he spoke of their work in preserving the ecology of americas wild places she laughed we live in a nearly closed ecology she said we know exactly what comes in and goes out we grow up knowing what your fromates have to go to college to learn not my fromates sorry not mine either she frowned we never had any trouble from the fromates or the angelinos when i was growing up say do you remember a movie a featurelength cartoon called uh the nest i think yah ten years ago well my parents say the fromates made that film and all the hassle has come since i dont remember she looked a question at him he had heard that from another source but he couldnt say so not in his present role he changed the subject when he asked her how she liked living in a walled fort she said that a walled fort didnt have balconies you could be getting a bit inbred lunan said your universityare all the students residents in ts just about we have a few exchange students some of my friends go to schools outside i like it where i am we get real working engineers for instructors and real managers miss churchward teaches economics mister rand lectures on city design and so on she wasnt exactly defensive but she wasnt going to admit that life might hold more than a promise of a place in todos santos or some other arcology youre watched every minute of the day he said thats why she doesnt freeze up in front of a microphone isnt that a bit much of a good thing she smiled up at him across her second iced tea maybe we dont have a lot to hide touchй dammit well dating they tell me the automobile revolutionized dating it meant that couples could find privacy any people so long as they could get to a car youve taken a giant step backward havent you i wouldnt know i didnt grow up then but the he almost said rentacops security would know every boy you dated where you went i suppose they can even spy on the rooms she thought it through frowning then we dont have cars and we dont have much privacy we ball but we tell our parents you bb after all theyll find out anyway she said briskly go ahead and ball but tell mom and dad thats what my brother andy told me when i was growing up and the schools teach us how not to get pregnant if we dont want to i wouldnt ball with a boy my parents didnt like but that still leaves me plenty of leeway of course marriage is a lot more serious thing she noticed his expression which must have been interesting whats wrong did i use the wrong word no we use it too jackpot talk about serendipity the alleyway smelled of urine and stale garbage it was bounded on one side by a blank wooden wall on the other by a chainlink fence opaquely overgrown with ivy the blacktop surface was marked with crystalline smears of dried urine homicide lieutenant donovan wanted to hold his nose but he didnt dare there was a growing crowd of chanting blacks near the alley entrance poleece murderers the voice was female but not feminine metro squads coming sergeant ortiz said softly the local precinct commanders worried he cant hold them donovan nodded and went back to the body that lay crumpled behind an overflowing garbage can it had been a young black man there wasnt a lot left of the face beneath the thick afro there wouldnt be after a charge of numberfour buck fired from the twentyinch barrel of a remington model twelvegauge riot gun had done its work there was also a large hole in the chest a dozen police stood near the body two stood just apart from the others not quite part of the group but not yet separated from it either donovan motioned to one of them and led him a few steps farther away from the others he kept his voice low as he said okay patterson lets go over it once more yes sir we got a call at ohnine sixteen this morning householder heard noises at the back door when we arrived at theiddress of complainant we drove to the back of the house at that moment without warning an unidentified black male broke and ran for the alley i pursued on foot while officer farrer took the cruiser to the other end of the alleyway before entering the alley i drew my service pistol and observed officer farrer with the riot gun at the other end of the alley on entering the alley i heard at least two gunshots the shots came from behind a garbage can i shouted police and heard an additional gunshot the flash attracted my attention and i saw an armed suspect crouched behind the garbage can i aimed for the can at chest height and fired one shot as i fired i heard my partners shotgun discharge the suspect fell from behind the can when we approached we found acaliber colt commander automatic pistol near the suspect we then reported an officerinvolved shooting to the dispatcher and after hes rehearsed that a few more times hell have it down perfectly donovan thought now for farrer he looked up in annoyance as a black imperial came into the far end of the alley the police line holding back the crowd parted briefly to let the car through donovan saw batons uplifted and swinging justice someone shouted hope metro gets here soon patterson said can i go now sir donovan nodded and stood waiting for the imperial when it got closer he recognized maclean stevens and felt relieved the mayor kept some strange ones on his personal staff but stevens was all right the imperials window rolled down stevens looked at donovan and raised an eyebrow donovan went over looks righteous he said some crazy kid with a fortyfive blazed away at two patrolmen and they blew him up stevens scowled distaste the crowd thinks differently why hell they always turn out when theres a shooting donovan said you know that sir he frowned something was wrong stevens wasnt reacting properly why what was goingholy shit no wonder stevens was looking funny he wasnt alone in the car donovan recognized the man in the back seat the reverend ebenezer clay an oldtime civil rights activist and leader what the hell was he doing here frantically donovan tried to remember what hed said not a lot no real harm done hed said they meaning blacks in watts but what the hell it was true they did turn out whenever there was a shooting reverend clay had an appointment with the mayor stevens said then we heard about the shooting and came down to see nothing much to see donovan said uhthe bodys not very pretty sir you wouldnt want to look i can stand it reverend clay said he got out of the car a tall thin man with skin the color of weak tea he had cottontuft white hair that might have come right out of an old movie clay wore a gray suit and clerical collar but he had put a lavender handkerchief in the breast pocket he looked around the alley and curled his lip in distaste then went over to the body it was a good shooting donovan said suspect fired three times at the officers witnesses stevens asked donovan shrugged only the officers only the officers nobody heard shots nobody saw anything nobody wholl admit it donovan said and believe me mr stevens were looking hell i know whatil happen as soon as the officers tell their story for the papers therell be a dozen witnesses all saying it didnt happen that way then well start running them down half of them couldnt possibly have been within miles of here when it happened some more wifi tell stories that dont make sense but one or two could have been here and wifi tell stories that fit the evidence they know about and then well have good cops in trouble reverend clay came back to join them he gestured toward the crowd i will talk with them to say what stevens asked to calm them or calm what is calm clay demanded a brother lies dead and you speak of calm a youth a mere boy that mere boy tried to shoot two police officers donovan said quietly think of it as evolution in action got to be careful about that say that here and my ass is grass so they say clay said yet why would he do that he was guilty of no crime none we know of donovan admitted at least the officers sent to look at the house where they first saw the kid couldnt find anything but he did have a gun we havent been able to trace it may have been stolen you accuse him but he cannot defend himself clay said reverend youre not making sense stevens said quietly neither you nor i know enough to have an opinion you wanted to see the scene for yourself and youve done that i think we should leave while my people cry for justice clay said not much we can do to get it for them stevens said there never has been all right mr stevens ill come with you i have missed my appointment with the mayor but there is a matter of importance we must discuss he got into the car as they drove away the first three units of the metro squad arrived and donovan felt a lot better eleven years earlier thomas lunan had come here with a girl with apartments ready for tenancy in the west wall the managers had been looking for publicity there had been refreshments and guides and a hang glider floating around inside the mall itself thomas lunan had been a fledgling newsman then but he hadnt come for news todos santos had been publicized to within an inch of its life the worlds television audiences knew all there was to know about the halffinished cityinabuilding but it was a fine excuse to bring what was her name marion something a fine way to get marions attention shed loved the way the hang glider floated around in all that empty space diving down to buzz her then riding the updrafts from the air conditioning fans they had sampled the smorgasbord and shopped the todos santos mall and then thomas lunan had used his press card to get them up on the roof the roof of the mall that was the mall had been finished and twothirds occupied with the overhanging balconies partially completed the citys outer walls had been finished too and some of the interior lunan and marion had stood on the roof of the mall and looked up into a tremendous lidless box crisscrossed with girders girders to shape the inverted pyramids that would be the air light wells the tips of the inverted pyramids stood on four pillars as big as small apartment buildings eleven years later marion something was probably fat and married now and lunan had never got around to coming back the great box had been sitting on the skyline for eleven years while pressures from within the box had reached out into los angeles itself the thing was too big to notice and angelinos didnt like to think about it it was sunday supplement material but not news not until now thomas lunan and a different girl looked down on the mall from a small balcony just under the roof cheryl was finishing her dessert lunan itched to talk to his microphone but the girl became restive when he did that still the mike was live and he had a good memory thanks for bringing me he said cheryl drinkwater smiled up at him there was chocolate syrup at the corner of her mouth has it changed much it was already finished when we moved in and i dont remember much anyway its changed i like what theyve done with the pillars last time i was here they were justpillars you really should see the daycare center i spent a lot of time there they were most of the way up the northwest pillar shops wound upward in a spiral narrowing as they rose culminating in a series of small balconies with restaurant tables cheryl was certainly giving him his lunch moneys worth the whole of todos santos was spread below him the view was staggering the vast expanse of the mall with its bewildering game board of shops beitways carrying people the balconies tiered below them others across from him glimpsed through a maze of pillars and conveyor tubes you wouldnt dare try hang gliding in here now apartments shops restaurants even factories overlooked the mall and lunan thought it must be wonderful to live with a view like this so many people to watch but he was getting more than scenery again he wished he could dictate there was a lot to remember the guards they were not police they were not obtrusive unless they were deciding whether to let you in but they were not invisible todos santos citizens didnt ignore them any more than lunan would really ignore a waiter they were there and they were convenient cheryl had stopped at the gate to have a guard locate her f ather drinkwater had been just leaving a dentists office he had agreed to meet lunan for drinks when his tour at the waldo transceiver ended at five and a boy younger than cheryl had been asking another guard to track down his missing date and he knew the guards name and the drunk businessman hed gotten off the subway looking apprehensive and weaved his way up to the entryway and his relief at getting into todos santos was so evident that lunan had spoken to cheryl about him sure hes relieved cheryl said angelino police would arrest him wouldnt they it hadnt even occurred to her that todos santos police might arrest a citizen for being drunk in public and they hadnt instead one had helped him to an elevator he had to remember it all because it might be the biggest story hed ever done the murders regrettable incident had triggered a renewed interest in todos santos and the cityinabox was going to get a lot of headlines and prime time but that wasnt lunans kind of story not by itself the new culture that had developed unnoticed here the impact of todos santos on its inhabitants that could be pulitzer prize material a city at peace with its police force our guards our police holding our civilization together and it was a civilization that showed in the very structures the seeming frailty of shops not built to resist weather or vandalism it showed in the people too the stout lady in her underwear they had stopped in a clothing shop halfway up the northwest pillar while cheryl was buying tennis shoes a fortyish matronly woman had realized that the dress she was trying on was too small she had stepped out to the counter in her bra and support pantyhose to trade the dress for another nodded cheerfully to the other customers and went back in just before she disappeared her eye had caught lunans clothes werent needed for protection here unless on the roof a constant awareness of the guards eyes might make concealment seem futile if the nudity taboo disappeared in todos santos would it be surprising but that look shed known he was an angelino and then she was embarrassed meanwhile cheryl had said daycare center sure lets go see it where is it on the roof cheryl pointed lunan didntunderstand a first she meant the vast artificial tree enveloping the southwest pillar a fence ran beneath the tips of the lowest branches of that great tree there were many children and few adults within the fence when cheryl and lunan were close enough the illusion of a tree broke down the cone of greenery was hollow lunan could look up into what the branches had concealed not just schoolrooms but jungle gyms seesaws a merrygoround and a vast threedimensional steel grid for climbing with netting beneath a score of children were playing what had to be a team sport within the grid you liked it lunan said for just that moment he wanted to be a child again this was wealth cheryl nodded happily do all the todos santos kids come here lunan asked sure well we have neighborhood parks too cheryl said but they arent used much some of them are being closed down mr rand talked about it in class last month the original idea was to have small neighborhood parks because thats what the people were used to when they lived outside but when everybody realized that it was safe for the children to go anywhere the designers decided to build the tree because it could be better than a lot of small places but you still have small parks sure cheryl said for adults and babies mostly though and we use them for ball games if its raining on the roof another thing to think about would todos santos be different if the outside weather were worse or would they simply put a dome over the roof there are four pillars lunan said the shops and this treewhat are the others come see she led him to the mall pedway they edged inward toward the fast strip cheryl always ahead of him lunan pushing himself and feeling clumsy they stood upright hurtling through the mall at fifty kilometers an hour while cheryl tried to explain the rules of the game shed played as a girl on that threedimensional grid in the nursery tree everybody around him seemed perfectly at ease another datum they must really trust the todos santos engineers lunan thought he was filing other impressions in his head quiet the machinery was nearly silent and voices didnt batter the ears lunan considered the soundbafihing effect of all those balconies and the two pillars that had been turned into trees and the high ceilings not enough there must be soundproofing in the ceilings have to ask someone but that still didnt explain it lunan made himself listen and knew that the loudest voices he heard were all angelinos even the children and he could hear the difference todos santos children werent loud but they were agile this was their turf and they moved through it like streaks never bumping anyone even here where there were a lot of angelino visitors clumsy moving objects to avoid they came to a wide arch spanning the pedway above was an arcade with shops but for a moment they were passing through a tunnel stationary walks but no shops on either side of the swiftmoving pedway there were boys on the walks one slipped a coil of rope off his shoulder lunan watched in horror as he flung it high in the air it floated down unrolling across the fast pedway ahead of lunan boys on the other side caught it they pulled it taut leaning back with the effort duck lunan roared he dropped to the belt and tried to sweep cheryls legs from under her she danced back laughing fending him off the rope caught her across the chest and disintegrated it was toilet paper lunan got up swell what if it was a real rope cheryl was still laughing it cant be the guards would stop them did you see anyone else duck he hadnt he thought even angelinos learn better it cant be real rope security wouldnt let it be are they crazy or are they right stevens drove the imperial back toward city hall they passed through block after block of low woodframe houses structurally sound but usually in need of paint houses that werent really squalid but were officially classed as substandard and looked it some would call them slums but maclean stevens resisted that watts and the surrounding areas had open space there were a few apartments but mostly there were singleunit houses and duplexes most of them had yards some scattered with occasional blowing paper some meticulously clean a few of the yards were filthy littered with discarded furniture and decaying mattresses but those were exceptions not a slum stevens thought los angeles doesnt really have slums not like harlem or what i needed to see you about was the price memorial project clay said they say we need more tests first the epa now hud mr stevens my people need housing this is a good project an excellent project it can turn that whole area around if only they will let us build it and we cannot continue testing and studying we will soon lose our contractors they say rightly that they cannot keep their equipment idle longer we saw the report stevens said the mayor made a strong protest i know it was strong because i wrote it i could show you the file if you like i believe you clay said but protests dont hire people or build housing we need that housing now and the jobs jobs you know what that means do you know what the unemployment rate is down here what are the young people supposed to do they have no jobs there is no one to work for the result is that they run in gangs like that young man today you saw the gang tattoos then stevens asked clay nodded slowly yes mr stevens they turned onto a main northsouth thoroughfare it was lined with bars and liquor stores all looking like fortresses with iron grill window guards and steel cagework to cover the doors at the corner stood a supermarket one of a major chain stevens noticed the prices at least percent higher than in his neighborhood they have to he told himself it costs more to do business insurance alone and security against shoplifting andand the higher prices help keep people chained down to this miserable block yes i saw the gang symbols clay repeated could they have a bearing on his actions this morning i dont know clay admitted its possible or he may have been high on something without jobs without hope they join gangs they use drugs they also steal at the moment they steal from their neighbors someday the neighbors will have nothing worth stealing then they will come out and steal from your neighbors and perhaps you will pay some attention that wont happen stevens thought as long as welfare and food stamps and aid to dependent children and social security and all the other benefit programs pump in money therell be something to steal and we already paid too much attention to watts anyway every department of every government at every level is involved and all those expensive people think they have to contribute to justify their salaries and every contribution is another delay reverend i know how you feel but what can i do the federal government is putting up percent of the cost and their inspectors have to be satisfied that its safe after all there was a chemical plant on that site thirty years ago yes but they might have buried some toxic wastes stevens said the del rio company states that they did not stevens shrugged hud wont take their word for it they insist on taking their own soil samples and making their own tests and for that matter when did ebenezer clay start taking a corporations word for anything the developer will quit while they are testing well find another one stevens said it took more than a year for jacobsen and myers to qualify clay said a new firm must start completely anew he sniffed and wrinkled his nose or perhaps not perhaps that is the plan to delay and delay until we can delay no longer then obtain an emergency ruling relaxing the affirmative actiom program and then a nice lilywhite company will come that wont happen stevens said wearily it has happened in the past mac stevens had nothing to say to that of course clay was right all we want is justice clay said justice stevens thought a line from the hymnal ran through his head thy justice like mountains high soaring above thy clouds which are fountains of goodness and love but what soared above off to the left was neither justice nor mountains it was the blank wall of todos santos does anybody really want justice stevens asked if justice is getting what you deserve a fair chance that is all we want why cant we have it because nobody gives a damn anymore stevens thought nobody but you and your friends and you dont have many of those left the glorious old days of the civil rights movement are gone long gone and not many lament them we did care once a lot of us did but something happened maybe it was the sheer size of the problem or watching while everybody who could afford it ran to the suburbs and left the cities to drift and complained about taxes going to the cities and or maybe it was having to listen to my police explain why theyll only go into watts in pairs with cocked shotguns and if the mayor doesnt like it he can damned well police that precinct himself people think theyve done enough whats enough it isnt enough if wed done enough we wouldnt have the problems ill do my best to speed things up stevens said well call washington do you think that will help it cant hurt and probably cant help although you never knew the problem was that washington didnt have to listen they might but they dont have to he remembered the chanting crowd outside the alleyway they demanded justice and the reverend clay wants justice mr planchet wants justice the mayor wants them all kept happy meaning im supposed to deliver what they want justice hell i dont even know what it is not that it matters well get clay his development but it wont bring justice to the ghetto itll just be another project and whatever justice is jim planchet doesnt want it what big jim wants is vengeance the northeast pillar had become another tree but this was no christmas tree there was a glasswalled ballroom nestled in its topmost branches in its sprawling knotted roots was the redlit entrance to lucifers the gambling hail halfway up the thick trunk were three levels of dream masters the gallery of fantasy art lunan stared searching for old memories and theres a serpent gnawing at the roots right he asked and an old oneeyed god comes to impale himself in order to learn the runes weve got a hologram serpent i dont think anybodys had the nerve to play odin yet thomas would you like to get a sculpted bust of yourself or a tattoo ali why cheryl laughed ill show you she led him to an outside elevator shaped like a rocket ship out of a s amazing baroque fins guiding a pointed glass tube glow of orange lights in rockets clustered underneath you should see this anyway fantasy art had come a long way since the art shows at early science fiction conventions dream masters still displayed paintings creatures foreign to earth and artists concepts of interstellar spacecraft and structures that would have dwarfed the earth itself but there were also windowsized holograms that looked out on alien worlds a gun with a double stock for use by something with two right arms tiny landscapes for use as game boards in roleplaying games and dragons and trolls and elves for markers ornately carved rings cups belt buckles there were two small shops within dream masters itself in the solidphotography shop lunan sat with parallel bands of light and dark demarking his head and shoulders while a score of photographs were taken from preset angles its absolutely accu rate the clerk told him the markings guide the computer that guides the tools that carve the bust we do have to add the eyes they come out blank and we can fiddle with the texture of the hair and make the bust bigger or smaller lunans bust would be the size of a fist carved in synthetic malachite the walls of the tattoo parlor were covered with designs line cartoons very simple and very expressive slogans in ornate gothic script photographs of astronomical scenery suns and glowing interstellar gas clouds tattooed on human backs a white comet running down a suntanned arm the tattooist was in her twenties with wild black hair and somewhat protuberant eyes she caught lunan staring at a pair of photographs and said they were both from the red plush onion one was a color photo of a womans assnot bad lunan thoughtwith a cluster of vertical lines tattooed on one cheek product identification markings the other a puffy red giant star losing a stream of flame into the bluewhite accretion disk around a black hole tattooed across a black womans chest the tattooist had a vivid smile and her eyes danced damn they were almost hypnotic almost too big for her face lunan said i didnt know the onion ran to astronomy buffs youd be surprised her voice was louder than los angeles traffic noisesabsent hereand beneath the vivaciousness was a selfconsciousness that the saints eventually lost angelino lunan said you havent been here long she admitted it she had moved in last april right after making out her income tax form where were you before what were you doing i lived in westwood and i did a little of everything including a movie they had me playing a zombie and she widened her eyes and grinned a deathrictus at him so that lunan recoiled even while he was laughing are you glad you moved oh i love it here i was a little worried you know about making new friends but it wasnt bad at all theres the commons you cant help meeting people and then saints seem to trust each other as if just being here means youre okay and i get plenty of customers angelinos and the onion no mostly saints i think its like ego plates you know personalized car license plates nobody wants to be exactly like everybody else youll see a lot of my designs floating around that is you would if you could make friends fast enough i put some of them in fairly private places ive got one myself cheryl said demurely there was a buzzing in lunans ear my masters voice he said with genuine regret ive got to call in as cheryl led him to a guard station thomas lunan wondered what could be so important that the city editor would beep him ix white shall not neutralize the black nor good compensate bad in man absolve him so lifes business being just the terrible choice robert browning the furies tony rand wasnt happy for one thing it was lunch time but instead of eating he was standing in art bonners office i found out how they did it he said weve got maintenance people in those tunnels all the time security used to watch them but that got too expensive so we set up a system to have millie track everyone in there and call security only if something unusual happened he shrugged so the kids fed millie the right signals how about getting in to begin with art bonner asked same thing as far as the computer was concerned one of our own work crews went in for unscheduled maintenance happens often enough art it bugs me that someone can do that to millie bugs you does it tony how would you feel if you knew someone could fiddle with your memory tony turned startled oh i hadnt thought of that aspect i rather hope nobody else does dont mention it to miss churchward okay well have to work out some safeguards for millies memory id say a man could make himself very wealthy by tampering with what millie tells barbara and thats not the worst that could happen rand looked thoughtful ill need a couple of specialists in programming highpriced ones youll have them now in future i want everyone going into a critical area to check in with security at least be looked at bonner said it wont be as convenient but we have to do something meanwhile life goes on maybe tony said you still worried about the carbon filament deliveries some that condominium outfits holding us up for more than mead likes to pay like it or not weve got to keep expanding heli pay it bonner said there was a low tone from his phone bonner lifted the instrument excuse me tony yes dee he listened a moment put him on she says its john shapiro with something urgent bonner listened again he what i dont believe it who what rand asked bonner ignored tonys question that tears it he told the telephone i guess wed better have another strategy meeting ten minutes in the board room there were more people in the conference room this time john shapiro had brought a legal assistant a big competentlooking woman dressed as conservatively as shapiro was colonel cross dark suit narrow clubstriped tie was flanked on either side by uniformed majors jim bowen rands administrative assistant there were others tony rand knew only vaguely people from meads section an athletic young man whose main job seemed to be fetching coffee for barbara churchward they listened some patiently some not so while major devins talked who was going to stop him devins asked not any of our people hes our boss dammit he went down to the subway lobby and caught a train nobody had orders to keep him inside not your fault art bonner said i should have told millie to let me know where pres was at all times how could you know hed do something like this shapiro asked hardly anyones fault he must be off his rocker frank mead said why the hell would he turn himself in messes up all our plans too that it does art bonner said johnny whats next shapiro looked more at ease he had his vested suit and his briefcase he spread his hands elaborately as i said last night preliminary hearing whenever you want it i can delay or start next week as youd like can you get sanders out on bail barbara churchward asked i doubt it not in a capital case shapiro said that shook all of them capital case death penalty mend asked its possible i doubt they can win an appeal though shapiro said but murder one is what big jim planchet insists on and hes got the clout to make it stick with the das office besides it looks better for the politicians if sanders is in jail lets them look much tougher than if he were walking around free waiting for trial of course we ask for bail and if its turned down we appeal but that all takes time and meanwhile one of our people is in their bucket mend said i am not sure i understand your position churchward said you dont like sanders whats that got to do with anything hes ours mend protested we can talk over this damn fool stunt when hes out meantime the angelinos have one of our people and i dont like it i see art why did he turn himself in churchward asked guilt he wants absolution bonner said and you know its our fault in all we said while he was here last night we didnt really make it clear that were behind him we talked a lot about strategy and what we ought to be doing but we didnt just flat out say you done good pres you did tony rand said when you first came into his office i didnt make it strong enough bonner said and we should all have said it here in this conference room with every one of us backing him up and a parade of people to say the same thing this morning my fault he might have thought he was helping us tony rand said hows that bonner demanded the morning news was full of threats by planchet tony said how hed wreck todos santos it could be that pres thinks hes saving us a lot of grief it wont help frank mead insisted makes us look like idiots what do we do now churchward asked we didnt talk to pres about strategy and we werent supportive enough well fix all that but what do we do this afternoon prepare for siege art bonner said tony you and cross will have to speed up the new security system installations meanwhile well try angelino justice i dont have any faith in it but well give it a try alice strahier waited nervously in the comptrollers office why was he late for his appointment with her his secretary had said something about an emergency meeting in the board room some new development from the fromate raid could they have found out alice wondered maybe i ought to run she took a deep breath and laughed nervously then glanced up to see if the receptionist had noticed she neednt have worried the receptionist was talking in low tones on the telephone the guilty flee when no man pursueth alice thought the best way to be certain they know is to act scared they dont know they dont even suspect tony rand trusts me with everything he sure does alice marie another part of her mind said aint you proud and that was just the trouble she wasnt proud tony rand had trusted her promoted her to an important position and she had betrayed him i had to the movement put me here and its important were rushing toward the ecospasm we have to act before its too late but its already too late for those kids theyre dead and they wouldnt have tried it without your informa tion alice marie and now the movement will want more everything about the new security systems the guards everythingand you know why theyll want it damn people are complicated its so much easier to work with computers i should have stayed a programmer never taken that promotion then i wouldnt have frank mead came in charging ahead as if he were hitting the line for princeton again he glanced at alice oh sorry to keep you waiting should have phoned come on in she followed him into his big corner office it was elaborately furnishedmore so than art bonners she thought and that has to mean something she took a seat and waited for the inevitable inquisition frank mead trying to learn more about tony rands department i have a right to know mead had told her the first time hed summoned her and asking tony is a waste of time so youre not betraying him youre doing him a favor which might even have been true tony rand would hate having to explain himself to the comptroller but since he went over or outside ofhis budget quite often somebody had to come down here and defend what rands department did so she wasnt really being disloyal in talking to meadwhich was a joke because what mead learned was legitimate company business and what i tell wolfe is legitimate human business she told herself the survival of the human race is far more important than petty bourgeois morals which doesnt explain why i feel so cheap sometimes so heres the check all approved mead was saying he held out a slip of paper hope your friends in diamond bar appreciate it easiest profit they ever turned they dont really have anything at all coming to them she took the check and waited for the questions but mead seemed preoccupied and after a while she left his office homicide lieutenant donovan drank quietly and alone that is not to say that he was not enjoying himself there could have been drinking buddies if hed wanted them he could have gone to a cop bar he wasnt in the mood this afternoon instead he was in a mood to get quietly buzzed watching the thoughts that played through his head enjoying some of the life that surged around him this very skillful pickup that clumsy approach that worked anyway the endless political discussion between the two who didnt know what they were talking about he also had memories to savor the todos santos tunnel crew knew nothing about the mugging victim but theyd enjoyed telling him about their job and showing off the enormous machine that chewed into dirt and rock fused the detritus to line the tunnel walls and crawled inexorably onward it had been something to see and there wasnt another machine like that in the western hemisphere and then came the news that their high muckymuck sanders had turned himself in the work crew hadnt been happy about that at all interesting workmen who worried about their boss but the argument at a nearby table threatened to ruin his mood three of them men younger than donovan getting excited the youngest sat quietly happily letting the others lecture each other he wasnt going to stop the developing fight dont tell me about those todos santos bastards that one had small features and very pale blond hair he leaned forward forearms braced on the table to emphasize his words they got a right to live said the third man he was small and lean with a face like a hatchet and a tension in him that showed even when he relaxed yeah listen do you know the red plush onion right in the shadow of that big fucking building ive heard about it never been there its a whorehouse i thought id try it you know how it is i got lonely one night the blond man relaxed looked into his beer drank donovan watched in the mirror donovans pleasantly melancholy mood had faded somewhat it was a pity he couldnt take off his reflexes with his badge then he could let them work themselves up punch each other out get thrown into the street incident finished none of his business anyway but hed been a street cop a long time before making detective he reached into his pocket so i drove out there and tried to get in you know they wouldnt let me in i wasnt drunk not drunk the big bouncer said they didnt want my kind the blond mans lips crawled away from his teeth i was going back to thy car when a guy went past me a tall thin guy with lots of teeth i knew him the bouncer let him in said hello called him by his name know who he was the todos santos undertaker well you can see their point said the other they get most of their customers from todos santos yeah yeah and the hivers wont go in if the angelinos do thats what they call us angelinos i hope they put that sanders bastard in the gas chamber if the little guy could have let it lie nope why because he killed two kids or because hes from todos santos yes said the blond man then what are you defending him for he gassed em gassed em nerve gas what the fuck they were only angelinos maybe they wont dare try it again the smaller man taunted him why dont you try sneaking inside some night with a box labeled dynamite donovan was there as the blond man tried to surge across the table think of it as evolution in action he said because it seemed to fit and had been on his mind they froze and looked at him all three it was a good stopper that phrase just cryptic enough he held his badge low cupped so that only those three could see it forget it he told them their eyes dropped donovan went back to his own table his eyes found theirs in the mirror they left very soon the interview room in the new los angeles county jail had not intentionally been designed to be intimidating the furniture was heavy and nearly immobile of course and the windows were barred but the designers had tried to make the room comfortable they hadnt succeeded big jim planchet tried to keep his voice under control as he eyed allan thompson with distaste why hadnt he paid more attention to the kind of companions his son had and yetwhat could he have done this boy wasnt any criminal good family real estate people good upper middleclass family just like diana lauder the lauders were blaming him he didnt want to think about it but he had to and he didnt have a lot of time he wasnt supposed to be here of course it had taken pulling strings but jim planchet was a lawyer and if ben costello insisted on having planchet as an associate the das office wasnt going to object why planchet demanded what did you think you were doing easy ben costello cautioned mr planchets right though allan if im going to defend you ive got to know everything for a moment the boys face held defiance he even started to say it it seemed like a good but his reserve broke my god mr planchet im sorry really sorry lot of good that does why planchet said again easy damniit costello said cant you see allan doesnt like this any more than you do why allan wellmr planchet had said a lot about todos santos jimmy really respected you mr planchet he thoughthe thought he was helping you it hit planchet like a blow and it was probably true i did he thought i did spout off a lot about todos santos termite hill the box graveyard of freedom picture of an ugly future he remembered it all public statements and what hed said at home at the breakfast table and junior making wisecracks but listening listening all right i can see that he said when hed got his voice under control butyou went past those doors thered been a special on channel showing that door and its ominous warnings it was said plainly if you go through this door you will be killed it said it we didnt believe it allan said we just didnt i mean everyones always telling you what horrible things are going to happen to you but they never do only this time they did planchet thought oh my god he sat down and put his head in his hands unwanted pictures came to his mind jim junior with his chemistry lab jim getting his ham radio license at age thirteen and getting a home computer for his next birthday eunice bragging to thejr friends about her son the genius and i guess he was ben costello took out a yellow legal pad and a dozen pencils id better get as many details as i can he said this isnt going to be easy allan thompson looked puzzled so what whats the worst they can do for trespassing the charge isnt trespassing costello said he tried to keep his voice as calm and gentle as possible it was obvious that the boy was torn up with guilt he talked defiantly but he was ready to collapseand what costello had to tell him wasnt going to help either the charge is murder murder but i didnt kill anybody those termites they did the killing with war gas you were committing a felony when theres a death resulting during the commission of a felony the law says its murder costello said same as if you were holding up a liquor store and the police shot your partner jesus allans eyes darted around the interview room maybe its right maybe i did kill them but i didnt mean to i didnt mean any harm may as well hit him with all of it costello thought hed better know how serious this is i cant plea bargain either not with todos santos involved costello said look they turned you over to the los angeles da but theyll go to the state attorney general if they have to they want your arse allan and if you dont help me theyre going to get it now you went to todos santos carrying the gear that james had built you waited until there was no one around and you went to the accessway door was it unlocked no jim unlocked it with what allan shrugged it was an electronic lock system jimmy had the combination costello wrote rapidly so you unlocked the door how did you know the combination i dont know jimmy had it he had quite a lot of information about the todos santos se curity system costello said where did james get all these data arnie i guess who is arnie arnold renn hes one of the sociology professors at ucla real friendly guy did mr renn suggest this expedition costello asked allan looked puzzled dr renn he said automatically uh well he didnt exactly suggest it but you had discussed it with him yes councilman planchet raised his head and looked at the boy arnold renn hed seen that name somewherewhere on a report his assistant had prepared dr renn was a spokesman for the ecology group had offered to speak at a fund raiser for planchet it hadnt been easy to find a way to turn him down why had he been turned down something ginny had dug up some kind of connection dr renn had that might be embarrassing good god renn was a fromate they wouldnt let tony rand see sanders in an interview room that was for lawyers only friends had to use a different and degrading tony thoughtsystem rand and sanders sat at tables facing each other they were separated by a doubled glass screen thick they talked by telephone what do you say in a situation like this rand wondered hi pres hi tony awkward silence now that youve had a week to get used to it how do you like the accommodations not too bad are you going to tell me im crazy too do you want me to what the thick glass tended to distort sanderss expression what if you want me to ill tell you youre crazy rand said look i had to sanders said i cant get shapiro to understand that i had to i killed whoa rand said urgently eh the sheriff swears blind these visiting phonies arent tapped tony rand said you can believe as much of that as you want to so what i dont have any secrets the whole englishspeaking world knows what i did uncomfortable subject how are they treating you all right he smiled almost they dont know how to treat me all that publicity so i got vip status that figures they give you a roommate yeah whats he in for anything interesting tony hes in for tax evasion he wants to sell us construction supplies he does exercises in the cell and he wants me to do pushups and jumping jacks with him hed really like to cheer me up want more you know youre a real wet blanket today pres said nothing whyd you do it pres why didnt you at least talk to someone first the first we heard about you turning yourself in was off a television set it was no good tony hiding out making like i was crazy no good dammit yeah i can see that wouldnt sit well rand said it wasnt right either art was taking a hell of a chance i could see that shapiro was worried tony the last damn thing i need is to have art bonner in jail because of me how is he he was fit to be tied rand saw the effect of that and quickly added he wasnt mad at you at himself why he thought he hadnt made it clear enough that you did the right thing the only thing you could do sure hed say that not just him pres youre a bloody hero its all they talked about in commons for days ever since it happened savior of the city and all that they really say that thats right oh and ive got a message from art he says all right its your life and if you want to try los angeles justice thats what youll get johnny shapiro will be down soon to talk strategy i gather hes going to ask for a change of venue what with all the publicity what i said no sanders was adamant no change of venue no legal tricks tell him that tony i dont want to get off on a technicality id rather leave it to a jury a los angeles jury the kids were angelinos you arent angelinos tony i saw them when they were being carried out they were dead people dead human beings tony sighed raggedly so did i on the screen pres could i have designed it differently what they got in they put themselves where we had to kill them or else let them bum up some of our city and some of our citizens they had to go to enormous trouble to do that but pres they shouldnt have been able to do it at all how could i have stopped them how do i stop the next ones the ones with the real bombs tony this is silly the hell it is pres do you think youre the only one with nightmares you did the right thing you did the only thing its not your fault you didnt have any choices you should never have been in that situation but what could i do it looks like a computer problem tony rand brooded they knew too much about millie and millie may be too vulnerable anyway too many people with access they have to have access okay maybe i cant deal with that but suppose theres something else one more door or another set of locks or a trapdoor somewhere tony youre doing it again preston sanders looked as if he were trying to reach through the glass youre putting people in boxes they dont fit you cant stop everyone its like trying not to offend anyone remember what tv was like in the seventies even your highdiving board doesnt work on everyone does it a clever determined suicide brings wire cutters and goes through the fence yeah i used to wonder if that was a murder why would a suicide go to that much trouble tony brooded for a moment skip it is there anything i can bring you yeah my roommate brings westerns and is eager to loan them to me so pick me a good thick science fiction novel with lots of obscure technical terms it was perfectly clear to tony that pres had said that to cheer up tony rand thatll fix him tony said rand left the jail with a feeling of relief but he continued to brood what could he have done differently and what should he do now thered be a next time he was sure of it and next time there would be real bombs x justice i think is the tolerable accommodation of the conflicting interests of society and i dont believe there is any royal road to attain such accommodations concretely learned hand judgment tony rand fidgeted uncomfortably on the courtroom chair from time to time he tried to catch preston sanderss eye but pres was sitting rigidly upright his eyes fastened on the witness and never looked back he didnt look too bad considering that hed been jailed for nearly three weeks the courtroom looked like a tv set it was the special courtroom with a big plexiglas panel between the spectators and the area where the action went on rand had been told that judge penny nortons bench had armor plate built into it as well marshals searched everyone who entered the room when they were satisfied they let the judge and defendant in judge norton looked very stern in her black robes it was a big case for her the biggest shed ever been involved in in the strategy meetings back at todos santos john shapiro had described her as upandcoming a judge whod likely end up on the callfornia supreme court once she had more experience hed known her in law school he also thought shed pay more attention to the political situation than to the law but he had no way to challenge her and hed said at least shes smart enough to un derstand the arguments i dont think wed get a better one and it would take a long time to try that had been the deciding factor for art bonner he wanted the trial over and done with as soon as possible no delays thered been argument over that with shapiro protesting that he had to work in sanderss best interest not the corporations and the best thing for sanders would be to delay that was when bonner had taken shapiro into his office and tony didnt know what art had said to the lawyer but certainly the legal proceedings had been surprisingly swift after that tony was no lawyer actually he disliked the breed for tony rand the world was a relatively simple place and there was no need for people whose profession was to get rich by making it complex however he had to admire john shapiro who had carefully and patiently built his case not merely in common sense but in the strange convolutions required by the law he had wrung tony rand dry of information and at the same time kept a lot of the todos santos security system secret now he was crossexamining allan thompson allan shapiro said you told the district attorney that you carried no weapons and nothing harmful yes sir what did you carry well some electronics gear anything else shapiros manner was entirely friendly matteroffact he seemed almost uninterested in the answers gas masks gee thats a strange kind of thing to carry isnt it why gas masks objection district attorney sid blackman was a tall thin man with black hair cut to a fashionable length and good but not expensive clothes which made him a liar in tony rands opinion because blackman was one of the heirs to a department store fortune although he tried to give the impression of a man of the people your honor this witness was not present when the gas masks were worn lets phrase it differently john shapiro said did james planchet or diana lauder tell you why they brought gas masks to todos santos yes sir they were worried about knockout gas wed heard that todos santos used gas to defend the tunnels lethal gas no sir we didnt know they used poison gas we thought they just used something to knock people out hmm i see shapiros manner didnt change who did you hear that from allan i dont know but you had all kinds of information about todos santos security systems you were able to open locked doors and defeat the alarm system werent you yes and surely you learned that from someone weve heard mr rand and colonel cross testify that such information is very carefully guarded it wasnt published anywhere where did you learn how to gain entry to todos santos i guess somebody told jimmy allan said he squirmed uncomfortably in the witness chair but i dont know who youre sure you dont know who told jimmy planchet yes sir im sure john shapiro looked away from the sweating boy for a moment tony thought the lawyer was disappointed but it wasnt easy to tell shapiro came back his voice again friendly all right now you were carrying other things too werent you what were they some boxes of sand sand did those boxes of sand have anything painted on them yes sir syhat well uhuh shapiro let him stammer he waited expectantly and finally allan said they said dynamite dynamite the word dynamite was painted on the boxes of sand is that correct on two of them the other one said bomb allan said there was a titter of laughter in the courtroom judge norton looked stern and lifted her gavel but she didnt have to say anything so if you hadnt known those were boxes of sand would you have thought they were dangerous explosives yes capable of setting fires objection blackman said calls for a conclusion from the witness did you want people to think those were dangerous explosives no not really we were going to leave them and when the guards found them theyd know we could have left real explosives i see shapiro said and why did you choose tunnel nine because thats where the hydrogen lines come in and whats special about hydrogen lines shapiro seemed a little more eager a little more interested than hed been before well they need it to run that anthill anything else well gee if it had caught on fire it would have been pretty spectacular thompson said district attorney blackman cursed under his breath tony rand saw it and wondered why if it had caught fire in other words the managers at todos santos would have legitimate cause to worry about fires if there were an explosion in tunnel objection excuse me shapiro said allan did you think the managers would have legitimate cause to worry about fires from an explosion in tunnel yes sir did jimmy or diana objection did either of them tell you they thought the managers of todos santos would be worried about fires from an explosion in tunnel sure jimmy said theyd be scared shitless shapiro smiled in triumph and of course you knew that todos santos is inhabited that there were people living there when you entered that tunnel well sure thank you shapiro turned away looking satisfied thomas lunan thought it a rather strange bar for one thing the bartender was lonely he never saw most of his customers orders came up on a television screen the drinks were mixed and then put through a passthrough and from there they went to various places in todos santos the bar itself was wood with a formica top there were barstools and a television set and a few tables but almost no customers two todos santos menlunan wasnt sure how he knew they were saints but he didsat on barstools drinking beer and talking about the unfairness of their wives otherwise the place was empty lunan had taken a seat as near the customers as he could hed told phil lowry to meet him here and he had to wait although hed have preferred a place with more people to watch after a few moments hed struck up a conversation with the bartender which was how he knew the man was lonely hed never met such a friendly bartender or one who knew so little about what was going on it was typical of todos santos people though none of them cared much about what went on outside their fortress except for the sanders hearings they knew all about those the bartenders name was mark levoy and he liked to talk liman knew that as soon as he admired the old fashioned yeah levoy said my drinks now theyre popular i get more business than the blackbird more than dreamland but its all remote drinks are popular but my place isnt dont know why too bad you own this place then well me and the todos santos bank ms churchward loaned you the money lunan guessed miss churchward yeah thanks to her i got my own business but it sure gets lonesome in here dont like being alone didnt like it in my underground days levoy paused hesitantly underground lunan prompted levoys smile was broad yeah i was in the weather underground way back when had to hide out from the law the two todos santos custoi iers picked up their drinks and moved to a table levoy watched them with a frown they didnt seem unfriendly they just left regulars lunan asked he nodded toward the two yeah howd you know anyway i didnt like being alone then either after a while the statute of limitations ran out but it started going sour a long time before that how so chicago the democratic national convention its not smart to put shit in baggies and throw it at armed men its not even smart to be standing next to that kind of yoyo and three of my buddies were trying to make a bomb to blow up the statue of liberty and one day they blew themselves all over the basement walls lunan considered responses and chose tough luck the bartender snorted luck my poker buddies would call that a run of bad playing im sorry they got killed of course not so sorry we didnt blow up the lady but you know what really got me out of the movement youll never guess im sure i cant lunan said the two regulars glanced his way then grinned at each other levoy had to go mix more drinks he made a shaker of martinis and put it onto the conveyor then spent more time on a tall complicated rum drink he came back with another old fashioned for lunan i wish that damned canadian would go away he said ive made enough pimms cups to last me the rest of my life say ive never tasted levoy rode him down you know we used to tell each other about how stupid politicians are you know so dumb that they passed a law making pi equal to three exactly i heard about that lunan said pretty stupid all right well it didnt happen levoy said beffigerently and waited for lunan to call him a liar when lunan didnt he said i looked it up i was going to use it in a pamphlet didnt happen what did happen was that some joker in indiana offered the royalties on his math text to the state of indiana if theyd pass a law with a lot of complicated mathematical language in it turns out the law would have made pi equal to nine but the nine nine but the legislature didnt know that because they couldnt read it so they referred it to the committee on swamps did you say swamps lunan was laughing swamps somebody must have been having fun the committee on swamps recommended that they pass it so they did the other house figured out what was happening and sent it to the committee on temperance it died there and thats all thats all levoy said he sniffed and here id believed all that you know well hell so did i and its a much better story the other way the two regulars were grinning at him lunan surmised that the bartender had told this tale before often got a question he said maybe you know those pillars in the mall downstairs three аf them bring in money shops restaurants the gambling hall daycare center and so forth but the waterfall yeah someday bonnerll sell that waterfall and itll be something else hes just never gotten an offer that had enough money in it and would be as pretty as the waterfall that counts it counts for a lot shouldnt it we could pile a lot more moneymakers around the yggdrasil pillar but itd look cluttered is that why you moved into todos santos the bartender grinned it was eleven years ago and coming up on april fifteenth the word was out that nobodyd be making out their own taxes in todos santos the taxesd be part of our rent it came to me that i didnt like being an accountant for the government on no pay nobody does lunan muttered thats a hell of a deal you people have sure levoy said but look at it this way after the fire there was this flicking great hole in los angeles you could see it from orbit and everybody wanted to forget it as fast as possible only the citys finances were in horrible shape and people needed housingsome of the same people who were shooting at the firemen but how could you pick them out anyway nobody could afford to fill that hole wilh buildings i looked like they were going to have to put in temporary housing you know the kind that lasts longer than any skyscraper instant slums the bartender shrugged so in exchange for leaving us alone they got this place put up over that big scarred gap and its not like we dont pay a lot of taxes theres my assistant lunan said hell want teachers and soda nice to have met you thankfully lunan took a table lowry was a regular reporter and he didnt much like being assigned to help lunan get a big story he wasnt much younger than lunan and he wanted off assignments but so far he hadnt had any big breaks and lunan didnt think he ever would too much of a plodder howd the trial go lunan asked dull only good part was when the thompson kid told about the boxes of sand with dynamite and bomb painted on them kids a liar though liar ive seen the boxes not about that lowry said he sipped his scotch and soda naw earlier he said he didnt know whod given the dead kids the info about ts said it right in court and hes lying he does know sure phil lowry looked smug this is straight lunan had a feeling in the pit of his stomach this could be it the lever he needed to get some exclusives with the todos santos top brass absolutely all right i bite lunan said how do you know ive got sources phil lowry said as many and as good as you you lucky bastard sure you do phil lunan said now how can i con him out of the information i cant he knows im interested look this place isnt your beat are you still interested in that long beach harbor scandal sure trade you lunan said ill give you a line on the whole scam exclusive two commissioners on the take itll take a lot of leg work but you can get it all for what for everything you know source and all about the thompson kid and the raid on todos santos lowry thought it over yeah thats fair he said you can do more with the todos santos story than me he spoke grudgingly that was a good article you did on the two cultures better than you think lunan thought better than you think the tribs publisher also owned a tv station and hed liked lunans articles so much hed assigned a camera crew and a director to work with lunan on a tv documentary and that was going to make lunans career so whos your source you cant use her tom lowry said its councilman planchets aide ginny bernard lonely chick not a very good lay either and so damned hung up that it took me six weeks to get in her pants and another month to get any information out of her but thats my source now what about the long beach scam in a minute okay itll take awhile to use your source but you can at least tell me what she told you who put the kids up to the raid professor arnold renn of ucla hes fromate and ginny thinks hes got ties to the american ecology army too now what about our bargain youll get it lunan took out a notebook and began writing names for lowry but his mind was somewhere else fromates and councilman planchet knew it that ought to be worth a lot to art bonner maybe enough to get some exclusive interviews lunan turned a page and jotted a note rapidly in neat square printed letters dear mr bonner ive found out something that i think you would be very interested in knowing i would appreciate an appointment at your earliest convenience that ought to get him lunan thought now how do i send it tony rand brought his drink into the board room art bonner and barbara churchward were aheady there with john shapiro how are we doing bonner asked shapiro shrugged if this was a quiet little li aring out in some hick town with no political implications wed have it won he said as it is im pretty sure we can win on appeal but you wont get a justifiable homicide judgment in this trial barbara churchward asked shapiro shook his head i doubt it judge norton only has to rule that the state has enough of a case to go to trial she can say that most of it hinges on facts and thats for a jury to decide we can appeal that will pres be out on bail during the appeal bonner asked unlikely the da will fight it of course when they deny bail we can appeal id be doing that now only you said get it over i did indeed bonner said tony please sit down i dont like people hovering over me thanks look johnny whats so complicated about it it just is shapiro said look weve got some tricky points of law here and penny norton doesnt want to rule for us itd cost her like crazy she says she wants on the state supreme court but im betting shed like to run for state attorney general in a couple years he shrugged again but i got the grounds for appeal into the transcript today what that the kids actually committed suicide barbara churchward asked shapiro looked thoughtful not a bad argument he frowned but its no good here why not tony asked that door was marked plainly enough it practically said that youd commit suicide if you went through it good argument for a jury shapiro said but it wont affect penny a damn bit no ive got another plan tell us churchward said well our defense is that there wasnt any crime in my final argument ill show that sanders had good reason to suppose a felony arson was about to be committed thats why all that about fires this afternoon rand said shapiro grinned yep blackman hated that he could see where i was headed see one of the key cases in homicide defense came up when an irs agent shot a man resisting arrest the courts held that it was justified but pres is not a policeman tony said right and blackman will try to make a lot out of that but it doesnt matter shapiro said because in us against rice the judge went on to say that the law requires private citizens to prevent felonies from being committed in their presence requires it he chuckled and then the judge said that when any person is performing a public duty required of him by the law hes under the laws protection and theres another case that says youre not justified in using deadly force to prevent just any felony but you can to prevent atrocious crimessuch as firstdegree arson thats setting fire to an inhabited building and weve shown that sanders had every reason to believe they were trying to commit an atrocious crime well i should think so churchward said so why arent we going to win bonner asked well there are other cases shapiro said mainly ones that say that a peace officer takes his chances when he kills a suspect its okay if the suspect was committing a felony or resists arrest by the way im going to try to show that those gas masks were a way of resisting arrestanyway its all right if the suspect is running away from an atrocious felony but not if its a misdemeanor and blackman will show that the kids werent committing a felony only misdemeanor trespass but it looked like arson churchward said they were trying their best to make it look that way and it hasnt always been just trespassing rand said thereve been real bombs therell probably be more now youre trying to use common sense on the law art bonner said and i dont think that works all right we lose what then appeal or let it go to trial and argue it before a jury we might win with a jury and if we dont we can appeal again meanwhile pres is in jail well until the trials over shapiro said id bet the worst wed get would be manslaughter then we could get pres out on bail but youre talking weeks months maybe bonner said sure thats not justice sanders didnt do a damn thing wrong but he gets locked up anyway bonners lips tightened damn it i dont like this i dont like it at all johnnys doing the best he can dont discourage him the voice was millies but it had the subtle differences indicating the words were barbaras the computer medical experts whod inserted the implant in bonners head had explained how it worked that millie was programmed to transmit nonverbal impulses which implant wearers learned to interpret as tones and emotional subtleties but that didnt make it less miraculous youre right as usual art thought then he said aloud keep trying johnny he put his hand on shapiros shoulder well all keep plugging away at it one thing more this just caine an offer from a newsman guy named lunan to trade information for our cooperation in his documentary i think we ought to discuss it cant hurt churchward said we could use some sympathetic news coverage lets talk to him there was mist over san pedro it couldnt quite be called a fog you could see through it out across the yacht basin and into the los angeles harbor but the sun couldnt penetrate it early morning low clouds and fog the weather reports said a better term would be gloomy before noon alice strahier walked along the los angeles fishing pier to ports o calls gaily painted shops there were restaurants and ice cream bars and artists displays antique shops and confectionary stores all painted to look more like cape cod than pueblo de los angeles there were not many tourists around they would come when the fog burned away she strolled through the shopping area pausing now and again to look back the way she came going through the shops in one door and out another until she was certain that no one was interested in her movements finally she went through a parking lot and under a highway viaduct it was like coming to another world instead of chintz and new paint and new rental cars this was a region of rundown buildings and battered old trucks marine engine repair shops warehouses and cheap cafes the road led along the waterfront to a drab building on a pier it had once been painted but years of saltladen wind had faded it until no one knew what color it had been large saltwater tanks of crabs and pacific lobster stood against the building there was no one else on the pier inside there was a fat man in a stained apron behind the counter at first alice thought he was alone then she saw the solitary customer a thin bearded man watching her from a corner booth where he sat breaking crackers into a bowl of soup the customer winked at her and she went over to his table he grinned widely good to see you again he swept his hand to indicate the seat across the carved and marked booth table coffee and the clam chowders the best in the city okay he got up and went to the counter to order for her she sat in silence biting her lip wanting to get this over with after what seemed like ages he came back with her food and coffee the coffee mug was old and chipped and so was the shallow chowder bowl but the chowder smelled delicious she automatically ate a spoonful then another gets to you doesnt it he asked with a grin then his face became serious we havent a lot of time whats this all about what i told phil she said ron i cant take it any longer i quit he shrugged okay so you quit she looked at him without saying anything but he wouldnt meet her eyes damn it you could say something sure what do you want me to say he asked that the works important and we need you hell you know that already if i could think of anything to say that would keep you with us id say it but you told phil your minds made up im not sure why you wanted to see me maybe you shouldnt have bothered come off it we owed you that much and more so im here he shrugged tell me what to say you might ask why i presume youve lost faith in the movement i dont know alice said iron why cant i work openly its this sneaking aroundthey trust me and im betraying that trust i know its hard but we need the information not from me we killed diana and jimmy and for nothing it wasnt for nothing his eyes narrowed and his voice hardened he spoke so intensely that it came across like shouting although he never raised his voice at all never say it was for nothing because of them were closer much closer to shutting down that termite hill people are asking questions wondering about todos santos and all of the arcologies wondering why they have to defend themselves with war gas and who theyll kill next were showing the world that humanity cant live like that so you can have all the second thoughts you want but dont try to take anything away from diana and jimmy but its my fault theyre dead bull shit he said because you didnt know about nerve gas that was the hives bestkept secret and you didnt find out so now its your fault they wouldnt even have got in without me she said he nodded thats true enough so it was my fault and now youve got the guilts he asked you want to atone turn us all in no id never do that why not he asked were nothing better than murderers but we are why how are we better than some petty crook because the movement is important its right because todos santos is the beginning of a horrible future and it has to be stopped now i believe that he said but you dont i do too then why are you quitting because because its hard he asked his voice was full of contempt youve got it hard you dont have to look over your shoulder all the time youve got a bed to sleep in and plenty to eat youre not mucking around with explosives and you dont have to jump every time you see a cop but you think youve got it hard it isnt that she insisted then what is it oh i dont know you get me all confused im sorry he said it just seems so simple to me weve got to work for humanity because theres nothing else worth doing what else is there their bourgeois god with his thunderings and mumblings and petty jealousies alle menschen mlissen sterben well all die all of us poof gone out like a light well it has to mean something there has to be a reason for living and keeping mankind human is a damned good one i dont knowsometimes watching them in todos santos ron theyre happy they like it his voice dropped low and became more intense happy of course theyre happy aristocrats usually are happy but how many of those places can the earth support and therell be more hives hives everywhereyoure the one who told us about that canadian hives in canada hives in mexico hives all over the united states theyve got to be stopped now before they spread and you know it do i she wondered i guess i do alice if you quit now then you really did something evil if we dont succeed then jimmy and diana were killed for nothing nothing at all and you helped kill them he reached across the table and took her hand i know it is hard being inside there never seeing your friends having to be on guard all the time but hang on it wont be long now get us their new defense setup this time well shut that place down for good xi it is easier for a man to be loyal to his club than to his planet the bylaws are shorter and he is personally acquainted with the other members b b white conspiracies tony rands videobeam television screen covered most of a wall it was big enough to watch reruns of a space odyssey which was true of danined few tv sets he never used it to watch war movies or rock shows they seemed just too intimidating on that huge screen tony was on his bed with the headboard panel pulled out to support his back the huge face looming above him had a lean and hungry look like cassius what i found it said is a feudal society now when i speak of feudalism i dont mean plate armor and crossbows todos santos isnt just modern its at the forefront of technology the carbon fibers in those compote walls were precipitated in an orbital laboratory and couldnt have been made except in free fall the very concept of an arcology is only a few decades old when paolo soleri first began to write about arcologies it seemed like science fiction even though soled was a student of frank lloyd wright tony rand nodded agreement when paolo soleri began construction of arcosanti his new model city in the arizona desert the news writers had been intriguedbut they hadnt taken him seriously even after it was obvious that soled was building his city that it was growing year by year most writers thought soled a pleasant eccentric brilliant but dotty certainly genevieve thought so tonys decision to spend an unpaid summer working with soleri had finished their marriage certainly todos santos is modem lunan continued the romulus corporation which built the box has for years been towing icebergs from antarctica to supply los angeles with water the scene flicked from lunan to the los angeles harbor panning across to the iceberg zooming in for a closeup of skiers then zooming right past and on to catalina island closeup of the isthmus harbor with sandy beaches and palm trees perhaps beyond modern lunan said hundreds of todos santos residents work in los angelestwo work as far away as houston texas and one works machinery on the moon without ever leaving their homes the scene shifted again to a smiling burly blackhaired man rand recognized him but couldnt remember the name lunans voice continued mr armand drinkwater is a master millingmachine operator experimental mechanic drinkwater corrected his voice boomed for the konigsberg medical instrument company the instruments he works on didnt exist five years ago armand im told you generally work stark naked right maybe im overreacting but i used to have to wear white coats and a cap to work in the clean rooms and i got damned sick of it got sick of freeways too and now i smile a lot oh you mean working days my contract says i have to be at work at nine fine i get up at ten of nine that gives me time for coffee harriet generally makes me a bacon and egg sandwich around half past and i eat it while im working when i take a lunch hour i get the whole hour do a little sun bathing out on the balcony i knock off at five and im home at five i can have a drink if i want and it wont be to wind down from fighting traffic the scene faded into a shot of drinkwater at a combination desk and work table a bank of tv screens curved in a horseshoe shape along one edge in the center was a pair of thick gloves suspended from universaljointed trusses something like an oldfashioned dentists drill cables led from the gloves to plugs on the desk in deference to our video audience armand dressed for work this morning lunans voice said over the scene drinkwater wearing a black bathing suit that blended invisibly with his thick pelt put on the gloves his hands made precise motions a complex shape took form on one of the tv screens in front of him i mostly make oneofakind items drinkwater said but this happens to be the prototype for a production run everything i do is recorded and when i get it right the computers will take over and make a hundred just like this by doing what i did i get a royalty he lifted a micrometer and applied it to nothing a similar instrument appeared on the tv screen and another screen lit up with measurements drinkwater nodded in satisfaction what are you making lunan asked pump for a heartlung machine drinkwater said i think this lots for export to africa the gloves moved slightly and the shape on the tv screen rotated pretty tricky work i doubt if i could do it if id had to drive all day just to get to work he grinned i know i wouldnt enjoy it as much the scene moved back to real time lunan interviewing drinkwater i take it you like it here lunan said nope i love it tony rand smiled the scene shifted meet rachael lief lunan said ms lief is a bulldozer driver lunan paused for effect as you see rachael doesnt look like your typical tractor driver she certainly didnt tony remembered meeting her once a short woman not particularly pretty but very delicately built with small features and piercing dark brown eyes and a voice so raucously loud that you expected to hear glass shattering when she spoke but then lunan said not every bulldozer operator works on the moon the cameras followed the trim woman into another room where there was a replica of a large tractor it was surrounded by tv screens one screen showed an astronaut seated in the drivers seat staring impatiently into the screen a bleak nearly colorless pit showed over his left shoulder about time you got here the astronaut said we were busy rachael sat down in the drivers seat and took hold of the controls i relieve you there was a pause busy hellall right i stand relieved thank you the bulldozer moved through the lunar strip mine lunan alternated views inside todos santos watching lief move the controls the scene that she saw in her control screen and a composite from over her shoulder looking into her monitor as you can see lunans disembodied voice said this is no easy job when rachael gives a command it takes over a second for the signal to get to the moon and another second for the information to get back to her it takes a lot of computer power to work this trick but its worth it meet colonel robert boyd commander of moon base colonel boyd does it help to have earthbased machine operators sure it costs a lot to keep people on the moon now its like i have four or five times as many people up here and i dont have to feed them or find air for them high technology applications lunan said you see a lot of them in todos santos the tv scene changed to show other todos santos people electronic assemblers an elaborate chemistry laboratory a man making intricate drawings using a computerized drafting table more waldo operators then it changed again to show children in the jungle tree people playing on the roof swimming in rooftop poois theres more than work lunan said they play hard too industrial feudalism can be fun as weve seen but why are todos santos residents so exuberant it isnt just freedom from freeways the tv came back to lunan standing in front of a bank of tv screens they showed a bewildering variety people sprawled on balconies people working people walking in corridors uniformed police watched the screens some lolling back in comfort others peering intently at the tv monitors security technology in todos santos is modem too lunan said tony rand cursed whatevзr lunans infbrmation was it couldnt have been worth this who the hell let him in he looked closer at the screen son of a bitch its a fake damned good one though wonder who described the security room for him theyd even got the chart showing the leaper results the only place todos santos residents are not under full surveillance is in their apartments the security guards have the equipment to look even there although theyre not supposed to do it except when asked to or if theres good reason to suspect a resident is in danger lunan said the scene cut back to drinkwater do you ever worry that the police might be watching you when theyre not supposed to lunan asked should i drinkwater shrugged maybe i do think about it sometimes weve got jokes about what the guards know what theyve seen us doing thing is though theyre our guards our friends you love it here lunan said doesnt all the constant surveillance ever bother you bothers hell out of me if it fails drinkwater said goddam fromates got lsd into our food once put four residents into the giggle ward if it hadnt been we had a bartender whod been through that stuff to talk them down wed have lost some stockholders you said fromates are you sure of that lunan asked who else would it be bleeping bleep keep trying too the scene shifted to the mall with a guard post conspicuous in the foreground lunans voice asked did you always feel that way about police nope drinkwater laughed when i was a kid my folks gave me that the policeman is your best friend jazz but it didnt take long to find out what a crock that was you may get friendly with cops but thats mostly to talk them out of giving you a ticket right you dont like them look suppose youre a solid citizen never been in trouble you go out with your buddies and you have one too many and youre trying to get home no accidents but maybe you weave just a little and the cops see you what happens you get a ticket you talk fast and you stifi get busted drinkwater said not here in here the police work for us i get drunk on top level and get lost the guards bring me to my apartment a pretty girl came onto the screen from the right she went up to the guard station we recorded this yesterday lunan said meet cheryl drinkwater armands daughter unlike armand cheryl grew up in todos santos she smiled pleasantly at the guard i had an appointment with my father but im going to be late cheryl told him im not sure where he is she held out her todos santos identity badge the guard returned her smile and nodded in understanding while he put the badge into a slot in his console mr drinkwater is in the th level hideaway he said do you want to telephone no cheryls grin widened just let him know ill be an hour or so late sure thing have a nice day the camera zoomed back a long way back to show thomas lunan standing on a balcony overlooking the kaleidoscopic mall cheryl drinkwater and the guard booth were almost invisible dots far below the scene dissolved to a street in los angeles a dozen police cars deployed around a house police with rifles pistols and shotguns draped over the cruisers while an officer with a bullhorn shouted instructions the guns erupted in a blaze of fire the scene dissolved again to a hijacked airliner to the zapruder films of john f kennedy in the dealy plaza it changed to reagan leaving the washington hilton ending with a federal agent holding a submachine gun then to a montage of scenes showing confrontations between police and citizens thence to another series showing burglarized houses muggings armed robberies finally the camera zoomed into todos santos through the wall and back to thomas lunan overlooking the mall of course weve been unfair lunan said not all police encounters outside todos santos are unpleasant and there have been murders in the box last year a man used a kitchen knife on his wife and two children sure tony rand thought but marlene higgins had lived long enough to push the panic button and the ts guards got there in time to save the third kid whod been hiding in a closet but those kids with the boxes of sand how could i have saved those kids tony wondered and pres judge norton had given her decision very quickly after the evidence was presented sooner than anyone had expected preston sanders would stand trial for murder damn tony thought double damn tony got up and went to the icebox for a beer when he came back lunan was lecturing feudal societies are always complex everyone in such a society enjoys rights but few have the same rights there is not even a pretense of equalityof rights nor of duties and responsibilities there is however loyalty and it runs both ways the todos santos resident is expected and required to be loyal but in return todos santos gives protection todos santos accountants negotiate income taxes for the box committees test consumer products sure do tony rand thought i still get burned up about those damned paper towels good quality but they put the perforations so far apart you used up two when you only needed one and i could never remember which brand it was until the evaluation committee gave them the ripoff rating sticker loyalties in todos santos tend to be personal lunan said the scene faded in to show art bonners office lunan spoke feelingly about the luxuries todos santos provided for its general manager then back to armand drinkwater armand are you jealous of mr bonners position lunan asked great ghu no i only have one boss mr bonner works for everybody loyalty and protection lunan said the ties of the oath of fealty run in both directions the trend in the united states has been to cut all ties so that individuals are alone the citizen against the bureaucracy against them only nobody is really in control and you cant say who they are in todos santos they is art bonner and if you dont like what hes doing you have a chance to tell him so the scene shifted to commons there were a dozen residents clustered around art bonner but tony was looking at the low ceilings which looked even lower on television they ought to be higher dammit the telephone rang tonys phone turned down the tvs sound as he picked up the phone rand art bonner has sir george reedy called you lately no i wish he would i need to talk to him ive set it up for him to tour security and the power plants tony if he asks you to show him around those areas beg off will you sure why hell tony how much do we want an outsider to know about our defenses sir george reedy a fromate spy that was laughable still paranoids have enemies too okay art is that all no did bonner interrupted himself stopped to consider that was odd art never did that then you know about the court decision today sure have you been watching lunans documentary yeah he got me to thinking bonner said i never thought of this place as a feudal society but maybe hes right tony we havent delivered what we promised not to sanders tony didnt say anything so its time we did bonner said tony i dont think our legal people can get pres off johnny shapiro told me today the best legal tactic would be to plead guilty to a lesser charge pres wont do that rand said i know even if he would i couldnt let him and even if we can get a not guilty verdict pres will have paid too high a price its not justice no its not tony said but it is the law also its bad advertising bonner said i dont mean for profits i mean the message it gives to anyone else out there whos thinking of trying a repeat with real bombs we need to let the world know we take care of our own so i want you to think of a way to break pres out of jail huh you heard me plan us a jailbreak i dont want anybody to get hurt and i dont want lapd to be able to prove we did it but i dont at all mind them knowing it was us art you have lost your mindi could be bonner said but it wont hurt you to look at the problem the phone went dead bonner sometimes forgot to let people know when he was through talking ye gods tony thought he went out to the kitchen for another beer thought better of it and dialed for a scotch when he looked back at the screen he saw his own face lunan was saying something about the court magician court magician tony wasnt sure he liked that his drink came and he tossed it off he decided not to order a second jailbreak was bonner serious he had to be art knew how much work rand had to do a whole new security system to install the new wing under construction and the expansion unit designs to finalize and lunan was going on about feudalism again now he was talking about the siege mentality and the fortress appearance of the box interesting stuff and tony wished he had time to think about it more ideas buzzed in his head jailbreaks feudalism if lunan was right how much did the design have to do with it corporations were feudal hell they were invented in feudal times the lord mayor and corporation of london and todos santos certainly did resemble a fort an arcology always would true paolos arcosanti had a light and airy look to it but that had been the first stage the tiny little centerpiece that soled could afford the full model of arcosanti included an immense thirtylevel ring city surrounding what actually got built and despite soleris use of glass and open beams and flying buttresses and balconies if the whole thing had ever been built it would have looked like a fortress of course soled hadnt built it all he hadnt wanted to because he wanted the design to evolve and it hadnt not far enough to construct he never did do a final design but tony rand with degrees in architecture and engineering and experience working with soled and considerable fame from building the new imperial county governmentuniversity complex didnt have the luxury of waiting for evolution tony had to build todos santos and get it open for occupancy and do it with real materials and a strict budget that didnt allow for a lot of the frifis maybe just maybe he thought i could have got away from those vertical walls but how we wanted as much park area as possible and there was always the budget and it had to be built with available labor and did angelinos really read rejection into those high walls as lunan claimed give them a different shape and maybe two innocents wouldnt have died and maybe we couldnt have defended the place at all the fromates didnt much care for soled either commercial time tony shook his head be a nice girl he said aloud ready millies contralto answered you have a message from sir george reedy later tell me about conspiracy context law conspiracy criminal law a combination or confederacy between two or more persons formed for the purpose of commitfing by their joint efforts some unlawful or criminal act or some act which is innocent in itself but becomes unlawful when done by the concerted action of the conspirators or for the purpose of using criminal or unlawful means to the commission of an act not in itself unlawful the essence of a conspiracy is an agreement together with at least one overt act to do an unlawful act enough thank you anytime well we havent conspired yet tony thought not yet but damn i need to talk this over with someone security problem thereit would have to be someone whod be told bonner wanted him to plan a jailbreak who the trouble with being a loner is youre alone he thought for another moment then lifted the phone the tv considerately muted its sound he tapped in half a number and hung up thought about it punched again the phone rang six times and he was about to hang up again hello delores tony rand hi tony there was a question in her voice what the devil did rand want did you see lunans broadcast tony asked some of it good look your boss has gone nuts and i have to talk to somebody rand said with a rush got that out he thought there was a long pause urn tony im dripping bathwater come down in twenty minutes okay well talk about it im sure mr bonner knows what hes doing i used to think so too oh come on anyway shall i have coffee waiting or a drink thanks uhboth irish coffee a tiny pause in which rand suddenly realized that the bartender would be sending drinks in pairs to deloress room and the guards would know he was there no privacy at all in todos santos tony had stopped noticing years ago but lunans broadcast done she said and hung up twenty minutes be a nice girl and call me in fifteen minutes tony said aloud using the voice shift that millie recognized sure thing boss i have messages give them to me from sir george reedy i would like to see you again to discuss details of my new arcology i understand how busy you are due to emergencies are you free for dinner tomorrow night rand scowled everything happened at once but he had to find a chance to pick reedys brain tell sir george six oclock schramms if its convenient phrase it better will do thank you anytime lunan was taking a camera through his own apartment in santa monica this was the damndest documentary rand had ever seen but it made sense in context because lunan was talking about fear and the siege mentality he showed good locks and cheap stereo equipment visible from a window and expensive equipment hidden and the cheap place where he stashed his car jesus rand thought if things were really that bad outside why would he be showing all his secrets lunan must be planning to move tomorrow and what of zach my boys growing up in that instead of here where he belongs and does genevieve deserve that oh damn lunan was back with the drinkwaters again cheryl was saying i dont see how you can live like that i dont see how anyone could and now back to an angelino woman saying i dont see how they can live like that eyes on the back of your neck all the time sure i shop there cut back to the shopping mall again view down a fast pedway another kaleidoscope boys with toilet paper rope cheryl again laughing no of course not she giggled nobody ducks well angelinos duck not bad tony thought not bad at all he dressed hurriedly trying to ignore the knot in his stomach he wanted to talk dammit but his glands told him he wanted something more and he might just might siege mentality lunan was saying todos santos has always seen itself as apart from los angeles although not everyone thinks so cut to barbara churchward neatly tailored skirt suit and bright silk scarf radiating both femininity and competence a large part of our development loans go to outsiders she was saying of course most are to let outsiders come inside but yes we depend on los angeles for a lot of goods and services that it wouldnt make sense to do inhouse she paused as if in thought lunans audience would assume it was thought would lunan example in one todos santos laboratory recently within a week they needed plexiglas sheets several sizes of rings three sizes of drill bits silicone glue glass tubing a dry cell battery some insulated wire three lenses two highly polished mirrorsi could go on but surely the point is made only a big city would have all those things in stock and readily available so you do depend on los angeles lunan said churchward laughed lets just say we spend a lot of money in los angeles probably more than most angelinos realize after all we could have our goods shipped in from some other city but wed rather not she said more but tony wasnt listening twenty minutes delores had said and waiting was tough would a cold shower help damn and an ugly mood has developed lately lunan said typified by a phrase that seems to have caught on in todos santos the camera zoomed down on a sticker attached to an elevator door think of it as evolution in action since nothing happens in todos santos without at least tacit approval by bonner and his people lunan said we may assume that the ts managers agree with this sentiment i havent beei able to trace the origin of the phrase ye gods tony thought i have seen that stuck up here and there lunan makes it look universal but its not not really and dammit where did i hear it first somewhere the night pres had to kill those kidsyeah that night but not then earlier the leaper hell i said it howd it get out to the public im calling you millie warbled ten fifty pm thanks sweetheart tony said be a nice girl ready rand in level tony said how long boss indefinite tony said and felt his stomach knot again ah hell xii make no little plans they have no magic to stir mens blood daniel hudson burnham visiting hours the irish coffee was waiting still hot the whipped cream halfmelted rand had been picturing delores in negligee halftransparent but she was in what were probably called hostess pajamas loose flowing violent orange and quite opaque she also wore a welcoming smile which was reassuring so mr bonner has gone out of his mind she said yeah he wants me to i know what he wants delores said mm did bonner call her or had she called bonner to report the court magicians misgivings good question i can find out who called whom from millie or i can if art doesnt mind my knowing millie was one of the few systems in todos santos that tony rand didnt control at least not completely his mind toyed briefly with an idea a way to get millie to tell him things bonner didnt want known well delores asked she gave him a half smile an indication that she understood his preoccupations but she was damned if shed be ignored when he was in her apartment delores youve known art a long time is he serious tony asked she looked at him tony we cant leave pres with the angelinos oops carefully tony said thats not press opinion i think he wants absolution he wants to be acquitted in court no matter what it costs us tony shrugged maybe he hasnt thought of it that way he thinks its his life and it isnt delores said rand looked away suddenly he didnt want to look at delores she lived in dark colors and soft curves deep brown rug a couple of bean bag chairs tables with no corners a kingsized water bed piled with huge pillows delores was high in the hierarchy her apartment was at least half the size of tonys and none of it was work space put it this way tony she said wewell johnny shapiro claimed no crime was committed that pres was doing his duty and now judge norton has ruled against us what does that mean well it means that the county of los angeles and the state of california consider that a crime has been committed theres no doubt as to who did what so just what is a trial going to be about legal maneuvers sure so if were lucky we get pres off on technicalities wont he just love that no but a jailbreak its not impossible is it i dont know i havent thought that far tony looked at delores and saw she was in dead earnest itd be a felony whether it worked or not even talking about it is felony conspiracy that didnt faze her either of course it wouldnt tony giggled what well i suppose art could always find someone to break us out of jail he would you know delores was dead serious you havent touched your irish coffee thanks he sipped then gulped a bit too cool but strong bitter and sweet irish coffee tastes like a black magic healing spell how do we break him out delores asked trapped but he couldnt be jailed just for talking about it conspiracy requires an overt acti guess id tackle the computer system how ive got a terminal of course she did and voice pickups too tony finished his irish coffee then took the chair it didnt take him long to summon up plans of the new los angeles county jail he ran through all twelve floors then returned to the plan for the ground floor it was about half cells and half administrative offices and waiting rooms pres is a vip tony said ground floor mmm he said he got sunrise on the wall say southeast side and the computers on the top floor but we dont really need to know that what do you need to know millie knows a lot already we could fool with the computers we might even just issue orders to transfer preston sanders to the todos santos jail if anyone noticed wed be up shit creek we have to fool a computer and some human jailors and theyre likely to notice anything that happens to sanders hes their star guest thanks he said as delores handed him a second irish coffee maybe we walk someone in someone who looks vaguely like pres switch them and switch press description in the computer hes got a cell mate tony recommended suddenly thats bad maybe not the cell mate wants to sell us plumbing tony pulled thoughtfully at his drink below conscious thought he was aware of a womans hand resting lightly on his shoulder but his mind had forgotten delores the room everything but the screen before him i dont like it everyone in that jail from the warden to the garbage collector know sanderss face by heart you know why not because theyve seen him because they watch television cant we get sneakier than that make our stooge look exactly like pres weve got a problem there this is a felony remember well be leaving someone else in the pickle and there arent too many individuals of the black persuasion in the uppdr ranks here of course we dont have to be sneaky she laughed whyever not art doesnt care who knows we did it prefers they know all he cares about is whether they can prove it in a los angeles court that should make things easier maybe he stared at the screen again maybe we just tell the courthouse computer to open all the doors at once just a minute tony played with the keyboard he had to give three different security identifications but eventually millie agreed that he was authorized to have the information yep millie can do that so but we cant count on pres cooperating otherwise we could just send a visitor in and when all the lights go out he walks pres out through a horde of escaping convicts with sirens going off and fake messages of mayhem on the fifth floor and like that look it might work delores sat down on the day bed she was on her own second irish coffee tony none of these ideas are foolproof are they and if we get caught were caught for keeps i dont think there is any safe way anyway were just talking right for the moment itd be nice if we had a plan where we could back out halfway wouldnt it so we could try something else yes delores lookedwary you think im trying to back out myself not so what we can do is get them to move pres outside the whole cell block goes funny right the lights go on and off the caterers arent delivering anything but escargot the hot water shuts down the fire alarms go off the doors between the mens and womens wings open yeah the orgy begins and the guardroom doors lock the air conditioning system goes on then the heating system with disinfectant smells then air conditioning again ruining the orgy all the prisoners have to be transferred out we get someone elses computer system to send pres anywhere we want and break him out on the way do you think itd work i dunno ive given you four separate plans what do you want from the court magician aha i saw that too tony had noticed that her tv was on with the sound muted i saw it he said i wonder if he wasnt right were a new feudalism thats what were doing now isnt it snatching our man out of the kings hands delores nodded and she didnt smile she said tony what do they do at the courthouse if the power goes off i dont know lets see no lights no computer they must have procedures for when the computer goes haywire id think so then none of this will work sooner or later you come up against human beings thats the thing about people who think they hate computers what they really hate is lazy programmers dont give me philosophy lessons tony how do we get pres out brute force how rough do we want to get we could send shapiro in with a briefcase full of shaped charges blow the wall and go you dont need me for that or take thirty of the security force through hold it a second tony summoned up the ground floor plan for the county jail through the kitchen it looks like so we send thirty men in through the kitchen and they shoot anyone who gets in the way the trouble is if it doesnt work weve got to bust thirtyone men out next time delores was looking at him with active dislike lamely tony said maybe we dont have to use bullets gas or i could rig something sonic a friend of mine came up with something for a novel a jet engine running in a truck with baffles behind the engine to put out sonic waves at terrific amplitude and he paused a moment be a nice girl right here boss millie said human factors physiology sonic effects too much to talk about boss show it to me data flashed across the screen tony nodded enough thanks at nine kilocycles tony said it kills everyone within a couple of blocks by ripping the walls of the capillaries apart wed want something else a frequency to stwl without killing dont know if her expression hadnt changed delores this kind of thing isnt done any more we cant just tie a rope to the bars of a window and whip up the horse so youll invent a whole new technology for the purpose tell me more dr zarkov tony looked down at his empty mug then up turn on the sound he said what the tv danunit be a nice girl television audio on he was looking at a door on a concrete wall the legend carefully printed on the door in magic marker said think of it as evolution in action beaten to death at the foot of the stairs lunans voice said the victim has not been identified but it is established that he wrote the phrase not long before he was killed no one knows why but it seems to be the earliest appearance there was a long shot of a pathetic bundle huddled on subway stairs tony recognized the clothing be a nice girl television audio off his eyes were still on the screen and he was grieving delores asked what is it he died anyway he didnt go off the high board but we pulled him in and sent him off in the subway and he got off at flower street and some muggers killed him him too dammit the same night dammit tony we can bust pres loose one way or another did you know theres a cable from the mayors office to the white house its for civil defense we can give the emergency alert and theyll have to evacuate the city we snatch pres in the confusion but what do we tell him shall we tell him its my fault i designed it wrong i shouldnt have let them talk me into flat walls tony i dont know what youre talking about flat walls the flat walls make todos santos look like a fort or a prison or a school i could have done something else different shapes it would have been as easy to defend because you only have to defend the groundfloor level anyway a pyra mid maybe the damn leapers wouldnt have come flocking to a pyramid why should they build a pyramid and we have no greensward delores said i remember that argument tony you wanted a pyramid yeah i should have fought harder why are you trying to bar death from todos santos rand let out a great gust of a sigh maybe maybe i am but i put an undertaker in here no i didnt its one of the things i forgot barbara churchward put an undertaker in a month after we opened financed him she had him by the shoulders and was trying to shake him people die tony they die he laughed do you know what pres would say hed say im flying a starship in my head hed say i just planned to drop the deceased out of the airlocks would a civil defense alert break pres out oh it was getting hard to think in theory an irish coffee was the perfect drink for this kind of work it released your imagination without letting you sleep id think the rest of the united states would get really irritated if we did that besides how would we get to him in the traffic jam no scratch that one she studied him for a moment then she stepped to the phone to order more drinks they waited and she watched him nothing up my sleeves tony said im out of ideas delores sorry i didnt mean to shoot you down she said tony shrugged the drinks came she handed him his sipped from her own then she moved behind him and began to knead his neck and shoulders she had strong hands youre all knotted up she said it felt good his tension started to melt beneath her fingers did i do that to you weve got to think of something maybe i shouldnt have shot you down every time tony what if i just ask for a dozen ways to get pres out of the damned jail and no remarks from me it isnt that well what is it then the edges of delores hands drummed on his shoulder muscles almost viciously but it felt good it put a vibrato in tonys voice i almost got seduced by my wife the rhythm broke what did you say exwife i went to see pres but visiting hours werent until four oclock so i set it up with genevieve to drop by and visit my son i got there and zachary wasnt home yet it says here i dont know what kind of a damned fool she thinks i am but she could prove it in court she had me taking off my clothes before she asked for any promises delores said take off your shirt and lie down on your belly on the floor he did she knelt above his hips and went to work on his lower back tony sprawled out with a long sigh i bet i impressed her though he said i not only walked out of her bedroom i waited in the living room and drank coffee and made conversation until zach came home i think he saw some tension though hes eleven and hes bright he knows theres something wrong delores was running her thumbs along the edges of his scapulae and on up to the base of his skull digging in hard what does she want she wants to move in here over my dead body she will when i wasnt getting rich and famous fast enough she walked out on me taking my son and custody of the money now theres no place safe outside umph except the place i built you should pardon my natural egotism shes not after more money shed better not be she had a sharp lawyer for the divorce claimed that since she put me through architecture and engineering school she had a right to a percentage of my income forever got some kind of slidingscale alimony deal she lives damn well doesnt work well to be fair about it shes on a dozen civic committees and things toyed around with the fromates back when we were first building todos santos i wouldnt think an ecosimp would want to live here delores kneaded the shoulder muscles working from outside in then back out again ah give her credit she didnt stay with that crowd very long tony it doesnt add up what doesnt if zach is elevenhavent you been here longer than that yeah what happened was i got through engineering school and wanted to study architecture she didnt like that much wanted to quit work start moving up in the world but she put up with it for a while until i got the chance to spend a year at arcosanti that didnt pay enough delores guessed didnt pay at all i had to pay to go there paolo never did have a lot of money so genevieve walked out and started the divorce while that was dragging through the courts i got lucky on the orange county job you may have heard about that i was a new associate when the finns senior people bought it in a plane crash and i was able to convince the clients that i could finish the project and i did and art bonner liked the work and he talked to the romulus board his voice trailed off sleepily and he yawned a week after the divorce was final i ran into genevieve at a cocktail party and one thing led to another he writhed at the memory we had a lot of problems but incompatibility wasnt one of them she let him chatter on while she pounded on his back zach isnt even mine tony said well i mean he is mine the blood types match and youd know it just looking at him anyway but legally he was conceived out of wedlock and i dont have any claim on him at all im surprised you didnt remarry delores the morning after zach was conceived a dozen sierra club people came to her apartment for an emergency strategy meeting the emergency was todos santos the goddam chapter president had a key to her apartment i walked out screaming and didnt take any phone calls zach was six months old before i knew he existed hey that feels wonderful but talking about djinn is not relaxing he thought not at all damn she almost had me today i wonder if shes still as oh crap take off your pants he craned to look over his shoulder my legs are tense or he didnt bother to finish delores had taken off the tops of her hostess pajamas and was taking off the bottoms tony rolled over i hope i remember how to do this he said there was no pale skin on delores no mark of a bathing suit either she sunbathed nude on her porch or not at all her skin was smooth and hot to the touch now that can hardly be called premature ejaculation tony said considering ive been thinking about it for several years now she laughed softly its always better the second time do you feel like scratching my back any excuse to touch you he thought should he say that any excuse to touch you and he ran his fingernails in large luxurious circles gradually descending djinn had always liked that bloody hell what a time to think of her but shes the only woman ive ever been really intimate with intimate as opposed towhat is this intimacy she moved and made purring sounds when he reached the swell of her buttocks erogenous zone mark he said check i bet i can find yours they made love again and it was better good the first time better the second and how long could they keep that up she left him flat on his back checked their irish coffees and found them cold and ordered fresh one more datum for the bartender tony thought he rolled on one elbow to watch her as she walked about the apartment naked she was as he had imagined her when she wore the orange hostess pajamas except that she had been wearing a bra and panties she came back found him ready spread him flat on his back to reverse their positions they were at climax when the irish coffees arrived and the table dinged to announce the fact and tony started laughing and couldnt stop would todos santos be pleased that rand and deloresthe court magician and the keeper of the privy sealwere in love likely they would he sipped irish coffee and contemplated her back and the world was a nice place to live in where did you meet her delores asked softly tenth grade algebra classuh who never mind the sky was gray with dawn and theyd finished another round of drinks and she still hadnt mentioned preston sanders and tony rand wasnt sleepy at all lets lay down some rules he said first we want something we can back out of second we dont mind using todos santos equipment if thats what it takes and if we can say it was stolen third we involve as few people as possible we use only people near the top she nodded at no time did she seem puzzled at what he might be talking about and then he knew their love affair was several hours old now and it was going just fine but it had started when delores decided that tony rand had to be jarred loose from his depression somehow and its still felony conspiracy damn lunan resident magician everyone who saw that show would know who planned the jailbreak but if i stop planning now or just keep my mouth shut he was kneeling crosslegged on the bed looking down at his feet he didnt have to look up he knew that delores was waiting crosslegged herself the mingled sweat drying on her her expression serious waiting dammit nobody can command a genius to make new inventions nader tried that on general motors general motors made a car that wouldnt start unless the seat belt was fastened and sometimes not even then and some woman got raped by four big men because she couldnt start her car fast enough to drive away from them and it almost happened to djinn that time the purse snatcher chased her except she had the spray can of toilet bowl cleanerfah all ive got to say is ive got part of an answer he said and now he was committed the dawn light showed her joy and she was beautiful ive got to talk about it with someone and ive got to know where theyre holding pres to the centimeter my problem is do i involve you youd be a coconspirator come on tony her hands on his hands im in what are we going to do he told her she started laughing and he joined her xiii tis not what man does which exalts him but what man would do robert browning saul schemes genevieve rand woke to the realization that there was a man in her bed it took her a moment to remember who it was and she almost laughed aloud because it wasnt all that usual a woman with an elevenyearold boy didnt get too many opportunities to begin with and although genevieve hadin her view anyway far more than her share of sexual drive she was also rather particular about her bed partners arnold renn had looked better in the dark this morning his mouth was open and he snored gently genevieve tried to sit up and her head pounded another unusual situation slowly it came back to her tonys visit damn i almost had him so close then that goddam pride his and mine both that always got in our way when what we both wanted to do was hop in the sack and make believe it was an old chevrolet van stuck in a snowdrift in minnesota and we thought wed better share blankets or wed freeze and neither one of us knew anything about how to do it but we managed damned nicely anyway thank you and a long time ago but it wasnt minnesota and we werent in twelfth grade and yesterday wasnt an accident yesterday would have been the most deliberate seduction in history if it had worked and i almost had him if i could have kept my goddam mouth shut who was the idiot who said honesty was the best policy but but would it have been any good to get tony in the sack for a fast lay maybe it was better this way i didnt get him but do i want him for a halfhour stand with zach coming home arnold had showed up the morning after zach was conceived if it hadnt been for arnold renn and his goddam key to the apartment zach would have a father not fair arnold picked up the pieces when tony walked out and hes never demanded anything and he was here to pick up the pieces last night too i am a desirable woman i am dammit i know i am but tony sure didnt let me think so he didnt say i was a scheming old witch but he might as well have tony left and zach got an invitation to an allnight campout treasure hunt and the bottle of bourbon was halfempty when arnold dropped by for the first time in a year and even then he wouldnt have got anywhere except that documentary came on and there was tony looking so ifipping smug under her breath she said court magician forsooth and got up and went to the kitchen her thoughts ran on court magician and what am i and what is zach and even if tony doesnt care for me anymore he sure as hell ought to feel something for zach nine am zach wouldnt be home before noon so there was time she was damned if shed let zach find professor arnold renn in their apartment or anybody else for that matter but especially renn zach would probably get out that pellet gun tony gave him for his last birthday if he thought he could get at dr renn zach tended to worship his father she began breakfast and the smell of eggs benedict brought arnold sleepy eyed and unshaven to the table in an old dressing gown that hed brought over a dozen years before and shed never quite got around to throwing out even after arnold married hed never looked less attractive but genevieve didnt resist when he kissed her he was dutiful not passionate so there wasnt a fight although she wouldnt have minded having a fight and getting him out of her life forever except except what she wondered as she sat across the table from him except that he can make me feel wanted there are other men who can do that why keep this one around hes persistent ill say thatarnold why did you come over yesterday she asked he looked puzzled i hadnt seen you in a while and i missed you why his puzzled look seemed genuine enough ohi dont know tony was over yesterday was he now to see zach unfortunately renn looked pained genevieve i have never understood your infantile infatuation with that man youre worth a hundred of him she giggled youve made it clear you think hes got a negative worth whats a hundred times a minus number he shared her laugh you know what i meant he was silent for a moment genevieve hed tried to call her gun once and it sounded like tonys djinn and she couldnt stand that genevieve for gods sake if you feel that way why dont you take him back take him back she laughed and felt rising hysteria and choked that off so that her voice was calm when she said what and live in the termite hill if need be i thought you fromates hated that place im not a fromate but yes i disapprove of todos santos for a lot of reasons which im sure youre tired of hearing me repeat i was thinking of you and your son ive always loved both of you i guess you have she thought at least enough to ask me to marry you several times in fact and shed often wondered did renn think zach was his he could have been shed slept with renn the night before zach was conceived and again after tony walked out the blood tests made it certain but arnold didnt know about them was he still wondering are you going to see him again renn asked i doubt it you ought to look if theres anything i can do to help greater love and all that youll help me trap my exhusband regretfully of course something like that he said i really do want you to be happy what does tina think of all this renn shrugged tina doesnt interfere hed tried to speak in a tone of indifference but his voice was full of irony all the same genevieve wondered if the stories shed heard were true that tina slept around with arnolds associates and sometimes even with students she didnt know arnolds friends anymore not for years since shed quit the movement open marriages were said to be quite common now but genevieve didnt know anyone who admitted living that way maybe if you moved into todos santos arnold said youd be closer to him ahif its money i think i could help you sure you could give me enough to become a stockholder in the box her laugh was bitter whats the matter arnold giving up the crusades damn it i am trying to put you ahead of ideologies i guess you are thats sweet also just a little unbelievable she thought what has come over him arnold its not money between what tony sends and my aunts legacy i probably could buy enough shares to live in todos santos but tony doesnt want me there hed see me as threat and my friend you dont know what trouble is until youve triggered anthony rands paranoia no thanks so you have to make him want you there renn said and you have something he wantsi presume he does want zach he believes zach to be his yes dammit he knows zach is his why didnt i say that then negotiate tell him you dont like it in los angeles youre going a long way off so far hell never see zachary again unless youve got a better alternative its worth a try ive thought of that she said more to herself than to renn tony doesnt blackmail if you say it right it isnt blackmail its an opportunity for him to talk you out of something he stood if youll excuse me a moment sure renn left the room genevieve drummed her fingers against the dinette table it might work it just might i never wanted to put that kind of pressure on tony but why not im not getting any younger and if zach is ever going to live in an arcology he ought to grow up in one might as well get dressed she started toward the bedroom arnold was in the hail what in the world are you doing she asked oh i dropped the telephone just checking to see that i didnt break anything looks all right he tightened the earpiece cover and set the phone down i will talk to tony genevieve said andi think youre more right than you know if i cant bring him around it probably would be better to leave los angeles hate to see you go arnold said but i can understand main thing is whatever you do im on your side just dont forget that i wont youre sweet arnold thanks tony rand got off the elevator and went to the balcony edge midgard was a sight he always stopped for even if it did trigger acrophobia too bad delores couldnt be here with him but thered be time and they both had work to do and always would but being in love was a new experience and he didnt want to be parted from her even for a little while even for this menonly luncheon he stood halfway between the floor of the mall and the top of the pillar midgard was egg shaped with view windows all around and the bar at the small end it was packed with men in threepiece suits they tended to form groups small clumps of stability while others circulated with grim determination maneuvering to be introduced the older men would find themselves in conversation with the younger newcomers conversation punctuated with quick turns to greet old friends tony shook his head there wouldnt be any real business conversation here a dozen hostesses circulated through the crowd longlegged pretty girls in their best party dresses obviously models hired for the luncheon thered been a time when tony would have looked at them wistfully and wondered how he could get to know one of them now he could be amused at the other mens efforts which when you came down to it were futile anyway these girls werent for sale his newfound objectivity was enlightening and wonderful but the room was far too crowded there were elbows everywhere the transparent walls helped dispel feelings of claustrophobia but they did nothing to alleviate bruises and spilled drinks conversations flowed around him none interesting enough to catch his attention although it made tony feel good to find that he could understand what the people next to him were saying the soundabsorbent cones in the ceiling worked perfectly keeping down echoes and the general noise level despite the overcrowding in fact he thought maybe they work too well there was a chap yelling his head off at a friend not more than five meters away and the friend was ignoring him deaf rude as the yeller obviously thought tony went over to find out fighting his way to a place next to the man being yelled at he turned and listened sam goddammit i know bloody well you can hear me tony could just make out the words he shouted back no he cant hear you to make it more effective he made it look as if he were screaming at the top of his lungs knowing the shouter wasnt going to catch on then he pushed his way across again see you cant get his attention from that far away it always surprises angelinos on their first visit to midgard ah okay he looked at tony puzzled then in comprehension rand the court magician you design this place some of it the sound absorbers not the rest of midgard although i wish i had its nice the man agreed he put out his hand joe adler im with disney studios i was admiring the holos he pointed up to the center of the ceiling where a probeseye view of saturn hung in splendor the view changed as the probe moved toward the rings wideangle views ofthe saturnian system alternating with closeups of the intricate ring structure panning over to the twisted streamers of the fring then back to wide angle thats damned nice thanks that parts mine too when the probe gets past the lunch is officially over good work you ever think of consulting for the studios you could make a bundle tony grinned in my copious free time i take it this is your first visit adler nodded yeah i just got promoted one of the studio brass suggested i should contribute to big brothers suggested it strong enough that i called in and reserved a ticket the same day he gestured at the crowd how do we get a drink allow me tony said he waved toward a waitress to get her attention and to let her see his goldedged badge she wriggled through the crowd like an exotic dancer never touching anyone took their drink orders and vanished in an astonishingly short time she reappeared with a tray guess you are a magician adler said theremy god what tony demanded someone just fell past the window there were a lot of people clustered around the windows now they chattered excitedly but there was no aura of panic damned strange tony thought he pushed his way through the crowd heedless of custom or good manners or anything else another leaper or fromates there goes another one one of the businessmen shouted wow a humansized golden plover with iridescent feathers fell past in a headlong swan dive tony reached the window just in time to see the diver brought up short by the cables that trailed out behind heno shehad almost hit the mall deck before the cables had completely stretched now the girl bounced through the air arms widespread held by a pair of enormous shock cords a riot of brilliant color seconds later she was joined by a boy dressed as a california condor bungee divers someone said aha tony thought they do thatwhere mexico south seas somewhere dive off tree platforms and use vines to stop themselves he looked up to see that adler had followed him to the window they ought to warn us about entertainment like that adler said damned right i nearly had a heart attack but it was damned interesting wonder why we never had anyone do that before maybe itll catch on adler drained his glass there sure are a lot of prizes tony nodded the luncheon included a raffle the biggest prize sat in the middle of the room roped off crowding the bar area even further everyone was crowding to the window so tony made his way to the center area and examined the machine a floatcycle hed never seen one of the twoperson ground effect vehicles up close but the ads said it would go over any land or swamp terrain as well as calm water there were other prizes around the walls portable televisions expensive clothing a hang glider jewelry and half a dozen kinds of home computers he turned back to see that hed lost joe adler to one of the hostesses she was an angelino tony noticed shed probably seen the disney studio label on his badge as usual there were too many at the table so that tonys elbows were jammed into his sides he didnt catch the names as people were introduced so he had no idea of whom he was talking to but they did seem to admire the decor particularly the holograms im surprised to find somebody like you sitting with us the beefy man across the table said i saw art bonner in the bar tony smiled and tried to be friendly corporate policy when we have outside guests they like us to mingle makes sense generally does tony thought of course im not the worlds best ambassador but what the hell and it was fun talking about the holograms a couple of radio comics had been imported to raffle off the prizes they also told jokes fairly rough ones i wasnt too sure about our welcome i dont know if floyd noticed but they brought us in through accessway level past the hydrogen pipe and the big sign that says do your bit thr human evolution i havent been so nervous since the reverend jones invited me to guyana for a cool drink another example of evolution in action i suppose neverthestill here we are once again to help redistribute the wealth taking from the rich to give to the rich but first these updates for those of you who like to keep posted on whats happening outside these walls the comics whipped sheets of notes from inside pockets were still paying taxes were still complaining about paying taxes death and taxes and a word from our sponsor hey you people seem to have solved taxes howre you doing on lake uncomfortable laughter sponsors hey speaking of sponsors james shapiro would like to update you on another aspect of the outside world the great work being done by big brothers of those birds have been retired for years tony said the man to his left chuckled sure and who do you suggest we get tony frowned ah yeah i see jake and floyd have been retired long enough that we remember them from before we built todos santos exactly while modern radio people are known mostly to freeway drivers look im louis charp quick handshake i did a lot of the work setting this up jake and floyd have been good to us wed probably bring them as guests but how can we get a little more current jake and floyd began raffling off prizes with the assistance of some of the ladies tony mulled over the problem what stars would angelinos and saints have in common louis charp asked do you still watch tv soaps situation comedies not those no they dont seem to make much sense news well mostly inhouse news actually even the tonight show monologue was pretty cryptic last time i watched we get movies on the cable tony realized suddenly that new guy in star wars eight the sarcastic one who keeps poking holes in han solos physics rip mendez mmm maybe he might go for it hes got an adopted son the table emptied and tony was able to move again he stretched with a sigh of gratitude and ordered another cognac for the moment his mind was clear of problems hed half finished the cognac when he became aware of a man standing expectantly near his chair tony didnt recognize him youre tony rand arent you the man asked i recognize you from lunans documentary tony sighed it was flattering to be recognized but there was a price to that yeah im the court magician the man grinned and put out his hand george harris he said weve got a mutual friend tony frowned he was sure hed heard the name before preston sanders harris said my cell mate on weekends have you escaped from the jail tony asked in a manner of speaking tonys mood was completely shattered now how i just walked outthey let me out sunday night to dawn saturday except for holidays holidays i go back in he explained the work furlough program but weekends i room with pres like a bloody omen tony thought how are they treating you not too bad now mind if i join you harris didnt wait for an answer he sat next to tony and caught the waiters eye two brandies anyway it was pretty rough before they moved me in with sanders but now its all right could you take something to pres for me nothing you couldnt send him through the sheriffs office harris said he grimaced they search us going in why did you want to send something id be glad to help anything i could do to help that fine young man it wasnt hard to draw harris out he liked to talk he wanted to tell tony about his electrical supply business in between stories about the jail but after a while tony had a good picture of the jail schedule the weekend schedule he reminded himself they might do things differently the rest of the time so itll be a weekend he thought and his heart thudded once hard i try to cheer him up harris was saying these things dont last look at watergate forgotten and all those big mafia scandals same thing people dont remember after a while of course that was pretty drastic killing those kids and jim planchet keeps things stirred up good but i dont talk to pres about that mostly i try to get him to keep in shape exercise if hed work out good every day he could leave that place in better shape than he went in look at the bright side thats what i tell him pres gets pretty moody tony said boy and how its all i can do to get him talking hes also polite yeah he sure ishey it was great meeting you ive got to get back to the office now could i come see you sometime id sure like to show you those new computerized light switch units i can make you a hell of a price in the quantities youd buy ill call you sometime tony said thanks for telling me about them they shook hands and tony waited until harris had left then picked up the untouched brandy that harris had ordered for him his hands were shaking as he drained the glassxiv there is nothingabsolutely nothinghalf so much worth doingas simply messing about in boats water rat in the wind in the willows perceptions barbara churchward smiled at the couple across the table from her then its settled she said i dont think youve made a mistake i hope not rebecca plan said she seemed nervous which barbara thought she had every right to be ted and rebecca plan had just bet everything they owned on a long shot of course it was a long shot for barbara churchward too but she was used to that sort of thing not all her gambles had to succeed just enough to cover the rest and make a bottom line profit it was different for ted and rebecca well have the equipment installed by next monday barbara said ive found space for you not far from your apartment when could we move in rebecca asked barbara stared thoughtfully at the ceiling for a moment tomorrow after four she said the services people will have everything ready then you make things happen so fast ted flan said i wouldnt have believed it barbara shrugged if its worth doing at all theres no point in being slow about it quite the opposite the sooner you get into the market the bigger your share will be she gave him her best smile and im certain it will be a large share i think so too rebecca said i always thought ted could be rich if he just had a chance which just might be true barbara thought ted plan was a brilliant man with insufficient confidence in himself it wasnt that he didnt have the drive he worked himself silly with his energy properly directed just now though the problem was to get rid of them the deal was made the papers signed and there was more work to do but of course the plans werent the kind of people who could leave drinks halffinished in an expensive place like this normally shed never have brought them the inferno bar was hardly the place to do business midgard was much better you could leave people to enjoy midgard and theyd never notice youd gone but midgard was taken up by the big brothers fund raiser and rebecca had wanted to see inferno it was worth seeing one whole wall was a looped hologram tape of antarctica icy crags eroded by winds laced with fine snow all in glare white another showed holograms of volcanos rivers of lava cascading down into the sea fiery eruptions of flame and smoke into the night then pan downward to towns and farms and fields covered with gray ash great place if you dig bleak ted said there are those who like it barbara said she nodded to acknowledge a greeting from a gathering of men in threepiece suits grouped around a table near the bar two had shed their jackets and were arm wrestling others came to join them when does anyone get their work done rebecca asked it looks like the whole business community barbara laughed it very nearly is the big brothers lunch was today annual event they figure theyll never get any work done because theyre halflooped so why not finish the job ineluding i see the general manager of this place uhif you could manage to excuse me i think id better join him oh sure not at all ted said he stood quickly rebecca joined him reluctantly we havent seen the casino plenty of chances for that ted said well be living here yes barbara thought and i wonder just how much interest in the casino rebecca has milue monitor financial activities at inferno for new residents ted and rebecca flan notify me of any activity over two hundred dollars after all ted was saying we wouldnt want to see everything in one day i suppose not rebecca said barbara stood and offered her hand i think youll be very happy here good luck they shook hands and ted turned away then he stopped oh i forgot he fished in his coat pocket and came up with a key which he held out to barbara you will take care of katie wont you shes something special well find her a good home barbara said she put the key in her purse and watched them leave the bar when they were gone she turned to go back to her office barbara nuts she thought no escape now tony rand had seen her and he looked a good bit more than halflooped hi tony hi id like to ask you a favor oh sure if i can its kind of complicated tony said well i was planning on working its important tony said he led her toward a table barbara watched analytically as she followed hes part drunk and damned nervous she thought id better see what he wants rand waved at the waitress and moments later she brought him a scotch and a pink lady for barbara sometimes this place is just a little too efficient barbara said i didnt really need a drink nor for that matter did you relax rand said you cant work today nobody sober to interact with youve a point there she said the arm wrestling game was continuing loudlyan angelino deputy district attorney against one of shapiros assistants whats your problem tony hah ive got a dozen problems including arts latest idiocy yes oh you know no i dont tony barbara said but you have to know youre on the management council he has to tell you its in his charter he gave her a wink you know she let her voice show impatience tony i dont have the least idea of what youre talking about and i dont have time to play games but he looked up at the ceiling the cones work i dont think anyone can hear us tony if youre about to say something art wants kept secret id advise you not to there are angelinos all over yeah i know he tossed off the scotch and waved at the waitress that wasnt the favor i wanted anyway good millie link me to bonner art your court magi cian is in his cups and wants to babble all our secrets i have another problem im afraid of my wife what exwife she called me wants to talk seriously with

her to move to new york why not i donti just dont tell me about genevieve rand data poured into her mind she hadnt time to digest it all but one thing was obvious i suppose its the boy yes are you being fair to him tony barbara asked youre building your starship and youre leaving your son behind you didnt have to be so damned blunt about it sure i did thats whats bothering you isnt it yes but i dont know what to do about it barbara the only way he could live here is to have djinn live here too hes legally hers not mine yes tony i know but i dont know why youre so dead set against her being here tony was quiet for a long time barbara shook her head shed never understood rand but he seemed stranger than usual today if he hesitated if i had to see her every damn day id probably be married to her in a year but iftony if you think youd marry her again why would that be so bad because shes lived off me for all these damn years tony said and she never did a damn thing for me all that time where was she when i needed her now its the other way around so youre making her pay but you get no satisfaction from it because it hurts your son you sure have a way with words tony said he brooded for a moment but i guess its true then its simple enough bring her here and put her on the other side of the building todos santos is a big place what would she do here barbara digested more information she seems to have done all right as a civic leader quite a natural organizer i expect shed do well probably be a neighborhood representative within a couple of yearsoh thats the problem isnt it you think shed do too well im not that petty oh yes you are my friend barbara thought i wonder just how long that little dilemma has been eating away at you art i really think you should get tony out of here soon ive sent for reinforcements shall i join you now one moment more tony what do you want me to do i want you to talk to her negotiate for me youre the sharpest negotiator i know sure barbara said i expect i am but for all my fabulous skills tony what can i do you dont know what you want so how could i get it for you i dont know you could do something better than i can he hunched his shoulders forward and stared into his drink let her in i wont be here anyway tony what in the world are you talking about nothinghello art enter the grand high executioner art what in the devil is wrong with him i told him to plan a jailbreak hes scared i contingency plan sorry i couldnt be with you earlier bonner said big powwow with maclean stevens he shrugged nothing we could really talk about of course the situations cut and dried planchet wants blood and macs got to supply some ours tony said maybe hell get more than he expects ive been looking up the law on conspiracy that will do bonners voice was edged with ice youre drunk take the afternoon off oh yass baas take the day off shuffle off shuckin and jivin all the way this wont do at all barbara thought rough and smooth right she put her hand on tonys arm arts right weve all had too much she pointed to the low table by the bar the arm wrestlers were still at it and there was a fiveway conversation over their heads with no one listening to anyone and were the soberest people here hi tony mr bonner delores came to the table bonner stood hell you sent for her too rand said christ no more privacy than a goldfish theres something wrong with the whole idea of this place people cant live like this oh hush delores said she sat next to rand what did you expect mr bonner to do send you home alone she grinned ive got the afternoon off too can we think of something to do rand rubbed his head maybe we could thats the spirit lets go delores stood and dragged tony up gee whilhikers mr wizard you walk funny oh shut up rand said but he walked with her out of the room whew yeah what did he want from you he spent long enough telling you he wants me to negotiate with his exwife he wants stop i the command was a shout in barbaras head involuntarily she put her hands over her ears my god art dont do that sorry bonner looked nervously around the room are you all right has everyone gone insane here he was looking at her but not seeing her shed never seen art bonner like that indecisive something really strange was happening lets go somewhere art said andkeep the conversation verbal and trivial for a while surewhere do you want to go your office mine my place or yours hah thatll be the day i wonder what it would be like she felt his hand on her arm and she stood letting him guide her past an erupting mount st helens his grip was firm she couldnt remember if hed ever touched her before theyd always been wary of each other two executives with something like telepathy guarding their thoughts when they were together never a man and a woman he led her onto a crowded pedway todos santos people automatically moved aside to make room for them but the angelinos either didnt recognize them or didnt care no one spoke to them and they rode in silence strange weird barbara thought we could talk without being overheard only he doesnt want to talk through millie something of his sense of urgency kept her from using millie at all and she rode through the crowded mall silent feeling cut off from the world and alone for the first time in years the guard at the exit gate stared in surprise dont you want someone to go with you mr bonner thanks riley well be all right going to look at some prop erty millie can find us if were needed bonner said he led barbara out to the subway platform art what in hell are we doing she asked when they were away from the gate getting out of todos santos for a while where are we going i have to tell my staff no please not this time we wont be gone long she looked at him intently are you drunk a little has nothing to do with this all right but where are we going anywhere restaurant coffee shop someplace random boy when you ifip out you really do it dont you a train rushed into the station and stopped they hopped on it and found seats bonners face was a deadpan no visible emotion a study in selfcontrol and that was a little frightening too any preference on where we get off she asked no but lets make it a couple of stops more sure she looked thoughtful for a second i know where we can go fme lead the way meaning dont say it out loud she wondered well i wont the train pulled into the marina station and she waited until the last moment then grabbed arts hand and pulled him lets go she said they ran out just as the car doors closed she was laughing as they went up the steps were you really worried about someone following us because i think i took care of that you sure did but no i wasnt especially worried about that they came out to bright daylight a hundred yards from the ocean to their right was a long stretch of beach with dozens of angelinos playing in the surf doing exercises on swings and jungle gyms or just lying around on the beach nice idea art said i havent been for a walk on the beach in ages actually i had something else in mind barbara said she led him off to the left into the maze of slips and piers and docks through a forest of sailboat masts searching for a slip number this way she said they walked out a long pier and stopped in front of a big singlemasted boat the name painted across the stem was katherine iii whats this i just bought it barbara said well for the company but ive got the keys want to help me aboard my skirts a little tight to climb that rail sure he said uhthose heels arent going to work so well on teak decks right she took them off then let art lift her over the plasticcoated wire guard rail pretty boat she said art nodded fortyfoot motor sailor you could sail around the world in this you bought it more or less i took over the payments she took out the key and unlocked the companionway a ladder led down to a large saloon cabin fitted out with wide padded berths that served as seats along both sides of a cockpit table art followed her down she looked around in the mahogany lockers aha jts brown she said holding up a bottle of bourbon or should i make coffee a little bourbon wont hurt bonner said he found glasses in a fitted locker and a small refrigerator below supplied cold water they sat at the table and barbara poured typical story barbara said young couple bright guy doing well writing software for a computer company making lots of money but they got in over their heads cars fancy apartment furniture this boatso when his boss reneges on promotions what can the poor bastard do he cant go start his own company not owing all that money she grinned so i surprised hell out of the boss and set them up in business and the boat distraction barbara said look we set them up and were only taking percent of the company the rest is his were risking a lot of capitalso i damned well insist that he risks everything hes got and i do mean everything gives him a powerful incentive lot of pressure on a young family bonner said he twisted his face into what might have been a grin and might have been something else i know what pressure can do to a person and to a marriage no pressures barbara said hes got his office a dec cornputer some lab space a c apartment and six months in cornmona he doesnt owe anybody a cent and they cant starve all part of the package now all hes got to do is produce and i know damned well he can do that because mast of what bfk associates sells was written by him so you think of everything how many of these deals go sour not enough of them eh she shrugged a low failure rate means im not taking enough risks im supposed to take risks my failure rate is down tooh dai n you art bonner were out of range and i cant remember and i dont like being cut off from my memory what is going on he sipped at his bourbon what did tony want you to talk to his exwife about she shook her head art i wont play games any longer i want to know whats happening yeah hard to know where to start you remember that reporter lunan you and the pr people thought it would be a good idea to turn him loose yes and i dont think that documentary hurt us a bit me either bonner said but that wasnt what i was trying to say he had an offer of his own information for interviews i bought it art paused and sipped at his drink the information was that a fromate ucla professor named arnold renn furnished the planchet kid the data he needed to break into todos santos okay so where did renn get the data we dont exactly advertise those codes she felt a tingle at the base of her spine art where does tony fit into this i had security watch professor renn he spent yesterday night in genevieve rands apartment but not the first time either bonner said genevieve and renn go back a long way to before rands divorce she put in a year with an ecofreak outfit renn was president of that was back before there were any fromates another interesting little item six years ago tony brought his son zach to todos santos well of course he would yeah bonner said and he took the kid to medical and had them take blood samples zach and himself what he wanted was complete blood types rh factor m n factors the whole damned works she frowned and started to frame a question in her mind but there was no response the only reason for that kind of test is to establish paternity bonner said which he did insignificant probability that the boy could be anyones but his but he did want to find out barbara said all right fine butart you dont really think tony rand is giving information to the fromates i dont know what to think theyll be back barbara with real bombs as soon as they know enough about our new defenses yes but tony im scared to think barbarasuppose he is he understands millie better than we do and millie knows almost everything we know so when you mentioned genevieve just after tony was acting crazy all i could think of was to et the hell out and go where nobody could listen to us not even millie he grinned sorry i was so melodramatic about it but i really was scared to think about it i never felt that way before i feel it too barbara said i think its called panic i dont blame you for wanting to run butart i thought no one could get at our files any security system is vulnerable especially to the one who set it up in the first place yeah but come on art i dont believe tony is a traitor and you dont either no and hes not usually a blabbermouth but i imagine its hard to keep secrets from your wife even if youre not living with her what did he want you to talk to her about anyway she wants to live in todos santos aecording to tony shes wanted to for a long time but he wont let her now she repeated the conversation shed had with tony shes putting the screws on and tony doesnt want to talk to her bonner said thoughtfully which may not mean anything and may mean im sure not certainly she could be blackmailing him but tony wouldnt have told her about the security codes renn got them from somewhere bonner said and tonys acting damned funny id act funny too if you told me to plan a jailbreak would you he was perfectly serious she had to think about that one no i guess i wouldnt are we going to break pres out art spread his hands got any better ideas onlyif tonys compromised so is the plan he poured more drinks for himself and for her should we be drinking any more feeling it some she admitted good he stood up his eyes on hers so here it comes she thought or not its all up to me all i have to do is make some funny remark or say anything at all hes scared to death of me why not ive been a bit afraid of him myself she stood without her heels her head was just at the level of his chin and she had to tilt her head up to look into his eyes they were very close in the narrow cabin she stood waiting wondering what he was going to do it was a funny situation art bonner decisive manager of todos santos the man they all expected to be god standing there trying to get up the nerve to touch his colleague maybe wed better leave things wont ever be the same between us if we he put his hand on her shoulder his easy grin was back damnation he said i kept hoping for a wave or something to throw us together she giggled the boats awfully steady then laughing she threw herself at him he caught her easilyxv extrasensory perception abbr esp perception by supernatural or other extraordinary means american heritage dictionary secrets it was long past noon and cheryl had started getting dressed when she found the knife lunan was still in bed a little too happy to move yet watching her she pulled his pants out of the tangle of their clothing and was ready to toss them to him but she noticed the weight of his belt buckle first she studied the big ornate steel buckle then she pulled on it experimentally she found the catch and it came out of the belt and became the handle on a fiveinch blade thats one you didnt show me she said lunan chuckled you were nervous enough she nodded it felt dangerous walking all that way from the garage and knowing there were no guards watching why do you park that far away well i know you want the car safe you told me but how can you feel safe walking back is that what the knife is for a knife ive never had to use it yet suppose the mugger has a gun lunan sat up grinning does being nervous turn you on cheryl grinned back theres no way she could deny it lunan thought no way at all she was turned on last night and thats what did it it felt adventurous ive never done anjthing like this before she said she shook her head curls flowing like something out of the past something starring clint eastwood with enemies on all sides of us and only one strong man to protect me i aint clint eastwood and i aint all that strong but ill accept it they had arrived in late afternoon he had showed her the locks on his doors the cheap stereo equipment in plain sight the good equipment all hidden the shotgun behind the sofa watching her reactions he had assumed she would need soothing but the opposite was true it had excited her they had made love at once twice and they only pulled themselves out of bed to cook dinner that had fascinated her watching him playing at impressing her by playing chef shed never cooked a meal in her life hed finished in time they ate during the broadcast of lunans documentary on todos santos for i am your bold deceiver thought lunan poor miss bailey unfortunate miss bailey todos santos had no place for the unabashed cocksman shed disagreed with some of what his television image was saying theyd argued far into the night hed gleaned more than enough material to start another documentary dan rather watch out but her attitude was suggestive he was going to have to brace bonner again and soon if the rest of the saints felt the way she did then thomas lunan wanted in the next step todos santos took could make thomas lunan famous he watched her a pretty but not beautiful girl attractive but not irresistible and totally unaware that she was the key to the riches of the indies in that sense alone cheryl drinkwater was the best thing that had ever happened to him when she tossed him his pants he bowed to reality and began getting dressed she stopped in the doorway as they were leaving what he asked she was studying him closely i had a lovely time tom but i dont think ill be back lunan had expected this sure not bloody likely you would but we both got what we wanted youd be very welcome she shook her head i know lunan said it was an adventure you dont have to repeat an adventure but maybe youll change your mind he knew that she wouldnt an angel had gone slumming no more than that buthow much variety could there be among the todos santos boys any angelino was bound to be an interesting experience for cheryl shes cut off from the mainstream one of us is anyway i tried to make it interesting for her god knows it was for me and i owed her that maybe but if im a little miffed shes never going to know it barbara woke in semidarkness the dock lights were on outside and some of the yellow light ifitered past the curtains on the cabin windows and fell on the cabin table making strange patterns on her neatly folded tailored suit and striped panties her brassiere atop the pile didnt look like clothing at all she moved lazily snuggling closer to him and felt his arm tighten around her your poor arm must be asleep she whispered its all right why didnt we think of this before he chuckled softly ive thought about it for five years hmm me too but not quite like this the smile was still in his voice no i wondered what yes well well just have to find out wont we she giggled here we are both of us wondering what telepathic lovemaking would be like and we still dont know we can find out or not she said artare you sure we want to continue this weve stolen an afternoon ill bet theyre going crazy back there wondering where we are but theyre wondering now do we want them to know do you care my darling i dont care one damn bit but then im a bitch with no reputation anyway youre the one whos got to worry do you right now i dont even want to go back now just one minute mister thats not even funny as a joke why not his voice was serious and that was just a little frightening were both rich its not as if we need our jobs the hell we dont she said he was quiet for a moment yeah thats the part grace could never understand that i could love my job and still love her now youve gone and said it said what that word love is this love art they call it making love damn you dont make jokes this is serious is it it could be he was quiet for a long time do you mean that yes good i think weve been in love for years she said if love is sharing and caring and respecting hmm love without intimacy we havent needed intimacy we can get all of that we want anytime we want she said and have sure but its not the same these affairs no she nestled closer to him then bit his nipple ouch turn abouts fair play not yet lets go back they really will be worried about us and youve got a jailbreak to plan sigh i suppose youre right one of us has to be sensible you dont mind if i lose my head over you once in a while i want to move in with you would you feel crowded um we can make the next apartment over an adjoining one a pause and a scowl maybe check on it when we get back good enough were at an age where well want some privacy and thatll make it official she swung her feet over the edge of the berth and began putting on her brassiere whats the allfired hurry because my darling not only will they be worried about us but but i blush to speak of it but there does remain that unanswered question she said and at our age i doubt we could manage anything three times in one day he locked his fingers in her bra strap tugged gently youre kidding yourself were not going back to make love she turned to look at him were going back to face a dozen emergencies ive got to check on rand and see if hes come up with anything his fingers loosened as he spoke see how were doing with the new defenses the bastards could be breaking in with real bombs and i should be checking on ways to get pres out of california his hand dropped from the strap god knows whats come up since we left but milliell tell us as soon as were in range late tonight if were lucky she nodded solemnly midnight your place i can get myself moved in by then damn what she laughed i tried to log it bonner felt millie return to him while the subway train was still approaching todos santos millie receiving summary information flowed nothing urgent had happened he glanced over at barbara she was staring at the ceiling her eyes half closed appointments none scheduled thomas lunan has requested another appointment at earliest convenience he says he will wait in the midgabd bar screw him tell delores ill be in shortly acknowledged he waited until barbaras eyes opened fully anything interesting you rushed me off so fast i forgot an appointment she said accusingly i havent done that in years important well it could be sir george reedy ah well he wants to learn something he wont be annoyed or at least he wont admit to it i suppose ah here we are with any luck ill see you about midnight ill keep an eye out for you bonners office staff had gone home of course leaving a thick stack of messages on his desk five were from lunan who seemed desperate to see him art thumbed through the stack then dropped them into the wastebasket before settling into his big highbacked leather chair and putting his feet on the desk he reached out to touch a button on the telephone console a pause then deloress voice came through boss here hows tony i fed him vitamin bi and a gallon of water hed never heard of that can you imagine hes just been living through the hangovers is he in condition to talk better than that he sobers up as fast as he gets smashed weve been making notes on the youknowwhat on paper tonys a little afraid of putting any of this in the computer good keep it that way ill drop in on you in an hour or so if you dont mind a momentary hesitation then fine welcome but keep it short he has a dinner appointment with reedy skip it send him to the sauna instead bye millie here locate thomas lunan midgard telephone link midgard headwaiter after a moment the telephone said yes sir find thomas lunan hes a visitor in the bar somewhere send him up here art bonners outer office was dark and thomas lunan stumbled twice as he made his way to the slightly ajar inner door shouldnt have had a fourth drink lunan thought hell with that art bonner was sprawled in a big leather chair he didnt get up when lunan came in but he waved toward an open sideboard make yourself a drink lunan poured a small scotch and ifiled the glass with soda he took a seat and lifted the glass cheers cheers bonner said there was a long silence all right what is it ive been thinking of a diplomatic way to say this lunan said and there isnt one mister bonner are you planning a jailbreak that threw him lunan thought got right to him why do you ask that bonner demanded because you are lunan said and no nobody told me you dont have to worry about security leaks ive talked to too many of your citizens they expect you to get preston sanders out of jail who else knows on the outside bonner asked nobody i know of which doesnt mean someone else hasnt thought of it but i havent told anyone maybe i should have lunan waited for bonners response and got an inquiring look i mean you guys play that rough you could make me disappear im not one of your citizens you dont figure you owe me a thing whats the point of this bonner demanded i want in lunan said i want an exclusive on everything in return you get the story told the way i tell stories superbly you saw my documentary yes it did us no harm it did you a lot of good and you know it look you want the story to get out not naming names of course but you want los angeles to get the message bonner looked thoughtful perhaps perhaps hell lunan insisted think of it as evolution in action societies evolve too thats the story you want out and ill see it gets out youll also be in a position to blackmail us im in it now lunan said one phone call and you wont get sanders out not easily anyway but im not blackmailing you i told you all about renn didnt i and i didnt even take any precautions because im not going to blackmail you not now and not later i just want the story and when the police ask you california has a very tough newsmans shield law mister bonner its protected me before maybe thats not quite enough bonner said maybe wed want you to help out do something yourself lunan gulped shit fire of course hed think of that all right good well let you know just stay available because you wont get much notice i dont need much notice lunan lifted his drink in salute he wanted to jump up and sing heroic arias this would make his career and it was the only way to deal with these people level with them uhyou have thought about immunity lunan said bonner nodded the da can certainly give you immunity from prosecution by the state of california but not from you lunan said bonners smile widened slightly i knew you were an intelligent man mr lunan cheers tony rand stepped out of the elevator and leaped back as shapes ran past him he heard sorry and saw two teenage boys and a laughing matron crouched low moving toward the swings at a dead run they wore dark coveralls and their faces were striped dark as well the doors tried to close tony blocked them and stepped out onto the roof shaking his head he was still a little wobbly from the afternoon even so he knew he should be feeling much worse bi and water and a sauna and never forget it he told himself the restaurant was a fair walk from the elevators tony passed gardens a pocketsized chaparral forest a football field he might have been strolling through any park there were no visual cues to tell him that he was a fifth of a mile in the air the lights along the walk had been dimmed to twilight level tony noticed other human shapes running or crouching in shadows they too wore dark coveralls and face paint and there was a faint glimmer of gemstones on their breasts tony kept his hands halfraised as he passed them noncombatant he was nearly at the restaurant when there was a ruby flash from behind him the lightbeam probed into the bushes ahead and to his right a young man no more than fifteen stood as his dark coveralls flashed with bright light he cursed horribly then sat heavily in the pathway and stared moodily ahead tony nodded sympathy as he passed schramms was a glass bubble set at one corner of the todos santos roof shallow steps led down from the entrance los angeles glowed through the unseen wall far below it was no place for someone with acrophobia the headwaiter had seen lunans broadcast of course welcome court magician he chortled as he escorted rand to the table where sir george reedy waited id like to push a volkswagen into thomas lunans big mouth rand confided sir george ignored that crypticism i had a scare coming here it was as if a street gang had taken over the roof nothing to worry about its a roleplaying game man from uncle hunt club lowpowered laser pistols and suits that light up when youre hit fashion designer named therri organizes themits considered an honor to be invited aha tony thought he still doesnt catch on of course millie and the security force are monitoring it buti would have thought youd call it off during the emergency hmmm i doubt anyone even considered that its been scheduled for months sir george the stockholders dont like letting outsiders run our lives tony noticed a waiter at his elbow and ordered a fruit daiquiri sir georges pimms cup was empty he ordered another have you been keeping busy this past week oh certainly reedys smile faded slightly well ill admit time hangs a bit heavy while i wait out your war the combatants havent much time for a visiting tourist when your miss churchward missed an appointment this afternoon i thought i would lose my aplomb i needed that drink tony nodded feeling awkward and yet it hasnt all been wasted time what did cause the war mr rand more to the point if i build an arcology in canada how do i prevent conflicts with the outside do you have fromate groups in canada theyre not a large influence they might become one if we built something like todos santos i wish id paid more attention to the bad feeling rand said im no good at politics danm it should i have built this place to look less like a fort i see other possibilities good enlighten me sir george smiled actually i came to be enlightened still should i put my giant building inside the borders of an already existing city you werent offered a choice there i have one tonys drink had arrived and he sipped at it cautiously hed blown his head off once today and once was enough yeah you should be outside youll look less like competition what else ive managed to see a good deal of todos santos your power system food and water storage securityall tend to make you independent of outside supplies and outside forces are you aiming for economic independence too sure millie would have told you that quite right is that wise youll end as a bubble of foreign matter inside the body of the city angelinos might well resent such a thing and los angeles politicians would resent it most tony looked at him practice for building a starship he thought is that where i went wrong butwait a minute isolation isnt just a whim with us its what were selling people come to todos santos because they can get free of whats outside the crime rate not just that sir george suppose you just didnt want to bother learning how to make out an income tax form and deciding whats deductible every time you spend ten bucks knowing some supercilious son of a bitch is being underpaid to secondguess you and keeping little pieces of paper to prove it its a fun game but why does everyone have to play sometimes it feels like the government wants to turn everyone on earth into accountants sir george seemed about to interrupt but rand went on accountants and lawyers half the government is lawyers and when they make laws they dont write them in english nobody but a lawyer can tell legal from illegal and the lawyers cant tell right from wrong anymore sir george looked stunned i never felt that way at all plenty of our people doat least thats what i hear in commons independence is a lot of what were selling sir george nodded thoughtfully maybe youre right though tony said maybe we really shouldnt be inside anyones borders build your arcology outside city limits but get your subway built fast because youll need to be trading with the host city have you decided where to put the project i have half a dozen sites to choose from reedy smiled fleetingly ill have to reject some toronto for instance toronto has a superb underground shopping complex something like todos santos would be competing with that menus arrived tony ordered without paying too much attention he wanted to get back to the conversation he noticed that reedy too had barely glanced at his menu reedy asked how would you build a canadian arcology would you change the design sure i learned a lot living here for all these years anyway todos santos is the wrong shape for a cold country youll need more insulation fewer balconies more storage for food in the winter sir george had a sleepy look as if he werent quite paying attention it was wasted on tony rand who stared out at los angeles with unfocused eyes it doesnt have to be less open and it doesnt have to look like a fort get yourself a mountain slope facing south a quartersphere hollow in winter the low sun shines right into it you can line it with apartments soleri designed it a long time ago for siberia but it ought to work even better in your latitudes reedy lifted an eyebrow and seemed thoughtful thank you but there are other decisions i must make for example am i selling independence like you and do i need such an elaborate security system i dont know tony said im an engineer not a manager ye gods is he trying to hire me he sure sounds like it naw he couldnt be butuh would you give the top brass computer implants reedy frowned i hadnt thought of it implants are expensive whats it like to have an implant to know anything you want just by thinking it an arcology is terribly complex it makes a saturntype moonship look like a tinker toy i believe i see what you mean sir george smiled slowly it wasnt his usual vague smile at all it looked somehow predatory there was a new door in the east wall of art bonners apartment bonner went through and found nobody home millie time location barbara churchward millie told him and he relaxed she was just coming out of the elevator on her way moments later she opened the door and found him hello hi how was sir george she shrugged as you predicted annoyed and pretending not to be he really is grateful to us with what hes learned hell be able to get his canadian arcology going in half the time it took us glad he wasnt too upset he waved expansively it looks like youve lived here for years howd you find the time i had services move me ill be weeks finding out where everything is and how was your day lunans back and he knows were planning a jailbreak ye gods how hes got a contact here cheryl drinkwater you saw her on the documentary i think she told him more than she knew barbara subvocalized millie data chery drinkwater bonner broke in millie phone link with barbara churchward love ive started a file on tom lunan too okay millie data tom lunon information whispered into her mastoid bone updateshe knows hes guessing cheryl cant possibly know but she must have told him how the stockholders feel the subway adlunct is common knowledge he may have worked that in hell maybe hes telepathic useful trait in an investigative reporter how will you handle it take him along make him an accomplice i told him hed be in at the kill dammit sometimes we really do need some protection from our friends thisll do it he stretched tired she nodded hows tony delores sobered him up and put him to work i dont know whether he needs a keeper or not but shes a good one if she can stand it millie file illicit barbaras jaw went slack as she listened to millies characterless voice describing rands updated plans she backed into a chair and sat down she began laughing art grinned down at her i do admire subtlety id have thought tony would go for something more complicated delores must be keeping him honest hey lets go to bed art looked back at the new door in what had been a blank wall theyd even remounted the pictures it all happened so fast yeah lets too fast he was stripping off clothing and tossing it through the open door into his own apartment they made a tight pattern on and around a reading chair im adaptable are there any special daydreams youd like fulfilled ive been through that hell i didnt mean to say that they moved into each others arms eye to eye barbara wondered how do you feel halfexcited halfapprehensive its been a long time why complications i get enough complications in real life for years now this should we have waited should have started earlier before those kids got killed better late than never what daydreams rape once with a vampire costume number masquerade at a con science fiction convention we kept the costumes on i was in a white shroud tried not to move a muscle but why am i telling you this it must be hard to lie subvocally what do you daydream art fast sudden seduction no complications fast right she swung out of his arms and yanked him toward the bed by one wrist he found himself on his back laughing still bouncing and she was sitting on his hips fast enough and up against a wall but im gettin old and its been a long day well try it some morning she wriggled and they were locked barbara bent toward him and he thought no stay upright youll pull loose thy servant she swayed upright and even leaned back hands gripping and tickling the back of his knees he gasped he thought lovely you shine by your own light he held up his hands and she took them glowing at the compliment his face altered as she moved up and down slowly the messages passing through millie became incoherent and finally breathing as if hed run a marathon art sent i wonder what mille thinks of all this lunan found the tiny bar dead empty he hoisted himself onto a stool and said keep it simple um calvados soda on the side be right with you the bartender finished pouring something pink and frothy out of a shaker put that glass and a brandy snifter in the wells of a drink tray and set it in the dumbwaiter he was grinning like a thief he asked insomnia lunan said yah pure nerves he took the snifter before levoy could set it down sniffed sipped whats got you smiling like that at two in the morning i cant tell you the bartender said happily i just told thirty million people that there arent any secrets in todos santos well no offense because you did a fine documentary on us mr lunan but youre not a stockholder lunan nodded i never asked you what you think about the preston sanders case the bartenders smile vanished im minded to brush up on my explosives its been years since i swore i was gonna be a lawandorder citizen you know but sanders is a hero and hes not being treated like one and thats wrong lunan nodded no surprises all the saints must feel that way better make this a double its wrong we cant let levoy shook himself he poured another generous ounce of calvados into lunans snifter okay tell me whats got you so jumpy at two in the morning that too is a secret and if i knew all of it i wouldnt be so jumpy or maybe i would maybe i would the jacuzzi barbara thought suddenly we wouldnt have to be young

regularly not really privacy no security knows some of them use it too you no ive been invited twice she spoke part of a name and stopped i dont like this art said we can cut millie out of the circuit sure im giving away too many secrets but art shouldnt we get to know each other good question ancient question i dont feel dutybound do you we opted for some privacy in living arrangements if the link is too uncomfortable she nodded asshole dutybound i are we still linked eekl sorry art he chuckled price of telepathy with telepathy we could give each other pictures sensations memories a great sunset a japanese bath the night four of us lucked into a beef wellington at mon greflier it wasnt on the menu it was for a private party and the chef made more than he needed it was the best ive ever tasted but part of it was just knowing wed lucked into something how would a machine transmit that its harclly a sensation at all i wonder if well ever have real telepathy tony would know why did you

damn complicated oh it actually went like this no i only did it once fun while it was happening but they werent very bright people and afterward two of the men kept bugging me im sorry i did it i was curious with real telepathy you could show me ill show you she ran her fingers up his thigh and he responded just pretend im six different women i think you probably are the table in the next room opened and sprouted a tray art went for the drinks he handed a pink lady across the bed and said now its really official the bartender knows they touched glasses art wondered youve never been married have you why not too hmm what kind of a man should i have married how would i know that she spoke aloud i try to describe him and i get contradictions a househusband how would i respect him an ambitious type like me but who runs our life who takes care of the kids and buys the groceries a houseful of servants or the service department of todos santos no kid could be lonely or in danger in todos santos she nodded to herself then suddenly looked him in the eye shall we he thought about it kids love it in todos santos the way cheryl drinkwater talked about the daycare center either of us could raise a kid here if we split up or one of us died get him a link to millie at eight or ten yeah one the only child usually has problems nope youre right here its one big family shed be okay im not so sure about the computer link age fifteen maybe she we could choose the sex we could but lets not lets gamble and ill get my birth control implant taken out tomorrow hah then were just wasting our time right now she rubbed up against him all i get is complaints ive been wasting time all right jesus what ive been missingl no dont stop do you like this fingernails scratching lightly in a circular motion just above her buttocks like it against their mastoid bones a shrill buzzing and they were rolling in opposite directions invaders art panted running for the chair where hed flung his clothes i knew it those kids were just a test run and they didnt even know it well have to speak to them about their timing harshly he stopped with his pants in his fist not too harshly damn i dont want to kill anyone millie phone link with security and tell sandra ill be at the worry desk in four minutes xvii the more technological sophistication we have attained the more destructive we have become humans are destructive in proportion to their supposition of abundance if they are faced with an infinite abundance then they become infmitely destructive wendell berry author of continuous harmony save the minotaur let me in dammit tony rand shouted whos the duty officer here this time this time it ticked through his head like the sound of a clock he couldnt think what to do with his hands and he stamped in impatience this time what was keeping them this time nobody would die this is captain vito hamilton my apologies but youll have to wait a momentah positive identification ill open the door now mr rand the door opened he dashed into the security control room the quiet calm of uniformed men at work calmed him too a little although there were signs that the guards took this seriously captain hamilton was standing not sprawled in an easy chair and many of the peripheral screens had doubled crews one screen showed a map of the underground service areas of todos santos with moving red blips in one of the tunnels below it was a screen entirely dark rand went over to it glancing at the name of the guard lieutenant sitting there he pointed to the screen whats this blake blake didnt turn around paint they spraypainted the camera before we even knew they were in the complex howd they get in near as we can tell they blew a hole through a wall separating the sewer lines from maintenance access tunnel b rand pursed his lips silently they should have been detected in that sewer detected long before they got near b i need a vacant console use this one a guard said he stood to give his chair to tony rand punched in ifie names file not found the screen said file not found file not found okay thats one of the problems tony muttered detection information never got ified how many bandits five we think the captain said from behind rand millie deduced that from the audio five one definitely female two carrying a heavy object sounds like theyre serious i take it you havent seen them only one theyre screwing up most of our electronics again and they seem to know exactly where the tv eyes are ah there we go watch a screen showed an opening fire door a shadowy figure came through bulky rounded snouted aliens aboard my starship the figure came directly toward them raised arm hiding snouted face and aimed something at the camera the screen went dark knew right where to go again hamilton said yeah rand muttered sourly right where to go but this time whos in charge of this operation ive been acting in command with sandra wyatt sitting in mr bonners office bonner is just getting to his station tony picked up a phone get bonner for me he waited art tony rand im down in security let me handle this there was a significant pause okay you dont mind if i watch over your shoulder would it stop you never mind thanks right ill tell hamilton if you need help just holler the phone went dead rand smiled faintly then turned back the screen retch gas use that in tunnel all chambers he said and get some people down to he thought for a moment calling up a picture of the tunnel complexc have them go west through and north through manually locking all the fire doors and report on the phone as they get each one locked on the phone not through millie and i want one of your people to keep track of their progress on a paper map gotthat yes sir hamilton said crisply you think millies compromised i know damned well millies compromised tony said he felt a tight knot in his stomach as he thought about what hed seen camera locations known the thickness of the wall between the sewer and b had been known and millie couldnt remember that she was supposed to monitor traffic in that sewer there werent many people who could know all that and fiddle with millies programming somebody was a traitorprobably somebody on tonys own staff he fished in his pants pockets hamilton i need a file folder i left it at the guard desk in the mall one of the lockers heres the key send someone who can run hamilton was doing something about those orders but tony ignored it nobody knew everything about the new defenses except rand himself he called up ifies found them logged and working the bandits hadnt chosen their route in it had been forced on them by what they knew and what they didnt back to the tracking programs how were the bandits doing aha tony thought lets try this he began to type orders the refrain grew in his mind this time this time captain hamilton was surprised to see that the chief engineer was grinning the five were sweating inside their wet suits one reached for the zipper down his chest the man next to him slapped at his hand glaring behind the snout of his mask they were all jogging even the trailing two who were carrying a box between them those two stopped reeling panting then began jogging again their breathing was stertorous and they stumbled frequently sounds like cheynestokes breathing doesnt it rand was grinning like a wolf theyll start to fall over any minute what did you do to them blake asked well i figured the next bunch of invaders would be in something like wet suits in case we used vx again were not we really did obey that court order rand nodded this time this time butsir i got the impression that we still had war gasses rand nodded happily so did a lot of people and no wonder since i spread that rumor myself so did the bandits and theyre coming in through the tunnels and carrying gear to foul up our electronic detection systems and carrying bombs or whatever a lot to carry i never heard of anyone carrying an airconditioning unit to a burglary me neither blake said he glanced at captain hamilton so tony said i put some quartz radiant heaters along those tunnels to sort of enhance the effect now ill bleed some air from the turbine heat exchangers into the ventilating system for the tunnels damn i wish the cameras were working id like to see if they open their suits he grinned widely plainly enjoying himself this time at least i can talk to them theyre coming to another interesting area new construction the leader said look for new construction here how the fuck do we do that sherry demanded she was a big burly woman even without her equipment and she was panting hard its all new construction now what do we do then did the court magicians voice boom hollowly through the tunnel return to your former lives none but the immortal cthulhu may pass here the leader shook his head the snout of his mask moving from side to side like an anteaters trunk fuck off he shouted to the others he said we hope this is it put some charges here and get back out of the way he glanced at his watch we havent got much time rand listened to the aliens and muttered curses just where are they planning to blast he demanded i dont know but im clearing my men out of all the adjacent areas hamilton said yeah do that we plastered new cement all over everything down there with any luck theyll blow the wrong wall several wrong walls the explosion overloaded the microphones which momentarily went silent then two screens lit nope northeast wall rand said they got some power lines millie can compensate for most of that but we better tell the residents already done bonners voice said from the speaker now what we get to see where theyre going rand said he waited then grinned mirthlessly okay hamilton i need your people to go down tunnel closing the fire doors we can cut them off from their way in will they care rand shrugged you werent supposed to ask that he watched as another screen came active a bulky figure advanced spray can in hand and the screen went dark but a moment later the one beside it lit it showed five shapes in profile dull black bulky sexless vaguely humanoid by god bonners voice said you have another pickup sure tony said in fact boss i have three more in there fives a critical area this time god i wish i could remember which people know about which cameras if i had an implant if i had an implant tony thought id be getting false data from millie read directly into my mind just this once im glad i dont so try to remember was it alice who knew about camera tunnel the invaders went forward through the tunnels alma get your ass in gear get moving the leader shouted there was no answer almas face was tomato colored her eyelids were almost closed showing white every gasping breath sounded like her last christ shes had it sherry said leave her you goddam bitch shes one of us shut up the leader said sherrys right we have to keep moving get almas gear and come on reese hesitated then ran the zipper on her wet suit all the way down now she might live if the saints didnt use war gas they lost one hamilton said ones down right tony rand said with considerable triumph one down and four to go get that one and take it up to mister bonner ah search it first and well leave the camera on it till your men get there hamilton said im not incompetent mr rand and im not tactful can you live with it no answer rand watched the invaders progress through tunnel there were enough pickup cameras in the tunnel to track the four as they moved along one ahead two following with the heavy box and one last who shouted orders the security room door eased open the entering guard was a woman looking still in her teens and lean as a snake she must have made olympic time down to the mall and back but she was barely panting as she handed a yellow manila envelope to hamilton who passed it to rand tony spilled the contents across the desk in one smooth motion then tried to sort them while watching three screens it wasnt working he had to look down he fished out a page and said hah nobody commented tony shuffled through the notes handwritten barely legiblefound another page and said right get me mr bonner dropped the papers and went back to watching you go on sherry said her meaty face glowed in the orange light reflections off water as if shed just stepped out of a very hot shower i cant go any farther get your ass up the leader shouted put that mask back on go to hell sherry said but she said it from the floor gavin and reese picked up her gear the box was lighter now thats two rand said with glee this time a hundred eighty degrees in there well get them all before its over and well get them alive this time he watched as the invaders moved across the screen through fire doors onward toward the central core of todos santos you cant let them get much farther along that way bonners voice said yeah i know that rand answered hang on hell when will the others drop he looked up to hamilton captain give em more knockout gas those masks cant be comfortable yes sir the guard captain continued to stare at the screen all right tony said i guess it wouldnt hurt if you put some of your armed people down there in tunnels and sort of parallel to these yoyos hamilton nodded eagerly then began speaking orders into his headset microphone bravo go delta go now they took one more turn stopped then went unerringly to the tv camera the screen blanked momentarily then came on from another angle as tony activated the alternate pickup damn tony muttered not much question about it now art our mole is alice strahier what do we do about her dont know yet you sure i mapped it she knew about camera in tunnel she didnt know about the radiants and neither did the bandits but she was supposed to enter a monitor program and she didnt and now theyve knocked out a new camera she knew of and didnt get one i never told her about ive got another double check coming up but its her your assistant yeah art she may not be guilty of anything but talking to the wrong person shes a nice okay ill deal with alice bonner said quickly yeah tony thought but she never blabbed innocently not in that much detail hell bonners voice came on again now just what are you going to do about those jokers down there i hate to remind you but theyre getting close to the turbines and mhd systems and if they zap one of those weve had it yeah i got the picture rand said but is that what theyre after last time it was start a big fire uhuh last time it was fake a big fire tony its the turbines they dont really want to kill lots of people bad publicity they want to make todos santos too expensive to run believe it theyre after the turbines on screen the bandits were still moving toward the turbines they were slow in a turtles race with heatstroke and tony had one more surprise for them before their route was clear but after that what now wait send in hamiltons swat teams god knows hes got eager enough troops tony looked up and saw that everyone in the room was staring at him waiting for orders my orders o pres i never really realized what you went through he looked up at the screens the bandits had found the jog where hed fiddled with a wall now they were moving on on the next screen over the second bandit to collapse bad moved out of view damn two parties to keep track of now hamilton send a squad through tunnel south of the turbines in and keep them south of there yes sir this time tony heard hamilton murmuring orders delta team to tunnel automatic weapons full body armor as long as they can stand the heat what happens in art bonners voice asked from the speaker i have another surprise for them tony said he tried to sound confident this time this time the corridor had angled slightly left everything down here looked like new construction but that jog wasnt on the map but what could they do if they left the map they went on pacing off their distances until gavin said here reese and lovin kept going staggering with the bomb box gavin shrieked here he could barely hear himself too many concussions they stopped set the box down a moment for heavy breathing then they were setting up the plastique lovin inserted the wire and they staggered back down the corridor the explosion slammed their eardrums gavin decided he was deaf it wouldnt matter none of them had really expected to live through this they went back to where they had set off the blast there was a shallow crater in the wall but it still stood reese screamed something inaudible gavin shook his head they began to set another charge bigger this time reese suddenly stopped then pulled his zipper down to his groin in one convulsive motion gavin tried to shake him reese pulled away and ran flinging his mask away then the top of his wet suit that wall surprised them tonys grin showed sick fear behind it i didnt just beef up the wall i put frangible disks in it and water behind to absorb the shock and the other walls reflected the shock wave back at them the bandits were running back down the corridor i keep hoping theyll run out of explosives did you find the second bandit yet first one must have reached medical by now second one tried to go back the way they came found himself blocked no camera but he doesnt seem to be moving well have him in a minute the camera view was suddenly opaque with smoke and dust it cleared gradually light from corridor glowed through a thighsized hole in four feet of wall one more blast and theyre through tony said why are they doing this hamilton i only see two of them do you have another camera back there maybe if i can remember tony tapped at keys and a screen lit the third bandit showed clear curled up with his back to a wall stripped naked with face set in anguish and his hands over his ears a gun lay a good distance away the remaining bandits ran into view and one seemed shocked at his companions condition the other clicked something with his thumb while he tried to cover both ears with his other hand and arm dust blew toward them on the other screen the hole in the wall was comfortably larger thats tunnel tony said no one commented everyone in the room knew was the crucial area have you got your squad in theyre there hamilton said dunhill you ready theyre in place get them clear for a moment ive got one last trick but its dangerous anaesthetic darts this time stoppit he typed rapidly file not found file not found goddamn it he shouted never mind i can rewrite the program tony typed rapidly watching two screens at once thankful for the touchtyping course his father had made him take in high school one of the bandits eased through the hole in the wall the two wrestled their box through then the second followed theyre after the turbines lieutenant blake said if they get those blake hamilton said the guard lieutenant fell silent so what happens if they do get the turbines tony asked himself nobody gets killed but the cost and it would be a message to the saints too many people hate you too fervently you cant run todos santos economically because well keep ruining your expensive equipment youll go broke you have to quit sooner or later why not now well would the money men in zurich actually shut down todos santos if it became that expensive to run theyd certainly not build any more arcologies nor would anyone else not when it was clear the arcologies couldnt defend themselves and dammit if todos santos goes broke then it cant run any longer expenses expenses expenses its property rights against human rights money against lives tony thought bleakly and im defending the money im defending my city did alice know about your darts bonners voice asked ive been trying to remember he recalled boasting about the darts but to whom never mind nothing else to do anyway he waited until they were both in corridor then hit the return key on his console lovin and gavin straightened up with the mass of the explosives box pulling them down and a dozen explosions burst from the walls gavin found himself in fetal position his cheek on hot con crete it would be so easy to lie there to wait soon theyd come and take him where it was cool no he stood up patting himself and found himselfbristhng with harts he sat up laughing entirely buzzed on fatigue poisons adrenalin and dehydration lovin looked like a porcupine as he rolled over and stood up they spent a minute pulling darts off each other in handfuls the points might work through the metal mesh imbedded between the thick layers of their wet suits there wasnt a chance of their hearing each other explosives had rendered them deaf but even through the deafness they could hear the roar of the todos santos turbines they picked up the box and staggered toward the sound armor hamilton said i wonder just how good that armor is tony leaned back in his chair im out of tricks he said damn alice he turned to hamilton stop them but that wasnt enough and he knew it this time but tony was never happy with euphemisms or imprecise language dont let them reach the turbines stop them even if you have to kill them xvii to us heaven switches on daylight or turns on the showerbath we little gods are gods of the machine only it is our highest our cosmos is a great engine and we die of ennui a subtle dragon stings us in the midst of plenty d h lawrence theres another one sergeant gomez said he pointed to the daygb sticker think of it as evolution in action gomez read aloud i think i counted a dozen on the way here yeah hal donovan said im getting a little tired of them myself he looked around the tunnel complex find anything gomez shrugged it looked jerky nothing the ts cops didnt tell us wed find whats got you so nervous you think its a setup naw thats not it how are we going to find anything if we keep getting lost if the guards just turned us loose in here i dont think wed ever get out the saints keep having to lead us around by the hand lieutenant donovan nodded again i get a touch of it myself well tough it out keep stirring things around ill go get their official story there were only two men in the interview room donovan frowned one was wearing the uniform of a captain of the todos santos guards the otherdonovan had no trouble at all recognizing the youngish man in the thousanddollar threepiece suit hed seen him often enough in court the man stood and extended his hand im john shapiro he said general counsel for todos santos of course they had their lawyer in the interview room donovan felt that he ought to resent that but he couldnt really blame the saints i asked to see all the todos santos police involved in the shootout donovan said yes the uniformed captain said but i was in charge and id like to go over the story with you before letting you have at my men donovan grimaced slightly these goddam sensitive saints hell captain were all cops i wish it were that simple shapiro said in any event we are ready to cooperate with you as fully as possible he sat down and opened a steno notebook donovan chuckled and looked around the room if shapiro needed to take notes donovan was next in line to be pope he saw no point in saying so youre captain hamilton then you were in charge i was the senior officer of todos santos security hamilton said which is not quite the same thing hal donovan said who was really running the show the police took my orders hamilton said no one elses no point in pushing that just now donovan decided all right captain suppose you tell me in your own words what happened ill do better than that hamilton said he pointed to a tv screen imbedded in the far wall of the room ill show you a lot of it the story went as donovan expected intruders got into ts by blowing their way through a wall the saints used a variety of nonlethal weapons to try to stop them nothing worked and finally the gadgets failed as they always did and some cops had to put their arses on the line and that always happened too the screen showed two policemen with rifles and a third with a bullhorn crouched behind some kind of portable barricade they were in tunnels and the sound track conveyed the rumble of machinery the picture stopped freezing that instant of time they were approaching the turbines hamilton said wed already tried the darts they had armor there was nothing to stop them from doing a hundred million dollars worth of damage and after what wed seen we knew damned well thats what they wanted to do and we knew they had explosives you sure did donovan agreed the tv drama came back to life you are under arrest the bullhorn blared throw down your weapons and for gods sake lets go where its cool the intruders came doggedly toward the camera dunhill gave them another chance hamilton said the ts cop with the bullhorn stood surrender he shouted the leading intruder held out a revolver and fired the two ts cops with rifles returned the fire at full automatic a loud stutter of smallcaliber highvelocity weaponry the leading bandit began to fall then there was an explosion dead man switch on his explosives we think hamilton said i see the scene went on showing messy details donovan sat down hard theres a little more hamilton said the tv picture dissolved then came up to show a burly woman naked except for panties she was holding a big webley revolver in both hands almost in a parody of the official police grip the pistol waved back and forth she was too tired to hold it steady hamilton said the woman fired several times the picture didnt show what she was shooting at i had four guards in good body armor about thirty meters away from her hamilton said they didnt think she could hurt them so they didnt shoot back eventually the woman in the picture sat heavily on the ground a halfdozen saints in bulgy swat uniforms appeared they grabbed her and handcuffs flashed thats it hamilton said donovan nodded the difference being that she didnt have any explosives i suppose hamilton said all right ive seen it now can i talk to your men hamilton and shapiro looked at each other certainly shapiro said of course you wont mind if captain hamilton and i stay here i should mind donovan thought but what would be the point fine lets get this done after the interviews donovan went back to the tunnels and let gomez lead him through the route the intruders had taken theyd cleaned up some in the final tunnel which was just as well even so donovan didnt think hed want any lunch after an hour he had seen enough he left the todos santos underground complex whistling again at the sight of the large holes blasted in one of the concrete walls there were guards at every fire door in the tunnels and the elevator door was opened for him by two more uniformed todos santos guards they looked blankly at donovan but they didnt say anything hell its not my fault donovan said its homicide and we have to investigate sure last time you jailed mr sanders the younger guard said who this time officer dunhill lieutenant blake captain hamilton or maybe somebody higher up can it prentice the older guard said the lieutenants just doing a job he cant help it if they put him in charge the younger guards lips tightened donovan was glad when they reached the executive floor and he could get away from them in charge he thought as he paced down the thickly carpeted corridor it is to laugh ho ho the mayor sends maclean stevens councilman planchet has two field deputies here the da and the coroner both come in person and then theyve got the goddam nerve to tell me im in charge hoo ha donovan smiled at the receptionist and got an answering look that made him feel really welcome debores anthony rand had called her a nice name too bad ill never get to meet her off duty she waved him into arthur bonners office and donovan wondered about that for a moment before he realized that with the setup they had here shed known he was coming long before he got to her anteroom she could have told bonner while he was in the corridor a good setup didnt have to keep people waiting bonner was at his desk and maclean stevens was pacing in front of it keep m at home mac bonner was saying before we have to kill a lot more of them yeah great image see todos santos and die you dont have a city youve got the anteroom to the morgue thats about enough i surely agree stevens said if you mean enough dead kids goddamn it with all their gear and a spy in my headquarters dammit art am i supposed to restrict the sale of wet suits donovan cleared his throat stevens turned stared at him for a moment and said find anything new no sir donovan said and we wont that seems a strange attitude for a homicide investigation donovan laughed investigation with all respect mr stevens whats to investigate we can look at the bodies we can stick our fingers in the bullet holes and we can talk to people then what the saints rentacops say this bunch broke in they shoota the guns they banga the bombs so the saints shoot back which god knows theyre entitled to do and the kids get hurt and some get dead you can make certain it really happened that way stevens said yes sir you doubt us mac bonner asked its really come to that whether i doubt you or not a lot of people will stevens said and theyll want proof one way or another which we cant get donovan said mr stevens well go over all the evidence well interview all the witnesses but no matter what we do mr bonners people are as smart as we are and theyve had plenty of time to set the stage if thats what they wanted so when its all done its going to come out the thing went down the way they said they tried everything they could and eventually they sent in their swat people the bandits shot it out and lost you have any reason to doubt that it happened that way lieutenant art bonner asked donovan shook his head if i did i wouldnt be talking like this no sir im sure it all went as your people say it did good bonner said so why are your detectives poking into every corner of our defenses donovan shrugged youre charging the survivors right we have to gather evidence yeah bonner said he gave stevens a sour look of course your cops have their normal share of curiosity speaking of prisoners are you ready to take custody of them i can send for some troops bonners office was filled with police when tony rand came in lapd da s men deputy sheriffs even a marshal from the federal district court all waiting expectantly until colonel cross and five todos santos guards brought in their prisoners they were both women the male prisoner had collapsed from heat exhaustion and would be taken by ambulance to the prison ward of county hospital tony rand stared at the women unashamedly it was the first time hed seen them without their protective equipment and masks something wrong with me fat boy one asked yes tony said you want to burn down my city thats the court magician the other woman said he designed this place the chief technologist so now hes here with the pigs enough one of the policemen came forward youre under arrest you have the right to remain silent you have the right to consult an attorney if you cannot afford an attorney of course we gave them their rights earlier on colonel cross announced he seemed annoyed that anyone would doubt it it never hurts to repeat it a federal marshal said sounds just like tv doesnt it sherry dont worry officer well go quietly what are we charged with suspicion of homicide the policeman said wow thats a heavy trip sherry said we didnt kill anybody their pigs killed our friends your friends were killed during the commission of a felony the los angeles policeman said that makes anyone involved in that felony an accomplice to homicide you should discuss this with your attorney not with me gomez take them out yes sir the uniformed policeman came forward and expertly handcuffed each of the women then with two policewomen and half a dozen other police he escorted them out of bonners office theres one more bonner said but i thought you might want to keep them separated colonel yes sir colonel cross said he spoke into a microphone attached to his lapel and a moment later a guard led alice into the room despite the police who had left with sergeant gomez there were half a dozen left alice blinked as she looked at each face when her eyes met tonys they fell quickly the la officer came forward again alice strahler youre under arrest you have the right to remain silent you have alice listened to the entire miranda warning without comment tony rand couldnt stand it any longer why he asked alice why she shook her head i trusted you yes sir alice said so did a lot of people people who got killed tony said youdamn you you made us kill people you made pres sanders into a basket case and thats not fair alice said you know i cant talk about any of that not here with all these police pres did tony said and i still dont understand you you worked here you knew what we were building that people like it here we dont pollute we you dont live like humans either alice said and even if you call this human life its not for very many people todos santos is beautiful tony but it uses too many resources to support too few people the more successful todos santos is the worse it will be for everyone else dont you understand that dont you understand that technology is not the answer that using technology to fix problems created by technology only puts you in an endless chain that the more success you have the more you make people believe that progress is possible and progress just leads to more technology and more waste and more doom alice you wear glasses tony said mildly you probably use tampons one thing i do understand art bonner said you gave us good reason to trust you we believed you and you betrayed us im sorry your friends were killed but im not sorry they can charge you with murder murder damn of course she was in the conspiracy and that led to murder and conspiracy eventually the outsiders left tony turned to go a moment of your time bonner said yeah there are a lot of cops wandering around here bonner said like a wellsmoked beehive and reporters and everyone else all looking at us tony nodded yeah ive been meaning to catch some sleep but its interesting you wont get a chance to sleep bonner said ive been reviewing your plan to get sanders out of jail i like it tony eyed him warily it seems to me this is a good time bonner said while everyones watching us you did say weekend and this is saturday oh shit oh dear tony thought but we dont need to not after this everybody will know we really need defenses what happened today wont change the fact that the kids pres killed were carrying nothing more deadly than sand and paint this may make it easier to get a jury to acquit him but hell still have put in a year in jail before its over and pres have you asked him about this tony demanded bonner ignored the question your plan needs some advance preparations bonner said as near as i can figure if you start now we can be ready tonight at lightsout any reason why you cant get to it conspiracy tony said and if anyones killed its honiicide so dont kill anyone youve already made up your mind tony i dont have to wheedle you so lets cut the crap and get at it we both have work to do tony nodded in submission xviii when we jumped into sicily the units became separated and i couldnt find anyone eventually i stumbled across two colonels a major three captains two lieutenants and one rifleman and we secured the bridge never in the history of war have so few been led by so many general james gavin executive action george harris had learned to disconnect his mind during heavy exercise if he thought about the pain or the fatigue or the monotony hed stop his body followed the routine while his mind daydreamed or planned business strategy or slept but on saturdays and sundays shut away from his weights and machines and confined by concrete and iron bars he had to improvise a routine that took concentration it took more concentration to ignore a distraction the sadeyed ghost in the upper bunk twentynine thirty harris rested for a few seconds waiting until his breathing slowed before he spoke a harmless vanity then i wish to hell youd join me youre in good shape what were you doing on the outside skiing surfing youre not doing it now in here ive never seen you do anything but lie there and eat your liver preston sanders didnt look up his arms were behind his head his eyes were on the ceiling that raid last night has to help your case harris said they had real bombs and the tv said there was a shootout guns and everything this wasnt just kids out playing tricks still nothing now theres demonstrations all over the city fromates and a lot of outfits named citizens for this and that want to burn todos santos to the ground and sow salt where it stood funny thing though there are counterdemonstrators nothing organized but more than youd expect george went into his situps the patrolling guard stopped for a minute to watch then moved on on previous weekends hed made witty comments until george called him butterball every time he passed and then every felon in the block took it up and now the guard generally didnt say anything thirty george stood and went to the bunks you lie there long enough and youll turn to butter he told sanders jesus youre younger than i am can you do thirty pushups l o itd take your mind off whats eating you sanders it is impossible to think about what a jury will do to you when youre on your twentyfifth pushup and going for thirty try it with me sanders shook his head he was the least troublesome cellmate george harris had ever had more he was a potential customer even if he did turn off whenever george tried to swing the conversation around to new construction in todos santos i guess i brought it up too early george thought too bad but maybe thatll change if i can get him to talk at all and thats tough enough they didnt identify the raiders yet harris said but that commentator guy lunan said they were an outfit calling itself the american ecology army thats a splinter group that broke away from the fromates years ago but lunan says the two outfits still work together he sounded real sure i read everything i can about it what with being in here with you besides i knew the planchet kid that got sanderss attention i never did what was he like harris shrugged nice enough i guess personable maybe a little shy i only met him twice i could have liked him except i heard about a stunt he pulled in high school never mind the point is he was a total damned fool and he died for it he didnt die he was killed yeah sure but he worked at it hey you know youre a hero back in todos santos yeah no kidding i went to the big brothers lunch out there last week i always liked those yeah i can see why quite a blast i won a pocket computer in the raffle anyway when they found out i was your cellmate everybody wanted me to give you the same message you done good who sanders asked art bonner yeah he was one of them some others too i didnt get everybodys name and tony rand harris looked sidewise at sanders hes a strange one isnt he he can be sanders said tonys about the best friend i have out there oh i can see how you could like that guy a lot once you got to know him anyway theyre all on your side sanders its dumb to lie there eating your liver you got paid to do a job and when the time came you earned your salary you dont need to hear that from a jury think of it as evolution in action what did you say harris laughed i saw it on he stopped listened then he said get down from there i mean it sit on the lower bunk i think he listened again feel that i think theres a quake coming he tugged at sanderss arm and sanders came down he wasnt that soft he didnt drop he lowered himself by the strength of his arms harris said you feel it not a jolt just shaking like a preliminary temblor everythings vibrating i feel it i hear something too it was right at the threshold of sound but it went on steadily machinery somewhere sanders said youre not from california are you earthquakes cant be heard coming wtha oh too bad harris considered going into deep knee bends but by damn hed finally got sanders talking and he wasnt going to stop what i saw was a bumper sticker raise the speed limit think of it as evolution in action sanders smiled i can guess who said that first it had to be tony rand really i wouldnt have guessed that i mean i didnt get to talk to him very long but i was impressed meeting the guy that built the nest aaargh wrong word it had just slipped out in haste harris continued whats he really like a good friend sanders said he didnt used to worry much about social relationships politics anything like that now hes eating his liver like you said hes losing sleep because maybe he could have designed todos santos so i wouldnt have to do that sanders shuddered and harris was suddenly afraid there would be histrionics but sanders said quietly maybe hes keeping me sane damn id love to blame it all on tony rand and i know he never thought of that i know it thats the nice part court magician harris said thats what they called him on the tv documentary anyway and ive got you talking now only a miracle could have captured harriss attention at that moment the miracle was a tiny hole that formed suddenly in the concrete floor just where harriss eyes rested george slid off the bunk and crouched to look he poked at the hole with his finger it was real sanders asked what are you doing damndest thing harris said he thought he saw light through the hole but when he bent closer to look there was only darkness and a trace of a strange mustily sweet smell orange blossoms i saw this little tiny he said and fell over the vehicle tony rand was driving was longer than four cadillacs and shaped roughly like a long rifle cartridge thick hoses in various colors some as thick as tonys torso trailed away down the tunnel and out of sight the visibility ahead was poor the top speed was contemptible the mileage would have horrified a cadillac owner it wasnt even quiet water poured through the blue hoses live steam blasted back down the red hoses hydrogen flame roared softly ahead of the cabin heated rock snapped and crackled and cool air hissed in the cabin for so large a vehicle the cabin was cramped stuck onto the rear almost as an afterthought it was cluttered with the extra gear tony rand had brought with him so that thomas lunan had to sit straddling a large redpainted tank and regulator there were far too many dials to watch the best you could say for the mole was that unlike your ordinary automobile it could drive through rock so were driving through rock lunan thought and giggled the blunt rounded nose of the mole was white hot rock melted and flowed around the nose flowed back as lava until it reached the watercooled collar where it froze the congealed rock was denser then compressed into a fine tunnel wall with a flat floor lunan was sweating why did i get into this i cant get any pix and i cant ever tell anybody i was here where are we lunan asked he had to shout about ten feet to go rand said how do you know inertial guidance system rand said he pointed to a blue screen which showed a bright pathway that abruptly became a dotted line were right here tony said he pointed to the junction of dot and solid line you trust that thing its pretty good rand said hell its superb it has to be you dont want to put a tunnel in the wrong place lunan laughed lets hope they want a tunnel here yeah rand fell silent after a while he adjusted a vent to increase the cool air flowing through the cabin despite the air flow and the cabin insulation lunan was sweating there was no place to hide none at all if anyone suspected what they were doing they had only to follow the hoses to the end of the blind tunnel were here rand said noise levels fell as rand turned down the hydrogen jets he looked at his watch then lifted the microphone dangling from the vehicles dashboard art here my computations tell me im either under press cell or just offshore from nome alaska you dont have to keep me entertained the voice blurred and crackled no eavesdropper could have sworn that art bonner was speaking to the soontobenotorious felon anthony rand a nice touch lunan thought no sir tony said as far as we can tell you hit it just right the radio said theyre still at dinner or all the months of tunnel drilling around here got them used to the noise whatever anyway we dont hear any signs of alert good rand said he put down the microphone and turned to lunan now we wait four hours lunan had carefully prepared for this moment he took a pack of cards from his pocket and said casually gin it was ninethirty in the evening and vinnie thompson couldnt believe his good fortune hed been hoping for a decent score later some guy coming back from winning a big bet on the hockey game at the forum or maybe a sailor with a months pay this early there probably wouldnt be much but there might be somebody with bread although most angelinos were smart enough not to carry much into the subway system of course theyd carry money in the todos santos stations but everybody in vinnies line of work learned early to stay away from there the ts guards might or might not turn you in to the la cops but more important they might hurt you a lot they didnt like muggers at all maybe tonight hed get a break he needed one he hadnt hit a good score in two weeks then he saw his vision a man in a threepiece suit an expensive suit with alligator shoes the vision carried a briefcase and he was not only alone hed gone through a door into a maintenance tunnel and there sure as hell wasnt anybody in that tunnel this time of night what could mr threepiece want take a pee meet somebody while he was wondering about that by god here she came a hell of a looker well dressed in an expensive pantsuit and she was alone too she went in the same door as threepiece and vinnie snickered shed get a surprise once again he congratulated himself heaven couldnt offer more attractions shed locked the door behind her but it didnt take vinnies knife long to take care of that he went through quickly and pulled the door closed the corridor in front of him was empty but he could hear rapid heelclicks around the bend ahead of him he could also hear sounds of machinery coming from down the tunnel somebody was working overtime here well that didnt matter hed just have to be quick although that was a shame the chick was a real looker and itd be something to get into that he could imagine her look of fear and feel her writhing in his grasp and he quickened his step to catch up to her shed be just around this bend in the tunnel he rounded the bend there were half a dozen people there all in expensive clothes they looked up at him first in surprise then in annoyance too many vinnie thought but they looked like money and he had his knife and a blackjack made of a leather bag of bbs and if he did this rightfeet scuffed behind him he was trying to turn to run when a bomb exploded under his jaw lights flared behind his eyes but through the blaze he saw his vision again fluffy razorcut hair and a broad smoothshaven face snarling with even white teeth and a polished gold ring on a huge fist gin rand said thats thirtyfive million dollars you owe me he stared at his watch and now we go to work lunan grimaced so far they hadnt done anything well nothing that would send you to prison god knows what crime it might be to dig a tunnel under the county jail but so far no harm done now though rand handed him a heavy tool and lunan took it automatically it was a large drifi with a long thin bit trickling sweat stung his eyes rand was sweating too and after a moment the engineer removed his shirt damn delores he muttered eh oh nothing rand threw his shirt down the tunnel then he lifted the microphone were starting in now he said everything all right at your end yeah barring three surprised muggers have at it roger rand hung up the mike and turned to lunan okay lets get at it he took a strip of computer readout from the con sole in front of him then manipulated controls a very bright spot of light appeared on the tunnel roof above them drill right there rand said the ceiling was concrete very rough lunan thought the drill bit too thin and weak for the job but when he applied it and pulled the trigger the drill ate in quickly and quietly lunan noticed after a while the bit went in all the way rand took the drill and changed to a longer bit my turn he said what do i do lunan asked just stand by rand drilled at the ceiling when the bit was all the way in he took out still another this one a foot long still very thin he drilled cautiously withdrawing the bit often then he saw light and pointed mask time rand said lunan handed up a gas mask then put on his own the hole in the ceiling was no more than a pinprick which was what rand had told lunan to expect when he had his mask on properly lunan went over to a large red tank there was a hose attached to it and lunan handed up the hose and watched as rand put it to the hole and sealed it in place with aluminized duct tape crack the valve rand said and lunan turned the valve handle there was a faint hissing rand pointed to the microphone phase two lunan said into the mike hope were in the right place all quiet here out the radio answered lunan replaced the mike quiet there which was the tunnel entrance just one entrance guarded by ts executives which meant lunan and rand were safe of course it also meant there was only one exit unless they wanted to dig a new one fleeing the law at a few dozen feet an hour rand waved and made cutting motions and lunan shut off the sleepy gas he worried about that gas rand said the stuff was the safest he could find unlikely to harm anyone except possibly a heart patient but there was no way they could control the dosages this was the trickiest part of the maneuver rand had removed the tube and widened the hole slightly now he was trying to insert the tiny thin periscope and cursing what lunan asked blocked rand said swearing terribly he moved two feet away and tried the drill again when light showed he inserted his periscope and looked he turned it this way and that then chuckled and motioned for lunan to come look concrete floor something overhead all very dark tom lunan adjusted the light amplillcation and rotated the periscope aha foreground a pair of feet showed under a very low ceiling he was under a bunk beyond a mouseseye view of a jail cell concrete floor toilet sink and a middleaged felon in fine physical shape sleeping peacefully on tony rands first periscope hole while tom looked rand brought up the gas tube and put it to the new hole body blocked the flow rand muttered and went back to open the valve on the tank he let it run another minute then disconnected the hose and brought up the periscope again meanwhile lunan had attached the electronic stethoscope to the floor he put on the earphones at highest sensitivity he could hear the sounds of breathing and a heartbeat otherwise nothing he made the ok sign to rand rand nodded and turned to the control console when he twisted dials a large jack ascended from the top of the vehicle and rose until it touched the ceiling another control sent up a large saw and spray hoses the saw began cutting in a circular pattern around the jack it wailed like a banshee lunan felt real terror surely someone would hear that the horrible rasping sound that proclaimed jailbreak evidently it worried rand too because he rigged up the tank and sent more sleepy gas through the hole the saw cut on a bias a concrete disk larger at the top than at the bottom eventually the cut was made and tony used the jack to lift the plug until it was two feet higher than the cell floor lunan helped him set up a newly bought aluminum stepladder rand scrambled up it and disappeared while lunan arranged thermarest air mattresses on the flat top of the vehicle then he climbed up squeezing under the concrete plug there was a moment of terror when he dislodged his gas mask but he got it back on without breathing preston sanders was on his side in the lower bunk with his feet hanging over the edge hed lost weight since lunan had seen him in a courtroom but he was still heavy they lifted him and rand slid down through the hole again leaving lunan to lower sanders down like a sack of potatoes with rand to catch him and let him down onto the mattresses now they had to work fast rand smeared the concrete plug with epoxy and lowered it into place then he filled the periscope holes while he did that lunan manhandled sanders into the cabin of the machine and thought about the origins of that picturesque verb manhandled yep got it rand said wont they be able to see the hole yeah sure i couldnt make the join perfect especially working from the bottombut theyll never get that plug out without jackhanimers and such lets get out of here get your shirt lunan said shit oh dear what else have we forgotten the ladder and the mattresses and thats okay rand said they cant be traced he chuckled well not profitably anyway hey im supposed to get the whole story youve got all the story rand said my instructions are to see you off before pres wakes up i make that to be about ten more minutes yeah all right lunan said so the adventure was coming to an end ye gods what hed seen the top brassthe top brassof todos santos involved in felony jailbreak not that he could tell anyone or even hint that he had certain knowledge rumor all rumors lunan sighed it was a hell of a story now all he had to do was figure out the best way to use it they drove away at the moles contemptible top speed pres woke up twenty minutes later he blinked and focused on tony rand stared for a moment and said we were just talking about you oh true whats going on where am i were roaring away in our trusty getaway vehicle seconds ahead of the law yeah i can hear the roaring anyway it matches my head pres pushed himself up and looked back down the tunnel good lord tony is it the digging machine the one thats making the subway under city hall shit are we really making our own tunnel the mole surged forward needles spun on the panel and the automatics cut off the hydrogen flow without melted rock to carry heat away from the nose the nose itself would melt halffused rubble slid past the cabin then the mole lurched into the open night tony lifted the microphone from the console panel were loose he put down the mike and turned to sanders grinning most of the time you were asleep we were running back along an alreadymade tunnel then just before you woke up we started boring again now come on you know pres we might actually make it sanders was still groggy but recovering where are we now did you really break me out of jail tony led him out of the mole and walked him through the night where was that stairway the ok corral will never be the same weve reached either the famed concrete banks of the los angeles river or the equally famous hoover dam depending ah there were the stairs we go up now you gonna just leave the digger jesus stay here tony sprinted back to the mole and came back uphill more slowly carrying his shirt and the gas cannister this could be traced the rest of that garbage was all bought today by creditcard number and telephone delivered to a blind drop it was charged to one professor arnold renn that might cause a bit of confusion renn hes fromate isnt he pres started to laugh art says he was the advisor to the planchet kid rand said oh sanders was silent a moment then laughed hey theyll think the fromates got me not for long they wont but it might slow down the opposition sanders stopped tony i dont like this much i meanyou broke me out of jail were both wanted by the law where can we go were going home i hope yeah butlook tony art must have put you up to this and dont think im not grateful but dammit art doesnt own todos santos he cant hide me forever the management council has to know and some of them dont like me somebodyll turn me in for sure his voice trailed off when he realized that rand was only half listening tony was trying to orient himself where the hell was the street where the hell was anything they stumbled onward then ahead car lights flashed twice and went dark thank god tony said come on pres just a little farther ah good they remembered to cut the fence here through right here and we go the rest of the way by taxi swallow your pride and climb in an ordinary yellow cab stood waiting for them the driver didnt speak sanders tumbled into the back seat still rubberlimbed and thrashed to right himself as tony tumbled in beside him and the taxi took off pres complained hey the speed limit my pride wouldnt take it if we got pulled in for reckless driving the cab slowed at once tony asked how do you feel fine no more headache no hangover sanders settled back in his seat i feel great of course theyll find us maybe not rand said the cabbie said where to sir and turned around mead frank mead did you think wed leave you for the eaters welcome home in a half hour youll be wolfing a midnight snack and drinking genuine scotch no brandys your drink right remy martin then frank mead sheeit i thought never mind what i thought listen tony if im awake now so is anyone else you dosed right itll take them awhile to get their act together tony said they wont know how you got out or where you went i sealed up the hole its a lockedroom mystery secret passage and all thats all right then sanders started laughing george harris woke with a mild headache and a feeling that something was wrong that was confinned when he heard the guards running up and down the corridors head count they were shouting everybody stand by your bunks pres what the hell is all this george demanded pres when there was no answer he looked around the cell jesus h christ he shouted now what and how had it happened he remembered the tiny hole hed seen and looked down at the floor but in the dim light he couldnt see anything at all should he tell the guards tell them what that his cellmate was missing to hell with those bastards but if he didnt cooperate theyd nail his arse to the wall george grinned faintly to himself and lay down on the lower bunk it wasnt hard at all to go back to sleep uh george woke to bright lights and a dozen deputies in his cell what wheres sanders whered he go the fat jailer shouted over and over uh pres tell these buzzards to buzz off where is he thatll do winsome mr harris i remind you that aiding an escape from lawful confinement is a felony now are you willing to cooperate sure george said excellent what can you tell us it was hard to keep from giggling but george managed a straight face nothing not one thing i went to sleep talking to preston sanders and i just woke up he rolled out of his bunk and looked into the upper bunk pres he lifted the blanket nothing shit fire hal hal its the telephone donovan came awake as from beneath a deep stagnant pond vaguely aware that carol was speaking to him gradually he understood okay honey thanks he took the phone and listened carol watched from her bed her blue negligee fell open and donovan winked at her his pretense was that she always turned him on she did often enough when he put the phone down and reached for his pants she looked resigned shed long since stopped asking questions hed either explain or he wouldnt not a new murder donovan said maybe not even my case but it was my prisoner even that didnt get a rise she looked at him expectantly even with interest but she wasnt asking questions preston sanders donovan said technically my case and my prisoner hes escaped from the county jail escaped great heavens harry how carol donovan demanded nobody seems to know just at present donovan said i suppose theyll find out so youre going down to the jail ill start there just to see how they did it how they did it sure i dont have to know what happened to know todos santos has made their move i just hope it doesnt mean allout war when donovan arrived at the county jail a team of workmen were breaking through the floor with jackhammers the officer in charge sheriffs captain oliver matson was an old friend one of matsons deputies handed donovan polaroids of the cell floor taken before the jackhaxnmers started there was a thin circular line showing clearly on the floor he went out that way all right the deputy said here a workman said hey watch out what is it matson asked its all hollow under there a tunnel tunnel donovan said of course there had to be a tunnel how else could sanders have got away but how had the tunnel got under the county jail holy shit what his friend demanded the digging machine the mole donovan shouted thats how they did it they dug a subway tunnel with the mole that big damned digging machine of theirsany minute now theyll report it stolen anybody want to bet they wont oh crap matson said jesus thats acting on the grand scale the workmen had the tunnel open deputies squeezed through and when they were out of the way donovan and matson followed no doubt about it matson said a new subway tunnel well we wont need bloodhounds to follow this trail donovan laughed but he thought they might as well get out the bloodhounds nothing else was going to catch sanders not just sanders he looked at the smoothsided tunnel walls just like magic he said which were looking for a magician in this case a court magician it was highly irritating to donovan that oliver matson hadnt seen the documentary donovan hated to explain jokes the meeting was in an apartment that showed on no maps of todos santos it would have taken twenty people with excellent measuring instruments the better part of a day merely to prove there was an apartment there finding the entrance and getting it open would take a lot longer most of the todos santos brass was there and tony rand basked in their approbation everything had gone well what about the other guy bonner asked press cellmate maybe you should have done him a favor whoooee sanders said he bellowed laughter jesus no art harris is only in there on weekends hed have screamed bloody murder to find out the cops are after him and he stopped laughing and the general mood of euphoria faded so what happens now several choices bonner said all of them reasonable how would you like my job thats silly not here bonner said and not an arcology but romulus has a lot of operations and the top slots open in one of them how do you feel about going to africa sanders lifted one eyebrow seems a long way to run bonner spread his hands well talk about it in the morning as i said its your choice you wouldnt have to go too far dont forget at the moment the police have no proof that you escaped you may be the victim of a kidnapping the grin or part of it returned to sanders do you really think we can pin it on the fromates frank mead snorted wouldnt want to would we we saved one of our own and id like it if everybody in the la basin knows it as long as they cant prove it he looked thoughtful we didnt actually put our autograph on anything unless tony would picasso refrain from signing his masterpiece sign it or not theyll guess art bonner said he giggled suddenly speaking of signing your work what barbara asked the muggers what should we do with the muggers kill the sons of bitches frank mead said hey no sanders yelled hey dont worry we wont bonner said frank didnt mean that anyway mead shrugged and massaged his fist he had bruises under his large ring and on two knuckles but there was a pensively happy smile on his face so what do we do with the meat heads where are they anyway in a dark room off medical bonner said i believe the technical term is under heavy sedation of course well have to let them go eventually they were bad dudes mead said hard on los angeles delores said nothing los angeles doesnt deserve but i had an idea should we be making decisions now barbara asked were all pretty soused good point sweetheart bonner said he went to her and took her hand lets go home oh tony yeah the la cops will want you for questioning id as soon they didnt find you delores came up and put her arm through tonys that answers one question she said tony frowned the question at her my place or yours we cant go to yours she said mine will be safe enough for a while she marched him out of the room xix they cannot commit treason nor be outlawed nor excommunicated for they have no souls sir edward coke lord chief justice of england suttons hospital case report retribution her position was odd and she was cold the sheets and blankets were twisted all to hell delores untangled them enough to pull them over her head feeling nice feeling sleepy would she be able to get back to sleep they hadnt slept much last night where was tony she heard the ting of room service delivery and smelled coffee coffee and unidentifiable breakfast smells suddenly her hunger was like teeth gnashing in her belly shorted on sleep theyd burned considerable energy last night the court magician had never before shown any such tendency toward satyriasis being a hero must make a man horny delores thought she sat up and called what have we got all kinds of things tony sounded cheerful and well he might melon blinis eggs benedict coffee and hot milk vodka right out of a freezer she came to see so little time so much to doshe tore into a thick wedge of honeydew melon and for a time there was si lence tony seemed as hungry as she was even sohombre well never eat all this which are blinis the pancakes right beluga caviar sour cream and a splash of hot butter between two buckwheat pancakes the iced vodka goes with the blinis if youve a mind whos gonna question my expense account on a day like today her spoon stopped moving your last day she looked up had he guessed he had lunan gave me too much publicity the angelino cops are sure to guess who did it where do you think theyll send me she cut into a blini while she considered art might send tony out with pres sanders they got along or it hit her as she raised the fork to her mouth the appointment with sir george reedy art would try to sell him tonys contract canada then she tasted the magic of a blini tony its wonderful yeah youd have to own todos santos to eat like this every day im glad the soviets are finally cleaning up their rivers hey delores i dont really care where they send me she couldnt tell him art wouldnt like her jumping the gun i just want to know youre coming with me in that moment she knew the answer guarding her bosss secrets from her lover automatically reflexively told her where her loyalty lay she said im not tony said nothing but the life went out of his face he swallowed with difficulty he started to say something stopped she couldnt let him beg in haste she said tony ive got power and respect here im the general managers secretary its an important job id probably be moving to another arcology or building one and id be the court magicians old lady tony i didnt even settle for general managers mistress thats an interchangeable slotno pun intended tonys laugh was more of a bark and delores didnt smile i want something permanent ive got it here now he looked up you know the whole city wondered why you and art broke it up no privacy in this place he poured a thimbleful of vodka into a chilled liqueur glass you gave me one classic heros welcome he said i wont ever forget pour me one too youve gone insane john shapiro said absolutely bonkers lieutenant donovan nodded to himself right enough by me he thought theyve all gone nuts they stood at the main surface entrance to todos santos an enormous banner fluttered overhead think of it as evolution in action they were surrounded by police and lawyers donovan could see uniformed todos santos guards to the rank of major three fbi men federal marshals scads of los angeles county sheriffs deputies some in uniform and others in plain clothes his own three lapd cops two united states attorneys and four los angeles county deputy district attorneys one of whom had just served a paper on the todos santos general manager plus five todos santos attorneys including john shapiro who had insisted on reading the warrant aloud from beginning to end eventually he finished you cant search an entire city shapiro said even if that were possible you cant do it with a single warrant if you want to look somewhere you have to get a warrant for that particular place impossible the deputy da said there are too many places about a hundred thousand private apartments shapiro agreed and each one a separate dwelling and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized sixth amendment i know that i wondered shapiro said because it doesnt look as if youve read it lately youve got some of the second part persons to be seized preston sanders and anthony randalthough i challenge your proper cause for wanting to arrest mr rand but the rest of this document is ridiculous how ever did you get a judge to sign it its signed a sheriffs deputy said now let us in and another thing you name millie as a place to be searched just how do you propose to search a computer they were interrupted by a burst of laughter from the todos santos manager he looks like hes got canary feathers in his whiskers donovan muttered to his assistant these papers are in order the das spokesman said now are you going to let us in or do we have to break in shapiro shrugged and looked to the general manager mr bonner admit them under protest get their names and badge numbers well want to sue bonner turned and stamped away shapiro stood aside and donovan followed the horde of police through the entryway and into the broad corridor where the hell do we start sergeant ortiz asked donovan shrugged thank god im not in charge of this farce cops sure can be stupid sometimes i dont know what those guys will do but what we do is nothing were not going to find anything and we all know it why go through the motions he paused in thought for that matter im not so sure i want to find this rand character next time they might take away the whole damned jail or city hall in there guard lieutenant blake said he indicated a low door ill be here in the service tunnel and security is watching all the corridors if the angelino cops get close well hold them up right tony rand said thanks the access door from the service corridor was low and tony had to duck to get through into art bonners temporary office it nearly matched the real thing the desk and viewscreens were almost identical though the shelves were empty of the sailing memorabilia and other clutter that bonner kept the door outside claimed the suite was an apartment occupied by a retired marine colonel inside were bonner barbara churchward and sir george reedy come in tony bonner said were just putting the finishing touches on our agreement sir george didnt look very happy tony regarded the canadians expression and asked how much are you getting for my contract oh were being quite reasonable barbara said cheerfully its too much reedy protested hes a wanted man theyll extradite him and well have nothing for all that money no you can give him political asylum bonner said if it comes to that which i doubt i doubt theyll even try on a federal level if they do shapiro can keep the state department tied in knots for years it isnt as if they had any real evidence that tony was involved in their jailbreak our problem is that they can keep him in courtrooms forever do i get a say in this tony asked sure tony bonner said its this way you have a contract with romulus corporation romulus is negotiating consultation fees for helping the canadians build their new arcology they want a lot of engineering help if you like youll be in charge of the engineering team thats one of your alternativesi would have thought the most attractive one what are the others you can go to zimbabwe with pres tony rand frowned zimbabwe where the devil is that it used to be called rhodesia barbara said why would pres want to go to rhodesia tony demanded sir georges eyebrows lifted barbara laughed he really doesnt know sir george he never pays attention to anything outside todos santos tony zimbabwe was a colony run by whites until a few years ago now it has a black government a fairly good one as such things go in africa romulus has had its eye on pres as honcho of corporate operations there for a long time nows a very good chance we put the idea to pres and he likes it tony nodded pres would like it a good promotion with a chance to run his own show would he resent getting this promotion because he was black or find that amusing have to ask him so you could go with him bonner was saying you work well with sanders and romulus has some extensive civil engineering operations in zimbabwe it would be a good place to stash you until we need you on the orbital construction shack rand looked from bonner to reedy umh huh that last part sounds pretty good he said reedy chuckled you neednt bring out the sandbags he looked thoughtful but theres the general strike that councilman planchet has called against todos santos im not certain i want economic reprisals taken against meand there would be for hiring mr rand well they might try it but what can they really do to you bonner asked theyre too far away theyre too far from canada tony rand thought but not too far from us a general strike thats got to have art worried out of his mind he doesnt show it but its got to be hurting us perhaps youre right sir george said he stared pensively at the ceiling for a moment then said id want it clearly understood that we have you two on call ill want you by hologram for at least ten hours a month and two weeks a year actually in residence both of us barbara asked certainly reedy said bonner looked thoughtful so did churchward and reedy now theyre doing it again tony thought consulting from the look on sir georges face theyve cut him outnow theyve let him overhear somethingdamn what must that be like ive got to find out and maybe tony cleared his throat ive never been to africa he said it sounds good nobody paid any attention to him for a moment then barbara smiled slightly oh come on tony we can at least consider it bonner shook his head his look was decisive all right tony thought ill shut up but just for now youve not heard the last of this there was more silence then all three bonner churchward and reedy were smiling eight hours a month and ten days a year art bonner said excellent agreed sir george said he extended his hand then withdrew it slightly mind you ill not aid in helping either of them escape no need bonner said youll take care of sending sanders on to salisbury well get them both to canada quite very well he extended his hand again bonner took it and after a moment barbara put hers atop the other two leaving me out tony thought taking me for granted well show them we wifi bonner stood a moment he stood silently for a moment sir george joined him in the pose they waited nearly a minute then bonner opened the outer office door a uniformed todos santos guard stood outside sir george will be leaving this afternoon bonner said i expect hed like to pack now right the guard said he led reedy away bonner came back and closed the door ok sweets what does tony think hes doing come on art its obvious what he wants tee hee youll see it in a second im surprised at you the police have requested all files under directory title rand dump it for them at baud art are you sure we cleaned rands directory first thing took out everything not routine then we added a few files old engineering catalogues maintenance schedules ratings of tv shows makes a pretty big file millie what is the total stored in rands directory bytes good lord art that will take hours to print out yeah that gives the cops a hobby now what is it rand wants delores hes got her no no delores wont go but thats not his primary want anyway come on use your head oh i bonner grinned all right tony why the sudden interest in trips to africa he watched amused as rand tried to keep a poker face well i always did get along with pres and but you could be talked into going to canada well yes but it would be expensive i want oh never mind tony bonner said wickedly he made his voice sound resigned well lose money on the canadian deal but if you really want to go to africa well we owe you and whatever rand was going to say was drowned out by barbaras laughter art you are really cruel maybe once in a while tony its going to cost you rand looked wary whats going to cost me the implant thats what youre holding out for isnt it jesus i never saw a worse negotiator fortunately your interest is our interest rand looked more wary than ever of course well want an exclusive contract for your services with veto power over any outside jobs and the right to reassign you at our convenience yipe thats slavery rand protested yup well also want you here part of the time not in person of course but well let you roam around todos santos by robot and set up regular holographic conferences with us and with your replacement what do you intend to do work me to death not quite of course you always have the option of quitting on half payyou wont be able to work for anyone else but half what we pay you is plenty so whats to keep me from taking your implant and your money and going off to grow petunias well chance it about as much chance of that as i have of turning into a werewolf keep him idle for six months and hed be a raving maniac there are those who say heskip it thats settled then barbara said smile tony you win youll get your implant she paused you dont look very happy about it no no thats fine but tony still wasnt smiling for a man whos about to go off alone he really is putting a good face on disaster yeah too good i dont like it there is a problem with this barbara said you wont be able to come back to the states not for a while anyway you might have difficulty seeing your son it isnt zach hes going to miss its getting laid regularly both id say and dont be narsty is there a chance genevieve might be persuaded to go with you rand shook his head violently why would she do that there wont be any highstatus place like todos santos in canada not till i build it which is just the point barbara said if shed come with you youd know its because she believes in you it wouldnt be just for the status shed earn her way just as you will arent you laying it on thick with rand you cant lay it on too thick look at his face weve got him but will genevieve believe any of that who cares so long as shell go and i think she will from everything ive heard shes pretty sharp why do you want genevieve to go with him anyway pet come on havent you seen him when he talks about her hes still in love with her delores knows everyone else knows except maybe tony i liked seeing tony happy and he was for the few days he had delores hed be happy with genevieve believe me shed never do it tony said youll never know until you ask her how do i ask her the cops will be watching her all the time probably have her phone tapped barbara nodded thats true but i can talk to her for you tony find out what she thinks if it sounds good ill bring her here theyll never be able to follow me inside todos santos i am printing the requested files you will not answer any other requests from the police until that printout is completed acknowledged the police are now entering your main office sandra wyatt is with them id appreciate that barbara tony said ii guess i really would like it if djinn came with me not that i think she will well see boss this is sandra im talking into a hush phone theres no way you can answer me the cops have brought alice strahler up here theyre trying to talk her into guiding their search theyre promising her immunity have millie blink your office lights if you understand holy shit bonner said aloud millie blink my office lights tony theyve brought alice here can she help them find anything in millie that we dont want them to know maybe rand said we did all the obvious things i did a few that werent so obvious bonner said such as erasing your access logs and taking your name off all the accession records for the city hall and county jail plans and such but we still could have missed something rand said what if we knew we wouldnt have missed it barbara said impatiently and we probably did miss something rand said no way we could be sure andwell alice could have hidden a few files herself she didnt know about anything illegal did she bonner demanded no but she might embarrass us meanwhile the economic harassments continue barbara said that strike can hurt us its already hurting us bonner said right so barbara stood suddenly art its time to call off this war i think we should have a peace conference think were ready we can get ready more data whispered against his mastoid bone holy cow sweetheart youre a mean broad economic warfare is my specialty so she said you call maclean stevens and invite him to bring councilman planchet out tony well have an hour or so to talk how would todos santos go about putting pressure on los angeles art bonner looked at the wreckage of his office and cursed the place was a mess with holes in the wall chipped plaster ripped upholstery there were books scattered everywhere i tried to get it cleaned up delores said she spat cops i can get the worst taken care of before your appointment leave it bonner said the main thing is to be sure their bugs are gone and our cameras are working we did that first off delores said of course that made some of the mess its all right art sat behind his desk and looked at the readout screens tony you there sure am the letters flowed across one desk console screen visual and audio pickups working fine good maclean stevens and councilman planchet have arrived at the southeast heliport thank you link to barbara churchward you there sweetheart right here tony had some ideas too this is it kids payoff time big jim planchet held his lips to a tight line as he entered the big office it was here he thought right here they gave the orders and my boy died right here he followed maclean stevens in not really hearing the introductions and greetings not seeing anything at first then he looked around seeing the destruction holes in the walls and ceiling books thrown to the floor covered with plaster dust then walked on some of them looked to be expensive books art volumes furniture had been ripped open rugs slashed your cops were thorough enough bonner said they didnt find anything but then i doubt they expected to not my cops stevens answered sheriffs people not mine balls you could call them off anytime you wanted bonner said you lost an office i lost a son planchet said coldly im sorry about your son bonner said if wed known any way to save him we would have but he was just too damned convincing we were betrayed ourselves alice strahlerthe one who told renn how to get your kid in here the sheriffs men were talking about giving her immunity planchet started to say something but held back if youd been a bit more cooperative i doubt the deputies would have trashed your office stevens said cooperative how that goddam computer printing out page after page of tv show ratings they asked for it bonner said i cant help it if youve got a bunch of stupid cops trying to talk to a smart computer look bonner this isnt a game planchet said i couldnt agree more bonner said so shall we be serious if you want a drink i can send for anything youd like my delivery system got broken this afternoon when one of your cretins thought hed found the secret compartment we hide engineers in thats serious stevens asked bonner couldnt help it he laughed the cop sure thought it was you should have seen him with his head stuck in the conveyor which picked just that time to deliver a royal gin fizz that got a grin from stevens well pass the drinks for the moment all right you called the conference your turn sure bonner said i want to negotiate a peace settlement no deal without sanders and rand planchet said then no deals at all bonner said sorry to have wasted your time gentlemen he stood up ill get you an escort back to your helicopter hell we just got here stevens said he looked at planchet you know damned well theyre not going to turn sanders over to us then we hurt them until they do planchet said you think the strike hurts now wait till we have a real strike nothing will go in or out of this building nothing sure bonner said and we counter with a boycott miss churchward starts making purchases from san francisco we bring it by ship and land it in long beach it will be the best thing that ever happened to the west coast merchant marine but los angeles wont make much out of it then there are our waldo operators theyve elected a spokesman bonner touched a switch on his desk console armand drinkwaters apartment appeared on the screen drinkwater sat idly his tools neatly stowed away just cant work this way he said how can i work when an angelino cop could break in my door anytime he wants to im used to knowing whos going to visit me the rest of us all feel the same way stevens nodded grimly and he and planchet exchanged glances aha bonner thought theyv already heard about that one wonder who called might be the secretary of state those medical gizmos drinkwater was making were pretty important and the orbital work even more so so lets rub it in he touched buttons rachael lief came onto the screen behind her in her screen was a lunar landscape complete with irate astronaut i cant tell you when i can get back to work rachael said when things are settled here you could get someone else the astronaut cursed again bonner cut him off and looked expectantly at planchet your move bonners look said how are shipments going to get here from long beach planchet demanded i told you well see that nothing comes in or out not even food bonner asked innocently im not certain but i think the constitution prevents us cities from making war on each other if you let people starve to death in here it will get on national television are you going to stop food from coming in dont be silly stevens said me silly come on now who was it threatened to leave us besieged in the castle youre more medieval than we are private wars yet damn you this is no joke planchet shouted and just to be sure you understand that bonners hand hesitated above the keyboard then withdrew councilman ive already told you we regret what happened you cant possibly believe we wanted to kill innocent kidsand youve seen all the warnings we gave the signs those kids went past the locked doors they went through youre an intelligent man you know damned well there wasnt another thing we could have done and either you or stevens would have done the same thing if youd been sitting in preston sanderss chair too bonner paused for a moment you dont have to respond to that but think about it while youre thinking let me show you another one the tv screen showed the iceberg resting in santa monica bay this goes with it bonner said he took a xerox from his desk and handed it to stevens that gives me operational control of all romulus assets in the southwest including the power plants in baja also the iceberg now watch closely are you watching millie are the skiers all evacuated from the iceberg yes have rand do phase one of flmbuiwinter nothing happened for a moment then the floating plastic liner which trapped melted icewater and kept it separated from the salt water of the bay rippled along its entire length the iceberg itself seemed to move slowly majestically on the windward side of the berg thousands of gallons of salt water slopped in hey for gods sake planchet protested so far your constituents can drink brackish water bonner said i dont expect theyll like it much but it wont hurt them would you like to try for straight salt water you need that water as much as we do stevens said watch again bonner said the tv screen shifted to a personable young lady the legend underneath said sandra wyatt deputy general manager a male voiceover said we interrupt regularly scheduled programming for an important announcement this is a stage two water conservation notice wyatt said we have reason to believe that the city of los angeles may interfere with our water supplies as you all know we have large internal storage systems all of which are full it will be inconvenient but we shouldnt have any real problems if everyone does their share the stage two water conservation plan imposeђ the following restrictions all residents will immediately the screen went back to a view of the iceberg which was still in motion but no longer shipping water into the plastic liner want to bet your people will conserve better than mine bonner asked you wont run out of drinking water but youll shut down more industries than i will i can get an injunction planchet protested bonner laughed go ahead theres the phone with luck you might get a court order in the next hour we wont even oppose it millie i want about half that much water sloppage again are you watching incidentally my chief engineer tellsuh excuse me told me that it takes three full days to flush the system once its been thoroughly contaminated with salt thats assuming our people do it doing it without the computer and using outside work crews can take from two weeks to forever depending just thought youd like to know that got to them bonner thought of course you could go back to pumping water from the owens valley and the sacramento delta art said you might have some trouble from the fromates though didnt they dynamite your aqueduct once still no answer data rippled into his mind he grinned now heres something interesting theres a large shipload of cement about to leave portland oregon romulus bought it to send up to prudhoe bay but barbara has authority to divert it for our use we were just about to put in an order with a local outfit but if were under local siege ill want to assure my supplies thatll cost you a lot stevens observed not so very much we got the cement at a good price he cocked his head to one side and looked thoughtful actually we might even save money planchet turned to stevens do you believe that stevens shrugged i could let your investigators find that file bonner said or show it to you here want to see for yourself all right ill just call that bluff planchet said how much he stopped because maclean stevens was laughing so hard it was hard to hear anyone else speak he really got you stevens said what difference does it make whether he tells you a story or has millie tell you you think the computer wont lie for him he cant have made up that many stories in advance he doesnt have to make up anything in advance stevens said dont you understand hes talking to that goddam computer every second the computers in his head councilman christ and thats what my kid was up against he almost beat us art bonner said if that makes you feel any better it doesnt he did beat us art said almost musingly our goal was a capture mr planchet what can i say nothing we do will bring jimmy back but you youre helping the people who really killed him the fromates and i cant believe youre actually on their side planchet sat heavily i thought about that already he said carefully i thought about it a lot damn it i dont know what to do he pounded his big fist into a bigger hand all right bonner what is it you want i want this strike ended bonner said i want your cops out of my city and my people back to work i want things the way they were before before planchet said we cant do that but i guess we can stop hurting each other anyone tries that itll be political suicide but sanders and rand are wanted and theyll stay wanted done youll never see either one of them again mac take your police and go mr planchet call off your strike and ill start flushing the iceberg tub and put my people back to work all right planchets lips tightened he looked from bonner to stevens then at the iceberg on the screen and slowly he nodded done break out the champagne xx successful and fortunate crime is called virtue seneca persuasions sure you dont want a driver miss churchward thank you no sergeant i dont have far to go she smiled warmly and climbed into the roadster like all cars in todos santos it was company property individually owned cars didnt make sense it was cheaper to keep a fleet and lend them to residents in theory no car was reserved for any particular person in practice certain specially equipped cars were used by a very few top executives and barbara considered the little alfa romeo hers she got in and adjusted the seats and mirrors carefully then touched a switch inside the glove compartment testing relay millie acknowledged relay operative her implanted transceivers range was fairly short but the car had a powerful relay system good anywhere in line of sight to the large antenna on top of todos santos she nodded in satisfaction then checked each gauge she started the car and listened attentively to the engine eventually she felt ready to face los angeles traffic and put the car in gear she spiraled up and up to the top of the ramp and out into the greensward around todos santos choosing a route that led through a wild area it wasnt actually wilderness the native chaparral of southern california is ugly brown most of the year and the todos santos residents didnt want to look down on that after some experimenting the companys agronomists developed shrubs that stayed green with minimum artificial irrigation the resulting greensward was pleasant to drive through and the deer and rabbits and coyotes seemed to like it a lot the citys walls towered high above her when she reached the edge of the park she saw that the picketing angelinos were gone stevens and planchet had acted swiftly once they made the basic agreement up above though the todos santos residents hadnt removed their banners think of it as evolution in action link to bonner here i am pretty busy just a note that banner has to go it cant be helping our relations with the angelinos guess youre right ill take care of it anything else not right now bye the apartment building was modern spanish mostly concrete and tile built over an underground parking structure and around a bricked patio there was a parking place right in front sparing her the drive down a narrow ramp a thick arched passage led to the interior court unlike most such apartment buildings the swimming p was in a separate area so that the brickfloored inside patio seemed cool and inviting rather than being a glare of concrete deck and chlorined water genevieve rands apartment was on the second floor up a flight of stairs and along an ironrailed balcony barbara rang the bell and was annoyed when there was no answer confirm time of appointment millie didnt answer either blast out of range too much concrete between me and the car oh well ill keep ringing i know the door opened barbara and genevieve eyed each appraisingly shes not bad at all barbara thought kept her looks and figure maybe just a touch plump but so is delores tony must like them that way barbara churchward we had an appointment yes iim not sure we have much to talk about ive come this far you may as well hear what i have to say shes certainly nervous because tonys wanted are the police inside that could be it better watch what i say yes wont you come in genevieve stood out of the way then closed the door behind when they were inside the apartment was neat expensive furniture plants little touches of color here and there all very tasteful a door was open to a hallway and at the end of that was another room larger but not so trimly kept with books and toys and a sewing basket visible on a big smoothtopped table very nice barbara said would you like anything sherry coffee nothing thank you genevieve indicated a chair she hovered nervously until barbara sat what can i do for you barbara made a snap decision she couldnt talk here not until she knew what was wrong id like to take you out to todos santos oh isis tony there i couldnt say but just before he disappeared he made an appointment with you yes thats right actually he wanted me to keep it for him even before the big flap with the police oh then youre barbara laughed great heavens no oh i like tony but no were not involved no mrs rand its just that he asked me to well to negotiate with you it seems he didnt trust himself negotiate but to do for you to join tony if thats what you want of course there are problems just now we could discuss all this better out there genevieve didnt say anything ha barbara thought you still want to live with tony if im any judge of expressions im also certain were not alone if were going to talk well have to get out of here i really wish youd come with me we could be back in an hour and theres a lot to talk about barbara stood and went toward the door please thatll do it it was a mans voice he was just stepping out of a closet barbara turned toward him my officer wasnt it uncomfortable in there genevieve laughed hysterically officer hes no policeman hes shut up the bubble of barbaras amusement popped and was gone not police there were more people now a not unattractive but certainly large woman came out of the playroom another man came from a side door in the same hallway this one carried some kind of twohanded firearm with a fat barrel barbara had seen one like it before but couldnt remember where one of colonel crosss men it didnt matter it was a submachine gun and that made these desperate people indeed millie nothing damn these concrete walls what do you want we want you mizz churchward miss she said automatically traitor the woman said she came over to stand very close to barbara pig leona the first man said thats enough just how am i a traitor barbara asked if i can keep them talking the woman hit her hard across the mouth barbara stepped back gasping the woman hit her again first with her fist then slapped her forehand backhand now do you understand leona demanded youre nothing pig nothing youll do what we want and youll talk when we want you to and youll be polite understand barbara spat out pieces of a broken tooth and felt bloody saliva run down her chin the hard hand struck her again i asked you a question pig i understand all right lets get them both out of here one of the men ordered leona was holding a black cloth hood she put it over barbaras head then took her arm and began pulling her barbara stumbled along somehow the whole side of h r face throbbed and it was hard to breathe inside the bag her nose was stopped up and she continually swallowed salt blood and keep quiet understand i understand something seized her left breast and squeezed horribly barbara gasped with pain i didnt say you could talk now shut up and come on the hand squeezed again barbara stumbled and nearly fell the woman lifted her by her breast and barbara felt faint from the pain she was half dragged until she could recover her balance millie millie millie god where are you millie acknowledged o thank god record security alert link with bonner what is it im being kidnapped present location genevieve rand apartment i were on our way going down some stairs now blindfolded the stairs face north were turning right right againim turned around i dont know which way im going were going down again i suppose into the garage under the apartment art im scared nothing art get in the car and lie on the floor thats it right there millieart someone nothing boy hang on no panic theyll find me art will take care of that and then itll be my turn with that sadistic bitch shes probably a lesbian wonder what shes afraid of most maybe rats i can have her put in with a whole cage full of rats spiders too whatever she doesnt like millie she heard the car motor start the car began to move it seemed to be going slowly turning slowly moving slowly it tilted sharply and continued to move up the parking ramp millie acknowledged you faded on us sweetheart look you keep trying they have me in a car well be driving away away from my car away from the relay keep telling us which way youre going dont stop transmitting im scared we turned left at the top of the ramp now were moving faster theres no gear shift electric automobile running smoothly good springs and shocks i think were turning right are you still there still hear you keep telling us now were going again turning right uphill uphill and turning a freeway ramp leveling off accelerating were on a freeway art nothing o lord millie millie millie the montana street entrance bonner said only one on ramp there and it goes south colonel cross said theyre headed toward us on weve got to find them bonner said cross nodded crisply i want every car with an implant relay out on that freeway cruise up and down and keep on miss churchwards frequency millie will tell you if she gets anything right lieutenant blake said he spoke softly into a telephone handset bonner lifted his own telephone sandra locate every portable transceiver we have and get them into cars that dont have relay units i want to blanket this city with relays let security know when youve got them ready to roll if we get enough cars out there one of them has to hear her i already thought of that art wyatt said its being done anything else no i have colonel cross with me and hes handling it were taking a lot of your cops youd better cancel leaves and call in some offduty guards already on that too chief leave the routine to me ill run the city you find your lady yeah thanks bonner put down the telephone millie acknowledged anything from miss churchward no new communication with churchward listen hard instruction not understood tony rand hurried past delores without seeing her and without waiting to be announced he charged into bonners office art i just heard it hit him then before hed only been worried now he felt a cold hand in his guts as he saw bonner and colonel cross and lieutenant blake sitting grimfaced not doing anything not doing anything which meant there was nothing to do theyd have thought of all the obvious stuffis it certain they took djinn tony demanded colonel cross glanced at bonner then nodded yes we have our people in mrs rands apartment now and neither she nor the boy are there zachs with his grandmother tony said i talked to him on the telephone before the jailbreak and he said his mother was sending him off for two weeks that accounts for him then cross said and of course mrs rand could have gone voluntarily with the kidnappers batshit tony said cross shrugged they got barbara at genevieve rands place bonner said they were obviously waiting for her and genevieve has been fairly chummy with professor arnold renn she wouldnt have helped them kidnap barbara tony said she can be a screwball but shes not that screwy bonner spread his hands makes no difference anyway he said join the club sit down and wait we should be doing something agreed what bonner demanded let me tell you what were doing now maybe you will think of something rand felt a quick surge of hope but when bonner finished talking tony couldnt think of a thing to add central this is one zed niner we have a weak transmission from sweetheart i say again we have a weak transmission from sweetheart our location is block of staunton avenue we have no directional antenna but we can cruise until signal peaks instructions stay out of sight one zed niner do not let playmates see you we do not wish playmates to know we have means of locating them i say again get your vehicle out of sight and stay there continue to monitor transmissions from sweetheart we will attempt to focus an antenna on your vehicle so that sweetheart will be able to communicate directly with us do you understand understood will comply one zed niner out what the hell are your troops doing bonner demanded take it easy colonel cross said and stop snapping at us were sending the cars out there including hers we had contact with her and she wasnt moving and its only a matter of time before we get through to her again for gods sake boss keep your shirt on yeah all right ill try now about that other matter do i call in help no colonel not unless you think you have to id rather we did this ourselves art bonner said amos cross grinned so would i but i do warn you the lapd swat team is one of the best in the world they havent lost a victim yet and you dont think our people can do it if i thought that id insist we call in lapd cross said weve got sharp troops but of course they dont have the kind of experience regular swat outfits get how could they there hadnt been a barricadedwithhostages case in the history of todos santos am i right to take chances with barbara and genevieve tony you get a voice in this decision should we call in lapd rand looked helpless colonel cross is the expert not me ill go along with whatever you two decide putting it square on me as usual bonner thought so be it arti millie answered me art thank god im here babe are you all right not too bad theyre a little rough but i can take it now but i dont know where we are we almost have you located thats how you hear us we have a relay unit near you soon as i get a couple more cars there well triangulate and locate you one question should we call lard swat or take care of it ourselves just us please ive stayed sane thinking what i can do to those uh o god barbara whew they do getill try to control that you need me to keep transmitting so you can locate me dont you ill try one two three four colonel get our troops ready thats a bad situation there whats happening rand demanded did you hear something is djinn all right dont know tony bonner said he held up his hand palm outward dont distract me colonel let me know when your people are in position theyll have to go in fast lie down bitch god not again you hurt me last time i shut up or ill give you to leona could that be worse millie have you located me uh thank god its not my fertile time do they all do this they raped patty hearst maybe they think it will convert me oh lord that hurts its the revolution its coming and nothing you can do about it well end the corporate state itll just die when people find out they dont have to knuckle under they dont have to put up with big companies to get enough to eat the lecture dissolved as his arms went around her and he squeezed her his hips moved faster and faster where are they now can you locate all of them there are four men and one female one of the men is in the closet with me i dont think there are any weapons in here with us i can take care of him if the others wont interfere i dont know where they have genevieve youre sure genevieve is not one of them yes very sure theythey hurt her and i dont know where she is or where the others are i what is he doing in a closet with you art what in hell do you think im sorry stand by were about ready think of something else anything else she remembered her friend jeanine who studied zen you handle pain by accepting it attending to it thinking about it make it a part of yourself until its commonplace and nothing special and then it isnt pain at all only its not working ha you get interested too dont you honey we can do this a lot there was a splintering sound from the next room what in hell was that hold it right there move one inch an ill blow your balls off shitwhat is this he tried to scramble up barbara reached up and seized his testicles she clenched her fist hard pulled twisted he shrieked and flailed helplessly in the dark it was his screaming that brought the guards xxi no one is fit to be trusted with power no one any man who has lived at all knows the follies and wickedness hes capable of and if he does know it he knows also that neither he nor any man ought to be allowed to decide a single human fate c p snow the light and the dark dilemmas are you all right yes no ive got a broken tooth and a cut on my face but mostly i feel dirty stickydirty art i hate themdr finder wants to give me a shot i think ill let him she says shes all right bonner said is djinn all right tony demanded bonner looked helpless barbara hasnt said damn it colonel why cant you talk to your people im getting through now cross said he spoke into the telephone all right captain ive got you on the speaker youre talking to mr bonner mr rand and myself report yes sir we are in complete control of the house mrs rand is hysterical but otherwise physically unharmed she may have been sexually abused but that isnt certain miss churchward had a nosebleed and has a cut on her left cheek which will require medical attention she wasa man was in the the guard stammered for a moment then resumed in a dry professional voice can you hear the policeman reporting to us yes we have four prisoners three male and one female one male prisoner was apprehended while committing rape miss churchward greatly assisted in his apprehension you neednt put any of that in your report bonner said well edit that considerably thank you im going to sleep now dr finder gave me a shot iloveyou love you thats about all sir we broke in clean the los angeles police have not been called and no one is likely to call them were waiting for instructions cross looked expectantly at art bonner bring them all here and the fewer people who know about this the better right what are you going to do with them that colonel is one hell of a good question genevieve rand found the situation thoroughly ambiguous on the one hand the todos santos guards had rescued her and they couldnt have been more polite on the othershe didnt know where she was and the polite guards wouldnt let her leave she was in a comfortable room the living room to a large apartment somewhere in todos santos she had use of a bathroom all the other doors were locked and there were no windows theyd left her a box that looked like a radio someone always answered if she talked into it theyd had a physician talk to her and now they ignored herbut they wouldnt let her go at least im safe she thought and shuddered shed always been a little afraid of ron wolfe even when hed been an aboveground member of the movement he was one of the intense ones ready to sacrifice everythingand everyoneto the cause including himself except that his objective assessment was that he was far too valuable to be sacrificed lightly that had been her first thought once she knew that they intended to kidnap churchward ron wolfe thinks hes too valuable to be sacrificed and im going to see him commit a capital crime shed even tried to play along with them pretend to join them but they werent having any arnold renn had told them all about her attitudes and wants and wishes and desires and they werent about to trust her and when theyd taken her as well as churchward shed felt relieved that they hadnt killed her on the spot but she didnt think she had very long to live she remembered her terror when wolfe blindfolded churchwardand didnt bother doing it to her so thanks to the todos santos people im safe but now what im still a witness she thought i wonder what that means the door opened and tony came in her first impulse was to run to him but she was seated in a deep soft chair and she couldnt get up easily by the time she could stand that moment had been lost but he looks worried and relieved and glad to see me so maybe its right after allhello tony i thought youd be out of the country by now what with the police after you and everything and wow do i sound calm and cool and collected and is that the right way to handle this competent he likes competence not having to worry about people so yes it is the right way if i can just keep it up i was just leaving when they told me tony said are you all right she tried to shrug and flinched it felt like shed been kicked under the shoulder blade shed hit a corner of something when the big woman threw her across a room some interesting bruises nothing permanent good he was looking into her eyes as if he really thought you could read minds that way iuhmiss churchward was going to talk to you did she tell you whati mean did she explain what she wanted to see you about some we got interrupted he waved his hands around nervously hell i used to be able to talk to you why cant i now djinn do you want to come to canada with me itll mean starting over on a new arcology one i can build right ah she never got that far oh sure i should have realized youve got to leave dont you yeah but sir george reedy has me signed up for another ten years of inspired drudgery thank god do you want in you and zach genevieve almost laughed what she wanted was out out of los angeles out of the fromates away from anyone who knew her she pictured a snowy wilderness and a gigantic formless building with thousands of glowing windows isolated on the ice all her mistakes left behind she wanted that now how best to bargain with tony uhdjinn i want to be honest with you this is a big job my contract looks like theyve reinvented slavery and it isnt something i can do by rote either this one wont be anything like todos santos i need a different design its a colder climate there are new materials id like to djinn what im trying to say is i wont have a lot of time for family life not at first ill come jesus he was about to talk himself out of it well come its all right tony im a big girl and im used to taking care of myself ill find plenty to do out of here in a place where nobody knows me then its settled youll come with me she remembered that tv documentary safety youre safe in todos santos we can do that again tony and i she nodded and hugged him carefully feeling fragile there were five people at the conference table they had just taken their seats when tony rand brought genevieve in art bonner half stood and bowed perfunctorily art bonner he said and frank mead our comptroller colonel cross of security john shapiro corporate counsel preston sanders formerly my deputy you already know barbara churchward i presume tony told you why were all here no genevieve seemed calm enough well its simple enough and we thought you ought to have a voice in the discussion were trying to decide what to do with the kidnappers but genevieve looked puzzled but surely youll turn them over to the police if we do that you and i will both spend months in a courtroom barbara said her voice was slurred and a thick bandage covered the left side of her face which would mean that you could not go to canada with tony and i certainly have better things to do than watch trials yes but what can we do with them genevieve demanded i mean you cant just kill them i could barbara said two of them anyway except that id want to do it slowly if you really mean that ill arrange it i dont know it just popped out so what do we do with them dont know i dont want to sit in courtrooms but im damned if ill just let them gol genevieve rand looked shocked then thoughtful then she looked disgusted with herself barbara be serious preston sanders said you dont want blood on your hands believe me you dont pres i understand how you meant thatbut i am serious barbara said then theres professor renn bonner said mrs rand are you certain he arranged this kidnapping im certain he tapped my telephone genevieve said i saw him doing ithe said hed dropped the phone and took it apart to check it and ron wolfe and those other people are arnolds friends and they knew when miss churchward was coming id say thats pretty certain barbara said certain enough for us not certain at all for the da shapiro said for that matter the way weve violated their rights we couldnt get any of them convicted now be more likely that wed go to jail another good reason to put them out the airlock tony rand said no sanderss voice was low and determined tony think how hard you tried not to kill anyone in the last breakin how hard i tried the first time did no good we were forced to it but this time this time we have them alive we havent had to kill anyone and dammit we cant do it in cold blood theyre human beings too just like us and nobody appointed us judge and jury i point out that the cost of putting them before a proper judge and jury is unreasonably high for the victims bonner said and we dont have jails and prisons here but i just dont know what to do he looked around helplessly i suppose i should start by asking the victims genevieve theres got to be a better way than murder barbara she shrugged three hours ago id have cut their throats myself now im not so sure she shook her head i pass tony put them out the airlock bonner was surprised at how vicious rand sounded so were several others judging from their expressions i mean what are the alternatives rand asked if we let them go they can get us in plenty of trouble could any of them prove that weve held them art asked what do you mean by proof shapiro said they might or might not recognize the guards who captured them otherwise what proof could there be and we can see that our guards have a hundred witnesses each to swear blind they were on duty here bonner said so they cant complain to the la cops not that theyd dare anyway since theyd have to say what they were doing when our guards grabbed them so youve proved that we can turn them loose frank mead said im not sure i care much for that theyd be right back again costing us with your permission amos cross said with your consent ill talk to each of them i think i can get it across that if we ever see or hear of any one of them again we will declare open season on themand that if we have the slightest doubt about our own ability to finish them we can afford highpriced open contracts is that your recommendation colonel bonner asked that we turn them loose with a warning cross shook his head i pass on giving an opinion mr bonner when the police become judges your society is in real trouble all right bonner said weve got three muggers we apprehended in the subway and four kidnappers we may as well take the easy case first i gather everyone is for letting the muggers loose no one said anything weve kept them fairly heavily drugged amos cross said and one of them babbled a lot enough to convince our guards that hes a murderer and youre going to turn them loose on los angeles genevieve rand asked frank mead shrugged who the hell cares about angelinos as long as were not bothered by them again angeino laws left them loose to hurt our people rand said if the angelinos dont like the situation let them change it we did so weve got three muggers four kidnappersand professor renn we dont have renn we can acquire him bonner said and the question before the house is a simple one what do we do with them think of it as evolution in action barbara churchward said there was no humor in her voice at all xxii injustice is relatively easy to bear what stings is justice h l mencken laws and prophets professor arnold renn threw clothes into an air force b bag he worked clumsily with almost frantic haste from time to time he glanced at the ornately engraved card that lay on his bedroom table think of it as evolution in action get out get away itll blow over they cant really hurt me but there had been a dozen of those cards in his box at ucla at the faculty club under the windshield wiper of his car and another on the car seat although there was no sign that the lock had been forced in the refrigerator and now in the bedroom and tina had no idea how they had got into the house the threat seemed unmistakable best not ignore it not with the headlines about the jailbreak following the unsuccessful attack and worse there wasnt anything in the papers or on tv about a todos santos official being kidnapped and there wasnt any answer at genevieves apartment or at the fromate headquarters or best get out of town take a leave of absence until things blow over let a graduate assistant meet the classes for a while get away let tina follow later if she wanted to but get away get out go now he finished packing and took the suitcase otit to the garage good afternoon renn looked up startled the man stood lazily against the garage door he smiled slightly but there wasnt anything pleasant about the shortbarreled shotgun he held uh no need to say anything at all i have a message for you what its simple goodbye renn had just enough time to understand before the buckshot tore his chest apart vague sensations shaped themselves into a pattern cold grass tickling cheek a distant moaning nearby slowly vinnie came to awareness of them all and more pain sharpening until it felt like the left side of his face and neck had been smashed to bloody mush like the longfaced creep with the empty pockets whod cursed them in the subway several weeks ago hed looked like vinnie felt when vinnie got through with him but vinnie remembered his face long and sullen and hating and another face flashed vivid lii his brain styled curly blond hair broad smooth cleanshaven face new dark blue suit and vest basrelief tie in scarlet and dark brown gold at both wrists gold ring walking money seen only for an instant with a look on his face such as vinnie had never seen on a mark unearthly joy as the mark cocked his fist for another blow the big fist with its big gold ring had just blasted vinnies neck to pulp and was set to do it again they hated him vinnie had never felt that before they cringed they tried to reason with him they handed him wallet or watch or purse they ran but they hated him they would kill him if they could he reached for another face seen later through a haze of some drug a face out of a nightmare seen in closeup a woman with impossibly huge eyes hair exploding around her head fiendish grin and a tool in her hand a needle tearing curves across his belly he tried to scream and another needle jabbed his arm and it all went away vinnie tried to curl himself tighter he moaned and the moan became a yell as it tore his throat open he was sitting upright naked as a peeled egg there were others around him all naked painted like so many easter eggs six plus vinnie some still sleeping some staring about them in terror where are we he sat up and looked around green shrubbery to one side on the other on the other todos santos was a wall across the sky the windows blazed like tens of thousands of eyes run he had to run he sprang to his feet and everything went blurry he hardly felt the jar as he fell back how was i to know he shouted how did i know it was you people in the subway a voice from the distance mocked him think of it as evolution in action the voice called he looked behind him there across the field over at the city street that bounded the todos santos greensward was a large tv truck with a cameraman standing on top the camera and other instruments were pointed at vinnie what am i doing here but there was no place to go not really and he wasnt alone strangers no that was runner carlos clutching himself tight to make himself smaller a small hard man who sometimes raided the subways whom vinnie avoided when he could very hard to recognize with no hair no moustache his whole body painted bluishwhite the great bulk of a man painted leaf green sleeping peacefully on his side would be gadge who ran with the runner and took his orders vinnie had never seen him undressed what he had taken for muscle on gadge seemed to be mostly fat but who were the other four and what did it say across their chests he strained to focus his eyes think of it as evolution in action vinnie fought back a laugh it would tear his throat and annoy gadge and runner carlos and vinnie himself had been painted deep rose his belly bore the same cartoon as the rest like a trade mark he rubbed it not understanding and found a slight ridge and understood tattoo just healing vinnie remembered thd woman with the needleand instantly the man with the gold ring he understood then that he would never see his belly in a mirror without remembering both the hugeeyed woman with the needle and the mark cocking his golddecorated fist ready to pound him to death maclean stevens drove up to lunans camera truck whats going on he demanded thomas lunan grinned some sad people out there all dressed up and no place to go who are they i think youll find three of them are from the american ecology army underground types wanted by the fbi three more are common crooks your cops will recognize you seem to know a lot shield law lunan chanted shield law shield law shield law no sources but its all true and you really will want to arrest the three ecology army types i doubt if you can charge the others butwhy stevens demanded why are they there if i had to guess lunan said id guess they annoyed todos santos stevens set his lips in a grim line in the field across the street the sleepers were stirring they kept glancing nervously toward stevens and lunan mac waved to the police whod come out with him round them up indecent exposure will do to get them to the station house the police sergeant laughed right okay troops lets go so it finally happened stevens said what happened lunan asked todos santos cut itself loose now theyre completely above the law theyre judge and jury and executioner but theyre not lunan said dont you see thats the whole message here he lowered his voice im prepared to deny i ever said this mr stevens some of those people did more than annoy the saints they kidnapped and abused one of their highest officials they had her for several hours before the todos santos guards rescued her stevens frowned lunan nodded exactly they really could have been judge and jury and executioner whod know instead theyve chosen to stay part of the human race oh sure theyre also protesting your brand of justice they want to see it changed but they havent cut loose from humanity you can say that you havent just come from looking at professor renns body lunan looked up sharply what somebody blew him away with a shotgun you didnt know that huh no but it wasnt todos santos why is that lunan would they have used a death ray lunan laughed they just didnt mac you may want to be careful investigating renns murder you might find your favorite city councilman wasnt as sharp as he thinks he was planchet planchet yeah god knows he had motive lunan do you know this no sounds like a hired kill though doesnt it that could be planchet or diana lauders parents or someone connected to the ecology army types renn sent in to die but i know what todos santos had in mind for renn and that wasnt it they wanted to scare him out of the country stevens mulled that the lapd officers had just finished rounding up the gaily colored nudies stevens watched the last one loaded into a black and white then he looked past the greensward past the orange grove on to the enormous building beyond free society or termite hill or both is this really the wave of the future for now he told lunan just for now and for this moment they havent quite cut loose from the human race but can you live in that and stay human forever his arm swept expressively to indicate the enormous city building its windows glaring orangewhite in sunsetlight the great orange banner was still there think of it as evolution in action as they watched it rippled and moved someone was lowering it you could live there lunan youd be welcome stevens said when are you planning to move in no said lunan and then he bellowed arbry get a camera sweep of those windows his voice dropped again thatll go nice a hundred thousand eyes but theyre all looking inward no privacy at all and no interest in what goes on out here no thats not my life style not mine either why does it have to be a venice boatman would go crazy in there so would a maori tribesman but that doesnt make him right what would a roman legionnaire think of your life style what would thomas jefferson think of me there are a lot of ways to be human maybe stevens turned in time to see the great banner flutter down from the battlements and settle gently to the ground
