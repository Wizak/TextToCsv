arm by larry niven the arm building had been abnormally quiet for some months now wed needed the rest at first but these last few mornings the silence had had an edgy quality we waved at each other on our paths to our respective desks but our heads were elsewhere some of us had a restless look others were visibly determinedly busy nobody wanted to join a mother hunt this past year wed managed to cut deep into the organlegging activities in the west coast area pats on the back all around but the results were predictable other activities were going to increase sooner or later the newstapers would start screaming about stricter enforcement of the fertility laws and then wed all be out hunting down illegitimate parents all of us who were not involved in something else it was high time i got involved in something else this morning i walked to my office through the usual edgy silence i ran coffee from the spigot carried it to my desk punched for messages at the computer terminal a slender file slid from the slot a hopeful sign i picked it up onehanded so that i could sip coffee as i went through it and let it fall open in the middle color holographs jumped out at me i was looking down through a pair of windows over two morgue tables stomach to brain lurch what a hell of an hour to be looking at people with thefr faces burned off get eyes to look somewhere else and dont try to swallow that coffee why dont you change jobs they were hideous two of them a man and a woman something had burned their faces away down to the skulls and beyond bones and teeth charred brain tissue cooked i swallowed and kept looking id seen the dead before these had just hit me at the wrong time not a laser weapon i thought though that was chancy there are thousands of jobs for lasers and thousands of varieties to do the jobs not a hand laser anyway the pencilthin beam of a hand laser would have chewed channels in the flesh this had been a wide steady beam of some kind i ifipped back to the beginning and skimmed details theyd been found on the wilshire slidewalk in west los angeles around am people dont use the slidewalks that late theyre afraid of organleggers the bodies could have traveled up to a couple of miles before anyone saw them preliminary autopsy theyd been dead three or four days no signs of drugs or poisons or puncture marks apparently the burns had been the only cause of death it must have been quick then a single flash of energy otherwise theyd have tried to dodge and thered be bums elsewhere there were none just the faces and char marks around the collars there was a memo from bates the coroner from the looks of them they might have been killed by some new weapon so hed sent the file over to us could we find anything in the arm files that would fire a blast of heat or light a foot across i sat back and stared into the holos and thought about it a light weapon with a beam a foot across they make lasers in that size but as war weapons used from orbit one of those would have vaporized the heads not charred them there were other possibilities death by torture with the heads held in clamps in the blast from a commercial attitude jet or some kind of weird industrial accident a flash explosion that had caught them both looking over a desk or something or even a laser beam reflected from a convex mirror forget about its being an accident the way the bodies were abandoned reeked of guilt of something to be covered up maybe bates was right a new illegal weapon and i could be deeply involved in searching for it when the mother hunt started the arm the police branch of the united nations has three basic functions we hunt organleggers dealers in illicit transplants who get their raw material through murder we monitor world technology new developments that might create new weapons or that might affect the world economy or the balance of power among nations and we enforce the fertifity laws come let us be honest with ourselves of the three protecting the fertility laws is probably the most important organleggers dont aggravate the population problem monitoring of technology is necessary enough but it may have happened too late there are enough fusion power plants and fusion rocket motors and fusion crematoriums and fusion seawater distilleries around to let any madman or group thereof blow up the earth or any selected part of it but if a lot of people in one region started having illegal babies the rest of the world would scream some nations might even get mad enough to abandon population control then what weve got eighteen billion on earth now we couldnt handle more so the mother hunts are necessary but i hate them its no fun hunting down some poor sick woman so desperate to have children that shell go through hell to avoid her sixmonth contraceptive shots ill get out of it if i can i did some obvious things i sent a note to bates at the coroners office send all further details on the autopsies and let me know if the corpses are identified retina prints and brainwave patterns were obviously out but they might get something on gene patterns and fingerprints i spent some time wondering where two bodies had been kept for three to four days and why before being abandoned in a way that could have been used three days earlier but that was a problem for the lapd detectives our concern was with the weapon so i started writing a search pattern for the computer find me a widget that will fire a beam of a given description from the pattern of penetration into skin and bone and brain tissue there was probably a way to express the frequency of the light as a function of the duration of the blast but i didnt fool with that id pay for my laziness later when the computer handed me a footthick list of lightemitting machinery and i had to wade through it i had punched in the instructions and was relaxing with more coffee and a cigarette when ordaz called julio ordaz was a slender darkskinned man with straight black hair and soft black eyes he was a detective inspector of homicide in the los angeles police the first time i saw him in a phone screen he had been telling me of a good friends murder two years later i still ifinched when i saw him hello julio business or pleasure business gil it is to be regretted yours or mine both there is murder involved but there is also a machine look can you see it behind me ordaz stepped out of the field of view then reached invisibly to turn the phone camera i looked into somebodys living room there was a wide circle of discoloration in the green indoorgrass rug in the center of the circle a machine and a mans body was julio putting me on the body was old halfmummified the machine was big and cryptic in shape and it glowed with a subdued eerie blue light ordaz sounded serious enough have you ever seen anything like this no thats some machine unmistakably an experimental device no neat plastic case no compactness no assemblyline welding too complex to examine through a phone camera i decided yah that looks like something for us can you send it over ordaz came back on he was smiling barely im afraid we cannot do that perhaps you should send someone here to look at it where are you now in raymond sinclairs apartment on the top floor of the rodewald building in santa monica ill come myself i said my tongue suddenly felt thick please land on the roof we are holding the elevator for examination sure i hung up raymond sinclair id never met raymond sinclair he was something of a recluse but the arm had dealt with him once in connection with one of his inventions the fyrestop device and everyone knew that he had lately been working on an interstellar drive it was only a rumor of course but if someone had killed the brain that held that secret i went the rodewald building was forty stories of triangular prism with a row of triangular balconies going up each side the balconies stopped at the thirtyeighth floor the roof was a garden there were rosebushes in bloom along one edge fullgrown elms nestled in ivy along another and a miniature forest of bonsai trees along the third the landing pad and carport were in the center a squad car was floating down ahead of my taxi it landed then slid under the carport to give me room to land a cop in vivid orange uniform came out to watch me come down i couldnt tell what he was carrying until i had stepped out it was a deepsea fishing pole still in its kit he said may i see some id please i had my arm ident in my hand he checked it in the console in the squad car then handed it back the inspectors waiting downstairs he said whats the pole for he smiled suddenly almost secretively youll see we left the garden smells via a ifight of concrete stairs they led down into a small room half full of gardening tools on the far side of which was a heavy door with a spyeye in it ordaz opened the door for us he shook my hand briskly glanced at the cop you found something good the cop said theres a sportinggoods store six blocks from here the manager let me borrow it he made sure i knew the name of the store yes there will certainly be publicity on this matter come gil ordaz took my arm you should examine this before we turn it off no garden smells here but there was something a whiff of something long dead that the airconditioning hadnt quite cleared away ordaz walked me into the living room it looked like somebodys idea of a practical joke the indoor grass covered sinclairs livingroom floor walltowall in a perfect fourteenfoot circle between the sofa and the fireplace the rug was brown and dead elsewhere it was green and thriving a mans mummy dressed in stained slacks and turtleneck lay on its back in the center of the circle at a guess it had been about six months dead it wore a big digital wristwatch with extra dials on the face and a fine mesh platinum band loose now around a wrist of bones and brown skin the back of the skull had been smashed open possibly by the classic blunt instrument lying next to it if the fireplace was false and it almost had to be nobody burns wood the fireplace instruments were genuine nineteenth or twentiethcentury antiques the rack was missing a poker a poker lay inside the circle in the dead grass next to the disintegrating mummy the glowing goldberg device sat just in the center of the magic circle i stepped forward and a mans voice spoke sharply dont go inside that circle of rug its more dangerous than it looks it was a man i knew officerone vaipredo a tall man with a small straight mouth and a long narrow italian face looks dangerous enough to me i said it is i reached in there myself valpredo told me right after we got here i thought i could ifip the switch off my whole arm went numb instantly no feeling at all i yanked it away fast but for a minute or so after that my whole arm was dead meat i thought id lost it then it was all pins and needles like id slept on it the cop who had brought me in had almost finished assembling the deepsea fishing pole ordaz waved into the circle well have you ever seen anything like this i shook my head studying the violetglowing machinery whatever it is its brandnew sinclairs really done it this time an uneven line of solenoids was attached to a plastic frame with homemade joins blistered spots on the plastic showed where other objects had been attached and later removed a breadboard bore masses of heavy wiring there were six big batteries hooked in parallel and a strange heavy piece of sculpture in what looked like pure silver with wiring attached at three curving points the silver was tarnished almost black and there were old file marks at the edges near the center of the arrangement just in front of the silver sculpture were two concentric solenoids embedded in a block of clear plastic they glowed blue shading to violet so did the batteries a less perceptible violet glow radiated from everywhere on the machine more intensely in the interior parts that glow bothered me more than anything else it was too theatrical it was like something a specialeffects man might add to a cheap latenight thriller to suggest a mad scientists laboratory i moved around to get a closer look at the dead mans watch keep your head out of the field valpredo said sharply i nodded i squatted on my heels outside the borderline of dead grass the dead mans watch was going like crazy the minute hand was circling the dial every seven seconds or so i couldnt find the second hand at all i backed away from the arc of dead grass and stood up inter stellar drive hell this blueglowing monstrosity looked more like a time machine gone wrong i studied the single throw switch welded to tile plastic frame next to the batteries a length of nylon line dangled from the horizontal handle it looked like someone had tugged the switch on from outside the field by using the line but hed have had to hang from the ceiling to tug it off that way i see why you couldnt send it over to arm headquarters you cant even touch it you stick your arm or your head in there for a second and thats ten minutes without a blood supply ordaz said exactly it looks like you could reach in there with a stick and flip that switch off perhaps we are about to try that he waved at the man with the fishing pole there was nothing in this room long enough to reach the switch we had to send wait a minute theres a problem he looked at me so did the cop with the fishing pole that switch could be a selfdestruct sinclair was supposed to be a secretive bastard or the field might hold considerable potential energy something might go blooey ordaz sighed we must risk it gil we have measured the rotation of the dead mans wristwatch one hour per seven seconds fingerprints footprints laundry marks residual body odor stray eyelashes all disappearing at an hour per seven seconds he gestured and the cop moved in and began trying to hook the switch already we may never know just when he was killed said ordaz the tip of the pole wobbled in large circles steadied beneath the switch made contact i held my breath the pole bowed the switch snapped up and suddenly the violet glow was gone valpredo reached into the field warily as if the air might be redhot nothing happened and he relaxed then ordaz began giving orders and quite a lot happened two men in lab coats drew a chalk outline around the mummy and the poker they moved the mummy onto a stretcher put the poker in a plastic bag and put it next to the mummy i said have you identified that im afraid so said ordaz raymond sinclair had his own autodoc did he those things are expensive yes raymond sinclair was a wealthy man he owned the top two floors of this building and the roof according to records in his doc he had a new set of bud teeth implanted two months ago ordaz pointed to the mummy to the skinnedback dry lips and the buds of new teeth that were just coming in right that was sinclair that brain had made miracles and someone had smashed it with a wroughtiron rod the intersteller drive that glowing goldberg device or had it been still inside his head i said well have to get whoever did it well have to even so even so no more miracles we may have her already julio said i looked at him there is a girl in the autodoc we think she is dr sinclairs greatniece it was a standard drugstore autodoc a thing like a giant coffin with walls a foot thick and a headboard covered with dials and red and green lights the girl lay faceup her face calm her breathing shallow sleeping beauty her arms were in the guts of the doc hidden by bulky rubbery sleeves she was lovely enough to stop my breath soft brown hair showing around the electrode cap small perfect nose and mouth smooth paleblue skin shot with silver threads that last was an evening dye job without it the impact of her would have been much lessened the blue shade varied slightly to emphasize the shape of her body and the curve of her cheekbones the silver lines varied too being denser in certain areas guiding the eye in certain directions to the tips of her breasts or across the slight swell of abdominal muscle to a lovely oval navel shed paid high for that dye job but she would be beautiful without it some of the headboard lights were red i punched for a readout and was jolted the doc had been forced to amputate her right arm gangrene she was in for a hell of a shock when she woke up all right i said shes lost her arm that doesnt make her a killer ordaz asked if she were homely would it help laughed you question my dispassionate judgment men have died for less even so i thought he could be right there was good reason to think that the killer was now missing an arm what do you think happened here gil well any way you look at it the killer had to want to take sinclairs ah time machine with him its priceless for one thing for another it looks like he tried to set it up as an alibi which means that he knew about it before he came here id been thinking this through say he made sure some people knew where he was a few hours before he got here he killed sinclair within range of the call it a generator turned it on he figured sinclairs own watch would tell him how much time he was gaining afterward he could set the watch back and leave with the generator thered be no way the police could tell that sinclair wasnt killed six hours earlier or any number you like yes but he did not do that there was that line hanging from the switch he must have turned it on from outside the field probably because he didnt want to sit with the body for six hours after hed turned it on hed bump his nose itd be like trying to walk through a wall going from field time to normal time so he turned it off stepped out of range and used that nylon line to turn it on again he probably made the same mistake valpredo did he thought he could step back in and turn it off ordaz nodded in satisfaction exactly it was very important for him or her to do that otherwise he would have no alibi and no profit if he continued to try to reach into the field yah he could lose the arm to gangrene thatd be convenient for us wouldnt it hed be easy to find but look julio the girl could have done the same thing to herself trying to help sinclair he might not have been that obviously dead when she got home he might even have been alive ordaz pointed out i shrugged in point of fact she came home at oneten in her own car which is still in the carport there are cameras mounted to cover the landing pad and carport dr sinclairs security was thorough this girl was the only arrival last night there were no departures from the roof you mean gil there are only two ways to leave these apartments one is from the roof and the other is by elevator from the lobby the elevator is on this floor and it was turned off it was that way when we arrived there is no way to override that control from elsewhere in this building so someone could have taken it up here and turned it off afterward or sinclair could have turned it off before he was killed i see what you mean either way the killer has to be still here i thought about that i didnt like its taste no it doesnt fit how could she be bright enough to work out that alibi then dumb enough to lock herself in with the body ordaz shrugged she locked the elevator before killing her greatuncle she did not want to be interrupted surely that was sensible after she hurt her arm she must have been in a great hurry to reach the doe one of the red lights turned green i was glad for that she didnt look like a kifier i said half to myself nobody looks like a killer when hes asleep no but she is where a killer ought to be quй lбstima we went back to the living room i called arm headquarters and had them send a truck the machine hadnt been touched while we waited i borrowed a camera from valpredo and took pictures of the setup in situ relative positions of the components might be important the lab men were in the brown grass using aerosol sprays to turn fingerprints white and give a vivid yellow glow to faint traces of blood they got plenty of fingerprints on the machine none at all on the poker there was a puddle of yellow in the grass where the mummys head had been and a long yellow snail track ending at the business end of the poker it looked like someone had tried to drag the poker out of the field after it had fallen sinclairs apartments were roomy and comfortable and occupied the entire top floor the lower floor was the laboratory where sinclair had produced his miracles i went through it with valpredo it wasnt that impressive it looked like an expensive hobby setup these tools would assemble components already fabricated but they would not build anything complex except for the computer terminal that was like a little womb with a recline chair inside a degree wraparound holovision screen and enough banked controls to fly the damn thing to alpha centaurus the secrets there must be in that computer but i didnt try to use it wed have to send an arm programmer to break whatever failsafe codes sinclair had put in the memory banks the truck arrived we dragged sinclairs legacy up the stairs to the roof in one piece the parts were sturdily mounted on their frame and the stairs were wide and not too steep i rode home in the back of the truck studying the generator that massive piece of silver had something of the look of bird in flight a triangle operated on by a topology student with wires at what were still the corners i wondered if it was the heart of the machine or just a piece of misdirection was i really riding with an interstellar drive sinclair could have started that rumor himself to cover whatever this was or there was no law against his working two projects simultaneously i was looking forward to beras reaction jackson bera came upon us moving it through the halls of arm headquarters he trailed along behind us nonchalant we pulled the machine into the main laboratory and started checking it against the holos id taken in case something had been jarred loose bera leaned against the doorjamb watching us his eyes gradually losing interest until he seemed about to go to sleep jackson bera was a big dark man crowned with a carefully tended sphere of puffy black hair id met him three years ago when i returned from the asteroids and joined the arm maybe hed wondered why i kept staring at his hair but a belter who wore his hair in that fashion would have needed a spacesuit helmet the size of a cannibals cooking pot hed been twenty then and two years an arm but his father and grandfather had both been arms much of my training had come from bera and as i learned to hunt men who hunt other men i had watched what it was doing to him an arm needs empathy he needs the ability to piece together a picture of the mind of his prey but bera had too much empathy i remember his reaction when kenneth graham suicided with a batteryoperated droud a single killing surge of current through the plug in his skull and down the wire to the pleasure center of his brain bera had been twitchy for weeks and the anubis case early last year when we realized what the man had done bera had been close to killing him on the spot i wouldnt have blamed him last year bera had had enough hed gone into the technical end of the business his days of hunting organleggers were finished he was now running the arm laboratory he had to want to know what this oddball contraption was i kept waiting for him to ask and he watched faintly smiling finally it dawned on me he thought it was a practical joke something id cobbled together for his own discomfiture i said bera and he looked at me brightly and said hey man what is it you ask the most embarrassing questions right i can understand your feeling that way but what is it i love it its neat but what is this that you have brought me i told him all i knew such as it was when i finished he said it doesnt sound much like a new space drive oho you heard that too did you no it doesnt unless id been wondering since i first saw it maybe its supposed to accelerate a fusion explosion youd get greater efficiency in a fusion drive nope they get better than ninety percent now and that widget looks heavy he reached to touch the bent silver triangle gently with long tapering fingers huh well well dig out the answers good luck im going back to sinclairs place why the action is here often enough hed heard me talking wistfully of joining an interstellar colony he must know how id feel about a better drive for the interstellar slowboats its like this i said weve got the generator but we dont know anything about it we might wreck it im going to have a whack at finding someone who knows something about sinclairs generator meaning whoever tried to steal it sinclairs killer if you say so but he looked dubious he knew me too well he said i understand theres a mother hunt in the offing oh he smiled just a rumor you guys are lucky when my dad first joined the business of the arm was mostly mother hunts the organleggers hadnt really got organized yet and the fertility laws were new if we hadnt enforced them nobody would have obeyed them at all sure and people threw rocks at your father bera those days are gone they could come back having children is basic bera i did not join the arm to hunt unlicensed parents i waved and left before he could answer i could do without the call to duty from bera who was through with hunting men and mothers id had a good view of the rodewald building dropping toward the roof this morning i had a good view now from my commandeered taxi this time i was looking for escape paths there were no balconies on sinclairs floors and the windows were flush to the side of the building a cat burglar would have trouble with them they didnt look like theyd open i tried to spot the cameras ordaz had mentioned as the taxi dropped toward the roof i couldnt find them maybe they were mounted in the elms why was i bothering i hadnt joined the arm to chase mothers or machinery or common murderers id joined to pay for my arm my right arm after it had been sheared clean to the shoulder in an industrial accident in the belt i hadnt had the money to buy a new arm from the belt organ banks id come back to earth because my citizens medical insurance would pay for it there later id found that my new arm was not part of some condemned criminal it had reached the world organ bank facility via a captured organleggers cache some honest citizen had died unwillingly on a city slidewalk and now his arm was part of me id joined the arm to hunt organleggers the arm doesnt deal in murder per se the machine was out of my hands now a murder investigation wouldnt keep me out of a mother hunt and id never met the girl i knew nothing of her beyond the fact that she was where a killer ought to be was it just that she was pretty poor janice when she woke up for a solid month id wakened to that same stunning shock the knowledge that my right arm was gone the taxi settled vaipredo was waiting below i speculated cars werent the only things that flew but anyone flying one of those tricky ductedfan flycycles over a city where he could fall on a pedestrian wouldnt have to worry about a murder charge theyd feed him to the organ banks regardless and anything that flew would have left traces anywhere but on the landing pad itself it would crush a rosebush or a bonsai tree or be flipped over by an elm the taxi took off in a whisper of air valpredo was grinning at me the thinker whats on your mind i was wondering if the killer could have come down on the carport roof he turned to study the situation there are two cameras mounted on the edge of the roof if his vehicle was light enough sure he could land there and the cameras wouldnt spot him roof wouldnt hold a car though anyway nobody did it how do you know ill show you by the way we inspected the camera system were pretty sure the cameras werent tampered with and nobody came down from the roof last night except the girl nobody nobody even landed here until seven this morning look here we had reached the concrete stairs that led down into sinclairs apartments valpredo pointed at a glint of light in the sloping ceiling at heart level this is the only way down the camera would get anyone coming in or out it might not catch his face but itd show if someone had passed it takes sixty frames a minute i went on down a cop let me in ordaz was on the phone the screen showed a young man with a deep tan with shock showing through the tan ordaz waved at me a shushing motion and went on talking then youll be here in fifteen minutes that will be a great help to us please land on the roof we are still working on the elevator he hung up and turned to me that was andrew porter janice sinclairs lover he tells us that he and janice spent the evening at a party she dropped him off at his home around one oclock then she came straight home if thats her in the doc i think it must be mr porter says she was wearing a blue skin dye job ordaz was frowning he put on a most convincing act if it was that i think he really was not expecting any kind of trouble he was surprised that a stranger answered shocked when he learned of dr sinclairs death and horrified when he learned that janice had been hurt with the mummy and the generator removed the murder scene had become an empty circle of brown grass marked with random streaks of yellow chemical and outlines of white chalk we had some luck said ordaz todays date is june dr sinclair was wearing a date watch it registered january if we switched the machine off at ten minutes to ten which we did and if it was registering an hour for every seven seconds that passed outside the field then the field must have gone on around one oclock last night give or take a margin of error then if the girl didnt do it she must have just missed the killer exactly what about the elevator could it have been jiggered no we took the workings apart it was on this floor and locked by hand nobody could have left by elevator why did you trail off like that ordaz shrugged embarrassed this peculiar machine really does bother me gil i found myself thinking suppose it can reverse time then the killer could have gone down in an elevator that was going up he laughed with me i said in the first place i dont believe a word of it in the second place he didnt have the machine to do it with unless he made his escape before the murder damnit now youve got me doing it i would like to know more about the machine beras investigating it now ill let you know as soon as we learn anything and id like to know more about how the killer couldnt possibly have left he looked at me details could someone have opened a window no these apartments are forty years old the smog was still bad when they were built dr sinclair apparently preferred to depend on his airconditioning how about the apartment below i presume it has a different set of elevators yes of course it belongs to howard rodewald the owner of this building of this chain of buildings in fact at the moment he is in europe his apartment has been lent to friends there are no stairs down to there no we searched these apartments thoroughiy all right we know the killer had a nylon line because he left a strand of it on the generator could he have climbed down to rodewalds balcony from the roof thirty feet yes i suppose so ordazs eyes sparked we must look into that there is still the matter of how he got past the camera and whether he could have gotten inside once he was on the balcony yah try this mr hamilton another question how did he expect to get away he watched for my reaction which must have been satisfying because it was a damn good question you see if janice sinclair murdered her greatuncle then neither question applies if we are looking for someone else we have to assume that his plans misfired he had to improvise uhhuh he could still have been planning to use rodewalds balcony and that would mean he had a way past the camera of course he did the generator right if he came to steal the generator and hed have to steal it regardless because if we found it here it would shoot his alibi skyhigh so hed leave it on while he trundled it up the stairs say it took him a minute thats only an eighth of a second of normal time one chance in eight that the camera would fire and it would catch nothing but a streak uhoh what is it he had to be planning to steal the machine is he really going to lower it to rodewalds balcony by rope i think it unlikely said ordaz it weighed more than eighty pounds he could have moved it upstairs the frame would make it portable but to lower it by rope wed be looking for one hell of an athlete at least you will not have to search far to find him we assume that your hypothetical killer came by elevator do we not yah nobody but janice sinclair had arrived by the roof last night the elevator was programmed to allow a number of people to enter it and to turn away all others the list is short dr sinclair was not a gregarious man youre checking them out whereabouts alibis and so forth of course theres something else you might check on i said but drew porter came in and i had to postpone it porter came casual in a wellworn onepiece jumpsuit he must have pulled on while running for a taxi the muscles rolled like boulders beneath the loose fabric and his belly muscles showed like the plates on an armadillo surfing muscles the sun had bleached his hair nearly white and burned him as brown as jackson bera youd think a tan that dark would cover for blood draining out of a face but it doesnt where is she he demanded he didnt wait for an answer he knew where the doc was and he went there we trailed in his wake ordaz didnt push he waited while porter looked down at janice then punched for a readout and went through it in detail porter seemed calmer then and his color was back he turned to ordaz and said what happened mr porter did you know anything of dr sinclairs latest project the timecompressor thing yah he had it set up in the living room when i got here yesterday evening right in the middle of that circle of dead grass any connection when did you arrive oh about six we had some drinks and uncle ray showed off his machine he didnt tell us much about it just showed what it could do porter showed us flashing white teeth it worked that thing can compress time you could live your whole life in there in two months watching him move around inside the field was like trying to keep track of a hummingbird worse he struck a match when did you leave about eight we had dinner at czillers and listen what happened here there are some things we need to know first mr porter were you and janice together for all of last evening were there others with you sure we had dinner alone but afterward we went to a kind of party on the beach at santa monica friend of mine has a house there ill give you the address some of us wound up at czillers house of irish coffee around midnight then janice flew me home you have said that you are janices lover doesnt she live with you no im her steady lover you might say but i dont have any strings on her he seemed embarrassed she lives here with uncle ray lived oh hell he glanced into the doe look the readout said shell be waking up any minute can i get her a robe of course we followed porter to janices bedroom where he picked out a peachcolored negligee for her i was beginning to like the guy he had good instincts an evening dye job was not the thing to wear on the morning of a murder and hed picked one with long loose sleeves her missing arm wouldnt show so much you call him uncle ray said ordaz yah because janice did he did not object was he gregarious gregarious well no but we liked each other we both liked puzzles you understand we traded murder mysteries and jigsaw puzzles listen this may sound silly but are you sure hes dead regrettably yes he is dead and murdered was he expecting someone to arrive after you left yes he said so no but he was wearing a shirt and pants when it was just us he usually went naked older people dont do that much porter said but uncle ray was in good shape he took care of himself have you any idea whom he might have been expecting no not a woman not a date i mean maybe someone in the same business behind him janice moaned porter was hovering over her in a flash he put a hand on her shoulder and urged her back lie still love well have you out of there in a jiffy she waited while he disconnected the sleeves and other paraphernalia she said what happened they havent told me yet porter said with a flash of anger be careful sitting up youve had an accident what kind of ok itll be all right my arm porter helped her out of the doc her arm ended in pink flesh two inches below the shoulder she let porter drape the robe around her she tried to fasten the sash quit when she realized she was trying to do it with one hand i said listen i lost my arm once she looked at me so did porter im gil hamilton with the un police you really dont have anything to worry about see i raised my right arm opened and closed the fingers the organ banks dont get much call for arms as compared to kidneys for instance you probably wont even have to wait i didnt it feels just like the arm i was born with and it works just as well how did you lose it she asked ripped away by a meteor i said not without pride while i was asteroid mining in the belt i didnt have to tell her that wed caused the meteor cluster ourselves by setting the bomb wrong on an asteroid we wanted to move ordaz said to her do you remember how you lost your own arm yes she shivered could we go somewhere where i could sit down i feel a bit weak we moved to the living room janice dropped onto the couch a bit too hard it might have been shock or the missing arm might be throwing her balance off i remembered she said uncle rays dead isnt he yes i came home and found him that way lying next to that time machine of his and the back of his head all bloody i thought maybe he was still alive but i could see the machine was going it had that violet glow i tried to get hold of the poker i wanted to use it to switch the machine off but i couldnt get a grip my arm wasnt just numb it wouldnt move you know you can wiggle your toes when your foots asleep but i could get my hand on the handle of the damn poker but when i tried to pull it just slid off you kept trying for a while then i backed away to think it over i wasnt about to waste any time with uncle ray maybe dying in there my arm felt stone dead i guess it was wasnt it she shuddered rotting meat it smelled that way and all of a sudden i felt so weak and dizzy like i was dying myself i barely made it into the doc good thing you did i said the blood was leaving porters face again as he realized what a close thing it had been ordaz said was your greatuncle expecting visitors last night i think so why do you think so i dont know he just acted that way we are told that you and some friends reached czillers house of irish coffee around midnight is that true i guess so we had some drinks then i took drew home and came home myself straight home yes she shivered i put the car away and went downstairs i knew something was wrong the door was open then there was uncle ray lying next to that machine i knew better than to just run up to him hed told us not to step into the field oh then you should have known better than to reach for the poker well yes i could have used the tongs she said as if the idea had just occurred to her its just as long i didnt think of it there wasnt time dont you understand he was dying in there or dead yes of course did you interfere with the murder scene in any way she laughed bitterly i suppose i moved the poker about two inches then when i felt what was happening to me i just ran for the doc it was awful like dying instant gangrene said porter ordaz said you did not for example lock the elevator damn i should have thought of that no we usually do when we lock up for the night but i didnt have time porter said why the elevator was locked when we arrived ordaz told him porter ruminated that then the killer must have left by the roof youll have pictures of him ordaz smiled apologetically that is our problem no cars left the roof last night only one car arrived that was yours miss sinclair but said porter and he stopped he thought it through again did the police turn on the elevator again after they got here no the killer could not have left after we got here oh what happened was this said ordaz around fivethirty this morning the tenants in he stopped to remember in a called the building maintenance man about a smell like rotting meat coming through the airconditioning system he spent some time looking for the source but once he reached the roof it was obvious he porter pounced he reached the roof in what kind of vehicle mr steeves says that he took a taxi from the street there is no other way to reach dr sinclairs private landing pad is there no but why would he do that perhaps there have been other times when strange smells came from dr sinclairs laboratory we will ask him do that mr steeves followed the smell through the doctors open door he called us he waited for us on the roof what about his taxi porter was hot on the scent maybe the killer just waited till that taxi got here then took it somewhere else when steeves finished with it it left immediately after steeves had stepped out he had a taxi clicker if he wanted another the cameras were n it the entire time it was on the roof ordaz paused you see the problem apparently porter did he ran both hands through his whiteblond hair i think we ought to put off discussing it until we know more he meant janice janice looked puzzled she hadnt caught on but ordaz nodded at once and stood up very well there is no reason miss sinclair cannot go on living here we may have to bother you again he told her for now our condolences he made his exit i trailed along so unexpectedly did drew porter at the top of the stairs he stopped ordaz with a big hand around the inspectors upper arm youre thinking janice did it arent you ordaz sighed what choice have i i must consider the possibility she didnt have any reason she loved uncle ray shes lived with him on and off these past twelve years she hasnt got the slightest reason to kill him is there no inheritance his expression went sour all right yes shell have some money coming but janice wouldnt care about anything like that yeess still what choice have i everything we now know tells us that the killer could not have left the scene of the killing we searched the premises immediately there was only janice sinclair and her murdered uncle porter bit back an answer chewed it he must have been tempted amateur detective one step ahead of the police all the way yes watson these gendarmes have a talent for missing the obvious but he had too much to lose porter said and the maintenance man steeves ordaz lifted one eyebrow yes of course we shall have to investigate mr steeves how did he get that call from uh a bedside phone or pocket phone maybe he was already on the roof i dont remember that he said but we have pictures of his taxi landing he had a taxi clicker he could have just called it down one more thing i said and porter looked at me hopefully porter what about the elevator it had a brain in it didnt it it wouldnt take anyone up unless they were on its list or unless uncle ray buzzed down theres an intercom in the lobby but at that time of night he probably wouldnt let anyone up unless he was expecting him so if sinclair was expecting a business associate he or she was probably in the tape how about going down would the elevator take you down to the lobby if you werent in the tape id think so it would said ordaz the elevator screens entrances not departures then why didnt the killer use it i dont mean steeves necessarily i mean anyone whoever it might have been why didnt he just go down in the elevator whatever he did do that had to be easier they looked at each other but they didnt say anything okay i turned to ordaz when you check out the people in the tape see if any of them shows a damaged arm the killer might have pulled the same stunt janice did ruined her arm trying to turn off the generator and id like a look at whos in that tape very well said ordaz and we moved toward the squad car under the carport we were out of earshot when he added how does the arm come into this mr hamilton why your interest in the murder aspect of this case i told him what id told bera that sinclairs killer might be the only living expert on sinclairs time machine ordaz nodded what hed really wanted to know was could i justify giving orders to the los angeles police department in a local matter and i had answered yes the rather simpleminded security system in sinclairs elevator had been built to remember the thumbprints and the facial bone structures of up to one hundred people most people know about a hundred people plus or minus ten or so but sinclair had listed only a dozen including himself raymond sinclair andrew porter janice sinclair edward sinclair sr edward sinclair iii hans drucker george steeves pauline urthiel bernath peterfi lawrence muhammad ecks bertha hall and muriel sandusky valpredo had been busy hed been using the police car and its phone setup as an office while he guarded the roof we know who some of these are he said edward sinclair iii for instance is edward seniors grandson janices brother hes in the belt in ceres making something of a name for himself as an industrial designer edward senior is raymonds brother he lives in kansas city hans drucker and bertha hall and muriel sandusky all live in the greater los angeles area we dont know what their connection with sinclair is pauline urthiel and bernath peterfi are technicians of sorts ecks is sinclairs patent attorney i suppose we can interview edward hi by phone ordaz made a face a phone call to the belt wasnt cheap these others i said may i make a suggestion of course send me along with whoever interviews ecks and peterfi and urthiel they probably knew sinclair in a business sense and having an arm along will give you a little more clout to ask a little more detailed questions i could take those assignments valpredo volunteered very well ordaz still looked unhappy if this list were exhaustive i would be grateful unfortunately we must consider the risk that dr sinclairs visitor simply used the intercom in the lobby and asked to be let in bernath peterfi wasnt answering his phone we got pauline urthiel via her pocket phone a brusque contralto voice no picture wed like to talk to her in connection with a murder investigation would she be at home this afternoon no she was lecturing that afternoon but would be home around six ecks answered dripping wet and not smiling so sorry to get you out of a shower mr ecks wed like to talk to you in connection with a murder investigation sure come on over whos dead valpredo told him sinclair ray sinclair youre sure we were oh lord listen he was working on something important an interstellar drive if it works out if theres any possibility of salvaging the hardware i reassured him and hung up if sinclairs patent attorney thought it was a star drive maybe it was doesnt sound like hes trying to steal it said valpredo no and even if hed got the thing he couldnt have claimed it was his if hes the killer thats not what he was after we were moving at high speed policecar speed the car was on automatic of course but it could need manual override at any instant valpredo concentrated on the passing scenery and spoke without looking at me you know you and the detective inspector arent looking for the same thing i know im looking for a hypothetical killer julios looking for a hypothetical visitor it could be tough to prove there wasnt one but if porter and the girl were telling the truth maybe julio can prove the visitor didnt do it which would leave the girl he said whose side are you on nobodys all ive got is interesting questions he looked at me sideways but youre pretty sure the girl didnt do it yah why i dont know maybe because i dont think shes got the brains it wasnt a simple killing shes sinclairs niece she cant be a complete idiot heredity doesnt work that way maybe im kidding myself maybe its her arm shes lost an arm shes got enough to worry about i know and i borrowed the car phone to dig into records in the arm computer pauline urthiel born paul urthiel phd in plasma physics university of california at ervine sex change and legal name change six years ago shed been in competition for a nobel prize for research into the charge suppression effect in the slaver disintegrator height weight married lawrence muhammad ecks had kept her maiden name separate residences bernath peterfi phd in subatomics and related fields mit diabetic height weight application for exemption to the fertility laws denied married divorced lives alone lawrence muhammad ecks masters degree in physics member of the bar height l weight artificial left arm vicepresident cet valpredo said funny how the human arm keeps cropping up in this case yah including one human arm who didnt really belong there ecks has a masters maybe he could have talked people into thinking the generator was his or maybe he thought he could he didnt try to snow us suppose he blew it last night he wouldnt necessarily want the generator lost to humanity now would he how did he get out i didnt answer ecks lived in a tapering tower almost a mile high at one time lindstetters needle must have been the biggest thing ever built before they started with the arcologies we landed on a pad a third of the way up then took a drop shaft ten floors down he was dressed when he answered the door in blazing yellow pants and a net shirt his skin was very dark and his hair was a puffy black dandelion with threads of gray in it on the phone screen i hadnt been able to tell which arm was which and i couldnt now he invited us in sat down and waited for the questions where was he last night could he produce an alibi it would help us considerably sorry nope i spent the night going through a rather tricky case you wouldnt appreciate the details i told him i would he said actually it involves edward sinclair rays greatnephew hes a belt immigrant and hes done an industrial design that could be adapted to earth swivel for a chemical rocket motor the trouble is its not that different from existing designs its just better his belt patent is good but the un laws are different you wouldnt believe the legal tangles is he likely to lose out no it just might get sticky if a firm called firestorm decides to fight the case i want to be ready for that in a pinch i might even have to call the kid back to earth id hate to do that though hes got a heart condition had he made any phone calls say to a computer during his night of research ecks brightened instantly oh sure constantly all night okay ive got an alibi no point in telling him that such calls could have been made from anywhere valpredo asked do you have any idea where your wife was last night no we dont live together she lives three hundred stories over my head weve got an open marriage maybe too open he added wistfully there seemed a good chance that raymond sinclair was expecting a visitor last night did ecks have any idea he knew a couple of women said ecks you might ask them bertha hall is about eighty about rays age shes not too bright not by rays standards but shes as much of a physicalfitness nut as he is they go backpacking play tennis maybe sleep together maybe not i can give you her address then theres muriel something he had a crush on her a few years ago shed be thirty now i dont know if they still see each other or not did sinclair know other women ecks shrugged whom did he know professionally oh lord thats an endless list do you know anything about the way ray worked he didnt wait for an answer he used computer setups mostly any experiment in his field was likely to cost millions or more what he was good at was setting up a computer analogue of an experiment that would tell him what he wanted to know take oh im sure youve heard of sinclair molecule chain hell yes wed used it for towing in the belt nothing else was light enough and strong enough a loop of it was nearly invisibly fine but it would cut steel he didnt start working with chemicals until he was practically finished he told me he spent four years doing molecular designs by computer analogue the tough part was the ends of the molecule chain until he got that the chain would start disintegrating from the endpoints the minute you finished making it when he finally had what he wanted he hired an industrial chemical lab to make it for him thats what im getting at ecks continued he hired other people to do the concrete stuff once he knew what he had and the people he hired had to know what they were doing he knew the top physicists and chemists and field theorists everywhere on earth and in the belt like pauline like bernath peterfi yah pauline did some work for him once i dont think shed do it again she didnt like having to give him all the credit shed rather work for herself i dont blame her could he think of anyone who might want to murder raymond sinclair ecks shrugged id say that was your job ray never liked splitting the credit with anyone maybe someone he worked with nursed a grudge or maybe someone was trying to steal this latest project of his mind you i dont know much about what he was trying to do but if it worked it would have been fantastically valuable and not just in money valpredo was making noises like he was about finished i said do you mind if i ask a personal question go ahead your arm howd you lose it born without it nothing in my genes just a bad prenatal situation i came out with an arm and a turkey wishbone by the time i was old enough for a transplant i knew i didnt want one you want the standard speech no thanks but im wondering how good your artificial arm is im carrying a transplant myself ecks looked me over carefully for signs of moral degeneration i suppose youre also one of those people who keep voting the death penalty for more and more trivial offenses no i after all if the organ banks ran out of criminals youd be in trouble you might have to live with your mistakes no im one of those people who blocked the second corpsicle law kept that group from going into the organ banks and i hunt organleggers for a living but i dont have an artificial arm and i suppose the reason is that im squeamish squeamish about being part mechanical ive heard of that ecks said but you can be squeamish the other way too what there is of me is all me not part of a dead man ill admit the sense of touch isnt quite the same but its just as good and look he put a hand on my upper forearm and squeezed it felt like the bones were about to give i didnt scream but it took an effort that isnt all my strength he said and i could keep it up all day this arm doesnt get tired he let go i asked if he would mind my examining his arms he didnt but then ecks didnt know about my imaginary hand my imaginary hand was a side effect of the accident that had cost me my own right arm it turned out that i had latent psi powers esper and pk they were weak the heaviest thing i could lift in earths gravity was a shot glass half full they were further restricted by my imagination i couldnt sense anything farther away than the reach of a missing right arm but with the real arm missing i had developed a ghost arm and when i replaced the real arm with a transplant the imaginary arm had remained it could reach through solid matter i probed the advanced plastics of eckss false arm the bone and muscle structure of the other it was the real arm i was interested in when we were back in the car valpredo said well nothing wrong with his real arm i said no scars valpredo nodded but the bubble of accelerated time wouldnt hurt plastic and batteries i thought and if hed been planning to lower eighty pounds of generator two stories down on a nylon line his artificial arm had the strength for it we called peterfi from the car he was in he was a small man darkcomplexioned mild of face his hair straight and shiny black around a receding hairline his eyes blinked and squinted as if the light were too bright and he had the scruffy look of a man who has slept in his clothes i wondered if we had interrupted an afternoon nap yes he would be glad to help the police in a murder investigation peterfis condominium was a slab of glass and concrete set on a santa monica cliff face his apartment faced the sea expensive but worth it for the view he said showing us to chairs in the living room the draperies were closed against the afternoon sun peterfi had changed clothes i noticed the bulge in his upper left sleeve where an insulin capsule and automatic feeder had been anchored to the bone of the arm well what can i do for you i dont believe you mentioned who had been murdered valpredo told him he was shocked oh my ray sinclair but theres no telling how this will affect and he stopped suddenly please go on said valpredo we were working on something together something revolutionary an interstellar drive he was startled he debated with himself then yes it was supposed to be secret we admitted having seen the machine in action how did a timecompression field serve as an interstellar drive thats not exactly what it is peterfi said again he debated with himself then there have always been a few optimists around who thought that just because mass and inertia have always been associated in human experience it need not be a universal law what ray and i have done is to create a condition of low inertia you see an inertialess drive peterfi nodded vigorously at me essentially yes is the machine intact if not i reassured him on that point thats good i was about to say that if it had been destroyed i could recreate it i did most of the work of building it ray preferred to work with his mind not with his hands had peterfi visited sinclair last night no i had dinner at a restaurant down the coast then came home and watched the holo wall what times do i need alibis for he asked jokingly valpredo told him the joking look turned into a nervous grimace no hed left the mail shirt just after nine he couldnt prove his whereabouts after that time had he any idea who might have wanted to murder raymond sinclair peterfi was reluctant to make outright accusations surely we understood it might be someone he had worked with in the past or someone hed insulted ray thought most of humanity were fools or we might look into the matter of rays brothers exemption valpredo said edward sinclairs exemption what about it id really prefer that you get the story from someone else you may know that edward sinclair was refused the right to have children because of an inherited heart condition his grandson has it too there is some question as to whether he really did the work that earned him the exemption but that must have been forty to fifty years ago how could it figure in a murder now peterfi explained patiently edward had a child by virtue of an exemption to the fertility laws now there are two grandchildren suppose the matter came up for review his grandchildren would lose the right to have children theyd be ifiegitimate they might even lose the right to inherit valpredo was nodding yali well look into that all right i said you applied for an exemption yourself not long ago i suppose your uh yes my diabetes it doesnt interfere with my life at all do you know how long weve been using insulin to handle diabetes almost two hundred years what does it matter if im a diabetic if my children are he glared at us demanding an answer he got none but the fertility laws refuse me children do you know that i lost my wife because the board refused me an exemption i deserved it my work on plasma flow in the solar photosphere well id hardly lecture you on the subject would i but my work can be used to predict the patterns of proton storms near any gtype star every colony world owes something to my work that was an exaggeration i thought proton storms affected mainly asteroidal mining operations why dont you move to the belt i asked theyd honor you for your work and they dont have fertility laws i get sick off earth its biorhythms it has nothing to do with diabetes half of humanity suffers from biorhythm upset i felt sorry for the guy you could still get the exemption for your work on the inertialess drive wouldnt that get you your wife back i dont know i doubt it its been two years in any case theres no telling which way the board will jump i thought id have the exemption last time do you mind if i examine your arms he looked at me what id like to examine your arms that seems a most curious request why there seems a good chance that sinclairs killer damaged his arm last night now ill remind you that im acting in the name of the un police if youve been hurt by the side effects of a possible space drive one that might be used by human colonists then youre concealing evidence in a i stopped because peterfi had stood up and was taking off his tunic he wasnt happy but he stood still for it his arms looked all right i ran my hands along each arm bent the joints massaged the knuckles inside the flesh i ran my imaginary fingertips along the bones three inches below the shoulder joint the bone was knotted i probed the muscles and tendons your right arm is a transplant i said it must have happened about six months ago he bridled you may not be aware of it but urgery to reattach my own arm would show the same scars is that what happened anger made his speech more precise yes i was performing an experiment and there was an explosion the arm was nearly severed i tied a tourniquet and got to a doe before i collapsed any proof of this i doubt it i never told anyone of this accident and the doe wouldnt keep records in any case i think the burden of proof would be on you uhhuh peterfi was putting his tunic back on are you quite finished here im deeply sorry for ray sinclairs death but i dont see what it could possibly have to do with my stupidity of six months ago i didnt either we left back in the car it was fivetwenty we could pick up a snack on the way to pauline urthiels place i told valpredo i think it was a transplant and he didnt want to admit it he must have gone to an organlegger why would he do that valpredo wondered its not that tough to get an arm from the public organ banks i chewed that youre right but if it was a normal transplant therell be a record well it could have happened the way he said it did uhhuh how about this he was doing an experiment and it was illegal something that might cause pollution in a city or even something to do with radiation he picked up radiation burns in his arm if hed gone to the public organ banks hed have been arrested that would fit too can we prove it on him i dont know id like to he might tell us how to find whomever he dealt with lets do some digging maybe we can find out what he was working on six months ago pauline urthiel opened the door the instant we rang hi i just got in myself can i make you drinks we refused she ushered us into a smallish apartment with a lot of foldintotheceiling furniture a sofa and coffee table were showing now the rest existed as outlines on the ceiling the view through the picture window was breathtaking she lived near the top of lindstetters needle some three hundred stories up from her husband she was tall and slender with a facial structure that would have been effeminate on a man on a woman it was a touch masculine the wellformed breasts might be flesh or plastic but surgically implanted in either case she finished making a large drink and joined us on the couch and the questions started had she any idea who might have wanted raymond sinclair dead not really how did he die someone smashed in his skull with a poker valpredo said if he wasnt going to mention the generator neither was i how quaint her contralto turned acid his own poker too i presume out of his own fireplace rack what youre looking for is a traditionalist she peered at us over the rim of her glass her eyes were large the lids decorated in semipermanent tattoo as a pair of flapping un flags that doesnt help much does it you might try whoever was working with him on whatever his latest project was that sounded like peterfi i thought but valpredo said would he necessarily have a collaborator he generally works alone at the beginning but somewhere along the line he brings in people to figure out how to make the hardware and make it he never made anything real by himself it was all just something in a computer bank it took someone else to make it real and he never gave credit to anyone then his hypothetical collaborator might have found out how little credit he was getting for his work and but urthiel was shaking her head im talking about a psychotic not someone whos really been cheated sinclair never offered anyone a share in anything he did he always made it damn plain what was happening i knew what i was doing when i set up the fyrestop prctotype for him and i knew what i was doing when i quit it was all him he was using my training not my brain i wanted to do something original something me did she have any idea what sinclairs present project was my husband would know larry ecks lives in this same building hes been dropping cryptic hints and when i want more details he has this grin she grinned herself suddenly youll gather im interested but he wont say time for me to take over or wed never get certain questions asked im an ar vi what im about to tell you is secret i said and i told her what we knew of sinclairs generator maybe valpredo was looking at me disapprovingly maybe not we know that the field can damage a human arm in a few seconds what we want to know i said is whether the killer is now wandering around with a halfdecayed hand or arm or foot for that she stood and pulled the upper half of her body stocking down around her waist she looked very much a real woman if i hadnt known and why would it matter these days the sexchange operation is elaborate and perfect hell with it i was on duty valpredo was looking nonchalant waiting for me i examined both her arms with my eyes and my three hands there was nothing not even a bruise my legs too i said not if you can stand on them next question could an artificial arm operate within the field larry you mean larry youre out of your teeny mind take it as a hypothetical question she shrugged your guess is as good as mine there arent any experts on inertialess fields there was one hes dead i reminded her all i know is what i learned watching the gray lensman show in the holo wall when i was a kid she smiled suddenly that old space opera valpredo laughed you too i used to watch that show in study hall on a little pocket phone one day the principal caught me at it sure and then we outgrew it too bad those inertialess ships im sure an inertialess ship wouldnt behave like those did you couldnt possibly get rid of the timecompression effect she took a long pull on her drink set it down and said yes and no he could reach in but you see the problem the nerve impulses that move the motors in larrys arm theyre coming into the field too slowly sure but if larry closed his fist on something say and reached into the field with it it would probably stay closed he could have brained ray with no he couldnt the poker wouldnt be moving any faster than a glacier ray would just dodge and he couldnt pull a poker out of the field either his fist wouldnt close on it after it was inside but he could have tried and still left with his arm intact i thought did urthiel know anything of the circumstances surrounding edward sinclairs exemption oh thats an old story she said sure i heard about it how could it possibly have anything to do with with rays murder i dont know i confessed im just thrashing around well youll probably get it more accurately from the un files edward sinclair did some mathematics on the fields that scoop up interstellar hydrogen for the cargo ramrobots he was a shooin for the exemption thats the surest way of getting it make a breakthrough in anything that has anything to do with the interstellar colonies every time you move one man away from earth the population drops by one what was wrong with it nothing anyone could prove remember the fertility restriction laws were new then they couldnt stand a real test but edward sinclairs a pure math man he works with number theory not practical applications ive seen edwards equations and theyre closer to something ray would come up with and ray didnt need the exemption he never wanted children so you think i dont care which of them redesigned the ramscoops diddling the fertility board like that that takes brains she swallowed the rest of her drink set the glass down breeding for brains is never a mistake its no challenge to the fertility board either the people who do the damage are the ones who go into hiding when their shots come due have their babies then scream to high heaven when the board has to sterilize them too many of those and we wont have fertility laws anymore and that she didnt have to finish had sinclair known that pauline urthiel was once paul she stared now just what the bleep has that got to do with anything id been toying with the idea that sinclair might have been blackmailing urthiel with that information not for money but for credit in some discovery theyd made together just thrashing around i said well all right i dont know if ray knew or not he never raised the subject but he never made a pass either and he must have researched me before he hired me and say listen larry doesnt know id appreciate it if you wouldnt blurt it out okay see he had his children by his first wife im not denying him children maybe he married me because i had a touch of urn masculine insight maybe but he doesht know it and he doesnt want to i dont know whether hed laugh it off or kill me i had valpredo drop me off at arm headquarters this peculiar machine really does bother me gil well it should julio the los angeles police were not trained to deal with a mad scientists nightmare running quietly in the middle of a murder scene granted that janice wasnt the type not for this murder but drew porter was precisely the type to evolve a perfect murder around sinclairs generator purely as an intellectual exercise he might have guided her through it he might even have been there and used the elevator before she shut it off it was the one thing he forgot to tell her not to shut off the elevator or he outlined a perfect murder to her purely as a puzzle never dreaming shed go through with it badly or one of them had killed janices uncle on impulse no telling what hed said that one of them couldnt tolerate but the machine had been right there in the living room and drew had wrapped his big arm around janice and said wait dont do anything yet lets think this out take any of these as the true state of affairs and a prosecutor could have a hell of a time proving it he could show that no killer could possibly have left the scene of the crime without janice sinclairs help and therefore but what about that glowing thing that time machine built by the dead man could it have freed a killer from an effectively locked room how could a judge know its power well could it bera might know the machine was running i caught the faint violet glow as i stepped into the laboratory and a flickering next to it and then it was off and jackson bera stood suddenly beside it grinning silent waiting i wasnt about to spoil his fun i said well is it an interstellar drive yes a warm glow spread through me i said okay its a lowinertia field said bera things inside lose most of their inertia not their mass just the resistance to movement ratio of about five hundred to one the interface is sharp as a razor we think there are quantum levels involved uhhuh the field doesnt affect time directly no it i shouldnt say that who the hell knows what time really is it affects chemical and nuclear reactions energy release of all kinds but it doesnt affect the speed of light you know its kind of kicky to be measuring the speed of light at three hundred and seventy miles per second with honest instruments damnit id been halfhoping it was an ftl drive i said did you ever find out what was causing that blue glow bera laughed at me watch hed rigged a remote switch to turn the machine on he used it then struck a match and flipped it toward the blue glow as it crossed an invisible barrier the match flared violetwhite for something less than an eyeblink i blinked it had been like a flashbulb going off i said oh sure the machinerys warm right the blue glow is just infrared radiation being boosted to violet when it enters normal time bera shouldnt have had to tell me that embarrassed i changed the subject but you said it was an interstellar drive yah its got drawbacks said bera we cant just put a field around a whole starship the crew would think theyd lowered the speed of light but so what a slowboat doesnt get that close to light speed anyway theyd save a little trip time but theyd have to live through it five hundred times as fast how about if you just put the field around your fuel tanks bera nodded thats what theyll probably do leave the motor and the lifesupport system outside you could carry a godawful amount of fuel that way well its not our department someone elsell be designing the starships he said a bit wistfully have you thought of this thing in relation to robbing banks or espionage if a gang could afford to build one of these jobs they wouldnt need to rob banks he ruminated i hate making anything this big a un secret but i guess youre right the average government could afford a whole stable of the things thus combining james bond and the flash he rapped on the plastic frame want to try it sure i said heart to brain thud whatre you doing youll get us all killed i knew we should never have put you in charge of things i stepped up to the generator waited for bera to scamper beyond range then pulled the switch everything turned deep red bera became as a statue well here i was the second hand on the wall clock had stopped moving i took two steps forward and rapped with my knuckles rapped hell it was like rapping on contact cement the invisible wall was tacky i tried leaning on it for a minute or so that worked fine until i tried to pull away and then i knew id done something stupid i was embedded in the interface it took me another minute to pull loose and then i went sprawling backward id picked up too much inward velocity and it all came into the field with me at that id been lucky if id leaned there a little longer id have lost my leverage id have been sinking deeper and deeper into the interface unable to yell to bera building up more and more velocity outside the field i picked myself up and tried something safer i took out my pen and dropped it it fell normally ft sec see field time which scratched one theory as to how the killer had thought he would be leaving i switched the machine off something id like to try i told bera can you hang the machine in the air say by a cable around the frame what have you got in mind i want to try standing on the bottom of the field bera looked dubious it took us twenty minutes to set it up bera took no chances he lifted the generator about five feet since the field seemed to center on that oddly shaped piece of silver that put the bottom of the field just a foot in the air we moved a stepladder into range and i stood on the stepladder and turned on the generator i stepped off walking down the side of the field was like walking in progressively stickier taffy when i stood on the bottom i could just reach the switch my shoes were stuck solid i could pull my feet out of them but there was no place to stand except in my own shoes a minute later my feet were stuck too i could pull one loose but only by fixing the other ever more deeply in the interface i sank deeper and all sensation left the soles of my feet it was scary though i knew nothing ter rible could happen to me my feet wouldnt die out there they wouldnt have time but the interface was up to my ankles now and i started to wonder what kind of velocity they were building up out there i pushed the switch up the lights flashed bright and my feet slapped the floor hard bera said well learn anything yah i dont want to try a real test i might wreck the machine what kind of real test dropping it forty stories with the field on quit worrying im not going to do it right you arent you know this timecompression effect would work for more than just spacecraft after youre on the colony world you could raise fullgrown cattle from frozen fertilized eggs in just a few minutes mmm yak the happy smile flashing white against darkness the infinity look in beras eyes bera liked playing with ideas think of one of these mounted on a truck say on jinx you could explore the shoreline regions without ever worrying about the bandersnatchi attacking theyd never move fast enough you could drive across any alien world and catch the whole ecology laid out around you none of it running from the truck predators in midleap birds in midflight couples in courtship or larger groups i think that habit is unique to humans he looked at me sideways you wouldnt spy on people would you or shouldnt i ask that fivehundredtoone ratio is that constant he came back to here and now we dont know our theory hasnt caught up to the hardware its supposed to fit i wish to hell we had sinclairs notes you were supposed to send a programmer out there he came back bera said viciously clayton wolfe clay says the tapes in sinclairs computer were all wiped before he got there i dont know whether to believe him or not sinclair was a secretive bastard wasnt he yah one false move on clays part and the computer might have wiped everything but he says different hmmm he says the computer was blank a newborn mind all ready to be taught gil is that possible could whoever killed sinclair have wiped the tapes sure why not what he couldnt have done is left afterward i told him a little about the problem its even worse than that because as ordaz keeps pointing out he thought hed be leaving with the machine i thought he might have been planning to roll the generator off the roof step off with it and float down but that wouldnt work not if it falls five hundred times as fast hed have been killed losing the machine maybe saved his life but how did he get out bera laughed at my frustration couldnt his niece be the one sure she could have killed her greatuncle for the money but i cant see how shed have a motive to wipe the computer unless something maybe never mind did bera ever miss this kind of manhunting but i wasnt ready to discuss this yet i didnt know enough tell me more about the machine can you vary that fivehundredtoone ratio he shrugged we tried adding more batteries we thought it might boost the field strength we were wrong it just expanded the boundary a little and using one less battery turns it off completely so the ratio seems to be constant and there do sзem to be quantum levels involved well know better when we build another machine how so well there are all kinds of good questions said bera what happens when the fields of two generators intersect they might just add but maybe not that quantum effect and what happens if the generators are right next to each other operating in each others accelerated time the speed of light could drop to a few feet per second throw a punch and your hand gets shorter thatd be kicky all right dangerous too man wed better try that one on the moon i dont see that look with one machine going infrared light comes out violet if two machines were boosting each others performance what kind of radiation would they put out anything from x rays to antimatter particles an expensive way to build a bomb well but its a bomb you can use ovcr and over again i laughed we did find you an expert i said you may not need sinclairs tapes bernath peterfi says he was working with sinclair he could be lying more likely he was working for him under contract but at least he knows what the machine does bera seemed relieved at that he took down peterfis address i left him there in the laboratory playing with his new toy the file from city morgue was sitting on my desk open waiting for me since this morning two dead ones looked up at me through sockets of blackened bone but not accusingly they had patience they could wait the computer had processed my search pattern i braced myself with a cup of coffee then started leafing through the thick stack of printout when i knew what had burned away two human faces id be close to knowing who find the tool find the killer and the tool must be unique or close to it lasers lasers more than half the machines suggestions seemed to be lasers incredible the way lasers seemed to breed and mutate throughout human industry laser radar the laser guidance system on a tunneling machine some suggestions were obviously unworkable and one was a lot too workable a standard hunting laser fires in pulses which is what makes it sporting but it can be jiggered for a much longer pulse or even a continuous burst assassins have been doing it for years set a hunting laser for a long pulse and put a grid over the lens the mesh has to be optically fine on the order of angstroms now the beam will spread as it leaves the grid a second of pulse will vaporize the grid leaving no evidence the grid would be no bigger than a contact lens if you didnt trust your aim you could carry a pocketful of them the gridequipped laser would be less efficient as a rifle with a silencer is less efficient but the grid would make the laser impossible to identify i thought about it and got cold chills assassination is already a recognized branch of politics if this got out but that was the trouble someone seemed to have thought of it already if not someone would someone always did i wrote up a memo for lucas garner aside from his being my boss i couldnt think of anyone better qualified to deal with this kind of sociological problem nothing else in the stack of printout caught my eye later id have to go through it in detail for now i pushed it aside and punched for messages bates had sent me another report theyd finished the autopsies on the two dead ones nothing new but records had identified the fingerprints two missing persons disappeared six and eight months ago aha i knew that pattern i didnt even look at the names i just skipped on to the gene coding right the fingerprints did not match the genes all twenty fingertips must be transplants and the mans scalp was a transplant his own hair had been blond i leaned back in my chair gazing fondly at the corpses organleggers both of them with all that raw material available most organleggers change their fingerprints constantly and their retina prints but wed never get prints from those charred eyeballs so weird weapon or no they were arm business and we still didnt know what had killed them or who it could hardly have been a rival gang for one thing there was no competition plenty of business for everyone left alive after the arm had swept through them last year for another why had they been dumped on a city slidewalk rival organleggers would have taken them apart for their own organ banks waste not want not on that same philosophy i had something to be deeply involved in when the mother hunt broke sinclairs death wasnt arm business and his timecompression field wasnt in my field this was both i wondered what end of the business they had been in the file gave their estimated ages forty for the man fortythree for the woman two years margin of error too old to be raiding the city streets for donors that takes youth and muscle i billed them as doctors culturing the transplants and doing the operations or salesmen charged with quietly letting prospective clients know where they could get an operation without waiting two years for the public organ banks to come up with the material so theyd tried to sell someone a new kidney and been killed for their impudence that would make the killer a hero so why hide them for three days then drag them out onto a city slidewalk in the dead of night because theyd been killed with a fearsome new weapon i looked at the burned faces and thought fearsome right whatever did that had to be strictly a murder weapon just as the optical grid over a laser lens would be strictly a murder technique so a secretive scientist and his deformed assistant fearful of rousing the wrath of the villagers had dithered over the bodies for three days then disposed of them in that clumsy fashion because they panicked when the bodies started to smell maybe but a prospective client neednt have used his shiny new terror weapon he had only to call the cops after they were gone it read better if the killer was a prospective donor hed fight with anything he could get his hands on i flipped back to full shots of the bodies they looked to be in good condition not much flab you dont collect a donor by putting an armlock on him you use a needle gun but you still need muscle to pick up the body and move it to your car and you have to do that damn quick hmmm someone knocked at my door i shouted come on in drew porter came in he was big enough to fill the office and he moved with a grace he must have learned on a board mr hamilton id like to talk to you sure what about he didnt seem to know what to do with his hands he looked grimly determined youre an arm he said youre not actually investigating uncle rays murder thats right isnt it thats right our concern is with the generator coffee yes thanks but you know all about the killing i thought id like to talk to you straighten out some of my own ideas go ahead i punched for two coffees ordaz thinks janice did it doesnt he probably im not good at reading ordazs mind but it seems to narrow down to two distinct groups of possible killers janice and everyone else heres your coffee janice didnt do it he took the cup from me gulped at it set it down on my desk and forgot about it janice and x i said but x couldnt have left in fact x couldnt have left even if hed had the machine he came for and we still dont know why he didnt just take the elevator he scowled as he thought that through say he had a way to leave he said he wanted to take the machine he had to want that because he tried to use the machine to set up an alibi but even if he couldnt take the machine hed still use his alternate way out why itd leave janice holding the bag if he knew janice was coming home if he didnt hed be leaving the police with a lockedroom mystery lockedroom mysteries are good clean fun but i never heard of one happening in real life in fiction they usually happen by accident i waved aside his protest never mind ou argue well but what was his alternate escape route porter didnt answer would you care to look at the case against janice sinclair shes the only one who could have done it he said bitterly but she didnt she couldnt kill anyone not that coldblooded prepackaged way with an alibi all set up and a weird machine at the heart of it look that machine is too complicated for janice no she isnt the type but no offense intended you are he grinned at that me well maybe i am but why would i want to youre in love with her i think youd do anything for her aside from that you might enjoy setting up a perfect murder and theres the money youve got a funny idea of a perfect murder say i was being tactful he laughed at that all right say i set up a murder for the love of janice damn it if she had that much hate in her i wouldnt love her why would she want to kill uncle ray i dithered as to whether to drop that on him decided yes do you know anything about edward sinclairs exemption yah janice told me something about he trailed off just what did she tell you i dont have to say that was probably intelligent all right i said for the sake of argument lets assume it was raymond sinclair who worked out the math for the new rвinrobot scoops and edward took the credit with raymonds connivance it was probably raymonds idea how would that sit with edward id think hed be grateful forever said porter janice says he is maybe but people are funny arent they being grateful for fifty years could get on a mans nerves its not a natural emotion youre so young to be so cynical porter said pityingly im trying to think this out like a prosecution lawyer if these brothers saw each other too often edward might get to feeling embarrassed around raymond hed have a hard time relaxing with him the rumors wouldnt help oh yes there are rumors ive been told that edward couldnt have worked out those equations be cause he doesnt have the ability if that kind of thing got back to edward how would he like it he might even start avoiding his brother then ray might remind brother edward of just how much he owed him and thats the kiss of death janice says no janice could have picked up the hate from her father or she might have started worrying about what would happen if uncle ray changed his mind one day it could happen anytime if things were getting strained between the elder sinclairs so one day she shut his mouth porter snarled in his throat im just trying to show you what youre up against one more thing the killer may have wiped the tapes in sinclairs computer oh porter thought that over yak janice could have done that just in case there were some notes in there notes on ed sinclairs ramscoop field equations but look x could have wiped those tapes too stealing the generator doesnt do him any good unless he wipes it out of uncle rays computer true enough shall we get back to the case against x with pleasure he dropped into a chair watching his face smooth out i added and with great relief i said lets not call him x call him k for killer we already had an ecks involved and his family name probably had been x once upon a time weve been assuming k set up sinclairs timecompression effect as an alibi porter smiled its a lovely idea elegant as a mathematician would say remember i never saw the actual murder scene just chalk marks it was macabre like a piece of surrealism a very bloody practical joke k could have deliberately set it up that way if his mind is twisted enough if hes that twisted he probably escaped by running himself down the garbage disposal pauline urthiel thought he might be a psychotic someone who worked with sinclair who thought he wasnt getting enough credit like peterfi i thought or pauline herself i like the alibi theory it bothers me too many people knew about the machine how did he expect to get away with it lawrence ecks knew about it peterfi knew enough about the machine to rebuild it from scratch or so he says you and janice saw it in action say hes crazy then say he hated uncle ray enough to kill him and then set him up in a makeshift dali painting hed stifi have to get out porter was working his hands together the muscles bulged and rippled in his arms this whole thing depends on the elevator doesnt it if the elevator hadnt been locked and on uncle rays floor there wouldnt be a problem so so say he did leave by elevator then janice came home and she automatically called the elevator up and locked it she does that without thinking she had a bad shock last night this morning she didnt remember and this evening it could come back to her porter looked up sharply i wouldnt youd better think long and hard before you do if ordaz is sixty percent sure of her now hell be a hundred percent sure when she lays that on him porter was working his muscles again in a low voice he said its possible isnt it sure itd make things a lot simpler too but if janice said it now shed sound like a liar but its possible i give up sure its possible then whos our killer there wasnt any reason i shouldnt consider the question it wasnt my case at all i did and presently i laughed did i say itd make things simpler man it throws the case wide open anyone could have done it ub anyone but steeves steeves wouldnt have had any reason to come back this morning porter looked glum steeves wouldnt have done it anyway he was your suggestion oh in pure mechanical terms hes the only one left who didnt need a way out but you dont know steeves hes a big brawny guy with a beer belly and no brains a nice guy you understand i like him but if he ever killed anyone itd be with a beer bottle and he was proud of uncle ray he liked having raymond sinclair in his building okay forget steeves is there anyone youd particularly like to pin it on bearing in mind that now anyone could get in to do it not anyone anyone in the elevator computer plus anyone uncle ray might have let up well he shook his head you make a hell of an amateur detective youre afraid to accuse anyone he shrugged smiling embarrassed what about peterfi now that sinclairs dead he can claim they were equal partners in the uh time machine and he tumbled to it awfully fast the moment valpredo told him sinclair was dead peterfi was his partner sounds typical could he be teffing the truth id say hes lying doesnt make him a killer though no what about ecks if he didnt know peterfi was involved he might have tried the same thing does he need money hardly and hes been with uncle ray for longer than ive been alive maybe he was after the immunity hes had kids but not by his present wife he may not know she cant have children pauline likes children ive seen her with them porter looked at me curiously i dont see having children as that big a motive youre young then theres pauline herself sinclair knew something about her or sinclair might have told ecks and ecks blew up and killed him for it porter shook his head in red rage i cant think of anything thatd make larry do that pauline maybe larry no but i thought there are men who would kill if they learned that their wives had gone through a sex change i said whoever killed sinclair if he wasnt crazy he had to want to take the machine one way might have been to lower it by rope i trailed off eighty pounds lowered two stories by nylon line eckss steel and plastic arm or the muscles now rolling like boulders in porters arms i thought porter could have managed it or maybe hed thought he could he hadnt actually had to go through with it my phone rang it was ordaz have you made any progress on the time machine im told that dr sinclairs computer was wiped yah but thats all right were learning quite a lot about it if we run into trouble bernath peterfi can help us he helped build it where are you now at dr sinclairs apartment we had some further questions for janice sinclair porter twitched i said all right well be right over drew porters with me i hung up and turned to porter does janice know shes a suspect no please dont tell her unless you have to im not sure she could take it i had the taxi drop us at the lobby level of the rodewald building when i told porter i wanted a ride in the elevator he just nodded the elevator to raymond sinclairs penthouse was a box with a seat in it it would have been comfortable for one cozy for two good friends with me and porter in it it was crowded porter hunched his knees and tried to fold into himself he seemed used to it he probably was most apartment elevators are like that why waste room on an elevator shaft when the same space can go into apartments it was a fast ride the seat was necessary it was two gee going up and a longer period at half a gee slowing down while lighted numbers flickered past numbers but no doors hey porter if this elevator jammed would there be a door to let us out he gave me a funny look and said he didnt know why worry about it if it jammed at this speed itd come apart like a handful of shredded lettuce it was just claustrophobic enough to make me wonder k hadnt left by elevator why not because the ride up had terrified him brain to memory dig into the medical records of that list of suspects see if any of them have records of claustrophobia too bad the elevator brain didnt keep records we could find out which of them had used the boxlike elevator once or not at all in which case wed be looking for by now i was thinldng in terms of three groups ki had killed sinclair then tried to use the lowinertia field as both loot and alibi was crazy he hadnt wanted the generator at all except as a way to set up his macabre tableau k was janice and drew porter janice was there when the doors slid open she was wan and her shoulders slumped but when she saw porter she smiled like sunlight and ran to him her run was wobbly thrown off by the missing weight of her arm i stepped past them shook hands with ordaz and vaipredo and looked around the wide brown circle was stifi there in the grass marked with white chalk and the yellow chemical that picks up bloodstains white outlines to mark the vanished body the generator the poker something knocked at the back door of my mind i looked from the chalk outlines to the open elevator to the chalk and a third of the puzzle fell into place so simple we were looking for ki and i had a pretty good idea of who he was ordax was asking how did you happen to arrive with mr porter he came to my office we were talking about a hypothetical killer i lowered my voice slightly a killer who isnt janice very good did you reason out how he must have left not yet but play the game with me say there was a way porter and janice joined us their arms about each others waists ordaz said very well we assume there was a way out did he improvise it and why did he not use the elevator he must have had it in mind when he got here he didnt use the elevator because he was planning to take the machine it wouldnt have fit they all stared at the chalk outline of the generator so simple porter said yah then he used it anyway and left you a lockedroom mystery that may have been his mistake ordaz said grimly when we know his escape route we may find that only one man could have used it but of course we do not even know that the route exists i changed the subject have you got everyone on the elevator tape identified valpredo dug out his spiral notebook and ffipped to the jotted names of those people permitted to use sinclairs elevator he showed it to porter have you seen this porter studied it no but i can guess what it is lets see hans drucker was janices lover before i came along we still see him in fact he was at that beach party last night at the randalls he flopped on the randalls rug last night said valpredo him and four others one of the better alibis oh hans wouldnt have anything to do with this janice cxclaimed the idea horrified her porter was still looking at the list you know about most of these people already bertha hall and muriel sandusky were lady friends of uncle rays bertha goes backpacking with him we interviewed them too valpredo told me you can hear the tapes if you like no just give me the gist i already know who the killer is ordaz raised his eyebrows at that and janice said oh good who which question i answered with a secretive smile nobody actually called me a liar valpredo said muriel sanduskys been living in england for almost a year married hasnt seen sinclair in years big beautiful redhead she had a crush on uncle ray once said janice and vice versa i think his lasted longer bertha hall is something else again valpredo continued sinclairs age and in good shape wiry she says that when sinclair was on the home stretch of a project he gave up everything friends social life exercise afterward hed call bertha and go backpacking with her to catch up with himself he called her two nights ago and set a date for next monday i said alibi nope really janice was indignant why weve known bertha since i was that high if you know who killed uncle ray why dont you just say so out of this list i sure do given certain assumptions but i dont know how he got out or how he expected to or whether we can prove it on him i cant accuse anyone now its a damn shame he didnt lose his arm reaching for that poker porter looked frustrated so did janice you would not want to face a lawsuit ordaz suggested delicately what of sinclairs machine its an inertialess drive sort of lower the inertia time speeds up beras already learned a lot about it but itll be a while before he can really you were saying ordaz asked when i trailed off sinclair was finished with the damn thing sure he was said porter he wouldnt have been showing it around otherwise or calling bertha for a backpacking expedition or spreading rumors about what he had yah sure he knew everything he could learn about that machine julio you were cheated it all depends on the machine and the bastard did wrack up his arm and we can prove it on him we were piled into ordazs police car me and ordaz and valpredo and porter valpredo had set the thing for conventional speeds so he wouldnt have to worry about driving wed turned the interior chairs to face each other this is the part i wont guarantee i said sketching rapidly in valpredos borrowed notebook but remember he had a length of line with him he must have expected to use it heres how he planned to get out i sketched in a box to represent sinclairs generator a stick figure clinging to the frame a circle around them to represent the field a bow knot tied to the machine with one end trailing up through the field see it he goes up the stairs with the field on the camera has about one chance in eight of catching him while hes moving at that speed he wheels the machine to the edge of the roof ties the line to it throws the line a good distance away pushes the generator off the roof and steps off with it the line falls at thirtytwo feet per second squared normal time plus a little more because the machine and the killer are tugging down on it not hard because theyre in a lowinertia field by the time the killer reaches the ground hes moving at something more than uh twelve hundred feet per second over five hundred uh say three feet per second internal time and hes got to pull the machine out of the way fast because the rope is going to hit like a bomb it looks like it would work said porter yah i thought for a while that he could just stand on the bottom of the field a little fooling with the machine cured me of that hed smash both legs but he could hang onto the frame its strong enough but he didnt have the machine valpredo pointed out thats where you got cheated what happens when two fields intersect they looked blank its not a trivial question nobody knows the answer yet but sinclair did he had to he was finished he must have had two machines the killer took the second machine ordaz said ahh porter said whos k we were settling on the carport valpredo knew where we were but he didnt say anything we left the taxi and headed for the elevators thats a lot easier i said he expected to use the machine as an alibi thats silly considering how many people knew it existed but if he didnt know that sinclair was ready to start showing it to people specifically to you and janice whos left ecks knew only that it was some kind of interstellar drive the elevator was uncommonly large we piled into it and said valpredo theres the matter of the arm i think ive got that figured too i gave you enough clues i told him peterfi was a long time answering our buzz he may have studied us through the door camera wondering why a parade was marching through his hallway then he spoke through the grid yes what is it police open up said valpredo do you have a warrant i stepped forward and showed my ident to the camera im an arm i dont need a warrant open up we wont keep you long one way or another he opened the door he looked neater now than he had this afternoon despite informal brown indoor pajamas just you he said he let me in then started to close the door on the others valpredo put his hand against the door hey its okay i said peterfi was smaller than i was and i had a needle gun valpredo shrugged and let him close the door my mistake i had twothirds of the puzzle and i thought i had it all peterfi folded his arms and said well what is it you want to search this time would you like to examine my legs no lets start with the insulin feeder on your upper arm certainly he said and startled hell out of me i waited while he took off his shirt unnecessary but he neednt know that then ran my imaginary fingers through the insulin feed the reserve was nearly full i should have known i said damnit you got six months worth of insulin from the organlegger his eyebrows went up organlegger he pulled loose is this an accusation mr hamilton im taping this for my attorney and i was setting myself up for a lawsuit the hell with it yah its an accusation you killed sinclair nobody else could have tried that alibi stunt he looked puzzled honestly i thought why not if anyone else had tried to set up an alibi with sinclairs generator bernath peterfl would have told the police all about what it was and how it worked but you were the only one who knew that until last night when he started showing it around there was only one thing he could say to that kind of logic and he said it still recording mr hamilton record and be damned there are other things we can check your grocerydelivery service your water bill he didnt flinch he was smiling was it a bluff i sniffed the air six months worth of body odor emitted in one night by a man who hadnt taken more than four or five baths in six months but his airconditioning was too good the curtains were open now to the night and the ocean theyd been closed this afternoon and hed been squinting but it wasnt evidence the lights he had only one light burning now and so what the big powerful campout flashlight sitting on a small table against a wall i hadnt even noticed it this afternoon now i was sure i knew what hed used it for but how to prove it groceries if you didnt buy six months worth of groceries last night you must have stolen them sinclairs generators perfect for thefts well check the local supermarkets and link the thefts to me how he was too bright to have kept the generator but come to think of it where could he abandon it he was guilty he couldnt have covered all his tracks peterfi ive got it he believed me i saw it in the way he braced himself maybe hed worked it out before i did i said your contraceptive shots must have worn off six months early your organlegger couldnt get you that hes got no reason to keep contraceptives around youre dead peterfi i might as well be damn you hamilton youve cost me the exemption they wont try you right away we cant afford to lose whats in your head you know too much about sinclairs generator our generator we built it together yak you wont try me at all he said more calmly are you going to tell a court how the killer left rays apartment i dug out my sketch and handed it to him while he was studying it i said how did you like going off the roof you couldnt have known it would work he looked up his words came slowly reluctantly i guess he had to tell someone and it didnt matter now by then i didnt care my arm hung like a dead rabbit and it stank it took me three minutes to reach the ground i thought id die on the way whered you dig up an organlegger that fast his eyes called me a fool cant you guess three years ago i was hoping diabetes could be cured by a transplant when the government hospitals couldnt help me i went to an organlegger i was lucky he was stifi in business last night he drooped it seemed that all the anger went out of him then it was six months in the field waiting for the scars to heal in the dark i tried taking that big campout flashlight in with me he laughed bitterly i gave up after i noticed that the walls were smoldering the wall above that little table had a scorched look i should have wondered about that earlier no baths he was saying i was afraid to use up that much water no exercise practically but i had to eat didnt i and all for nothing will you tell us how to find the organlegger you dealt with this is your big day isnt it hamilton all right why not it wont do you any good why not he looked up at me very strangely then he spun about and ran he caught me flatfooted i jumped after him i didnt know what he had in mind there was only one exit to the apartment excluding the balcony and he wasnt headed there he seemed to be trying to reach a blank wall with a small table set against it a campout flashlight on it and a drawer in it i saw the drawer and thought gun and i surged after him and got him by the wrist just as he reached the wall switch above the table i threw my weight backward and yanked him away from there and then the field came on i held a hand and arm up to the elbow beyond was a fluttering of violet light peterfi thrashing frantically in a lowinertia field i hung on while i tried to figure out what was happening the second generator was here somewhere in the wall the switch seemed to have been recently plastered in now that i saw it close figure a closet on the other side and the generator in it peterfi must have drilled through the wall and fixed that switch sure what else did he have to do with six months of spare time no point in yelling for help peterfis soundprooflng was too modern and if i didnt let go peterfi would die of thirst in a few nunutes peterfis feet came straight at my jaw i threw myself down and the edge of a boot sole nearly tore my ear off i rolled forward in time to grab his ankle there was more violet fluttering and his other leg thrashed wildly outside the field too many conflicting nerve impulses were pouring into the muscles the leg flopped about like something dying if i didnt let go hed break it in a dozen places hed knocked the table over i didnt see it fall but suddenly it was lying on its side the part with the drawer must have been well beyond the field the flashlight lay just beyond the violet fluttering of his hand okay he couldnt reach the drawer his hand wouldnt get coherent signals if it left the field i could let go of his ankle hed turn off the field when he got thirsty enough i almost did then something jarred together in my head and brain to hand hang on for our lives dont you understand hes trying to reach the flashlight i hung on peterfi suddenly stopped thrashing about in there he lay on his side his face and hands glowing blue i was trying to decide whether he was playing possum when the blue light behind his face quietly went out i let them in they looked it over valpredo went off to search for a pole to reach the light switch ordaz asked was it necessary to kill him i pointed to the flashlight he didnt get it i was overconfident i said i shouldnt have come in alone hes already killed two people with that flashlight the organleggers who gave him his new arm he didnt want them talking so he burned their faces off and then dragged them out onto a slidewalk he probably tied them to the generator and then used the line to pull it with the field on the whole setup wouldnt weigh more than a couple of pounds with a flashlight ordaz pondered of coutse it would have been putting out five hundred times as much light a good thing you thought of that in time well i do spend more time dealing with these oddball sciencefiction devices than you do and welcome to them said ordaz
