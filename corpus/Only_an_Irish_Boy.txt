to the door the speaker was a boy of fifteen handsomely dressed and to judge from his air and tone a person of considerable consequence in his own opinion at least the person addressed was employed in the stable of his father colonel anthony preston and so inferior in social condition that master godfrey always addressed him in imperious tones john looked up and answered respectfully master godfrey your horse is sick of the disease and your father left orders that he wasnt to go out on no account its my horse said godfrey i intend to take him out maybe its yours but your father paid for him none of your impudence john answered godfrey angrily am i master or are you i should like to know neither im thinking said john with a twinkle in his eye its your father thats the master im master of the horse anyway so saddle him at once the colonel would blame me objected john if you dont ill report you and get you dismissed ill take the risk master godfrey said the servant goodhumoredly the colonel wont be so unreasonable as to send me away for obeying his own orders here john was right and godfrey knew it and this vexed him the more he had an inordinate opinion of himself and his own consequence and felt humiliated at being disobeyed by a servant without being able to punish him for his audacity this feeling was increased by the presence of a third party who was standing just outside the fence as this third party is our hero i must take a separate paragraph to describe him he was about the age of godfrey possibly a little shorter and stouter he had a freckled face full of good humor but at the same time resolute and determined he appeared to be one who had a will of his own but not inclined to interfere with others though ready to stand up for his own rights in dress he compared very unfavorably with the young aristocrat who was biting his lips with vexation in fact though he is my hero his dress was far from heroic he had no vest and his coat was ragged as well as his pants he had on a pair of shoes two or three times too large for him they had not been made to order but had been given him by a gentleman of nearly double his size and fitted him too much he wore a straw hat for it was summer but the brim was semidetached and a part of his brown hair found its way through it now godfrey was just in the mood for picking a quarrel with somebody and as there was no excuse for quarreling any further with john he was rather glad to pitch into the young stranger who are you he demanded in his usual imperious tone and with a contraction of the brow only an irish boy answered the other with a droll look and a slight brogue then what business have you leaning against my fence again demanded godfrey imperiously shure i didnt know it was your fence then you know now quit leaning against it why should i now i dont hurt it do i no matter i told you to go away we dont want any beggars here shure i dont see any said the other boy demurely what are you but a beggar shure im a gintleman of indepindent fortune you look like it said godfrey disdainfully where do you keep it here said the irish boy tapping a bundle which he carried over his shoulder wrapped in a red cotton handkerchief with a stick thrust through beneath the knot whats your name andy burke whats yours i dont feel under any obligations to answer your questions said godfrey haughtily dont you then what made you ask me thats different you are only an irish boy and who are you i am the only son of colonel anthony preston returned godfrey impressively are you now i thought you was a royal duke or maybe queen victorias oldest boy fellow you are becoming impertinent faith i didnt mean it you look so proud and gintale that its jist a mistake i made you knew that we had no dukes in america said godfrey suspiciously if we had now youd be one of them said andy why what makes you say so youre jist the picture of the earl of barleycorns ildest son that i saw before i left ireland godfrey possessed so large a share of ridiculous pride that he felt pleased with the compliment though he was not clear about its sincerity where do you live he asked with a slight lowering of his tone where do i live shure i dont live anywhere now but im going to live in the village my mother came here a month ago why didnt you come with her i was workin with a farmer but the work gave out and i came home maybe ill find work here i think i know where your mother lives said john who had heard the conversation she lives up the road a mile or so in a little house with two rooms its where old jake barlow used to live thank you sir i guess ill be goin then as my motherll be expectin me do you know if shes well and a look of anxiety came over the boys honest goodnatured face the question was addressed to john but of this godfrey was not quite sure he thought the inquiry was made of him and his pride was touched what should i know of your mother you beggar he said with a sneer i dont associate with such low people do you mane my mother said andy quickly and he too looked angry and threatening yes i do what are you going to do about it demanded godfrey youd better take it back said andy his goodhumored face now dark with passion do you think i am afraid of such a beggar as you sneered godfrey you appear to forget that you are speaking to a gentleman shure i didnt know it returned andy hotly youre no gentleman if you insult my mother and if youll come out here for a minute ill give you a bating john said godfrey angrily will you drive that beggar away now johns sympathies were rather with andy than with his young master he had no great admiration for godfrey having witnessed during the year he had been in his fathers employ too much of the boys arrogance and selfishness to feel much attachment for him had he taken any part in the present quarrel he would have preferred espousing the cause of the irish boy but that would not have been polite and he therefore determined to preserve his neutrality that aint my business master godfrey he said you must fight your own battles go away from here said godfrey imperiously advancing toward that part of the fence against which andy burke was leaning will you take back what you said agin my mother no i wont then youre a blackguard if you are a rich mans son the blood rushed to godfreys face on the instant this was a palpable insult what he a rich mans son the only son and heir of colonel anthony preston with his broad acres and ample bank account he to be called a blackguard by a low irish boy his passion got the better of him and he ran through the gate his eyes flashing fire bent on exterminating his impudent adversary chapter ii a skirmish andy burke was not the boy to run away from an opponent of his own size and age neither did he propose to submit quietly to the thrashing which godfrey designed to give him he dropped his stick and bundle and squared off scientifically at his aristocratic foe godfrey paused an instant before him im going to give you a thrashing he said the worst thrashing you ever had are you now asked andy undismayed come on thin im ready for you youre an impudent young ruffian so are you godfreys aristocratic blood boiled at this retort and he struck out at andy but the latter knew what was coming and swift as a flash warded it off and fetched godfrey a blow full upon his nose which started the blood now the pain and the sight of the blood combined filled him with added fury and he attempted to seize andy around the waist and throw him but here again he was foiled the young irish boy evaded his grasp and seizing him in turn by an adroit movement of the foot tripped him up godfrey fell heavily on his back andy withdrew a little and did not offer to hold him down as godfrey would have been sure to do under similar circumstances have you got enough he asked that wasnt fair exclaimed godfrey jumping up hastily deeply mortified because he had been worsted in the presence of john who sooth to say rather enjoyed his young masters overthrow he rushed impetuously at andy but he was blinded by his own impetuosity and his adversary who kept cool and selfpossessed had of course the advantage so the engagement terminated as before godfrey was stretched once more on the sidewalk he was about to renew the assault however when there was an interruption this interruption came in the form of colonel preston himself who was returning from a business meeting of citizens interested in establishing a savings bank in the village whats all this godfrey he called out in a commanding tone godfrey knew that when his father spoke he must obey and he therefore desisted from the contemplated attack he looked up at his father and said sulkily i was punishing this irish boy for his impertinence john grinned a little at this way of putting it and his father said it looked very much as if he were punishing you i didnt get fair hold said godfrey sulkily so he was impertinent was he what did he say he said i was no gentleman andy burke listened attentively to what was said but didnt attempt to justify himself as yet i have sometimes had suspicions of that myself said his father quietly though godfrey was an only son his father was sensible enough to be fully aware of his faults if he was indulged it was his mother not his father that was in fault colonel preston was a fair and just man and had sensible views about home discipline but he was overruled by his wife whose character may be judged from the fact that her son closely resembled her she was vain haughty and proud of putting on airs she considered herself quite the finest lady in the village but condescended to associate with the wives of the minister the doctor and a few of the richer inhabitants but even with them she took care to show that she regarded herself superior to them all she was therefore unpopular as was her son among his companions however these two stood by each other and mrs preston was sure to defend godfrey in all he did and complained because his father did not do the same i didnt think youd turn against me and let a low boy insult me complained godfrey why do you call him low because hes only an irish boy some of our most distinguished men have been irish boys or of irish descent i dont think you have proved your point hes a beggar im not a beggar exclaimed andy speaking for the first time i never begged a penny in all my life look at his rags said godfrey scornfully you would be in rags too if you had to buy your own clothes i think i should respect you very much more under the circumstances returned his father the colonels agivin it to him thought john with a grin twont do the young master any harm what is your name inquired colonel preston turning now to our hero as his son seemed to have no more to say andy burke do you live here ive just come to town sir my mother lives here where does she live i dont know sir just he knows pointing out john i calcerlate his mother lives in old jake barlows house said john oh the widow burke yes i know i believe mrs preston employs her sometimes well andy if thats your name how is it that i catch you fighting with my son that is not very creditable unless you have good cause he called my mother a low woman said andy and then he run up and hit me did you do that godfrey he was putting on too many airs he talked as if he was my equal he appears to be more than your equal in strength said his father well was that all it was about all then i think he did perfectly right and i hope youll profit by the lesson you have received he is a gentleman thought andy he aint hard on a boy because hes poor colonel preston went into the house but godfrey lingered behind a moment he wanted to have a parting shot at his adversary he could fight with words if not with blows look here he said imperiously dont let me see you round here again why not i dont want to see you then you can look the other way said andy independently this is my house i thought it was your fathers thats the same thing youd better stay at home with your mother thank you said andy youre very kind may i come along the road sometimes if you do walk on the other side andy laughed he was no longer provoked but amused then by the same token youd better not come by my mothers house he said goodhumoredly i dont want to come near your miserable shanty said godfrey disdainfully you may come if you keep on the other side of the road said andy slyly godfrey was getting disgusted for in the war of words as well as of blows his ragged opponent seemed to be getting the better of him he turned on his heel and entered the house he was sure of one who would sympathize with him in his dislike and contempt for andy this was of course his mother besides he had another idea he knew that mrs burke had been employed by his mother occasionally to assist in the house it occurred to him that it would be a fine piece of revenge to induce her to dispense hereafter with the poor womans services bent on accomplishing this creditable retaliation he left his young opponent master of the field i must be goin said andy as he picked up his bundle and suspended it from his stick will i find the house where my mother lives easy the question was of course addressed to john who had just turned to go to the stable you cant miss it answered john its a mile up the road stands a little way back theres a few hills of potatoes in the front yard how long since you saw your mother its three months does she know you are coming today no i would have wrote to her but my fingers isnt very ready with the pen nor mine either said john id rather take a licking any time than write a letter come round and see us some time the boyll lick me said andy laughing i guess you can manage him andy smiled for it was his own conviction also with his bundle on his shoulder he trudged on light of heart for he was about to see his mother and sister both of whom he warmly loved chapter iii andy and his mother the house in which the widow burke and her daughter lived was a very humble one it had not been painted for many years and the original coat had worn off leaving it dark and timestained but when mrs burke came to town a short time before it was the only dwelling she could hire that was held at a rent within her means so she and mary who was now eleven years old had moved in their scanty furniture and made it look as much like a home as possible mrs burke had not always been as poor as now she was the daughter of an irish tradesman and had received quite a good education in due time she married a small farmer who was considered to be in fair circumstances but there came a bad year and misfortunes of various kinds came together the last and heaviest of all was fever which prostrated her husband on a bed of sickness though his wife watched over him night and day with all the devotion of love it was all of no avail he died and she found herself left with about a hundred pounds after his debts were paid she was advised to go to america with her two children and did so that was five years before they had lived in various places but the little sum she had left over after the passage of the three was paid had long since melted away and she was forced to get a living as she could since she had come to crampton leaving andy at work for a farmer in the place where they had last lived she had obtained what sewing she could from the families in the village and had besides obtained a chance to help about the ironing at colonel prestons washing was too hard for her for her strength was not great at the time of our introduction she was engaged in making a shirt one of half a dozen which she had engaged to make for dr plympton the village doctor she had no idea that andy was so near having heard nothing of his having left his place but it was of him she was speaking i wish i could see andy she sighed looking up from her work so do i mother the sight of him would do my eyes good hes such a lively lad andy is always in good spirits shure hes got a good heart mother dear it wouldnt be so lonely like if he was here i would send for him if there was anything to do mary but we are so poor that we must all of us stay where we can get work when do you go to colonel prestons mother is it tomorrow yes my dear im always lonely when you are away perhaps you would come with me mary dear mrs preston wouldnt object im thinkin if andy was at home i wouldnt feel so lonely while she was speaking andy himself had crept under the window and heard her words he was planning a surprise but waited for the last moment to announce himself he waited to hear what reply his mother would say i think well see him soon mary dear what makes you say so mother i dont know ive got a feeling in my bones that well soon meet the blessed saints grant that it may be so your bones are right this time mother said a merry voice and andy popping up from his stooping position showed himself at the window there was a simultaneous scream from mary and her mother is it you andy exclaimed mary it isnt nobody else said andy rather ungrammatically come in andy my darling come in and tell me if you are well said his mother dropping the shirt on which she was at work and rising to her feet ill be with you in a jiffy said andy and with a light leap he cleared the window sill and stood in the presence of his mother and sister who vied with each other in hugging the returned prodigal youll choke me sister mary said andy goodhumoredly maybe you think im your beau dont speak to her of beaux and she only eleven years old said his mother but you havent told us why you came faith mother it was because the work gave out and i thought id pack my trunk and come and see you and mary thats all we are glad to see you andy dear but continued his mother taking a survey of her sons appearance for the first time youre lookin like a beggar with your clothes all in rags andy laughed faith its about so mother there was no one to mend em for me and im more used to the hoe than the needle i will sew up some of the holes when youre gone to bed andy are you sure youre well lad well mother jist wait till you see me atin mother youll think ive got a healthy appetite i never thought andy the poor lad must be hungry mary see what there is in the closet theres nothing but some bread mother said mary indeed bread and potatoes were the main living of the mother and daughter adopted because they were cheap they seldom ventured on the extravagance of meat and that was one reason doubtless for mrs burkes want of strength and sometimes feeling faint and dizzy while working at her needle is there no meat in the house mary not a bit mother then go and see if theres an egg outside the widow kept a few hens having a henhouse in one corner of the back yard the eggs she usually sold but andy was at home now and needed something hearty so they must be more extravagant than usual mary went out and quickly returned with a couple of eggs here they are mother two of them the black hen was settin on them but i drove her away and you can hear her cackling shure andy needs them more than she does will you have them boiled or fried andy asked his mother any way mother im hungry enough to ate em raw its hungry work walkin ten miles wid a bundle on your back let alone the fightin fighting exclaimed mrs burke pausing in drawing out the table fightin andy chimed in mary in chorus yes mother said andy and who did you fight with asked the widow anxiously with a boy that feels as big as a king maybe bigger whats his name i heard his father call him godfrey what godfrey preston exclaimed mrs burke in something like consternation yes thats the name he lives in a big house a mile up the road what made you fight with him andy inquired his mother anxiously he began it what could he have against you he didnt know you he thought as i only was an irish boy he could insult me and call me names but i was too much for him i hope you didnt hurt him i throwed him twice mother but then his father came up and that put a stop to the fight and what did his father say he took my part mother when he found out how it was and scolded his son shure hes a gentleman yes colonel preston is a gentleman and thats where he isnt like his son im thinkin no godfrey isnt like his father its his mother he favors faith and i dont call it favoring said andy is the old lady as ugly and bigfeelin as the son shes rather a hard woman andy i go up to work there one day every week do you mother said andy not wholly pleased to hear that his mother was employed by the mother of his young enemy yes andy what is it you do i help about the ironing tomorrows my day for going there i wish you could stay at home and not go out to work mother said andy soberly you dont look strong mother dear im afraid youre not well oh yes andy i am quite well i shall be better too now that you are at home i missed you very much it seemed lonely without you i must find out some way to earn money mother said andy im young and strong and i ought to support you you can help me andy said mrs burke cheerfully she took up the shirt and resumed her sewing im afraid youre too steady at the work mother said andy i shall be ironing tomorrow its a change from sewing andy mary its time to take off the eggs andy was soon partaking of the frugal meal set before him he enjoyed it simple as it was and left not a particle of the egg or a crumb of the bread chapter iv mrs preston whenever godfrey preston had any difficulty with his father he always went to his mother and from her right or wrong he was sure to obtain sympathy so in the present instance failing to receive from his father that moral support to which he deemed himself entitled on entering the house he sought out his mother mrs preston who was rather a spare lady with thin lips and a sharp hatchetlike face was in her own room she looked up as godfrey entered well godfrey whats the matter she asked seeing on her sons face an unmistakable expression of discontent matter enough mother fathers always against me i know it he appears to forget that you are his son what is it now he came up just as i was thrashing a boy down in the yard what boy nobody you know mother it was only an irish boy what was your reason for punishing him asked mrs preston adopting godfreys version of the affair he was impudent to me he was leaning against the fence and i ordered him away he was a ragged boy with a bundle on a stick of course when he wouldnt move i went out and thrashed him was your father there he came up in the midst of it and instead of taking my part he took the part of the irish boy i dont see how mr preston can be so unfair said his wife it is his duty to stand by his family i felt ashamed to have him scold me before the impudent boy of course he enjoyed it and i suppose he will think he can be impudent to me again no doubt i will speak to your father about it he really shouldnt be so inconsiderate but what is that stain on your coat godfrey i should think you had been down on your back on the ground oh said godfrey rather embarrassed i happened to slip as i was wrestling with the fellow and fell on my back however i was up again directly and gave it to him i can tell you if father hadnt stopped me id have laid him out he continued in a swaggering tone it will be seen that godfrey did not always confine himself to the truth indeed he found it rather hard at all times to admit either that he had been in the wrong or had been worsted even if his mother sometimes suspected that his accounts were a trifle distorted she forbore to question their accuracy mother and son had a sort of tacit compact by which they stood by each other and made common cause against colonel preston dont you know the boy doesnt he live in the neighborhood asked mrs preston after a pause hes just come into the town but ill tell you who he is hes the son of that woman that comes to work for you once a week mrs burke yes he told me that his name was andy burke he ought to know his place too well to be impudent to one in your position so i think i shall speak to mrs burke about her sons bad behavior i wish youd discharge her thats a good way to punish the boy i shouldnt object to doing that godfrey but mrs burke is a capital hand at ironing shirts yours and your fathers never looked so nice as they have since she has been here godfrey looked a little discontented being essentially mean he thought it would be an excellent plan to strike the son through the mother you might threaten her mother a little tell her to make her boy behave himself or youll discharge her i will certainly speak to her on the subject godfrey at the table mrs preston introduced the subject of godfreys wrongs i am surprised mr preston that you took part against godfrey when he was rudely assaulted this morning i thought godfrey in the wrong my dear that was my reason you generally appear to think your own son in the wrong you are ready to take part with any stranger against him said mrs preston in a complaining manner i dont think you are quite right just there said her husband goodhumoredly i must say however that godfrey generally is in the wrong you are very unjust to him i dont mean to be i would be glad to praise him but he is so overbearing to those whom he considers his inferiors that i am frequently ashamed of his manner of treating others the boy has some reason to feel proud he must maintain his position what is his position i dont think you need to ask as our son he is entitled to a degree of consideration he will receive consideration enough if he deserves it but this is a republic and all are supposed to be on an equality mrs preston tossed her head thats well enough to say but dont you consider yourself above a man that goes round sawing wood for a living at any rate i would treat him with courtesy because i am richer and have a better education it is no reason why i should treat him with contempt then i dont share your sentiments said mrs preston i am thankful that i know my position better i mean to uphold the dignity of the family and i hope my son will do the same colonel preston shrugged his shoulders as his wife swept from the room he knew of old her sentiments on this subject and he was aware that she was not likely to become a convert to his more democratic ideas i am afraid she will spoil godfrey he thought the boy is getting intolerable i am glad this irish boy gave him a lesson he seems a finespirited lad i will help him if i can ellen said mrs preston the next morning when mrs burke comes let me know yes maam shes come announced ellen half an hour later mrs preston rose from her seat and went into the laundry goodmorning mrs preston said mrs burke goodmorning returned the other stiffly mrs burke i hear that your son behaved very badly to my godfrey yesterday it isnt like andy maam said the mother quietly hes a good wellbehaved lad godfrey tells me that he made a brutal assault upon him quite forgetting his superior position are you sure master godfrey didnt strike him first asked the mother even if he had your son shouldnt have struck back why not asked mrs burke her eyes flashing with spirit meek as she generally was because it was improper said mrs preston decisively i dont see that maam andy isnt the boy to stand still and be struck do i understand said mrs preston in a freezing tone that you uphold your son in his atrocious conduct yes maam i stand up for andy for hes a good boy and if he struck master godfrey it was because he was struck first that is enough said mrs preston angrily i shall not require your services after today mrs burke just as you like maam said mrs burke with quiet pride but she thought with a sinking heart of the gap which this would make in her scanty income chapter v a profitable job after finishing her work at colonel prestons mrs burke went home she did not see mrs preston again for the latter sent her the money for her services by ellen mrs preston says youre not to come next week said ellen she told me so herself this morning she is angry because i took the part of my boy against master godfrey godfreys the hatefulest boy i ever see said ellen whose grammar was a little defective hes always putting on airs he struck my andy and andy struck him back im glad he did said ellen emphatically i hope hell do it again i dont want the boys to fight andys a peaceable lad and hell be quiet if hes let alone but hes just like his poor father and he wont let anybody trample on him thats where hes right said ellen im sorry youre not coming again mrs burke so am i ellen for i need the money but ill stand by my boy you iron real beautiful ive heard mrs preston say so often she wont get nobody thatll suit her so well if you hear of anybody else that wants help ellen will you send them to me this ellen faithfully promised and mrs burke went home sorry to have lost her engagement but not sorry to have stood up for andy of whom she was proud andy was at home when she returned he had found enough to do at home to occupy him so far the next day he meant to go out in search of employment when his mother got back she found him cutting some brush which he had obtained from the neighboring woods there mother he said pointing to a considerable pile youll have enough sticks to last you a good while thank you andy dear thatll save mary and me a good deal of trouble there was nothing in her words but something in her tone which led andy to ask whats the matter mother has anything happened ive got through working for mrs preston andy got through for today you mean no im not going to work there again why not she complained of you andy what did she say mother asked our hero listening with attention she said you ought not to have struck godfrey did you tell her he struck me first yes i did and what did she say thin she said that you ought not to have struck him back and what did you say mother i said my andy wasnt the boy to stand still and let anybody beat him good for you mother bully for you thats where you hit the nail on the head and what did the ould lady say then she told me i neednt come there again to work im glad youre not goin mother i dont want you to work for the likes of her let her do her own ironin the ould spalpeen in general andys speech was tolerably clear of the brogue but whenever he became a little excited as at present it was more marked he was more angry at the slight to his mother than he would have been at anything however contemptuous said to himself he had that chivalrous feeling of respect for his mother which every boy of his age ought to have more especially if that mother is a widow but andy im very sorry for the money ill lose how much is it mother seventyfive cents ill make it up mother i know you will if you can andy but work is hard to get and the pay is small you might go back and tell mrs preston that im a dirty spalpeen and maybe shed take you back mother i wouldnt slander my own boy like that if shed take me back twenty times thats the way to talk mother said andy well pleased dont you be afeared well get along somehow more by token heres three dollars i brought home with me yisterday andy pulled out from his pocket six silver halfdollars and offered them to his mother where did you get them andy she asked in surprise where did i get them one way and another by overwork we wont starve while them last will we andys cheerful tone had its effect upon his mother perhaps youre right andy she said smiling at any rate we wont cry till its time tomorrow ill go out and see if i can find work suppose you dont find it andy suggested his sister then ill take in washing said andy laughing its an iligant washer id make wouldnt i now nobodyd hire you more than once andy by and by they had supper if they had been alone they would have got along on bread and tea but andy needs meat for hes a growing boy said his mother and so mary was dispatched to the butchers for a pound and a half of beefsteak which made the meal considerably more attractive mrs burke felt that it was extravagant particularly just as her income was diminished but she couldnt bear to stint andy at first she was not going to eat herself meaning to save a part for andys breakfast but our hero found her out and declared he wouldnt eat a bit if his mother did not eat too so she was forced to take her share and it did her good for no one can keep up a decent share of strength on bread and tea alone the next morning andy went out in search of work he had no very definite idea where to go or to whom to apply but he concluded to put in an application anywhere he could he paused in front of the house of deacon jones a hardfisted old farmer whose reputation for parsimony was well known throughout the village but of this andy being a newcomer was ignorant wouldnt you like to hire a good strong boy he asked entering the yard the deacon looked up ever worked on a farm yes can you milk yes where did you work in carver whats your name andy burke where do you live with my mother mrs burke a little way down the road i know the widder burke have you got any work for me wait a minute ill see the deacon brought out an old scythe from the barn and felt of the edge there was not much danger in so doing for it was as dull as a hoe this scythe needs sharpening he said come and turn the grindstone well heres a job anyhow thought andy wonder what hell give me he sat down and began to turn the grindstone the deacon bore on heavily and this made it hard turning his arms ached and the perspiration stood on his brow it was certainly pretty hard work but then he must be prepared for that and after all he was earning money for his mother still the time did seem long the scythe was so intolerably dull that it took a long time to make any impression upon it kinder hard turnin aint it said the deacon yes said andy this scythe aint been sharpened for ever so long its as dull as a hoe however time and patience work wonders and at length the deacon after a careful inspection of the blade of the scythe released andy from his toil of an hour and a half with the remark i reckon thatll do he put the scythe in its place and came out andy lingered respectfully for the remuneration of his labor he ought to give me a quarter he thought but the deacon showed no disposition to pay him and andy became impatient i guess ill be goin he said all right i aint got anything more for you to do said the deacon ill take my pay now said andy desperately pay what for inquired the deacon innocently for turning the grindstone you dont mean ter say you expect anything for that said the deacon in a tone of surprise yes i do said andy i cant work an hour and a half for nothing i didnt expect to pay for such a trifle said the old man fumbling in his pocket finally he brought out two cents one of the kind popularly known as bungtowns which are not generally recognized as true currency there said he in an injured tone ill pay you though i didnt think youd charge anything for any little help like that andy looked at the proffered compensation with mingled astonishment and disgust never mind he said you can keep it you need it moren i do im thinkin dont you want it asked the deacon surprised no i dont im a poor boy but i dont work an hour and a half for two cents one of em bad id rather take no pay at all thats a curus boy said the deacon slowly sliding the pennies back into his pocket i calclate he expected more just for a little job like that does he think im made of money as andy went out of the yard the idea dawned upon the deacon that he had saved two cents and his face was luminous with satisfaction chapter vi the two old maids hes the meanest man i ever saw thought andy does he think i work on nothing a year and find myself divil a bit of work will i do for him agin if i know it but better luck was in store for andy quarter of a mile farther on in a twostory house oldfashioned but neat lived two maiden ladies of very uncertain age misses priscilla and sophia grant i am not aware that any relationship existed between them and our distinguished expresident nevertheless they were of very respectable family and connections and of independent property owning bank stock which brought them in an annual income of about twelve hundred dollars in addition to the house they occupied and half a dozen acres of land thereunto pertaining now this was not a colossal fortune but in a country place like crampton it made them ladies of large property priscilla was the elder of the two and general manager sophia contented herself with being the echo of her strongerminded sister and was very apt to assent to her remarks either by repeating them or by saying just so she was a mild inoffensive creature but very charitable and amiable and so little given to opposition that there was always the greatest harmony between them they kept a gardener and outofdoor servant of all work who cultivated the land sawed and split their wood ran of errands and made himself generally useful he had one drawback unfortunately he would occasionally indulge to excess in certain fiery alcoholic compounds sold at the village tavern and as natural consequence get drunk he had usually the good sense to keep out of the way while under the influence of liquor and hitherto the good ladies had borne with and retained him in their employ but a crisis had arrived that morning he had come for orders while inebriated and in his drunken folly had actually gone so far as to call miss priscilla darling and offer to kiss her miss priscilla was of course horrified and so expressed herself law sophia she said i came near fainting away the idea of his offering to kiss me just so said sophia so presuming just so of course i couldnt think of employing him any longer couldnt think of it he might have asked to kiss me again just so or you just so said sophia in some excitement of manner the neighbors would talk just so so i told him that i was very sorry but it would be necessary for him to find work somewhere else but who will do our work inquired sophia with a rare original suggestion we must get somebody else so we must acquiesced sophia as if she had suddenly received light on a very dark subject but i dont know who we can get just so at that moment there was a knock at the door priscilla answered it in person they kept no domestic servant only a gardener ive brought the load of wood you ordered maam said the teamster where shall i put it in the backyard john no john has left us i will show you myself she put on a capebonnet and indicated the place in the yard where she wanted the wood dumped then she returned to the house its very awkward that john should have acted so she said in a tone of annoyance i dont know who is to saw and split that wood we couldnt do it said sophia with another original suggestion of course not that would be perfectly absurd just so i dont believe there is enough wood sawed and split to last through the day we must have some split of course but i really dont know of anyone in the neighborhood that we could get john john has gone away you know why perhaps he wouldnt kiss us if we told him not to suggested sophia i am afraid you are a goose said priscilla composedly just so slipped out of sophias mouth from force of habit but her sister was so used to hearing it that she took no particular notice of it on the present occasion it was just at this time that andy released from his severe and unrequited labor for deacon jones came by he saw the wood being unloaded in the back yard and an idea struck him maybe i can get the chance of sawin and splittin that wood ill try anyway i wonder who lives there he immediately opened the front gate and marching up to the front door knocked vigorously theres somebody at the door said sophia perhaps its john come back said priscilla i am afraid of going to open it he might want to kiss me again ill go said sophia rising with unwonted alacrity he might want to kiss you ill tell him not to well both go said priscilla decisively accordingly the two sisters for mutual protection both went to the door and opened it guardedly their courage returned when they saw that it was only a boy what do you want asked priscilla just so chimed in sophia youve got a load of wood in the back yard commenced andy just so said sophia do you want it sawed and split just so answered the younger sister brightening up can you do it inquired priscilla try me and see answered andy youre not a man just so chimed in her sister faith and i soon will be said andy i can saw and split wood as well as any man you ever saw what is your name andy burke are you a hibernian inquired priscilla i dont know what you mane by that same said andy perplexed to what nation do you belong oh thats what you want maam im only an irish boy and you say your name is burke yes maam are you related to burke the great orator he was an irishman i believe just so said sophia he was my greatgrandfather maam answered andy who had never heard of the eminent orator but thought the claim would improve his chances of obtaining the job of sawing and splitting wood your greatgrandfather exclaimed priscilla in astonishment really this is most extraordinary and you are poor if i wasnt i wouldnt be goin round sawin wood maam just so said sophia to think that the grandson of the great burke should come to us for employment said priscilla who was in some respects easily taken in i think we must hire him sophia just so perhaps he could take johns place altogether just so i must find out whether he understands gardening just so andy stood by waiting patiently for the decision and hoping that it might be favorable of course it was wrong for him to tell a lie but he thought his engagement depended upon it and although a very good boy in the main he was not altogether perfect as my readers are destined to find out chapter vii andy obtains a place do you understand the care of a garden asked miss priscilla yes answered andy promptly then you are used to agricultural labor ive been workin on a farm all summer our man has just left us and we must hire somebody else just so chimed in sophia and if you are competent just so try me said andy i really think wed better sophia said priscilla turning to her sister just so well try you for a week what compensation do you require is it wages you mane of course sophia was the speaker how much did you give the man you had before me asked andy shrewdly twentyfive dollars a month and board thatll suit me said andy audaciously at the farmers for whom he had been working he had received board and a dollar a week but you are a boy men folks get more than boys ill do as much work as he did any day said andy stoutly i really dont know what to say i think well give you five dollars the first week and then we will decide about the future just so said sophia im to eat here inquired andy yes you will make your home here we will put you in johns room when shall i begin we shall need some wood split at once all right maam but its dinner time ill just go home and get a bite to keep up my strength you can have your dinner here it will be ready in half an hour just so all right said andy im agreeable do you live in the village i do now my mother lives up the road a bit very well go and split some wood and well call you in to dinner youll find the ax and the saw in the shed andy found the articles referred to and straightway went to work he was really a smart boy to work as the phrase is and he went to work with a will he was greatly elated at having secured so profitable a job he meant to give satisfaction so as to keep it five dollars a week and board seemed to him a magnificent income and compared very favorably with his wages at farmer belknaps where he had been working all summer its lucky i came here he said to himself as he plied the saw energetically but what queer old ladies they are especially the one thats always sayin just so if id tell her id got fiftyseven grandchildren ill bet shed say just so miss sophia was looking out of the back window to see how their new man worked occasionally priscilla as she was setting the table glanced out of the window in passing he takes hold as if he knew how she observed just so responded her sister i think he works faster than john just so its very strange that he should be the greatgrandson of the great burke just so and that he should be sawing wood for us too just so i think we must be kind to him sister just so he wont try to kiss you priscilla said sophia with a sudden thought you are a goose sister said priscilla just so assented the other from force of habit in due time dinner was ready and andy was summoned from the woodpile he was in nowise sorry for the summons he had a hearty appetite at all times and just now it was increased by his unrequited labor in turning the grindstone for deacon jones as well as by the halfhour he had spent at his new task the misses grant did their own work as i have before observed they were excellent cooks and the dinner now upon the table though plain was very savory and inviting andys eyes fairly danced with satisfaction as they rested on the roast beef and vegetables which emitted an odor of a highly satisfactory character at the farmers where he had last worked the table had been plentifully supplied but the cooking was very rudimentary sit down andrew said miss priscilla i think that is your name they call me andy maam that means andrew shall i give you some meat thank you maam will you have it rare or well done well done maam i have it rare enough anyhow sophia andrew has made a joke said priscilla with a decorous smile just so priscilla and sophia smiled also i suppose your family has been reduced to poverty andrew or you would not be seeking employment of this character true for you maam said andy with his mouth full how was your family property lost faith maam by speculation said andy hazarding a guess that is very sad sophia we must never speculate just so priscilla or we might lose all our money and have to saw wood for a living said sophia with another brilliant idea andy was so amused at the picture thus suggested that he came near choking but recovered himself after a violent attack of coughing i am afraid sophia we should scarcely make a living in that way said priscilla with a smile just so acquiesced her sister how long have you been in this country andrew six years maam andy kept at work industriously his appetite proved to be quite equal to the emergency but his evident enjoyment of the dinner only gratified the ladies who though eccentric were kindhearted and not in the least mean what will i do maam asked our hero you may go on sawing wood so andy resumed work and worked faithfully during the afternoon by this time there was a large pile of wood ready for the stove at halfpast four miss priscilla appeared at the door andrew she said yes maam do you feel tired a little maam does your mother know where you are no maam would you like to go home and tell her yes maam i would you can go now or after supper as you prefer then ill go now but remember we want you to come back and sleep here we do not feel safe without a man in the house andy felt rather flattered at being referred to as a man ill be back any time you name maam he said then be here at nine oclock very well maam andy put on his coat and hurried home he wanted to tell his mother and mary the good news about his engagement at such unexpected good wages mrs burke looked up inquiringly as he entered the house where have you been andy she asked i thought i had lost you you dont lose me so easy mother shure ive been at work at work yes ive got a place what already you are lucky andy youll think so mother how much do you think i get besides board mind a dollar a week what do you say to three dollars youre a lucky boy andy im glad for you what do you say to five dollars a week mother asked andy in exultation youre jokin now andy said his sister i dont believe youve got a place at all i have thin and its five dollars a week im to get ask the ould maids im workin for the miss grants i expect so theyre mighty queer old ladies one of m is always sayin just so that is miss sophia grant just so said andy mimicking her you mustnt do that andy then its them youre workin for yes and theyre mighty kind im goin back to sleep there tonight they want a man to purtect them mary laughed do you call yourself a man andy what could you do if a burglar tried to get in id give him what paddy did the drum said andy supper is ready announced his mother it was a cheerful meal andy had done much better than his mother expected and it seemed likely that they would get along in spite of her being discharged by mrs preston chapter viii the midnight alarm its time for me to be goin back said andy as the clock indicated twenty minutes to nine i wish you could sleep at home andy said his mother they want me to purtect them said our hero with a little importance ill pack my clothes in a handkerchief ive got a little carpetbag said his mother that looks more respectable when you have earned enough money you must have a new suit of clothes how much will they cost mother i think we can get a cheap suit for fifteen or twenty dollars when you have got the money we will call on the tailor and see shure ill feel like a gentleman with a suit like that mary go and get the carpetbag ive packed andys clothes all ready for him mary soon reappeared with the carpetbag and andy set out on his return presently as the clock struck nine he knocked at the door of the misses grant the elder opened the door for him you are punctual andrew she said approvingly yes maam are those your clothes pointing to the bag he carried what few ive got maam im goin to buy some more when ive got money enough that is right we want you to look respectable just so remarked sophia who felt that it was time for her to speak then a brilliant idea seized her if he was a girl we could give him some of our dresses but he isnt said matteroffact priscilla or if we were men continued sophia with another brilliant idea but we are not just so assented her sister now brought to the end of her suggestions by this time andy was in the house holding his cap in one hand and his carpetbag in the other do you feel tired asked priscilla yes maam then perhaps you would like to go to bed i would if its just the same to you maam very well follow me and i will show you your room sophia perhaps you had better come too they went up the front stairs the house proper had two rooms on the lower floor and the two chambers over them but there was besides an extension behind used as a kitchen and over this was the room which had been used by john the former servant this is your room andrew said miss priscilla sophia will you lift the latch the door being opened revealed a small chamber with the ceiling partly sloping there were two windows it was very plainly furnished but looked very comfortable andy glanced about him with a look of satisfaction it was considerably more attractive than the bed in the attic which he had occupied at the house of the farmer for whom he had last worked weve put the feather bed at the bottom as its summer said miss priscilla all right maam theres one thing youve forgotten priscilla suggested sophia what is that the gun oh yes i am glad you reminded me of it andrew can you fire off a gun yes maam said andrew glibly he had never done it but he had seen a gun fired and always wanted to make a trial himself as you are the only menfolks in the house we should expect you to fire at any robbers that tried to enter the house do you expect any maam asked andy eagerly no but some might come of course we cannot fire guns it would be improper as we are ladies just so interrupted sophia so we shall leave that to you do you think you would dare to would i dare is it asked andy shure id be glad of the chance i see you are brave ill show you the gun now she went to the closet in the corner of the room and pointed out a big unwieldy musket to andy it was in the corner is it loaded maam he asked yes it has been loaded for a year or more john never had occasion to use it and i hope you wont if any robber should come added the kindhearted spinster perhaps you had better only shoot him in the arm and not kill him just as you say maam i believe that is all i have to say sophia shall we go to our own room just so so the two maidens withdrew and andy was left to his own reflections he undressed himself quickly and deposited himself in the bed which proved to be very comfortable he went to bed but there was one thing that prevented his going to sleep this was the gun he had never even had one in his hand and now there was one at his absolute disposal it made him feel a sense of his importance to feel that upon him young as he was devolved the duty of defending the house and its occupants from burglary and why not shure im most a man reflected andy i can shoot off a gun as well as anybody i wonder will robbers come tonight thought andy he rather wished they would so that he might have an excuse for firing the gun however of this there seemed very little chance for had not miss priscilla said that it had been loaded for more than a year and during all that time john had never had occasion to use it this seemed rather discouraging i wonder would they let me go out gunning with it thought andy somehow or other he could not get his mind off the gun and after a lapse of an hour he was as wide awake as ever meanwhile priscilla and sophia were both asleep not being interested in the gun finally it occurred to andy that he would get up and look at the gun he wanted to make sure that he understood how to fire it it was important that he should do so he reasoned to himself for might not a burglar come that very night then suppose he was unable to fire the gun and in consequence of his ignorance both he and the two ladies should be murdered in their beds of course this was not to be thought of so andy got out of bed and finding a match lit the candle and put it on the bureau or chest of drawers as they called it in the country then he stepped softly to the closet and took out the gun murder how heavy it is thought andy i didnt think it was half as heavy there must be a pound of bullets inside now he said to himself suppose a big thafe was to poke his dirty head in at the winder and say give me all your money or ill break your head id put up with the gun and point at him this way here andy brought the gun into position with some difficulty and put his finger near the trigger and id say continued andy rehearsing his part jump down you thafe or ill put a bullet through your head at that unlucky moment his finger accidentally pulled the trigger and instantly there was a tremendous report the noise being increased by the shattering of the window panes by the bullet probably the charge was too heavy for the gun kicked and andy to his astonishment found himself lying flat on his back on the floor with the gun lying beside him oh murder ejaculated the bewildered boy is it dead i am shure the divils in the gun what will the ould wimmen say theyll think its bloody burglars gettin into the house shure ill slip on my pants for theyll be coming to see whats happened he picked himself up and slipped on his pants he had scarcely got them on when the trembling voice of miss priscilla was heard at the door chapter ix what followed the report of the gun as may be supposed had aroused both the ladies from their sleep did you hear it ejaculated miss priscilla clutching her sister by the arm just so muttered sophia in bewilderment its the gun burglars exclaimed sophia in alarm i am afraid so what shall we do run away suggested sophia no we must not leave the boy to be murdered perhaps he has shot them said sophia with a gleam of hope at any rate it is our duty to go and see what has happened im afraid whimpered sophia covering up her head then you can stay here said the more courageous priscilla i will go and leave me alone i must ill go too then said sophia her teeth chattering with fear so they crept out of bed and throwing shawls over their shoulders advanced into the entry trembling with excitement and fear if we should find andy weltering in his gore suggested priscilla dont say such horrid things or i shall scream said her sister then came the tremulous knock mentioned at the close of the last chapter andy opened the door in person and met the gaze of the two miss grants sophia almost ready to drop with fright do you see any gore priscilla she asked tremulously are you hurt andrew asked the elder sister no maam did you fire the gun yes maam what made you did any burglars try to get in not exactly maam said andy but i thought there might be some did you see any not exactly said andy a little embarrassed but i heard a noise just so said sophia why didnt you wait till they appeared at the window andrew because maam they would fire at me first i wanted to scare em away perhaps you were right you dont see any traces of them outside do you you can look for yourself maam the two ladies went to the window which as already explained had suffered from the discharge and peered out timidly but of course saw no burglars are you sure there were any burglars andrew asked priscilla no maam i couldnt swear to it well no harm has been done except breakin the winder maam never mind we will have that mended tomorrow were you afraid andrew asked miss sophia not a bit answered andy valiantly i aint afraid of burglars as long as i have a gun im a match for em how brave he is exclaimed the timid lady we might have been killed in our beds im glad we hired him priscilla as there is nothing more to do we had better go to bed just so thats a bully way to get out of a scrape said andy to himself as the ladies filed out of his chamber i expected theyd scold me plague take the old gun it kicks as bad as a mule oh andy youre a lucky boy to get off so well the next day andy obtained permission to take out the gun in the afternoon when his chores were done i want to get used to it maam he said it kicked last night dear me did it asked sophia i didnt know guns kicked what do they kick with they havent got any legs andy explained as well as he could what he meant by the guns kicking and said it was because it had not been used for a good while and needed to be taken out it needs exercise just like horses maam he said that is singular andrew said priscilla just so observed her sister its a fact maam said andy it gets skittish just like horses but if i take it out sometimes itll be all right very well you may take it only be careful oh ill be careful maam said andy with alacrity now ill have some fun he said to himself he found a supply of powder and some shot in the closet and proceeded to appropriate them come back in time for supper andrew said miss priscilla yes maam im always on hand at meal times answered our hero thats because hes hungry said sophia brilliantly youre right maam said andy my stomach always tells me when its supper time its as good as a watch said priscilla smiling and a good deal cheaper observed sophia with another brilliant idea andy started up the road with his gun over his shoulder it was his intention after going a little distance to strike into the fields and make for some woods not far away where he thought there would be a good chance for birds or squirrels he hadnt gone many steps before he encountered godfrey preston his antagonist of three days previous now godfrey hadnt seen or heard anything of andy since that day he had learned from his mother with great satisfaction that she had discharged mrs burke from her employment as this he imagined would trouble andy but of andy himself he knew nothing and was not aware that he had already secured a place when he saw our hero coming along his curiosity led him to stop and find out if he could where he was going with the gun he carried on his shoulder and where he obtained it so he looked intently at andy waiting for him to speak but andy preferred to leave that to him whose gun is that asked godfrey in the tone of one who was entitled to ask the question shure it belongs to the owner said andy with a smile of course i know that said godfrey impatiently im not quite a fool not quite repeated andy emphasizing the last word in a way which made godfrey color what do you mean he said what do i mane it was only your words i repeated then dont trouble yourself to repeat them do you hear thank you i wont you didnt tell me whose gun that is no i didnt very likely you stole it said godfrey provoked maybe youll go and tell the owner how can i when you havent told me whose it is no more i did said andy with apparent innocence where are you going with it goin out shootin so i supposed did you now then what made you ask returned andy you are an impudent fellow said godfrey provoked i never am impudent to gentlemen said andy pointedly do you mean to say that i am not a gentleman demanded the other angrily suit yourself said andy coolly youre only an irish boy shure i knew that before why cant you tell me some news im an irish boy and im proud of the same ill never go back on ould ireland the irish are a low set are they now maybe you never heard of burke the great orator what of him shure he was an irishman and isnt my name andy burke and wasnt he my greatgrandfather he must be proud of his greatgrandson said godfrey sarcastically i never axed him but no doubt youre right but its time i was goin or i shant get any birds would you like to come with me no i am particular about the company i keep im not or i wouldnt have invited you said andy who was rather quicker witted than his opponent i should like to know where he got that gun said godfrey to himself following with his eyes the retreating figure of our hero i am sure that isnt his gun ten to one he stole it from somebody but godfreys curiosity was not destined to be gratified that afternoon as it might have been if he had seen andy turning into the yard of the misses grant two hours afterward he had not shot anything but he had got used to firing the gun and was not likely to be caught again in any such adventure as that recorded in the last chapter chapter x andys debut at school the first of september came and with it came the opening of the fall schools on the first day when andy at work in the yard saw the boys and the girls go by with their books he felt a longing to go too he knew very well that his education had been very much neglected and that he knew less of books than a boy of his age ought to do i wish i could go to school this term he said to himself but its no use wishin mother needs my wages and i must keep on workin the same thought had come to the misses grant andy had been in their employ now for six weeks and by his unfailing good humor and readiness to oblige had won their favor they felt interested in his progress and at the same moment that the thought referred to passed though andys mind miss priscilla said to her sister the fall school begins today theres godfrey preston just passed with some books under his arm just so i suppose andrew would like to be going to school with other boys of his age just so dont you think we could spare him to go half the day just so said sophia with alacrity there isnt so much work to do now as there was in the summer and he could do his chores early in the morning he could go to school in the forenoon and work in the afternoon just so priscilla shall we give him less wages no i think not he needs the money to give his mother call him in and tell him suggested sophia it will do at dinner time just so when the dinner was over and andy rose from the table miss priscilla introduced the subject are you a good scholar andrew im a mighty poor one maam did you ever study much no maam ive had to work ever since i was so high indicating a point about two feet from the ground dear me said sophia you must have been very small yes maam i was very small of my size ive been thinking andrew that perhaps we could spare you half the day so that you could go to school in the forenoon you could learn something in three hours should you like it would i like it maam wouldnt i though i dont want to grow up a poor ignorant crathur hardly able to read and write then you can go to school tomorrow and ask the teacher if he will take you for half the day you can get up early and get your chores done before school oh yes maam i can do that easy i think we have some schoolbooks in the house some years ago we had a nephew stay with us and go to school i think his books are still in the closet thank you maam itll save me buyin and i havent got any money to spare we shall give you the same wages andrew though you will work less thank you maam youre very kind try to improve your time in school as becomes the greatgrandson of such a distinguished orator ill try maam said andy looking a little queer at this allusion to the great edmund burke in fact he was ashamed of having deceived the kind old ladies but didnt like now to own up to the deception lest they should lose confidence in him but he determined hereafter to speak the truth and not resort to deception the next morning at twenty minutes of nine andy left the house provided with books and joyfully took his way to the schoolhouse which was a quarter of a mile distant as he ascended the small hill on which it stood he attracted the attention of a group of boys who had already arrived among them was his old adversary godfrey preston is that irish boy coming to school he said in a tone of disgust what andy burke i hope so said charles fleming hes a good fellow hes only an irish boy said godfrey with a sneer and i am only an american boy said charles goodhumoredly you can associate with him if you want to i shant said godfrey thats where i agree with you godfrey said ben travers who made himself rather a toady of godfreys andy had now come up so that charles fleming did not reply but called out cordially are you coming to school andy yes said andy im glad of it thank you said andy whats the matter with them fellows as godfrey and bill travers walked off haughtily tossing their heads charles fleming laughed they dont think we are good enough for their company he said im not anxious for it said andy i like yours better i didnt think you could get away from work to come to school are you working for miss grant now yes but she lets me come to school half the day shes a bully ould lady well half a loafs better than no bread will you sit with me ive got no one at my desk say yes its just what id like charlie but maybe godfrey preston wants to sit with me i wouldnt like to disappoint him said andy with sly humor sit with me till he invites you then thatll be a long day they went into the schoolhouse and andy deposited his books in the desk next to charlie flemings he couldnt have wished for a better or more agreeable companion charlie was the son of dr fleming the village physician and was a general favorite in the town on account of his sunny attractive manner but with all his affability he was independent and resolute if need be he was one of the leaders of the school godfrey aspired also to be a leader and was to some extent on account of his fathers wealth and high standing for as we have seen colonel preston was not like his son still it is doubtful whether anyone was much attached to godfrey he was too selfish in disposition and offensively consequential in manner to inspire devoted friendship ben travers however flattered him and followed him about simply because he was the son of a rich man such cases occur sometimes among american schoolboys but generally they are too democratic and sensible to attach importance to social distinctions in the schoolroom or in the playground when the teacher a certain ebenezer stone a man of thirty or upward entered andy went up to him and asked permission to attend school a part of the time as there had been such cases in former terms no objection was offered by the teacher and andy went back to his seat a regularly admitted member of the school it was found necessary to put him in a low class to begin with he was naturally bright but as we know his opportunities of learning had been very limited and he could not be expected to know much but andy was old enough now to understand the worth of knowledge and he devoted himself so earnestly to study that in the course of three weeks he was promoted to a higher class this however is anticipating when recess came the scholars poured out upon the playround charles fleming and godfrey preston happened to pass out side by side i see youve taken that irish boy to sit with you he said you mean andy burke yes i invited him to be my deskfellow i congratulate you on your hightoned and aristocratic associate observed godfrey sarcastically thank you i am glad to have him with me i wouldnt condescend to take him into my seat nor do i there isnt any condescension about it he works for a living so does my father and so does yours are you going to cut your fathers acquaintance for that reason my father could live without work he doesnt choose to and thats where he shows his good sense its a different kind of work from sawing and splitting wood and such low labor it strikes me godfrey that you ought to have been born somewhere else than in america in this country labor is considered honorable you ought to be living under a monarchy i dont believe in associating with inferiors i dont look upon andy burke as my inferior said charlie he is poor to be sure but he is a good fellow and helps support his mother and sister as i would do in his place charlie fleming was heard from the playground come and choose up for baseball without waiting for an answer charlie ran to the field alongside the schoolhouse where the game was to take place chapter xi a game of ball come here said conrad fletcher come here charlie and choose up for a game we must make haste or recess will be over all right conrad the first choice devolved upon conrad he chose ephraim pinkham noted as a catcher i take elmer rhodes said charlie john parker said conrad henry strauss godfrey preston was conrads next choice can you play andy asked charlie yes said andy then i take you ive a good mind to resign said godfrey in a low voice to ben travers i dont fancy playing with that irish boy however he was too fond of playing to give up his place notwithstanding his antipathy to andy charlie flemings side went in first and charlie himself went to the bat the pitcher was godfrey he was really a fair pitcher and considered himself very superior charlie finally succeeded in hitting the ball but rather feebly and narrowly escaped losing his first base he saved it however next at the bat was elmer rhodes he hit one or two fouls but not a fair ball finally he was put out on three strikes meanwhile however charlie fleming got round to third base henry strauss succeeded in striking the ball but it was caught by center field rapidly sent to first base before henry could reach it then thrown to the catcher in time to prevent charlie fleming from getting in he ran halfway to home base but seeing his danger ran back to third base next andy took the bat knock me in andy called out charlie fleming all right said andy quietly not if i can prevent it said godfrey to himself and he determined by sending poor balls to get our hero out on three strikes the first ball therefore he sent about six feet to the right of the batter andy stood in position but of course was far too wise to attempt hitting any such ball the next ball went several feet above his head of this too he took no notice the third would have hit him if he had not dodged why dont you knock at the balls asked godfrey i will when you give better ones said andy coolly i dont believe you know how to bat said godfrey with a sneer i dont believe you know how to pitch returned andy hows that sending another ball whizzing by his left ear i want them waisthigh said andy my waist is about two feet lower than my ears godfrey now resolved to put in a ball waisthigh but so swiftly that andy could not hit it but he had never seen andy play our hero had a wonderfully quick eye and steady hand and struck the ball with such force to left field that not only charlie fleming got in without difficulty but andy himself made a home run thats a splendid hit exclaimed charlie with enthusiasm i didnt think you could play so well ive played before today said andy composedly i told you i would get you in and i meant what i said godfrey looked chagrined at the result he meant to demonstrate that andy was no player but had only contributed to his brilliant success for had he not sent in so swift a ball the knock would not have been so forcible as there were but six on a side two outs were considered all out who will catch asked charlie fleming i want to pitch i will said andy all right if you can catch as you can bat well cut down their score andy soon showed that he was no novice at catching he rarely let a ball pass him when godfreys turn came to bat one was already out and andy determined to put godfrey out if it was a possible thing one strike had been called when godfrey struck a foul which was almost impossible to catch but now andy ran made a bound into the air and caught it a very brilliant piece of play by which godfrey and his side were put out the boys on both sides applauded for it was a piece of brilliant fielding which not one of them was capable of that is all applauded but godfrey he threw down his bat spitefully and said to fleming you didnt give me good balls i gave you much better than you gave andy said charlie thats so chimed in two other boys i wont play any more said godfrey just then the bell rang so that the game was brought to a close andy received the compliments of the boys on his brilliant playing he received them modestly and admitted that he probably couldnt make such a catch again it was very disagreeable to godfrey to hear andy praised he was rather proud of his ballplaying and he saw that andy was altogether his superior at any rate in the opinion of the boys however he ingeniously contrived to mingle a compliment with a sneer youre more used to baseball than to books he said true for you said andy youre a head taller than any of the boys in your class i know that said andy i havent been to school as much as you i should be ashamed if i didnt know more so you ought said andy for youve been to school all your life i hope to know more soon anyway you can play ball said charlie fleming id rather be a good scholar ill help you if you want any help thank you charlie they had now entered the schoolroom and andy took up his book and studied hard he was determined to rise to a higher class as soon as possible for it was not agreeable to him to reflect that he was the oldest and largest boy in his present class very well said the teacher when his recitation was over if you continue to recite in this way you will soon be promoted ill do my best sir said andy who listened to these words with pleasure i wish you were coming in the afternoon too andy said his friend charlie fleming as they walked home together so do i charlie but i must work for my mother thats right andy id do the same in your place i havent such foolish ideas about work as godfrey preston he aint very fond of me said andy laughing no nor of anybody else he only likes godfrey preston we got into a fight the first day i ever saw him what was it about he called my mother names and hit me so i knocked him flat you served him right hes disgustingly conceited nobody likes him ben travers goes around with him all the time ben likes him because he is rich if he should lose his property youd see how soon he would leave him that isnt a friend worth having ive got one consolation said andy laughing nobody likes me for my money but someone likes you for yourself andy said charlie who myself to be sure and i like you as much charlie said andy warmly youre ten times as good a fellow as godfrey i hope so said charlie that isnt saying very much andy so the friendship was cemented nor did it end there charlie spoke of andys good qualities at home and some time afterward andy was surprised by an invitation to spend the evening at dr flemings he felt a little bashful but finally went nor was he at all sorry for so doing the whole family was a delightful one and andy was welcomed as a warm friend of charlies and in the pleasant atmosphere of the doctors fireside he quite forgot that there was one who looked down upon him as an inferior being dr fleming had himself been a poor boy by a lucky chance or providence rather he had been put in the way of obtaining an education and he was not disposed now in his prosperity to forget his days of early struggle andy found that in spite of the three hours taken up at school he was able to do all that was required of him by the misses grant they were glad to hear of his success at school and continued to pay him five dollars a week for his services this money he regularly carried to his mother after paying for the new clothes of which he stood so much in need chapter xii a little difficulty it has already been said that godfrey preston was a conceited and arrogant boy he had a very high idea of his own importance and expected that others would acknowledge it but he was not altogether successful he would like to have had andy burke look up to him as a member of a superior class and in that case might have condescended to patronize him as a chieftain might in the case of a humble retainer but andy didnt want to be patronized by godfrey he never showed by his manner that he felt beneath him socially and this greatly vexed godfrey his mother used to iron at our house he said to ben travers one day but my mother discharged her i dont see why the boys treat him as an equal i wont for my part of course he isnt your equal said the subservient ben thats a good joke he acts as if he was said godfrey discontentedly its only his impudence you are right said godfrey rather liking this explanation he is one of the most impudent boys i know i wish my father would send me to a fashionable school where i shouldnt meet such fellows thats the worst of these public schools you meet all sorts of persons in them of course you do i suppose this burke will be a hodcarrier or something of that kind when he is a man while you are a member of congress very likely said godfrey loftily and he will claim that he was an old schoolmate of mine it is disgusting of course it is however we neednt notice him i dont mean to but in the course of the next week there was an occurrence which compelled godfrey to notice his detested schoolfellow among the scholars was a very pleasant boy of twelve named alfred parker he was the son of a poor widow and was universally liked for his amiable and obliging disposition one morning before school he was engaged in some game which required him to run he accidentally ran against godfrey who was just coming up the hill with considerable force now it was very evident that it was wholly unintentional but godfrey was greatly incensed what do you mean by that you little scamp he exclaimed furiously excuse me godfrey i didnt mean to run into you that dont go down indeed i didnt i didnt see you i cant help it you ought to have been more careful take that to make you more careful as he said this he seized him by the collar and tripping him laid him flat on his back for shame godfrey said another boy standing by but as it was a small boy godfrey only answered if you say that again ill serve you the same way alfred tried to get up but godfrey put his knee on his breast let me up godfrey said alfred piteously i cant breathe you hurt me ill teach you to run into me said the bully i didnt mean to i want to make sure of your not doing it again do let me up said alfred in return godfrey only pressed more heavily and the little fellow began to cry but help was near at hand andy burke happened to come up the hill just then and saw what was going on he had a natural chivalry that prompted him always to take the weaker side but besides this he liked alfred for his good qualities and disliked godfrey for his bad ones he did not hesitate a moment therefore but ran up and seizing godfrey by the collar with a powerful grasp jerked him on his back in the twinkling of an eye then completely turning the tables he put his knee on godfreys breast and said now you know how it is yourself how do you like it let me up demanded godfrey furiously thats what alfred asked you to do said andy coolly why didnt you do it because i didnt choose answered the prostrate boy almost foaming at the mouth with rage and humiliation then i dont choose to let you up you shall suffer for this said godfrey struggling but in vain not from your hands oh you neednt try so hard to get up i can hold you here all day if i choose youre a low irish boy youre lower than i am just now said andy let me up why didnt you let alfred up he ran against me did he mean to no i didnt andy said alfred who was standing near i told godfrey so but he threw me over and pressed on my breast so hard that it hurt me in this way said andy increasing the pressure on his prostrate enemy godfrey renewed his struggles but in vain please let him up now andy said alfred generously if hell promise not to touch you any more i will i wont promise said godfrey i wont promise anything to a low beggar then you must feel the low beggars knee said andy you wouldnt have got me down if i had been looking you got the advantage of me did i well then ill give you a chance andy rose to his feet and godfrey relieved from the pressure arose too no sooner was he up than he flew like an enraged tiger at our hero but andy was quite his equal in strength and being cool had the advantage the result was that in a few seconds he found himself once more on his back you see said andy it isnt safe for you to attack me i wont keep you down any longer but if you touch alfred again ill give you something worse godfrey arose from the ground and shook his fist at andy ill make you remember this he said i want you to remember it yourself said andy godfrey didnt answer but made his way to the schoolroom sullenly thank you andy said alfred gratefully for saving me from godfrey he hurt me a good deal hes a brute said andy warmly dont be afraid of him alfred but come and tell me if he touches you again ill give him something he wont like you must be very strong andy said the little boy admiringly you knocked him over just as easy andy laughed did you ever know an irish boy that couldnt fight he asked im better with my fists than with my brains alfred thats because you never went to school much youre getting on fast andy im tryin alfred he said its a shame for a big boy like me not to know as much as a little boy like you youll soon get ahead of me andy meanwhile godfrey had taken his place in school feeling far from comfortable he was outraged by the thought that andy whom he regarded as so much beneath him should have had the audacity to throw him down and put his knees on his breast it made him grind his teeth when he thought of it what should he do about it he wanted to be revenged in some way and he meant to be finally he decided to report andy to the teacher and if possible induce him to punish him the teacher knows that my fathers a man of influence he said to himself he will believe me before that ragamuffin if he dont ill try to get him turned away when therefore the bell rang for recess and the rest of the scholars hurried to the playground godfrey lingered behind he waited till all the boys were gone and then went up to the teacher well godfrey what is it asked the master mr stone i want to make a complaint against andrew burke said godfrey what has he done he is a brute said godfrey in an excited manner he dared to come up behind my back before school began and knock me down then he put his knee on my chest and wouldnt let me up what made him do it he knows i dont like him and am not willing to associate with him was that all the reason asked the teacher keenly i suppose so said godfrey i was not aware that andy burke was quarrelsome said the teacher he behaves well in school because he knows he must very well i will inquire into the matter after recess godfrey went back to his seat triumphant he didnt doubt that his enemy would be severely punished chapter xiii godfreys rebellion having made his complaint godfrey waited impatiently for the recess to close in order that he might see retribution fall upon the head of andy he had not long to wait meanwhile however he was missed in the playground wheres godfrey asked one of the boys he dont want to come out he got a licking from andy burke i aint much sorry itll cure him of some of his airs i dont know about that it comes natural to him to put on airs if anybody has insulted godfrey remarked ben travers his toady he had better look out for himself do you hear that andy ben travers says you must look out for yourself whos goin to punish me asked andy if its ben let him come on but ben showed no disposition to come on he could talk and threaten but when words were to be succeeded by blows he never was on hand in fact he was a coward and ought to have kept quiet but it is just that class that are usually most noisy andy had no idea that godfrey would complain to the teacher in a matter where he was so clearly in the wrong nor would he if he had not relied upon his fathers position to carry him through mr stone is a poor man he thought and he wont dare to take the part of a low irish boy against the only son and heir of colonel preston he knows on which side his bread is buttered and he wont be such a fool as to offend my father while he said this he knew that it was very doubtful whether his father would espouse his cause but then mr stone would probably suppose he would which would answer the same purpose on the present occasion when andy reentered the schoolroom with the rest of the boys at the termination of recess he saw godfrey in his seat the latter darted at him a glance of malicious triumph when the noise of entering was over mr stone said andrew burke come forward considerably surprised andy came forward and looked up with a modest selfpossession into the teachers face a complaint has been entered against you andrew mr stone began what is it sir asked andy you are charged by godfrey preston with violently assaulting and throwing him down just before school commenced is this true yes sir answered andy promptly you are charged with kneeling down upon him and preventing his getting up that is true said andy quite composedly i am surprised that you should have acted in this manner said mr stone i did not think you quarrelsome or a bully i hope i am not said andy did godfrey tell you why i knocked him over he said it was because he would not associate with you andy laughed i hope youll excuse my laughing sir he said respectfully but id rather associate with any of the boys than with godfrey i like him least of all then that is the reason you attacked him is it no sir then what was it if you dont mind sir id like to have you ask alfred parker alfred parker called out the teacher come forward alfred obeyed do you know why andrew attacked godfrey preston yes sir it was on my account on your account explain this morning before school i was playing with another boy and accidentally ran into godfrey he got mad and threw me over violently then he pressed his knee on my breast till i could hardly breathe i begged him to let me up but he would not though he knew that it was only an accident while i was lying on the ground andy burke came up he no sooner saw me than he ran up and threw godfrey off and got on him in the same manner and i think he served him right as he uttered these last words godfrey scowled ominously but andys face brightened up he was glad that alfred was brave enough to speak up for him this alters the case considerably said the teacher is there any other boy who witnessed the affair and can substantiate what has been said if so let him raise his hand herman reynolds raised his hand well herman what do you know about it were you present yes sir i was it was just as alfred said it was what have you to say godfrey asked mr stone sternly i dont mean to be insulted by an irish boy said godfrey haughtily remember where you are sir and speak in a more becoming manner did you attack alfred parker as he says he had no business to run into me answer my question yes i did and did you kneel on his breast yes oblige me by saying yes sir yes sir said godfrey reluctantly why do you complain then of being treated in a similar manner by andrew he has no business to touch me if he had not interfered when he saw you maltreating his young schoolfellow i should have been ashamed of him said the teacher this so far chimed in with the sentiment of the boys that they almost involuntarily applauded and one boy arising exclaimed three cheers for the teacher the three cheers were given with a will and though they were strictly speaking out of order mr stone was a sensible man and the only notice he took of it was to say thank you boys i am glad to find that you agree with me on this point and that your sympathies are with the weak and oppressed godfrey preston your complaint is dismissed i advise you to cease acting the part of a bully or you may get another similar lesson andrew when you exert your strength i hope it will always be in as just a cause you may take your seat and you also alfred the boys would have applauded again but mr stone said waving his hand once is enough boys time is precious and we must now go on with our lessons first class in arithmetic godfrey had been equally surprised and angry at the turn that affairs had taken he was boiling with indignation and nervously moved about in his seat after a slight pause having apparently taken his determination he took his cap and walked toward the door mr stones attention was drawn to him where are you going godfrey he demanded quickly home said godfrey you will wait till the end of school i would rather not sir it makes no difference what you would rather do or rather not do are you sick no sir then you have no good cause for leaving and i shall not permit you to do so i have been insulted sir and i dont wish to stay by whom demanded the teacher sharply godfrey would like to have said by you but he saw the teachers keen eye fixed upon him and he didnt dare to do it he hesitated by whom repeated mr stone by andrew burke that is no good reason for your leaving school or would not be if it were true but it is not he has only meted out to you the same punishment you undertook to inflict upon a smaller boy take your seat my father will take me away from school said godfrey angrily we shall none of us mourn for your absence take your seat this last remark of the teacher still further incensed godfrey and led him temporarily to forget himself though he had been bidden to take his seat he resolved to leave the schoolroom and made a rush for the door but mr stone was there before him he seized godfrey by the collar and dragged him shaking him as he proceeded to his seat on which he placed him with some emphasis that is the way i treat rebels he said you forget yourself preston the next time you make up your mind to resist my commands count in advance on a much severer lesson godfrey was pale with passion and his hands twitched convulsively he only wished he had mr stone in his power for five minutes he would treat him worse than he did alfred parker but a boy in a passion is not a very pleasant spectacle it is enough to say that godfrey was compelled to stay in school for the remainder of the forenoon as soon as he could get away he ran home determined to enlist his mother in his cause chapter xiv mr stone is called to account at home godfrey gave a highly colored narrative of the outrageous manner in which he had been abused for so he chose to represent it he gave this account to his mother for his father was not at home indeed he was absent for a day or two in a distant city mrs preston was indignant it is an outrage godfrey she said compressing her thin lips how did mr stone dare to treat you in this way i was surprised myself said godfrey had he no more respect for your fathers prominent position it looks as if he didnt he is evidently unfit to keep the school i shall try to persuade your father to have him turned away i wish he might be said godfrey it would teach him to treat me with proper respect anybody would think that irish boy was the son of the most important man in town both godfrey and his mother appeared to take it for granted that a teacher should treat his pupils according to their social position this is certainly very far from proper as all my youthful readers will i hope agree i dont want to go back to school this afternoon mother said godfrey i dont wonder said his mother i will tell you what i will do i will send a letter to mr stone by you asking him to call here this evening i will then take occasion to express my opinion of his conduct thats good mother said godfrey joyfully he knew that his mother had a sharp tongue and he longed to hear his mother give it to the teacher whom he hated then you think i had better go to school this afternoon yes with the note if mr stone does not apologize you need not go tomorrow i will go upstairs and write it at once the note was quickly written and putting it carefully in his inside pocket godfrey went to school as he entered the schoolroom he stepped up to the desk and handed the note to mr stone here is a note from my mother he said superciliously very well said the teacher taking it gravely as it was not quite time to summon the pupils he opened it at once this was what he read mr stone sir my son godfrey informs me that you have treated him in a very unjust manner for which i find it impossible to account i shall be glad if you can find time to call at my house this evening in order that i may hear from your lips an explanation of the occurrence yours in haste lucinda preston preston said mr stone after reading this note you may say to your mother that i will call this evening he did not appear in the least disturbed by the contents of the note he had received from the richest and in her own eyes the most important lady in the village in fact he had a large share of selfrespect and independence and was not likely to submit to browbeating from anyone he tried to be just in his treatment of the scholars under his charge and if he ever failed it was from misunderstanding or ignorance not from design in the present instance he felt that he had done right and resolved to maintain the justice of his conduct nothing of importance occurred in the afternoon godfrey was very quiet and orderly he felt that he could afford to wait with malicious joy he looked forward to the scolding mr stone was to get from his mother he wont dare to talk to her he said to himself i hope shell make him apologize to me he ought to do it before the school evidently godfrey had a very inadequate idea of the teachers pluck if he thought such a thing possible school was dismissed and godfrey went home he dropped a hint to ben travers that his mother was going to haul mr stone over the coals as he expressed it are you going to be there asked ben when godfrey had finished yes said godfrey itll be my turn then perhaps mr stone will have something to say said ben doubtfully he wont dare to said godfrey confidently he knows my father could get him kicked out of school hes rather spunky the master is said ben who toady as he was understood the character of mr stone considerably better than godfrey did ill tell you all about it tomorrow morning said godfrey all right i expect hell apologize to me for what he did maybe he will answered ben but he thought it highly improbable did you give my note to mr stone asked his mother yes what did he say he said hed come around how did he appear he looked a little nervous said godfrey speaking not according to facts but according to his wishes i thought so said mrs preston with a look of satisfaction he will find that he has made a mistake in treating you so outrageously give it to him right and left mother said godfrey with more force than elegance you might express yourself more properly my son said mrs preston i shall endeavor to impress upon his mind the impropriety of his conduct at halfpast seven mr stone rang the bell at mrs prestons door and was ushered in without delay goodevening mrs preston he said bowing your son brought me a note this afternoon requesting me to call i have complied with your request be seated mr stone said the lady frigidly not offering her hand thank you said the teacher with equal ceremony and did as invited i suppose you can guess the object of my request said mrs preston i think you stated it in your note i desire an explanation of the manner in which you treated my son this forenoon mr stone pardon me madam your son is in the room well sir i decline discussing the matter before him i cannot understand why you should object to his presence i am his teacher and he is subject to my authority you apparently desire to find fault with the manner in which i have exercised that authority it is improper that the discussion upon this point should take place before him may i stay in the room mother asked godfrey who was alarmed lest he should miss the spectacle of mr stones humiliation i really dont see why not returned his mother madam said mr stone rising i will bid you goodevening what sir before we have spoken on the subject i distinctly decline to speak before your son for the reasons already given this is very singular sir however i will humor your whims godfrey you may leave the room cant i stay i am compelled to send you out godfrey went out though with a very ill grace now madam said the teacher i have no objection to telling you that i first reprimanded your son for brutal treatment of a younger schoolmate and then forcibly carried him back to his seat when he endeavored to leave the schoolroom without my permission it was mrs prestons turn to be surprised she had expected to overawe the teacher and instead of that found him firmly and independently defending his course mr stone she said my son tells me that you praised an irish boy in your school for a violent and brutal assault which he made upon him i did not praise him for that i praised him for promptly interfering to prevent godfrey from abusing a boy smaller and younger than himself godfrey had good cause for punishing the boy you refer to he acted in selfdefense he has doubtless misrepresented the affair to you madam as he did to me you take this andrew burkes word against his i form my judgment upon the testimony of an eyewitness and from what i know of your sons character from your own statement this low irish boy to whom do you refer madam to the irish boy i have yet to learn that he is low do you mean to compare him with my son in wealth no otherwise you mustnt blame me for saying that i hold him entirely equal in respectability and in some important points his superior really sir your language is most extraordinary at this moment there was an interruption godfrey had been listening at the keyhole but finding that difficult had opened the door slightly but in his interest managed to stumble against it the door flew open and he fell forward upon his knees on the carpet of the sittingroom chapter xv mrs prestons discomfiture godfrey rose to his feet red with mortification his mother looked disconcerted mr stone said nothing but glanced significantly from godfrey to mrs preston what is the matter godfrey she asked rather sharply it was an accident said godfrey rather sheepishly you can go out and shut the door and take care not to let such an accident happen again for some unknown reason mr stone prefers that you should not be present and therefore you must go for once godfrey found nothing to say but withdrew in silence you appear to have formed a prejudice against godfrey mr stone said mrs preston i may have formed an unfavorable judgment of him on some points said the teacher i judge of him by his conduct to say that andrew burke is his superior is insulting to him and his family as well as ludicrous i beg pardon mrs preston but i must dissent from both your statements andrew burke possesses some excellent qualities in which godfrey is deficient he is a poor working boy he is none the worse for that he should remember his position and treat my son with proper respect i venture to say that godfrey will receive all the respect to which he is entitled may i ask if you expect him to be treated with deference because his father is richer than those of the other boys it seems to me only proper do you expect me to treat him any better on that account i think my sons social position should command respect then mrs preston i entirely disagree with you said mr stone firmly as a teacher i have nothing whatever to do with the social position of the children who come to me as pupils from me a poor boy will receive the same instruction and the same treatment precisely as the son of rich parents if he behaves as he should he will always find in me a friend as well as a teacher your son godfrey shall have no just complaint to make of my treatment i will give him credit for good conduct and faithful study but no more than to andrew burke or to any other pupil under the same circumstances mr stone i am surprised at your singular style of talking you wish to do away with all social distinctions i certainly do madam in my schoolroom at least there must be social differences i am aware we cannot all be equally rich or honored but whatever may be the worlds rule i mean to maintain strict impartiality in my schoolroom will you require andy burke to apologize to godfrey why should i for his violent assault upon him certainly not he was justified in his conduct if my son was doing wrong the irish boy instead of interfering should have waited till you came and then reported the matter to you and meanwhile stood by and seen alfred parker inhumanly treated i presume the matter has been greatly exaggerated i do not madam do i understand that you decline to make reparation to my son reparation for what for the manner in which he has been treated i must have talked to little purpose if i have not made it clear that your son has only received his deserts of course he is entitled to no reparation as you term it then mr stone said mrs preston her thin lips compressed with indignation since godfrey cannot meet with fair treatment i shall be compelled to withdraw him from your school that must be as you please madam said the teacher quite unmoved by the threatened withdrawal of his richest pupil i shall report to colonel preston your treatment of his son i have no objection madam you are pursuing a very unwise course in alienating your wealthiest patrons i have no patrons madam said mr stone proudly i return faithful service for the moderate wages i receive and the obligation if there is any is on the part of those whose children i instruct really thought mrs preston this man is very independent for a poor teacher she resolved upon another shot not in the best of taste you must not be surprised mr stone she said if the school trustees refuse to employ you again you mistake me utterly said the teacher with dignity if you suppose that any such threat or consideration will make me swerve from my duty however though i did not propose to mention it i will state that this is the last term i shall teach in this village i have been engaged at double the salary in a neighboring city mrs preston was disappointed to hear this it was certainly vexatious that the man who had treated her son with so little consideration who had actually taken the part of a working boy against him should be promoted to a better situation she had thought to make him feel that he was in her power but she now saw that her anticipations were not to be realized as she did not speak mr stone considered the interview closed and rose goodevening mrs preston he said goodevening sir she responded coldly he bowed and withdrew when godfrey who was not far off though he had not thought it best to play the part of eavesdropper again heard the door close he hurried into the room well mother what did he say he inquired eagerly he obstinately refused to make any reparation to you did you tell him what you thought of his treatment of me said godfrey rather surprised that his mothers remonstrance had produced no greater effect yes i expressed my opinion very plainly i must say that hes a very impudent man the idea of a poor teacher putting on such airs continued mrs preston tossing her head what did he say that that irish boy was superior to you id like to knock him over said godfrey wrathfully mrs preston was a lady and it is not to be supposed that she should join in her sons wish still it did not occur to her that she should mourn very much if mr stone met with a reverse she would like to see his pride humbled not reflecting that her own was greater and less justifiable you ought to have told him that he would lose his school said godfrey that would have frightened him for he is a poor man and depends on the money he gets for teaching he is not going to teach here after this term good did he tell you that yes he is afraid of me after all you are mistaken godfrey he is offered considerably higher pay in another place godfreys countenance fell it was as disagreeable to him as to his mother to learn that mr stone was to be promoted in his profession shall i have to go to school again mother he asked after a pause no said mrs preston with energy upon that i have determined while mr stone is teacher you shall not go back i will take care to let it be known in the neighborhood why i keep you at home i hope the next teacher will be a man who understands the respect due to social position i dont care to have you put on an equality with such boys as andrew burke he is no fit associate for you that is what i think mother said godfrey the low beggar id like to come up with him perhaps i shall have a chance some day when colonel preston returned home the whole story was told to him but colored though it was he guessed how matters actually stood and was far from becoming his sons partisan he privately went to mr stone and obtained his version of the affair you did right mr stone he said at the end if my son chooses to act the bully he must take the consequences mrs preston does not look upon it in the same light and insists upon my taking godfrey from school for the sake of peace i must do so but you must not construe it as showing any disapproval on my part of your course in the matter thank you colonel preston said the teacher warmly i can only regret mrs prestons displeasure your approval i highly value and it will encourage me in the path of duty chapter xvi the christmas present godfrey didnt return to school at all he fancied that it would be more aristocratic to go to a boarding school and his mother concurring in this view he was entered as a scholar at the melville academy situated in melville twelve miles distant once a fortnight he came home to spend the sunday on these occasions he flourished about with a tiny cane and put on more airs than ever no one missed him much outside of his own family andy found the school considerably more agreeable after his departure we will now suppose twelve months to have passed during this time andy has grown considerably and is now quite a stout boy he has improved also in education the misses grant taking a kind interest in his progress managed to spare him half the day in succeeding terms so that he continued to attend school knowing that he had but three hours to learn when the others had six he was all the more diligent and was quite up to the average standard for boys of his age the fact is andy was an observing boy and he realized that education was essential to success in life mr stone before going away talked with him on this subject and gave him some advice which andy determined to follow as may be inferred from what i have said andy was still working for the misses grant he had grown accustomed to their ways and succeeded in giving them perfect satisfaction and accomplished quite as much work as john his predecessor though the latter was a man as christmas approached miss priscilla said one day to her sister dont you think sophia it would be well to give andrew a christmas present just so returned sophia approvingly he has been very faithful and obliging all the time he has been with us just so i have been thinking what would be a good thing to give him a pair of spectacles suggested sophia rather absentmindedly sophia you are a goose just so acquiesced her sister meekly such a gift would be very inappropriate just so a pair of boots was the next suggestion that would be better boots would be very useful but i think it would be well to give him something that would contribute to his amusement of course we must consult his taste and not out own we are not boys just so said sophia promptly and he is not a lady she added enlarging upon the idea of course not now the question is what do boys like just so said sophia but this admission did not throw much light upon the character of the present to be bought just then andy himself helped them to a decision he entered cap in hand and said if you can spare me miss grant i would like to go skating on the pond have you a pair of skates andrew no maam said andy but one of the boys will lend me a pair yes andrew you can go if you will be home early yes maam thank you as he went out miss priscilla said i have it what asked sophia alarmed i mean that i have found out what to give to andrew what is it a pair of skates just so said sophia he will like them so i think suppose we go to the store while he is away and buy him a pair wont he need to try them on asked her sister no said priscilla they dont need to fit as exactly as boots so the two sisters made their way to the village store and asked to look at their stock of skates are you going to skate miss priscilla asked the shopkeeper jocosely no they are for sophia answered priscilla who could joke occasionally oh priscilla answered the matteroffact sophia you didnt tell me about that i am sure i could not skate you said they were for andrew sophia you are a goose just so it was only a joke just so the ladies who never did things by halves selected the best pair in the store and paid for them when andy had returned from skating priscilla said how did you like the skating andrew it was bully said andrew enthusiastically whose skates did

counted out six dollars in bills of which miss priscilla took charge the next day they fulfilled their commission and purchased a fine dress pattern at the village store it cost rather more than six dollars but this they paid out of their own pockets and did not report to andy just after supper as he was about to go home to spend christmas eve they placed the bundle in his hands isnt it beautiful he exclaimed with delight wont mother be glad to get it shell think she has a good son andrew shure i ought to be good to her for shes a jewel of a mother that is right andrew i always like to hear a

sooner saw the skates than his face brightened up with the most evident satisfaction its just what i wanted he said joyfully theyre regular beauties im ever so much obliged to you sophia wanted to get you a pair of spectacles but i thought these would suit you better andy went off into a fit of laughter at the idea in which both the ladies joined him then after thanking them again he hurried home hardly knowing which gave him greater pleasure his own present or his mothers i will not stop to describe andys christmas for this is only a retrospect but carry my reader forward to the next september when andy met with an adventure which eventually had a considerable effect upon his fortunes chapter xvii introduces an adventurer colonel preston as i have already said was a rich man he owned no real estate in the town of crampton except the house in which he lived his property was chiefly in stocks of different kinds included in these was a considerable amount of stock in a woolen manufacturing establishment situated in melville some twelve miles distant dividends upon these were paid semiannually on the first of april and october it was the custom of colonel preston at these dates to drive over to melville receive his dividends and then drive back again now unfortunately for the welfare of the community there are some persons who unwilling to make a living by honest industry prefer to possess themselves unlawfully of means to maintain their unprofitable lives among them was a certain blackwhiskered individual who finding himself too well known in new york had sought the country ready for any stroke of business which might offer in his particular line chance led his steps to melville where he put up at the village inn he began at once to institute inquiries the answers to which might serve his purpose and to avert suspicion casually mentioned that he was a capitalist and thought of settling down in the town as he was well dressed and had a plausible manner this statement was not doubted among other things he made inquiries in regard to the manufactory what dividends it paid and when expressing himself desirous of purchasing some stock he inquired the names of the principal owners of the stock first among them was mentioned colonel preston perhaps he might sell some stocks suggested the landlord where can i see him asked james fairfax for this was the name assumed by the adventurer you can see him here answered the landlord in a day or two he will be here the first of the month to receive his dividends will he stop with you probably he generally dines with me when he comes over will you introduce me with pleasure mr fairfax appeared to hear this with satisfaction and said that he would make colonel preston an offer for a part of his stock most of my property is invested in real estate in new york he said but i should like to have some manufacturing stock and from what you tell me i think favorably of the melville mills we should be glad to have you settle down among us said the landlord i shall probably do so said fairfax i am very much pleased with your town and people in due time colonel preston drove over as usual he put up at the hotel colonel said the landlord theres a gentleman stopping with me who desires an introduction to you indeed what is his name james fairfax is he from this neighborhood no from the city of new york i shall be happy to make his acquaintance said the colonel courteously but it must be after i return from the mills i shall be there a couple of hours probably we are to have a directorial meeting i will tell him colonel preston attended the directors meeting and also collected his dividend amounting to eight hundred dollars these in eight onehundreddollar bills he put in his pocketbook and returned to the hotel for dinner dinner is not quite ready colonel said the landlord it will be ready in fifteen minutes where is the gentleman who wished to be introduced to me asked colonel preston who thought it would save time to be introduced now i will speak to him he went directly to a darkcomplexioned man with black whiskers and eyes that were rather sinister in appearance the eyes oftenest betray the real character of a man where all other signs fail but colonel preston was not a keen observer nor was he skilled in physiognomy and judging of mr fairfax by his manner merely was rather pleased with him you will pardon my obtruding myself upon you colonel preston said the stranger with great ease of manner i am happy to make your acquaintance sir i am a stranger in this neighborhood the city of new york is my home i have been led here by the recommendations of friends who knew that i desired to locate myself in the country how do you like melville very much so much that i may settle down here but colonel preston i am a man of business and if i am to be here i want some local interest some stake in the town itself quite natural sir you are a business man yourself and will understand me now to come to the point i find you have a manufactory here a woolen manufactory which i am given to understand is prosperous and profitable you are correctly informed mr fairfax it is paying twelve per cent dividends and has done so for several years that is excellent it is a better rate than i get for most of my city investments i also have city investments bank stocks and horserailroad stocks but as you say my mill stock pays me better than the majority of these you are a large owner of the mill stock are you not colonel preston yes sir the largest i believe so i am informed would you be willing to part with any of it i have never thought of doing so i am afraid i could not replace it with any other that would be satisfactory i dont blame you of course but it occurred to me that having a considerable amount you might be willing to sell i generally hold on to good stock when i get possession of it indeed i would buy more if there were any in the market he must have surplus funds thought the adventurer i must see if i cant manage to get some into my possession here the landlord appeared and announced that dinner was ready you dine here then said fairfax yes it will take me two hours to reach home so i am obliged to dine here we shall dine together it seems i am glad of it as at present i happen to be the only permanent guest at the hotel may i ask where you live in crampton i have heard favorably of it and have been intending to come over and see the place but the fact is i am used only to the city and your country roads are so blind that i have been afraid of losing my way wont you ride over with me this afternoon mr fairfax i cant bring you back but you are quite welcome to a seat in my chaise one way the eyes of the adventurer sparkled at the invitation colonel preston had fallen into the trap he had laid for him but he thought it best not to accept too eagerly you are certainly very kind colonel preston he answered with affected hesitation but i am afraid i shall be troubling you too much no trouble whatever said colonel preston heartily it is a lonely ride and i shall be glad of a companion a lonely ride is it thought fairfax all the better for my purpose it shall not be my fault if i do not come back with my pockets well lined the dividends you have just collected will be better in my pockets than in yours this was what he thought but he said then i will accept with pleasure i suppose i can easily engage someone to bring me back to melville oh yes we have a livery stable where you can easily obtain a horse and driver the dinner proceeded and fairfax made himself unusually social and agreeable so that colonel preston congratulated himself on the prospect of beguiling the loneliness of the way in such pleasant company fairfax spoke of stocks with such apparent knowledge that the colonel imagined him to be a gentleman of large property it is not surprising that he was deceived for the adventurer really understood the subject of which he spoke having been for several years a clerk in a brokers countingroom in wall street the loss of his situation was occasioned by his abstraction of some securities part of which he had disposed of before he was detected he was in consequence tried and sentenced to three years imprisonment at the end of this period he was released with no further taste for an honest life and had since allied himself to the class who thrive by preying upon the community this was the man whom colonel preston proposed to take as his companion on his otherwise lonely ride home chapter xviii riding with a highwayman get into the chaise mr fairfax said colonel preston thank you said the adventurer and accepted the invitation now we are off said the colonel as he took the reins and touched the horse lightly with the whip is the road a pleasant one inquired fairfax the latter part is rather lonely for a mile it runs through the woods still on a summer day that is rather pleasant than otherwise in the evening it is not so agreeable no i suppose not said fairfax rather absently colonel preston would have been startled could he have read the thoughts that were passing through the mind of his companion could he have known his sinister designs he would scarcely have sat at his side chatting so easily and indifferently i will postpone my plan till we get to that part of the road he speaks of thought fairfax it would not do for me to be interrupted i suppose it is quite safe traveling anywhere on the road remarked the adventurer oh yes said colonel preston with a laugh thieves and highway robbers do not pay us the compliment of visiting our neighborhood they keep in the large cities or in places that will better reward their efforts precisely said fairfax i am glad to hear it for i carry a considerable amount of money about me so do i today this is the day for payment of mill dividends and as i have occasion to use the money i did not deposit it good said fairfax to himself that is what i wanted to find out aloud he said oh well there are two of us so it would be a bold highwayman that would venture to attack us do you carry a pistol not i said colonel preston i dont like the idea of carrying firearms about with me they might go off by mistake i was reading in a daily paper recently of a case where a man accidentally shot his son with the pistol he was in the habit of carrying about with him there is that disadvantage to be sure said fairfax so he has no pistol he is quite in my power he said to himself its a good thing to know by the way he asked merely to keep up the conversation are you a family man colonel preston yes sir i have a wife and a son of fifteen you have the advantage of me in that respect i have always been devoted to business and have had no time for matrimony time enough yet mr fairfax oh yes i suppose so if you are going to settle down in our neighborhood i can introduce you to some of our marriageable young ladies said colonel preston pleasantly thank you said fairfax in the same tone i may avail myself of your offer wont you take supper at my home this evening said the colonel hospitably i shall be glad to introduce mrs preston my son is at boarding school so i shall not be able to let you see him have you but one child then but one his absence leaves us alone godfreys absence would have been lamented more by his father had his character and disposition been different but he was so arrogant and overbearing in his manners and so selfish that his father hoped that association with other boys would cure him in part of these objectionable traits at home he was so much indulged by his mother who could see no fault in him as long as he did not oppose her that there was little chance of amendment so they rode on conversing on various topics but their conversation was not of sufficient importance for me to report at length they entered on a portion of the road lined on either side by a natural forest fairfax looked about him i suppose colonel preston these are the woods you referred to yes sir how far do they extend about a mile they had traversed about half a mile when fairfax said if you dont object colonel preston i will step out a moment theres a tree with a peculiar leaf i would like to examine it nearer to certainly mr fairfax said the colonel though he wondered what tree it could be for he saw no tree of an unusual character the chaise stopped and fairfax jumped off but he seemed to have forgotten the object of dismounting instead of examining the foliage of a tree he stepped to the horses head and seized him by the bridle what are you going to do mr fairfax asked colonel preston in surprise by this time fairfax had withdrawn a pistol from his inside pocket and deliberately pointed it at his companion good heavens mr fairfax what do you mean colonel preston said the adventurer i want all the money you have about you i know you have a considerable sum for you have yourself acknowledged it why exclaimed colonel preston startled this is highway robbery precisely said fairfax bowing mockingly you have had the honor of riding with a highwayman will you be good enough to give me the money at once i am in haste surely this is a joke mr fairfax i have heard of such practical jokes before you are testing my courage i am not in the least frightened jump in the chaise again and we will proceed thats a very kind way of putting it said fairfax coolly but not correct i am no counterfeit but the genuine article fairfax is not my name i wont tell you what it is for it might be inconvenient no man can look with equanimity upon the prospect of losing money and colonel preston may be excused for not wishing to part with his eight hundred dollars but how could he escape he had no pistol and fairfax held the horses bridle in a strong grasp if he could only parley with him till some carriage should come up he might save his money it seemed the only way and he resolved to try it mr fairfax he said if you are really what you represent i hope you will consider the natural end of such a career turn i entreat you to a more honest course of life that may come some time said fairfax but at present my necessities are too great oblige me by producing your pocketbook i will give you one hundred dollars and keep the matter a secret from all that will be better than to expose yourself to the penalty of the law colonel preston a hundred dollars will not satisfy me you have eight hundred dollars with you and i shall not leave this spot till it is transferred to my possession if i refuse you will subject me to the unpleasant alternative of blowing your brains out said the other coolly you surely would not be guilty of such a crime mr fairfax said colonel preston with a shudder i would rather not i have no desire to take your life but i must have that money if you prefer to keep your money you will compel me to the act youll gain nothing for in that case i shall take both your life first and your money afterward and this is the man with whom i dined and with whom a few moments since i was conversing freely thought colonel preston the adventurer became impatient colonel preston he said abruptly produce that money instantly or i will fire there was no alternative with reluctant hand the colonel drew out his pocketbook and was about to hand it with its contents to the highwayman when there was a sudden crash in the bushes behind fairfax his pistol was dashed from his hand and our young hero andy burke with resolute face stood with his gun leveled at him all happened so quickly that both colonel preston and fairfax were taken by surprise and the latter still retaining his hold upon the bridle stared at the young hero who had so intrepidly come between him and his intended victim with an oath he stopped and was about to pick up the pistol which had fallen from his hands but was arrested by the quick decisive tones of andy let that pistol alone if you pick it up i will shoot you on the spot chapter xix baffled a robber fairfax paused at andys threat he was only a boy it is true but he looked cool and resolute and the gun which was pointed at him looked positively dangerous but was he to be thwarted in the very moment of his triumph by a boy he could not endure it young man he said this is dangerous business for you if you dont make yourself scarce you wont be likely to return at all ill take the risk said andy coolly confound him i thought hed be frightened said fairfax to himself i dont want to kill you he said with a further attempt to intimidate andy i dont mean to let you said our hero quietly you are no match for me with a gun i am i dont believe it is loaded if you try to pick up that pistol ill convince you by the powers i will said andy energetically what is to prevent my taking away the gun from you faith returned andy quaintly youll take the powder and ball first im thinkin fairfax thought so too and that was one reason why he concluded not to try it it was certainly a provoking position for him there lay the pistol on the ground just at his feet yet if he tried to pick it up the boy would put a bullet through him it was furthermore provoking to reflect that had he not stopped to parley with colonel preston he might have secured the money which he so much desired before andy had come up there was one other resource he had tried bullying and without success he would try cajoling and temptation look here boy he said i am a desperate man i would as leave murder you as not thank you said andy but id rather not have it done i dont want to hurt you as i said before but you mustnt interfere with me then you mustnt interfere with the colonel i must have the money in his pocketbook must you maybe ill have something to say to that he has eight hundred dollars with him did he tell you no matter i know if you wont interfere with me ill give you two hundred of it thank you for nothing then said andy independently im only a poor irish boy but i aint a thafe and never mane to be bravo andy said colonel preston who had awaited with a little anxiety the result of the offer fairfax stooped suddenly but before he could get hold of the pistol andy struck him on the head with the gunbarrel causing him to roll over while in a quick and adroit movement he himself got hold of the pistol before fairfax had recovered from the crack on his head now said andy triumphantly with the gun over his shoulder and presenting the pistol lave here mighty quick or ill shoot ye give me back the pistol then said the discomfited ruffian i guess not said andy its my property i dont know that maybe you took it from some thraveler give it to me and ill go off peaceably i wont take no robbers word said andy are you goin give me the pistol fire it off if you like that you may load it again you dont catch a weasel asleep answered andy shrewdly ive a great mind to make you march into the village and give you up to the perlice this suggestion was by no means pleasant for the highwayman particularly as he reflected that andy had shown himself a resolute boy and doubly armed as he now was it was quite within his power to carry out his threat dont fire after me he said i never attack an inimy in the rare said andy who always indulged in the brogue more than usual under exciting circumstances i make this explanation as the reader may have noticed a difference in his dialect at different times we shall meet again boy said fairfax menacingly turning at the distance of a few feet thank you sir you neednt thrubble yourself said andy i aint anxious to mate you when we do meet youll know it said the other maybe i will go along wid ye said andy pointing the pistol at him dont shoot said fairfax hastily and he quickened his pace to get out of the way of a dangerous companion andy laughed as the highwayman disappeared in the distance i thought he wouldnt wait long he said andy said colonel preston warmly you have behaved like a hero im only an irish boy said andy laughing shure they dont make heroes of such as i i dont care whether you are irish or dutch you are a hero for all that shure sir its lucky i was round whin that spalpeen wanted to rob you how did you happen to be out with a gun this afternoon i got my work all done and miss grant said i might go out shootin if i wanted shure i didnt expect it ud been robbers i would be afther shootin you came up just in the nick of time werent you afraid i didnt stop to think of that when i saw that big blackguard pintin his pistol at you i thought id have a hand in it myself jump into the chaise andy and ride home with me what wid the gun to be sure we wont leave the gun that has done us too good service already today ive made something out of it anyway said andy displaying the pistol which was silvermounted and altogether a very pretty weapon its a regular beauty he said with admiration it will be better in your hands than in the real owners said colonel preston by this time andy was in the chaise rapidly nearing the village if you hadnt come up just as you did andy i should have been poorer by eight hundred dollars thats a big pile of money said andy who as we know was not in the habit of having large sums of money in his own possession it is considerably more than i would like to lose said colonel preston to whom it was of less importance than to andy i wonder will i ever have so much money thought andy now ill tell you what i think it only right to do andy pursued the colonel andy listened attentively i am going to make you a present of some money as an acknowledgment of the service you have done me i dont want anything colonel preston said andy i didnt help you for the money i know you didnt my lad said the colonel but i mean to give it to you all the same he took out his pocketbook but andy made one more remonstrance i dont think i ought to take it sir thankin you all the same then i will give you one hundred dollars for your mother you cant refuse it for her andys eyes danced with delight he knew how much good this money would do his mother and relieve her from the necessity of working so hard as she was now compelled to do thank you sir he said itll make my mothers heart glad and save her from the hard work here is the money andy said the colonel handing his young companion a roll of bills again andy poured out warm protestations of gratitude for the munificent gift with which colonel preston was well pleased i believe you are a good boy andy he said it is a good sign when a boy thinks so much of his mother id be ashamed not to sir said andy they soon reached the village andy got down at the misses grants gate and was soon astonishing the simple ladies by a narrative of his encounter with the highwayman do you think hell come here asked sophia in alarm if he should come when andy was away you could fire the gun yourself sophia i should be frightened to death then he couldnt kill you afterward just so answered sophia a little bewildered were you shot andrew she asked a minute afterward if i was i didnt feel it said andy jocosely andys heroic achievement made him still more valued by the misses grant and they rejoiced in the handsome gift he had received from the colonel and readily gave him permission to carry it to his mother after supper chapter xx how the news was received it is always pleasant to carry good news and andy hastened with joyful feet to his mothers humble dwelling why andy youre out of breath whats happened asked mrs burke i was afraid of bein robbed said andy the robber wouldnt get much that would steal from you andy i dont know that mother i aint so poor as you think look there now here he displayed the roll of bills there were twenty fives which made quite a thick roll where did you get so much andy asked his sister mary how much is it asked his mother a hundred dollars answered andy proudly a hundred dollars repeated his mother with apprehension oh andy i hope you havent been stealing did you ever know me to stale mother said andy no but i thought you might be tempted whose money is it its yours mother mine exclaimed mrs burke in astonishment youre joking now andy no im not its yours where did it come from then colonel preston sent it to you as a present i am afraid you are not tellin me the truth andy said his mother doubtfully why should he send me so much money listen and ill tell you mother and youll see its the truth ive been tellin thereupon he told the story of his adventure with the highwayman and how he had saved colonel preston from being robbed his mother listened with pride for though andy spoke modestly she could see that he had acted in a brave and manly way and it made her proud of him so the colonel andy concluded wanted to give me a hundred dollars but i didnt like to take it myself but when he said he would give it to you i couldnt say anything aginst that so here it is mother and i hope youll spend some of it on yourself i dont feel as if it belonged to me andy it was you that he meant it for keep it mother and itll do to use when we nade it i dont like to keep so much money in the house andy we might be robbed you can put part of it in the savings bank mother this course was adopted and andy himself carried eighty dollars and deposited it in a savings bank in melville a few days afterward meanwhile colonel preston told the story of andys prowess at home but mrs preston was prejudiced against andy and listened coldly it seems to me colonel preston she said you are making altogether too much of that irish boy he puts on enough airs to make one sick already i never observed it my dear said the colonel mildly everyone else does he thought himself on a level with our godfrey he is godfreys superior in some respects oh well if you are going to exalt him above your own flesh and blood i wont stay and listen to you you disturb yourself unnecessarily my dear i have no intention of adopting him in place of my son but he has done me a great service this afternoon and displayed a coolness and courage very unusual in a boy of his age but for him i should be eight hundred dollars poorer oh well you can give him fifty cents and he will be well paid for his services as you call them fifty cents repeated her husband well a dollar if you like i have given him a hundred dollars a hundred dollars almost screamed mrs preston who was a very mean woman are you insane not that i am aware of my dear it is perfectly preposterous to give such a sum to such a boy i ought to say that i gave it to him for his mother he was not willing to accept it for himself thats a likely story said mrs preston incredulously he only wants to make a favorable impression upon you perhaps to get more out of you you misjudge him my dear i know he is an artful intriguing young rascal you give him a hundred dollars yet you refused to give godfrey ten dollars last week for a very good reason he has a liberal allowance and must keep within it he did not need the money he asked for yet you lavish a hundred dollars on this boy i felt justified in doing so which was better to give him that sum or to lose eight hundred i dont like the boy and i never shall i suppose he will be strutting around boasting of his great achievement if he had a gun it was nothing to do i suspect godfrey would hardly have ventured upon it said the colonel smiling oh of course godfrey is vastly inferior to the irish boy remarked mrs preston ironically you admire the family so much that i suppose if i were taken away you would marry his mother and establish her in my place if you have any such apprehensions my dear your best course is to outlive her that will effectually prevent my marrying her and i pledge you my word that while you are alive i shall not think of eloping with her it is very well to jest about it said mrs preston tossing her head i am precisely of your opinion my dear as you observe that is precisely what i am doing so the interview terminated it was very provoking to mrs preston that her husband should have given away a hundred dollars to andy burkes mother but the thing was done and could not be undone however she wrote an account of the affair to godfrey who she knew would sympathize fully with her view of the case i give some extracts from her letter your father seems perfectly infatuated with that low irish boy of course i allude to andy burke he has gone so far as to give him a hundred dollars yesterday in riding home from melville with eight hundred dollars in his pocketbook he says he was stopped by a highwayman who demanded his money or his life very singularly andy came up just in the nick of time with a gun and made a great show of interfering and finally drove the man away as your father reports he is full of praise of andy and as i said gave him a hundred dollars when two or three would have been quite enough even had the rescue been real but of this i have my doubts it is very strange that the boy should have been on the spot just at the right time still more strange that a fullgrown man should have been frightened away by a boy of fifteen in fact i think it is what they call a putup job i think the robber and andy were confederates and that the whole thing was cut and dried that the man should make the attack and andy should appear and frighten him away for the sake of a reward which i dare say the two have shared together this is what i think about the matter i havent said so to your father because he is so infatuated with the irish boy that it would only make him angry but i have no doubt that you will agree with me it may be said here that godfrey eagerly adopted his mothers view and was equally provoked at his fathers liberality to his young enemy your father says he wont give you the ten dollars you asked for he can lavish a hundred dollars on andy but he has no money to give his own son but sooner or later that boy will be come up with sooner or later he will show himself in his true colors and your father will be obliged to confess that he has been deceived it puts me out of patience when i think of him we shall expect you home on friday afternoon of next week as usual andy was quite unconscious of the large space which he occupied in the thoughts of mrs preston and godfrey and of the extent to which he troubled them he went on trying to do his duty and succeeding fully in satisfying the misses grant who had come to feel a strong interest in his welfare three weeks later sophia grant who had been to the village store on an errand returned home looking greatly alarmed what is the matter sophia asked her sister you look as if you had seen a ghost just so priscilla she said no i dont mean that but we may all be ghosts in a short time what do you mean smallpox is in town whos got it colonel preston and his wife wont stay in the house she is packing up to go off and i expect the poor manll die all by himself unless somebody goes and takes care of him and then itll spread and well all die of it this was certainly startling intelligence andy pitied the colonel who had always treated him well it occurred to him that his mother had passed through an attack of smallpox in her youth and could take care of the colonel without danger he resolved to consult her about it at once chapter xxi a model wife colonel preston returning from a trip to boston in which probably he had been unconsciously exposed to the terrible disease referred to was taken sick and his wife wholly unsuspicious of her husbands malady sent for the doctor the latter examined his patient and on leaving the sickchamber beckoned mrs preston to follow him what is the matter with him doctor asked mrs preston the physician looked grave i regret to say mrs preston that he has the smallpox the smallpox almost shrieked mrs preston oh what will become of me dr townley was rather disgusted to find her first thought was about herself not about her stricken husband its catching isnt it doctor she asked in great agitation i am sorry to say that it is madam do you think i will take it i cannot take it upon myself to say and i was in the same room with him wailed mrs preston and never knew the awful danger oh i wouldnt have the smallpox for this world if i didnt die i should be all marked up for life you havent much beauty to spoil thought the doctor but this thought he prudently kept to himself i must leave the house at once i will go to my brothers house till he has recovered said mrs preston in agitation what exclaimed the doctor in surprise and leave your husband alone i cant take care of him you must see that i cant said mrs preston fretfully i cant expose my life without doing him any good i expose myself every time i visit him said the doctor i never had the smallpox have you been vaccinated yes i believe so im sure i dont know but people sometimes take the smallpox even after they have been vaccinated i should be so frightened that i could do no good then said the doctor gravely you have decided to leave your husband yes doctor i must it is my duty to my boy answered mrs preston catching at this excuse with eagerness i must live for him you know of course if i could do any good it would be different but what would godfrey do if both his father and mother should die she looked up into his face hoping that he would express approval of her intentions but the doctor was too honest for this in truth he was disgusted with the womans selfishness and would like to have said so but this politeness forbade at any rate he was not going to be trapped into any approval of her selfish and cowardly determination what do you wish to be done mrs preston he asked of course your husband must be taken care of hire a nurse doctor a nurse will do much more good than i could she will know just what to do most of them have had the smallpox it is really much better for my husband that it should be so of course you can pay high wages anything she asks added mrs preston whose great fear made her for once in her life liberal i suppose that will be the best thing to do you wish me then to engage a nurse yes doctor if you will be so kind when do you go away at once i shall pack up my clothes immediately on the whole i think i will go to the town where godfrey is at school and board there for the present i must see him and prevent him from coming home you will go into your husbands chamber and bid him goodby no i cannot think of it it would only be useless exposure what will he think explain it to him doctor tell him that i hope he will get well very soon and that i feel it my duty to go away now on godfreys account i am sure he will see that it is my duty i wonder what excuse she would have if she had no son for a pretext thought the doctor well he said i will do as you request see that he has the best of care get him two nurses if you think best dont spare expense what extraordinary liberality in mrs preston thought the physician he went back into the chamber of his patient doctor said colonel preston you didnt tell me what was the matter with me am i seriously sick i am sorry to say that you are dangerously not necessarily you have the smallpox have i said the patient thoughtfully its an awkward thing to tell him that his wife is going to leave him the doctor said to himself however it must be done have you told my wife doctor i just told her what does she say she is very much startled and now for it thinks under the circumstances she ought not to run the risk of taking care of you on account of godfrey perhaps she is right said colonel preston slowly he was not surprised to hear it but it gave him a pang nevertheless she wants me to engage a nurse for you yes that will be necessary there was a pause when is she going he asked a little later as soon as possible she is going to board near the school where godfrey is placed shall i see her she thinks it best not to risk coming into the chamber lest she should carry the infection to godfrey i suppose that is only prudent returned the sick man but in his heart he wished that his wife had shown less prudence and a little more feeling for him have you thought of any nurse he asked i have thought of the widow burke she might not dare to come she has had the disease i know this from a few slight marks still left on her face of course you would be willing to pay a liberal price any price said colonel preston energetically it is a service which i assure you i shall not soon forget i must see her at once for your wife will leave directly pray do so said colonel preston tell my wife he said after a pause that i hope soon to have recovered so that it may be safe for her to come back there was a subdued bitterness in his voice which the doctor detected and did not wonder at he gave the message as requested i am sure i hope so dr townley said mrs preston i shall be tortured with anxiety i hope you will write me daily how my poor husband is getting along perhaps the paper might carry the infection said the doctor testing the real extent of her solicitude i didnt think of that answered mrs preston hastily on the whole you neednt write then it might communicate the disease to godfrey she finds godfrey very useful the doctor thought i will bear my anxiety as i can she continued have you thought of anyone for a nurse i have thought of mrs burke she is poor and will come if you offer her a good price try to get her i think she will come i must go at once for your husband needs immediate attention get her to come at once dr townley oh do my husband may want something and i cant go into the room my duty to my dear only son will not permit me i hope mr preston understands my motives in going away i presume he does said the doctor rather equivocally tell him how great a sacrifice it is for me to leave his bedside it is a terrible trial for me but my duty to my son makes it imperative the doctor bowed he drove at once to the humble dwelling of mrs burke his errand was briefly explained can you come he asked i am authorized to offer you ten dollars a week for the time you spend there i would come in a minute doctor but what shall i do with mary she shall stay at my house i will gladly take charge of her you are very kind doctor i wouldnt want to expose her but i dont mind myself i dont think i am in danger for ive had the smallpox already can you be ready in five minutes tell mary to pack up her things and go to my house at once well take good care of her in less than an hour mrs burke was installed at the bedside of the sick man as his nurse as she entered the house mrs preston left it bound for the railway depot im so glad youre here she said greeting the widow burke with unwonted cordiality i am sure you will take the best care of my husband i have told the doctor to pay you whatever you ask ill do my best mrs preston but not for the money answered mrs burke your husband shall get well if good care can cure him ive no doubt of it but the carriage is here and i must go tell my husband how sorry i am to leave him so mrs preston went away leaving a stranger to fulfill her own duties at the bedside of her husband thus it happened that when andy came home he found his mother already gone and his sister on the point of starting for the doctors house his idea had already been carried out chapter xxii colonel prestons recovery four weeks afterward we will introduce the reader into the bedchamber of colonel preston his sickness has been severe at times recovery was doubtful but mrs burke has proved a careful and devoted nurse intelligent and faithful enough to carry out the directions of the physician how do you feel this morning colonel preston asked the doctor who had just entered the chamber better doctor i feel quite an appetite you are looking better decidedly better the disease has spent its force and retreated from the field it is to you that the credit belongs dr townley only in part the greater share belongs to your faithful nurse mrs burke i shall not soon forget my obligations to her said the sick man significantly now colonel preston said mrs burke you are making too much of what little i have done that is impossible mrs burke it is to your good nursing and the doctors skill that i owe my life and i hardly know to which the most to the doctor sir i only followed out his directions at the expense of your own health you show the effects of your longcontinued care it wont take long to pick up said mrs burke cheerfully is the danger of contagion over doctor asked the patient quite so then would it not be well to write to mrs preston not that i mean to give up my good nurse just yet that is if she is willing to stay i will stay as long as you need me sir that is well but mrs preston may wish to return now that theres no further danger i will write to her at once thank you the following letter was dispatched to mrs preston mrs preston dear madam it gives me great pleasure to inform you that your husband is so far recovered that there is no danger now of infection you can return with safety and he will doubtless be glad to see you he has been very ill indeed in danger of his life but thanks to the devotion of mrs burke who has proved an admirable nurse he is now on the high road to recovery yours respectfully john townley i think that will bring her said the doctor but he reckoned without his host the next day he received the following letter on scented paper my dear doctor townley you cannot think how rejoiced i am to receive the tidings of my husbands convalescence i have been so tortured with anxiety during the last four weeks you cannot think how wretchedly anxious i have been i could not have endured to stay away from his bedside but that my duty imperatively required it i have lost flesh and my anxiety has worn upon me now how gladly will i resume my place at the bedside of my husband restored by your skill i am glad the nurse has proved faithful it was a good chance for her for she shall be liberally paid and no doubt the money will be welcome but dont you think it might be more prudent for me to defer my return until next week it will be safer i think and i owe it to my boy to be very careful you know the contagion may still exist it is hard for me to remain longer away when i would fain fly to the bedside of mr preston but i feel that it is best say to him with my love that he may expect me next week accept my thanks for your attention to him i shall never forget it and believe me to be my dear doctor your obliged lucinda preston dr townley threw down this letter with deep disgust was ever any woman more disgustingly selfish he exclaimed her husband might have died so far as she was concerned of course he had to show this letter to colonel preston the latter read it with grave face and the doctor thought he heard a sigh my wife is very prudent he said with a touch of bitterness in his voice she will be here next week said the doctor having nothing else to answer i think she will run no risk then said the sick man cynically but mrs preston did not return in a week it was a full week and a half before she arrived at her own house the doctor was just coming out of the front door how is my husband she asked not far from well he is still weak of course and are you sure she said anxiously that there is no danger of infection not the slightest madam said dr townley coldly i am so glad i can see him once more you cannot imagine she exclaimed clasping her hands how much i have suffered in my suspense the doctor remained cool and unmoved he didnt feel that he could respond fittingly being absolutely incredulous mrs preston saw it and was nettled she knew that she was a hypocrite but did not like to have the doctor by his silence imply his own conviction of it mine has been a hard position she continued your husband has not had an easy time said the doctor significantly but he has had good care mrs burke was a good nurse admirable she must be paid well i offered her ten dollars a week humph said mrs preston doubtfully in whose eyes five dollars would have been liberal compensation it has been a good chance for her it is far from adequate said the doctor disgusted money cannot pay for such service as hers not to speak of the risk she ran for cases have been known of persons being twice attacked by the disease you dont think my husband will have a relapse asked mrs preston with fresh alarm not if he has the same care for a short time longer he shall have it she must stay of course her duties are lighter now and six dollars a week for the remainder of the time will be enough dont you think so no i dont said the doctor bluntly and moreover i am quite sure your husband will not consent to reducing the wages of one whose faithful care has saved his life oh well you know best said mrs preston slowly i am quite willing that she should be well paid mrs preston went upstairs and entered her husbands chamber oh my dear husband she exclaimed theatrically hurrying across the room with affected emotion i am so glad to find you so much better i am glad to see you back lucinda said colonel preston but he spoke coldly and without the slightest affectation of sentimental joy i have passed through a good deal since you left me and so have i exclaimed his wife oh how my heart has been rent with anxiety as i thought of you lying sick while duty kept me from your side is godfrey well asked her husband taking no notice of her last speech yes poor boy he sends his love and is so anxious to see you let him come next friday afternoon said the sick man who doubted this statement yet wanted to believe it true he shall i will write to him at once so mrs preston resumed her place in the house but from that time there was a something she could not understand in her husbands manner he was graver than formerly and sometimes she saw him watching her intently and after a little turn away with a sigh he had found her out in all her intense selfishness and want of feeling and he could never again regard her as formerly even though she tried hard at times by a show of affection to cover up her heartless neglect chapter xxiii mrs burke has good fortune mrs burke remained a week longer to nurse colonel preston at the end of this time mr preston thought he was well enough to dispense with a nurse and accordingly she prepared to take leave i shall always remember your kind service mrs burke said the colonel warmly it was only my duty sir said the widow modestly not all would have done their duty so faithfully i am glad to see you well again said the widow not more than i am to get well i assure you said he whenever you are in any trouble come to me with these words he placed in her hands an envelope which as she understood contained the compensation for her services she thanked him and took her departure mrs preston was curious to know how much her husband paid the nurse and asked the question a hundred dollars he replied a hundred dollars she repeated in a tone which implied disapproval i thought she agreed to come for ten dollars a week so she did she has not been here ten weeks only about six that is true but she has richly earned all i gave her ten dollars a week i consider very handsome remuneration to one in her position in life said mrs preston pointedly lucinda but for her attention i probably should not have lived through this sickness do you think a hundred dollars so much to pay for your husbands life you exaggerate the value of her services said his wife dr townley says the same thing that i do you are both infatuated with that woman said mrs preston impatiently we only do her justice oh well have it your own way but i should have only paid her what i agreed to it is a great windfall for her she deserves it mrs preston said no more at this time for she found her husband too infatuated as she termed it to agree with her she did however open the subject to godfrey when he came home and he adopted her view of the case she and her low son are trying to get all they can out of father he said its just like them i wish i could make your father see it said mrs preston but he seems prepossessed in her favor if he can give a hundred dollars to her he can give me a little extra money im going to ask him so he did the same evening will you give me ten dollars father he asked what for oh for various things i need it i give you an allowance of three dollars a week i have a good many expenses that will meet all your reasonable expenses i was far from having as much money as that when i was of your age i dont see why you wont give me the money said godfrey discontentedly i dont think you need it you are generous enough to others to whom do you refer you give plenty of money to that irish boy and his mother they have both rendered me great services the boy saved me from being robbed the mother in all probability saved me from falling a victim to smallpox but that has nothing to do with your affairs it is scarcely proper for a boy like you to criticise his fathers way of disposing of his money i confess i think godfrey is right in commenting upon your extraordinary liberality to the burkes observed mrs preston lucinda said her husband gravely when my own wife deserted my sick bed leaving me to wrestle alone with a terrible and dangerous disease i was fortunate enough to find in mrs burke a devoted nurse the money i have paid her is no adequate compensation nor is it all that i intend to do for her there was a part of this speech that startled mrs preston never before had her husband complained of her desertion of him in his sickness and she hoped that he had been imposed upon by the excuse which she gave of saving herself for godfrey now she saw that in this she had not been altogether successful and she regretted having referred to mrs burke and so brought this reproach upon herself she felt it necessary to say something in extenuation it was because i wanted to live for godfrey she said with a flushed face nothing but that would have taken me away from you at such a time it was a great trial to me she continued putting up her handkerchief to eyes that were perfectly dry we will say no more about it said colonel preston gravely i shall not refer to it unless you undervalue my obligations to mrs burke mrs preston thought it best not to reply but on one thing that her husband had said she commented to godfrey your father speaks of giving more money to mrs burke i suppose we shall not know anything about it if he does perhaps he will leave her some money in his will said godfrey very likely if he does there is such a thing as contesting a will that is if he gives her much mrs preston was right her husband did intend to give his devoted nurse something in his will but of that more anon there was one thing which he did at once and that was to buy the cottage which mrs burke occupied from the heir a nonresident mrs burke didnt learn this until she went to pay her rent to the storekeeper who had acted as agent for the owner i have nothing to do with the house any longer mrs burke he said then who shall i pay rent to said mrs burke to colonel preston who has recently bought the house mrs burke therefore called at the house of the colonel mr and mrs preston were sitting together when the servant announced that she wished to speak to him you seem to have a good deal of business with mrs burke said his wife in a very unpleasant tone none that i care to conceal he said smiling show mrs burke in here jane he continued addressing the servant goodmorning mrs burke he said pleasantly goodmorning said mrs preston coldly goodmorning sir im glad to see you looking so much better oh yes i am feeling pretty well now i didnt find out till just now colonel preston that you were my landlord here mrs preston pricked up her ears for it was news to her also as her husband had not mentioned his recent purchase yes i thought i would buy the house as it was in the market i have come to pay my rent i have been in the habit of paying fifteen dollars a quarter i wont be a hard landlord said colonel preston you are welcome to live in the house if it suits you free of all rent this is too much kindness said mrs burke quite overwhelmed by the unexpected liberality mrs preston thought so too but could not well say anything theres been kindness on both sides mrs burke put up your money i dont want it but i have no doubt you will find use for it buy yourself a new dress thank you colonel preston you are very generous and i am very grateful said the widow i have something to be grateful for also mrs burke if you want any repairs just let me know and they shall be attended to thank you sir but the house is very comfortable she soon took her leave when did you buy that house colonel preston asked his wife a month since you didnt say anything about it to me nor to anyone else except those with whom i did the business mrs preston would like to have said more but she did not think it expedient remembering what she had brought upon herself before chapter xxiv andys journey toward the first of april of the succeeding year miss sophia grant took a severe cold not serious indeed but such as to make it prudent for her to remain indoors this occasioned a little derangement of her sisters plans for both sisters were in the habit about the first of april and of october of taking a journey to boston partly for a change and partly because at these times certain banks in which they owned stock declared dividends which they took the opportunity to collect but this spring it seemed doubtful if they could go yet they wanted the money a part of it at least send andrew suggested miss sophia after her sister had stated the difficulty in general miss priscilla did not approve sophias suggestions but this struck her more favorably i dont know but we might she said slowly he is a boy to be trusted just so and i think he is a smart boy just so he can take care of himself you remember how he saved colonel preston from the robber just so then on the other hand he has never been to boston he could ask i dont suppose there would be any particular difficulty i could give him all the necessary directions just so ill propose it to him so after supper as andy was going out into the woodshed for an armful of wood miss priscilla stopped him were you ever in boston andy asked she no maam i wish you had been why maam because i should like to send you there on some business ill go maam said andy eagerly like most boys of his age no proposition could have been more agreeable do you think you could find your way there and around the city no fear of that maam said andy confidently we generally go ourselves as you know but my sister is sick and i dont like to leave her of course not maam said andy quite approving any plan that opened the way for a journey to him we own bank stock and on the first of april they pay us dividends now if we send you do you think you can get to the bank get the money and bring it back safe ill do it for you maam said andy well ill think of it between now and next week if we send you at all you must start next monday ill go any day maam said andy any day you name miss priscilla finally decided to send andrew but cautioned him against saying anything about it except to his own family on monday morning just before the morning train was to start andrew appeared on the platform of the modest village depot with a small carpetbag in his hand lent him by the misses grant give me a ticket to boston said he to the station master godfrey preston who was about to return to his boarding school had just purchased a ticket and overheard this he didnt much care to speak to andy but his curiosity overcame his pride are you going to boston he asked yes said andy what are you going for important business has miss grant turned you off she didnt say anything about it this morning why do you want to take my place do you think id stoop to be a hired boy said godfrey haughtily you wouldnt need to stoop said andy you aint any too tall godfrey winced at this he was not tall of his age and he wanted to be andy had been growing faster than he and was now though scarcely as old quite two inches taller it makes no difference about being tall he rejoined i am a gentleman and dont have to work for a living like you do what are you going to be when you grow up a lawyer then wont you work for money of course then youll be a hired man and work for a living thats very different when are you coming back when ive finished my business how soon will that be i cant tell yet humph i shouldnt wonder if you were running away dont you tell anybody said andy in a bantering tone where did you get the money to pay for your ticket what would you give to know you are impudent said godfrey his cheek flushing so are your questions said andy i dare say you stole it look here godfrey preston said andy roused to indignation by this insinuation youd better not say that again if you know whats best for yourself he advanced a step with a threatening look and godfrey instinctively receded that comes of my speaking to my inferior he said you cant do that what do you mean i dont know anybody thats inferior to you godfrey turned on his heel wrathfully muttering something about a low beggar which andy not hearing did not resent the whistle of the locomotive was heard and the cars came along with high anticipation of pleasure andy got aboard he had before him a journey of close upon a hundred miles and he wished it had been longer he had never been much of a traveler and the scenes which were to greet his eyes were all novel he had heard a good deal of boston also and he wanted to see it besides the money which miss grant had given him to defray his expenses he had with him ten dollars of his own since his mother had received the two donations from colonel preston she made andy keep half his wages for his own use these were now seven dollars a week so he kept three and a half and of this sum was able to lay up about half so he had a supply of money in his trunk of which he had taken with him ten dollars maybe ill see something i want to buy in the city he said to himself i dont mean to dwell upon the journey there is nothing very exciting in a railway trip even of a hundred miles nowadays unless indeed the cars run off the track or over the embankment and then it is altogether too exciting to be agreeable for the sake of my young hero whom i really begin to like though he was only an irish boy i am glad to say that nothing of that sort took place but in good time about the time when the clock on the old south steeple indicated noon andys train drove into the boston maine railway depot fronting on haymarket square inquire your way to washington street that was the first direction that andy had received from miss priscilla and that was what our hero did first the question was addressed to a very civil young man who politely gave andy the necessary directions so in a short time he reached washington street by way of court street the next thing was to inquire the way to the merchants bank that being the one in which the ladies owned the largest amount of stock where is the merchants bank asked andy of a boy whose blackingbox denoted his occupation ill show you mister said the boy come along his young guide instead of taking him to the bank took him to the side door of the courthouse and said go in there it was a massive stone building and andy not suspecting that he was being fooled went in wandering at random he found his way into a room where a trial was going on that opened his eyes he cheated me thought andy maybe ill get even with him he retraced his steps and again found himself in the street his fraudulent young guide with a grin on a face not over clean was awaiting his appearance chapter xxv the merchant from portland look here young chap said andy what made you tell me that was the merchants bank isnt it asked the bootblack with a grin its the bank where youll be wanted some time shouldnt wonder if theyd make a mistake and lock you up instead of your money have you got any money in the merchants bank asked the other im goin to see if they wont give me some if you hadnt cheated me maybe id have invited you to dine with me at my hotel where are you stoppin asked the street boy not quite knowing how much of andys story to believe at the most fashionable hotel parkers youre good at guessin perhaps youd like to dine there i dont know as theyd let me in said the boy doubtfully but ill show you where theres a nice eatin house where they dont charge half so much twouldnt be fashionable enough for me i shall have to dine alone see what comes of tryin to fool your grandfather andy went on leaving the boy in doubt whether his jest had really lost him a dinner andy didnt go to the parker house however his expenses were to be paid by the misses grant and he felt that it wouldnt be right to be extravagant at their expense i shall come across an eatin house presently he said to himself not far off he found one with the bill of fare exposed outside with the prices andy examined it and found that it was not an expensive place he really felt hungry after his mornings ride and determined before he attended to his business to get dinner he accordingly entered and seated himself at one of the tables a waiter came up and awaited his commands whatll you have he asked bring me a plate of roast beef and a cup of coffee said andy and be quick about it for i havent eaten anything for three weeks then i dont think one plate will be enough for you said the waiter laughing itll do to begin on said andy the order was quickly filled and andy set to work energetically it is strange how we run across acquaintances when we least expect it andy had no idea that he knew anybody in the eating house and therefore didnt look around feeling no special interest in the company yet there was one present who recognized him as soon as he entered and watched him with strong interest the interest was not friendly however as might be inferred from the scowl with which he surveyed him this will not be a matter of surprise to the reader when i say that the observer was no other than fairfax whose attempt to rob colonel preston had been defeated by andy he recognized the boy at once both from his appearance and his voice and deep feelings of resentment ran in his breast to be foiled was disagreeable enough but to be foiled by a boy was most humiliating and he had vowed revenge if ever an opportunity occurred for this reason he felt exultant when he saw his enemy walking into the eating house ill follow him he said to himself and itll go hard if i dont get even with him for that trick he played on me but how did it happen that andy did not recognize fairfax for two reasons first because the adventurer was sitting behind him and our hero faced the front of the room next had he seen him it was doubtful if he would have recognized a man whom he was far from expecting to see for fairfax was skilled in disguises and no longer was the blackwhiskered individual that we formerly knew him from motives of prudence he had shaved off his black hair and whiskers and now appeared in a red wig and whiskers of the same hue if any of my readers would like to know how effectual this disguise is let them try it and i will guarantee that they wont know themselves when they come to look at their likeness in the mirror after disposing of what he had ordered andy also ordered a plate of apple dumpling which he ate with great satisfaction i wouldnt mind eatin here every day he thought maybe ill be in business here some day myself and then ill come here and dine fairfax was through with his dinner but waited till andy arose he then arose and followed him to the desk where both paid at the same time he was careless of recognition for he felt confident in his disguise now thought andy i must go to the bank but he didnt know where the bank was so when he got into the street he asked a gentleman whom he met sir can you direct me to the merchants bank it is in state street said the gentleman i am going past it so if you will come along with me i will show you thank you sir said our hero politely merchants bank said fairfax to himself beginning to feel interested i wonder what hes going there for perhaps i can raise a little money besides having my revenge he had an added inducement now in following our hero when andy went into the bank fairfax followed him he was in the room when andy received the dividends and with sparkling eyes he saw that it was a thick roll of bills representing no doubt a considerable sum of money that money must be mine he said to himself it cant be the boys he must have been sent by some other person the loss will get him into trouble very likely he will be considered a thief that would just suit me andy was careful however he put the money into a pocketbook or rather wallet with which he had been supplied by the misses grant put it in his inside pocket and then buttoned his coat up tight he was determined not to lose anything by carelessness but this was not his last business visit there was another bank in the same street where it was necessary for him to call and receive dividends again fairfax followed him and again he saw andy receive a considerable sum of money theres fat pickings here thought fairfax now i must manage in some way to relieve him of that money theres altogether too much for a youngster like him shouldnt wonder if the money belonged to that man i tried to rob if so all the better in this conjecture as we know fairfax was mistaken however it made comparatively little difference to him whose money it was as long as there was a chance of his getting it into his possession the fact was that his finances were not in a very flourishing condition just at present he could have done better to follow some honest and respectable business and avoid all the dishonest shifts and infractions of law to which he was compelled to resort but he had started wrong and it was difficult to persuade him that even now it would have been much better for him to amend his life and ways in this state of affairs he thought it a great piece of good luck that he should have fallen in with a boy in charge of a large sum of money whom from his youth and inexperience he would have less trouble in robbing than an older person andy had already decided how he would spend the afternoon he had heard a good deal about the boston museum its large collection of curiosities and the plays that were performed there one of the pleasantest anticipations he had was of a visit to this place the paradise of country people now that his business was concluded he determined to go there at once but first he must inquire the way turning around he saw fairfax without recognizing him can you direct me to the boston museum he asked certainly with pleasure said fairfax with alacrity in fact i am going there myself i suppose you are going to the afternoon performance yes sir have you ever been there no but i have heard a good deal about it i dont live in the city nor do i said fairfax i am a merchant of portland maine i have come to the city to buy my winter stock of goods as i only come twice a year i generally try to enjoy myself a little while i am here do you stay in the city overnight yes said andy so do i here is the museum they had reached the museum which as some of my readers are aware is situated in tremont street we go up these stairs said fairfax if you dont object we will take seats together i shall be glad to have company said andy politely reserved seats adjoining were furnished and the adventurer and his intended victim entered the museum chapter xxvi spinning the web there was a short interval before the play commenced this andy improved by examining the large stock of curiosities which have been gathered from all parts of the world for the gratification of visitors fairfax kept at his side and spoke freely of all they saw there was something about him which seemed to andy strangely familiar was it in his features or in his voice he could not tell the red whig and whiskers misled him andy finally set it down as a mere chance resemblance to someone whom he had met formerly and dismissed it from his mind at length the increasing crowds pouring into the lectureroom reminded them that the play was about to begin shall we go in and take our seats said fairfax andy assented and they were speedily in their seats i do not propose to speak of the play it was a novelty to andy to see a dramatic representation and he thoroughly enjoyed it fairfax was more accustomed to such things but pretended to be equally interested feeling that in this way he could ingratiate himself better into andys confidence at last it was over and they went out of the building how did you like it asked fairfax tiptop said andy promptly dont you think so capital answered fairfax with simulated delight i am glad i had company i dont enjoy anything half as well alone by the way where do you pass the night at some hotel i dont know which suppose you go to the adams house ive got to stop overnight somewhere and it might be pleasanter going in company where is the adams house on washington street not very far off ten or fifteen minutes walk if its a good place im willing it is an excellent hotel and moderate in price we might go up there now and engage a room and then spend the evening where we like very well said andy they soon reached the adams house a neat unpretending hotel and entered they walked up to the desk and fairfax spoke to the clerk can you give us a room certainly enter your names shall we room together asked fairfax calmly now andy though he had had no objection to going to the theater with his present companion did not care to take a room with a stranger of whom he knew nothing he might be a very respectable man but somehow andy did not know why there was something in his manner which inspired a little repulsion besides he remembered that he had considerable money with him and that consideration alone rendered it imprudent for him to put himself in the power of a companion so he said a little awkwardly i think wed better take separate rooms very well said fairfax in a tone of indifference though he really felt very much disappointed i thought it might have been a little more sociable to be together andy did not take the hint except so far as to say we can take rooms alongside of each other i can give you adjoining rooms if you desire said the clerk fairfax here entered his name in the hotel register as nathaniel marvin portland maine while andy put down his real address his companions was of course fictitious he did not venture to give the name of fairfax as that might be recognized by andy as that of the highwayman with whose little plans he had interfered a servant was called and they went up to their rooms which as the clerk had promised were found to be adjoining they were precisely alike very comfortable mr burke said fairfax in a tone of apparent satisfaction i think we shall have a comfortable night i guess so said andy are you going to stay here now no im going to wash my face and then take a walk around i want to see something of the city i think ill lie down awhile i feel tired perhaps we shall meet later if not i shall see you in the morning all right said andy in a few minutes he went out chapter xxvii the drop game fairfax had an object in remaining behind he wanted to see if there was any way for him to get into andys room during the night that he might rob him in his sleep to his great satisfaction he found that there was a door between the two rooms for the accommodation of persons in the same party who wished to be in adjoining apartments it was however locked but fairfax was not unprepared for such an emergency he took a bunch of keys from his pocket and tried them one after another in the lock there was one that would very nearly fit for this again fairfax was prepared he took from the same pocket a file and began patiently to file away the key till it should fit he tried it several times before he found that it fitted but at last success crowned his efforts the door opened his eyes danced with exultation as he saw this i might as well be in the same room he said to himself now you young rascal i shall take your money and be revenged upon you at the same time he carefully locked the door and then feeling that he had done all that was necessary to do at present went downstairs and took supper andy was out and did not see him meanwhile our young hero was out seeing the sights he walked up washington street and at boylston street turned and reached tremont street when he saw the common before him it looked pleasant and andy crossed the street and entered he walked wherever fancy led and then found himself after a while in a comparatively secluded part here he met with an adventure which i must describe rather a shabbylooking individual in front of him suddenly stooped and picked up a pocketbook which appeared to be well filled with money he looked up and met andys eyes fixed upon it this was what he wanted heres a pocketbook he said somebody must have dropped it andy was interested it seems to have considerable money in it said the finder open it and see said andy i haint time i have got to leave the city by the next train i mean i havent time to advertise it and get the reward which the owner will be sure to offer are you going to stay in the city long im going out tomorrow i must go i wish i knew what to do he seemed to be plunged into anxious thought ill tell you what ill do he said as if a bright idea had suddenly struck him you take the pocketbook and advertise it if the owner is found he will give you a reward if not the whole will belong to you all right said andy hand it over of course said the other i shall expect something myself as i was the one to find it ill give you half but i shall be out of the city ill tell you what give me ten dollars and ill make it over to you thats rather steep said andy heft it there must be a lot of money inside im afraid the reward might be less than ten dollars said andy well im in a great hurry give me five it is possible that andy who was not acquainted with the drop game might have agreed to this but a policeman hove in sight and the shabby individual scuttled away without further ceremony leaving andy a little surprised with the pocketbook in his hand whats he in such a hurry for thought our hero he opened the pocketbook and a light flashed upon him as he perceived that there was no money inside but was stuffed with rolls of paper he wanted to swindle me thought andy its lucky i didnt pay him five dollars anyway ill keep it the pocketbook is worth something he put it in his pocket without taking the trouble to remove the contents chapter xxviii the guest of two hotels andy wandered about till nine oclock determined to see as much of the city as possible in the limited time which he had at his disposal but at last he became tired and returned to the hotel fairfax was seated in the readingroom he looked up as andy entered have you been looking around the city he asked yes said andy i wanted to improve my time i suppose as this is your first visit you see a good deal that is new its all new said andy i feel tired walking around so much no doubt are you going to bed now i guess ill turn in i shant go up quite yet i have been staying here quietly and i dont feel tired i shall go up in the course of an hour or two goodnight then said andy goodnight i hope youll sleep sound said fairfax who was certainly entirely sincere in this wish as the success of his plans depended on the soundness of our heros repose andy went upstairs and lighted the gas in his bedroom he noticed the door communicating with the next one and tried it but found it to be locked thats all right said andy nobody can get in that way he locked the principal door and bolted it also which seemed to make him perfectly secure now thought he after undressing where shall i put the money this was an important question as he had between five hundred and a thousand dollars belonging to the misses grant of which it was his duty to take even more care than if it belonged to himself i guess ill put it under the bolster he reflected covering it up with the sheet nobody can get in that i can see but it is best to be careful in emptying his pockets he came across the pocketbook with its sham contents of which mention has already been made ill leave that in my pocket he said to himself with a smile im not afraid of losing that by the powers it wouldnt be much of a prize to the man that took it im sure of that he laid his clothes on a chair in the middle of the room and jumped into bed when he soon sank into a deep sleep meanwhile fairfax remained below in the readingroom he was not at all sleepy as he had told andy and his mind was full of the scheme of robbery which appeared so promising he was glad andy had retired so early as he would be asleep sooner and this would make things favorable for his entering his young companions chamber it was his intention after he had secured the plunder to adopt a western phrase to come downstairs and leave the hotel not to return as otherwise as soon as andy should discover his loss the door between the two rooms would naturally point to him as the thief he didnt go up to his room till halfpast ten this was an hour and a half later than andy retired and would give him a chance to get fast asleep he must be asleep now he thought on reaching the corridor on which both of the chambers were situated he stood a moment before andys door and listened it was not often that our young hero was guilty of snoring but tonight he was weary and had begun to indulge in this nocturnal disturbance the sounds which he heard were very satisfactory to fairfax the boys fast asleep he muttered ill go into his room and make quick work of it fairfax youre in luck for once fortune has taken a turn softly he opened the door of his own room and entered he lit the gas and then going to the door of communication between the two rooms he listened again there was no cessation of the sounds which he had heard from the outside he determined to make the attempt at once taking the proper key from his pocket he fitted it into the lock and turning it the door opened and he stepped into the adjoining apartment it was dark for andy had extinguished the gas on going to bed but the gas from his own room made it sufficiently light for his purpose he at once caught sight of andys clothes lying on the chair where he had placed them he glanced cautiously at our hero as he lay extended upon the bed with one arm flung out but he saw no reason for alarm quickly he glided to the chair with noiseless step he had removed his boots by way of precaution and thrust his hand into the pocket of the coat it came in contact with the false pocketbook which seemed bulky and full of money fairfax never doubted that it was the right one and quickly thrust it into his own pocket just then andy moved a little in bed and fairfax retreated hastily through the door closing it after him now the sooner i get out of this hotel the better he thought the boy may wake and discover his loss it isnt likely but it may happen at any rate its very much better to be on the safe side he did not stop to examine the prize which he had secured he had no doubt whatever that it contained the money he was after to stop to count it might involve him in peril he therefore put on his boots and glided out of the chamber and downstairs to the clerk who was at the desk he said as he surrendered his key how late do you keep open till after midnight certainly was the reply all right i may be out till late he left the key and went out into the street he hailed a passing car in tremont street and rode for some distance in court street he got on board a charlestown car and in half an hour found himself in the city everywhere known by the granite shaft that commemorates the battle of bunker hill he made his way to a hotel where he took a room entering here under the name of james simmons portsmouth new hampshire anxious to examine his prize he desired to be shown at once to a chamber he followed the servant who conducted him with impatient steps the stolen money was burning in his pocket he wanted to know how much he had and was more than half resolved to take an early train the next morning for the west where he thought he should be secure from discovery is there anything wanted sir asked the servant lingering at the door no no said fairfax impatiently its all right might be a little more polite muttered the snubbed servant as he went downstairs now for it exclaimed fairfax exultingly now let me see how much i have got he drew the pocketbook from his pocket and opened it his heart gave a quick thump and he turned ashy pale as his glance rested upon the worthless roll of brown paper with which it had been stuffed curse the boy he cried in fierce and bitter disappointment he has fooled me after all why didnt i stop long enough to open the pocketbook before i came away blind stupid fool that i was i am as badly off as before nay worse for i have exposed myself to suspicion and havent got a penny to show for it i will not dwell upon his bitter selfreproaches and above all the intense mortification he felt at having been so completely fooled by a boy whom he had despised as verdant and inexperienced in the ways of the world to think that success had been in his grasp and he had missed it after all was certainly disagreeable enough it occurred to him that he might go back to the adams house even now and repair his blunder it was not likely that andy was awake yet he was very weary and boys of his age were likely unless disturbed to sleep through the night he might retrieve his error and no one would be the wiser ill do it he said at length he went downstairs and left the hotel without the knowledge of the clerk jumping into the horsecars he returned to boston and entered the adams house about halfpast twelve oclock he claimed his key at the desk and went upstairs to his room he had scarcely lit the gas however when a knock was heard at the door opening it unsuspiciously he turned pale as he recognized the clerk in company with an officer of the law whats wanted he faltered you are wanted was the brief reply what for he gasped you are charged with entering the adjoining room and stealing a pocketbook from the boy who sleeps there its a lie he said but his tone was nervous you must submit to a search said the officer do you mean to insult me demanded fairfax assuming an air of outraged virtue not at all i am only giving you a chance to clear yourself from suspicion i am a respectable merchant from portland i was never so insulted in my life said fairfax if the charge proves groundless i will make you an ample apology said the officer fairfax was compelled to submit to the search he cursed his stupidity in not throwing away the worthless pocketbook but this he had neglected to do and of course it was very significant evidence against him not only was this found but the variety of keys already referred to you carry a great many keys said the officer it isnt a crime to carry keys is it demanded fairfax sullenly not if no improper use is made of them i suspect that one of them will open the door into the next chamber the keys were tried and one did open the door as the light flashed into the room andy got up come here young man said the officer can you identify that pocketbook i can said andy is it yours when i went to bed it was in the pocket of my coat lying on that chair it is certainly a wonderful pocketbook i have just found it in that gentlemans pocket fairfaxs eyes were bent malignantly upon andy a light flashed upon him now he recognized him i know you he said you are the man that stopped colonel preston and tried to rob him you lie curse you exclaimed fairfax springing forward and trying to throw himself upon andy but he was not quick enough the officer had interposed and seized him by the collar not so fast mr marvin or whatever your name is we dont allow any such games as that sit down till i want you the baffled adventurer was jerked into a chair from which he continued to eye andy savagely whats that affair you were talking about young man asked the officer andy briefly related his adventure with fairfax on a former occasion ill trouble you to come with me mr marvin or fairfax said the officer theres another hotel where lodgings are provided for such as you resistance was useless and the detected thief though his name was registered at two hotels was compelled to occupy a less agreeable room at the stationhouse how he was detected will be explained in the next chapter chapter xxix a startling event sometimes the mere presence of a person in the room is sufficient to interrupt even sound repose at all events whether it was the entrance of fairfax acting in some mysterious way upon andy or the light that streamed into the room his slumber was disturbed and his eyes opened just as the adventurer was retiring with his supposed booty our hero did not immediately take in the situation he was naturally a little bewildered being just aroused from sleep but in a short time the real state of the case dawned upon him by the powers he said to himself its that man that went to the museum with me he saw my money and he came in for it ill get up and see quietly and noiselessly he got out of bed and going to the chair felt in his pockets and so discovered the loss of the stuffed pocketbook andy wanted to laugh but forbore lest the sound should be heard in the next room its a good joke on the dirty thafe said andy to himself hes welcome to all the money hes got it wont carry him far im thinkin prudence suggested another thought when fairfax found out the worthlessness of his booty would he not come back and search for the real treasure if he does ill fight him thought andy still he knew the conflict would be unequal since the other was considerably his superior in strength however andy determined that come what might he would defend his trust or perish in the attempt but while he was coming to this determination he heard the door of the adjoining chamber open softly and then he could hear steps along the corridor evidently the thief had not found out the actual character of his booty but was going off under the impression that it was valuable maybe hell come back thought andy i guess id better go down and give notice at the desk then if he comes back hell get into hot water he hastily dressed himself and locking his door went downstairs first however he removed the money from under his pillow and put it into his pocket he found the clerk at the desk has the man that came in with me gone out asked andy mr marvin yes he went out about five minutes ago did he say anything about coming back he said it would be late when he returned he asked me if we kept open after twelve did you want to find him i should like to have the police find him said andy how is that asked the clerk surprised he has robbed me did you leave your door unlocked no but there was a door between our rooms he opened it and stole a pocketbook from the pocket of my coat while you were asleep yes but i awoke just in time to see him go through the door how much money was there in it thats the joke of it said andy laughing there was no money at all only some folds of paper he got hold of the wrong pocketbook thereupon he told the story of the drop game of which he came near being a victim and what a useful turn the bogus treasure had done him theres the right pocketbook he said in conclusion i wish you would take care of it for me till tomorrow the money isnt mine and i dont want to run any more risk with it ill lock it up in the safe for you said the clerk is there much several hundred dollars you were very fortunate in escaping as you did said the clerk true for you said andy he may come back when he finds out how he has been fooled if he does ill call a policeman well make short work with him the reader has already heard how fairfax or marvin did return and how he met with a reception he had not calculated upon andy was informed in the morning that it would be necessary for him to appear as a witness against him in order to secure his conviction this he did the next day but the judge delayed sentence on being informed that the accused was charged with a more serious offense that of stopping a traveler on the highway his trial on this count must come before a higher court and he was remanded to prison till his case was called in the calendar andy was informed that he would be summoned as a witness in that case also as well as colonel preston and answered that he would be ready when called upon we will so far anticipate events as to say that the testimony of andy and the colonel was considered conclusive by the court and on the strength of it mr fairfax alias marvin was sentenced to several years imprisonment at hard labor andy met with no further adventures in his present visit but had the satisfaction of delivering the money he had been sent to collect to miss priscilla grant now advancing our story some three months we come to an afternoon when miss sophia grant returning from a walk with visible marks of excitement rushed breathless and panting into her sisters presence whats the matter sophia asked priscilla such an awful thing she gasped what is it you wont believe it tell me at once what it is it seems so sudden good heavens sophia why do you tantalize me so just so gasped sophia if you dont tell me ill shake you colonel prestons dead dropped dead in the store ten minutes ago i was there and saw him this startling intelligence was only too true suddenly without an instants warning the colonel had been summoned from life succumbing to a fit of apoplexy this event of course made a great sensation in the village but it is of most interest to us as it affects the fortunes of our young hero chapter xxx colonel prestons will mrs preston was a cold woman and was far from being a devoted wife she was too selfish for that supreme love which some women bestow upon their husbands still when colonel prestons lifeless form was brought into the house she did experience a violent shock to have the companion of nearly twenty years so unexpectedly taken away might well touch the most callous and so for a few minutes mrs preston forgot herself and thought of her husband but this was not for long the thought of her own selfish interests came back and in the midst of her apparent grief the question forced itself upon her consideration did my husband make a will of course she did not give utterance to this query she knew what was expected of her and she was prudent enough to keep up appearances before the neighbors who poured into the house to offer their sympathy she received them with her cambric handkerchief pressed to her eyes from which by dint of effort she succeeded in squeezing a few formal tears and while her bosom appeared to heave with emotion she was mentally calculating how much colonel preston had probably left shant i stay with you my dear mrs preston said worthy mrs cameron in a tone full of warm interest and sympathy thank you said mrs preston in a low voice you are very kind but i would rather be left alone but it must be so sad for you to be alone in your sorrow said her neighbor no i can bear sorrow better alone said the newly made widow perhaps i am peculiar but i would prefer it if you really wish it said the other reluctantly yes i wish it thank you for your kind offer but i know my own feelings and the presence of others would only increase my pain this was what she said to others who made the same offer it did not excite great surprise for mrs preston had never leaned upon anyone for sympathy nor was she ready with her sympathy when others were in trouble she was selfpoised and selfcontained and in fact for this reason was not popular with her neighbors still in this her distress they were ready to forget all this and extend the same cordial sympathy which they would have done in other cases there was but one person whose company she did crave at this time and this was her son godfrey so when alfred turner offered to go for him the next morning she accepted his offer with thanks at last she was left alone the servant had gone to bed and there was no one but herself and her dead husband in the lower part of the house she no longer sat with her handkerchief pressed before her eyes her face wore its usual look of calm composure she was busily thinking not of her husbands fate but of her own future did he leave a will and if so how much did he leave me she thought if there was a will it was probably in the house and mrs preston determined to find it if possible of course all ought to come to me and godfrey she soliloquized i dont think it is right to leave money to charitable institutions as long as a wife and child are living fortunately my husband had no brothers or sisters or perhaps he would have divided the property if there is no will i shall have my thirds and shall have the control of godfreys property till he comes of age i think i will go to boston to live my friend mrs boynton has a very pleasant house on worcester street i should like to settle down somewhere near her i dont know how much mr preston was worth but i am sure we shall have enough for that i always wanted to live in the city this village is intolerably stupid and so are the people i shall be glad to get away could the good women whose kind hearts had prompted them to proffer their sympathy have heard these words they would not have been likely to obtrude any more on the hard cold woman who held them in such low estimation mrs preston took the lamp in her hand and began to explore her husbands desk she had often thought of doing so but as his death was not supposed to be so near she had not thought that there was any immediate cause of doing so besides it had almost been her belief that he had made no will now she began to open drawers and untie parcels of papers but it was some time before she came to what she sought at length however her diligence was rewarded in the middle of a pile of papers she found one labeled on the outside my will her heart beat as she opened it and though there was no need for it was now past ten oclock and there was not likely to be a caller at that late hour she looked cautiously about her and even peered out of the window into the darkness but could find no one whose observation she might fear i am not about to recite at length the items in the will which covered a page of foolscap it is enough to quote two items which mrs preston read with anger and dissatisfaction they are as follows item to my young friend andy burke son of the widow burke of this village in consideration of a valuable service rendered to me on one occasion and as a mark of my regard and interest i give and bequeath the sum of five thousand dollars and to his mother as a token of gratitude for her faithful nursing when i was dangerously sick with the smallpox i give and bequeath free of all incumbrance the cottage in which she at present resides item to the town i give five thousand dollars the interest to be annually appropriated to the purchase of books for a public library for the benefit of all the citizens provided the town will provide some suitable place in which to keep them all the balance of the property was left to his wife and son in equal proportions his wife to be the guardian of godfrey till he should have attained his majority as colonel preston was well known to be rich this seemed to be an adequate provision but mrs preston did not look upon it in that light on the contrary she was deeply incensed at the two legacies of which mention has been made above was ever anything more absurd than to waste five thousand dollars and a house upon that irish boy and his mother she said to herself i dont suppose it was so much my husbands fault that artful woman got around him and wheedled him into it i know now why she was so willing to come here and take care of him when he was sick she wanted to wheedle him into leaving money to her lowlived boy she is an artful and designing hussy and i should like to tell her so to her face the cold and usually impassible woman was deeply excited her selfish nature made her grudge any of her husbands estate to others except indeed to godfrey who was the only person she cared for as she thought over the unjust disposition as she regarded it which her husband had made of his property a red spot glowed in her usually pale cheek then it was another grievance that money should have been left to the town what claim had the town on my husband she thought that he should give it five thousand dollars in doing it he was robbing godfrey and me it was wrong he had no right to do it what do i care for these people they are a set of common farmers and mechanics with whom i condescend to associate because i have no one else here except the ministers and the doctors family to speak to soon i shall be in the city and then i dont care if i never set eyes on any of them again in boston i can find suitable society the more mrs preston thought of it the more she felt aggravated by the thought that so large a share of her husbands property was to go to others she fixed her eyes thoughtfully on the document which she held in her hand and a strong temptation came to her if this should disappear she said to herself the money would be all mine and godfreys and no one would be the wiser that irish boy and his mother would stay where they belonged and my godfrey would have his own why should i not burn it it would only be just deluding herself by this false view she persuaded herself that it was right to suppress the will with steady hand she held it to the flame of the lamp and watched it as it was slowly consumed then gathering up the fragments she threw them away it is all ours now she whispered triumphantly as she prepared to go to bed it was lucky i found the will chapter xxxi mrs prestons intentions godfrey returned home on the day after his fathers death he had never witnessed death before and it frightened him for the time into propriety he exhibited none of the stormy and impetuous grief which a warmhearted and affectionate boy would have been likely to exhibit it was not in his nature when he and his mother were left alone he showed his resemblance to her by asking do you know how much property father left i dont know he never told me about his affairs as he ought i think he must have left near a hundred thousand dollars godfreys eyes sparkled thats a pile of money he said it goes to me dont it to us said mrs preston a woman doesnt need so much money as a man said godfrey selfishly you are not a man yet said his mother dryly your father may have left a will in that case he may have left a part of his property to others do you think he has inquired godfrey in alarm i dont think any will will be found said his mother quietly he never spoke to me of making one of course not that wouldnt be fair would it it is fitting that the property should all go to us when shall i get mine when you are twentyone thats a long time to wait said godfrey grumblingly you are only a boy yet i shall probably be your guardian i hope youll give me a larger allowance than father did i will must i go back to boarding school i dont want to if i go to boston to live as i think i shall i will take you with me and you can go to school there thatll be jolly said godfrey his eyes sparkling with anticipation ive got tired of this miserable town so have i said his mother we shall have more privileges in boston i can go to the theater as often as i please there cant i we will see about that how soon shall we move to the city as soon as business will allow i must settle up your fathers affairs here cant i go beforehand would you leave me alone asked his mother with a little touch of wounded affection for she did feel attached to her son he was the only one indeed for whom she felt any affection you wont miss me mother itll be awfully stupid here and you know youll be coming to the city as soon as you get through with the business mrs preston was disappointed but she should not have been surprised her only son reflected her own selfishness it would not look well for you to go to the theater just at the present she said why not so soon after your fathers death godfrey said nothing but looked discontented it was early to think of amusement while his father lay yet unburied in the next room he left the room whistling he could not gainsay his mothers objections but he thought it hard luck a funeral in a country village is a public occasion friends and neighbors are expected to be present without invitation among those who assembled at the house were mrs burke and andy they felt truly sorry for the death of colonel preston who had been a friend to both mrs preston saw them enter and notwithstanding the solemnity of the occasion the thought intruded theyre after the legacy but they will be disappointed ive taken good care of that godfrey saw them also and his thought was a characteristic one what business has that irish boy at my fathers funeral he ought to know better than to poke himself in where he is not wanted even godfrey however had the decency to let this thought remain unspoken the services proceeded and among those who followed on foot in the funeral procession were andy and his mother it never occurred to them that they were intruding they wanted to show respect for the memory of one who had been a friend to them on the day after the funeral squire tisdale called at the house invited by mrs preston the squire had a smattering of law and often acted as executor in settling estates i invited you to come here squire tisdale said mrs preston to speak about my affairs of course it is very trying to me to think of business so soon after the death of my dear husband here she pressed her handkerchief to her tearless eyes but i feel it to be my duty to myself and my boy of course said the squire soothingly we cant give way to our feelings however much we want to that is my feeling said mrs preston whose manner was wonderfully cool and collected considering the grief which she desired to have it thought she experienced for her husband did colonel preston leave a will asked the squire i dont think he did he never mentioned making one to me did you ever hear of his making any i cant say that i ever did i suppose it will be best to search wont it be more proper for you to make the search squire tisdale said the widow i am an interested party suppose we search together you can tell me where your husband kept his private papers certainly he kept them in his desk i locked it as soon as he died but here is the key if there is a will it is probably there very probably we shall soon ascertain then squire tisdale took the key and mrs preston led the way to her late husbands desk a momentary fear seized her what if there was an earlier will or two copies of the last she thought i ought to have made sure by looking over the other papers but it was too late now besides it seemed very improbable that there should be another will had there been an earlier one it would doubtless have been destroyed on the drafting of the one she had found she reassured herself therefore and awaited with tranquillity the result of the search the search was careful and thorough mrs preston desired that it should be so knowing the wrong she had done to andy and his mother as well as the town she was unnecessarily anxious to appear perfectly fair and assured squire tisdale that had there been a will its provisions should have been carried out to the letter there is no will here said the squire after a careful search i did not expect you would find one said the widow but it was necessary to make sure is there any other place where your husband kept papers we will look in the drawers and trunks said mrs preston but i dont think any will be found none was found can i do anything more for you mrs preston asked the squire i should like your advice squire tisdale i am not used to business and i would like the aid of your experience willingly said the squire who felt flattered as my husband left no will i suppose the estate goes to my son and myself undoubtedly how ought i to proceed you should apply for letters of administration which will enable you to settle up the property will you help me to take the necessary steps certainly i should like to settle the estate as rapidly as possible as i intend to remove to boston indeed we shall be sorry to lose you can you not content yourself here everything will remind me of my poor husband said mrs preston with another application of the handkerchief to her still tearless eyes squire tisdale was impressed with the idea that she had more feeling than he had thought i didnt think of that he said sympathetically no doubt you are right mrs preston lost no time in applying for letters of administration as soon as i get them she said to herself i will lose no time in ejecting that irishwoman from the house my husband bought for her ill make her pay rent too for the time she has been in it chapter xxxii mrs prestons revenge andy burke was passing the house of mrs preston within a month after colonel prestons death when godfrey who had not gone back to boarding school showed himself at the front door come here said godfrey in an imperious tone andy turned his head and paused who are you talking to he asked to you to be sure whats wanted my mother wants to see you all right ill come in you can go around to the back door said godfrey who seemed to find pleasure in making himself disagreeable i know i can but i dont mean to said andy walking up to the front entrance where godfrey was standing the back door is good enough for you said the other offensively i shouldnt mind going to it if you hadnt asked me said andy just move away will you godfrey did not stir very well said andy turning tell your mother you would not let me in come in if you want to said godfrey at length moving aside i dont care much about it i only came to oblige your mother maybe you wont like what she has to say said godfrey with a disagreeable smile ill soon know said andy he entered the house and godfrey called upstairs mother the burke boy is here ill be down directly was the answer he can sit down andy sat down on a chair in the hall not receiving an invitation to enter the sittingroom and waited for mrs preston to appear he wondered a little what she wanted with him but thought it likely that she had some errand or service in which she wished to employ him he did not know the extent of her dislike for him and his mother after a while mrs preston came downstairs she was dressed in black but showed no other mark of sorrow for the loss of her husband indeed she was looking in better health than usual you can come into the sittingroom she said coldly andy followed her and so did godfrey who felt a malicious pleasure in hearing what he knew beforehand his mother intended to say i believe your name is andrew she commenced yes maam your mother occupies a house belonging to my late husband yes maam answered andy who now began to guess at the object of the interview i find by examining my husbands papers that she has paid no rent for the last six months thats true said andy she offered to pay it but colonel preston told her he didnt want no rent from her he said she could have it for nothing thats a likely story said godfrey with a sneer its a true story said andy in a firm voice steadily eying his young antagonist this may be true or it may not be true said mrs preston coldly if true i suppose my husband gave your mother a paper of some kind agreeing to let her have the house rentfree she hasnt got any paper said andy i thought not said godfrey sneering you forgot to write her one be quiet godfrey said his mother i prefer to manage this matter myself then your mother has no paper to show in proof of what you assert no maam the colonel didnt think it was necessary he just told my mother when she first came with the rent that she neednt trouble herself to come again on that errand he said that she had nursed him when he was sick with the smallpox and hed never forget it and that hed bought the house expressly for her i am aware that your mother nursed my husband in his sickness said mrs preston coldly i also know that my husband paid her very handsomely for her services thats true maam said andy he was a fine generous man the colonel was and ill always say it there really seems no reason why in addition to this compensation your mother should receive a present of her rent how much rent did she pay before my husband bought the house fifteen dollars a quarter then she has not paid rent for six months i find she owes my husbands estate thirty dollars colonel preston told her she wasnt to pay it how do i know that my mother says it and she wouldnt tell a lie said andy indignantly i have nothing to say as to that said mrs preston i am now managing the estate and the question rests with me i decide that your mother has been sufficiently paid for her services and i shall claim rent for the last six months andy was silent for a moment then he spoke it may be so mrs preston ill speak to the doctor and ill do as he says i dont know what the doctor has to do with the matter said mrs preston haughtily he wants to get an excuse for not paying said godfrey with a sneer mind your business said andy excusably provoked do you hear that mother said godfrey are you going to let that beggar insult me before your very face you have spoken very improperly to my son said mrs preston he spoke very improperly to me at first said andy sturdily you do not appear to understand the respect due to me said mrs preston with emphasis if ive treated you disrespectfully im sorry said andy but godfrey mustnt insult me and call me names we have had enough of this said mrs preston i have only to repeat that your mother is indebted to me for six months rent thirty dollars which i desire she will pay as soon as possible one thing more i must request her to find another home as i have other plans for the house she occupies youre not goin to turn her out of her house sure said andy in some dismay it is not her house said mrs preston though it occurred to her that it might have been if she had not suppressed the will but of course andy knew nothing of this nor did he suspect anything since neither he nor his mother had the faintest idea of being remembered in colonel prestons will kind though he had been to them both in his life i know it isnt said andy but shes got used to it i dont know any other place we can get that is your lookout said mrs preston i have no doubt you can get in somewhere as i said the house is mine and i have other views for it cant we stay till the end of the quarter maam no i wish to finish my business here as soon as possible and then shall go to boston how long can we stay then till the first of the month thats only three days it is long enough to find another place that is all i have to say and mrs preston turned to go andy rose and followed her without a word he saw that it would be of no use to appeal for more time her tone was so firm and determined that there evidently was no moving her what will we do thought andy as he walked slowly and silently along the road he felt the need of consulting somebody older and more experienced than himself just in the nick of time he met dr townley in whose friendship he felt confidence can you stop a minute dr townley he said i want to speak to you about something i can spare two minutes if you like andy said the doctor smiling andy explained the case it is quite true said the doctor colonel preston intended your mother to pay no rent he told me so himself but as your mother has no written proof i suppose you will have to pay it shall i lend you the money no need doctor weve got money enough for that but we must move out in three days where shall we go ill tell you i own the small house occupied by grant melton he sets out for the west tomorrow with his family ill let it to your mother for the same rent shes been paying thank you said andy gratefully its better than the house weve been living in its a good change perhaps you wont like me for a landlord so well as mrs preston said the doctor smiling ill risk it said andy two days afterward the transfer was made mrs preston was disappointed and godfrey still more so to find their malice had done the widow burke no harm by advice of the doctor andy deferred paying the thirty dollars claimed as rent availing himself of the twelve months allowed for the payment of debts due the estate of one deceased if it was anybody else id pay at once said andy but mrs preston has treated us so meanly that i dont mean to hurry the delay made mrs preston angry but she was advised that it was quite legal chapter xxxiii andy loses his place andy and his mother moved into dr townleys cottage it was rather an improvement upon the house in which they had lived hitherto but then there was this great difference for the one they had no rent to pay but for the other they paid fifty dollars rent dr townley would gladly have charged nothing but he was a comparatively poor man and could not afford to be as generous as his heart would have dictated he had a fair income being skillful and in good practice but he had a son in college and his expenses were a considerable drain upon his fathers purse still with the money saved and andys weekly earnings the burkes were able to live very comfortably and still pay the rent but a real misfortune was in store for andy miss sophia grant was taken sick with lung fever the sickness lasted for some weeks and left her considerably debilitated what do you think of sophia dr townley asked priscilla anxiously she remains weak and she has a bad cough i am feeling alarmed about her ill tell you what i think miss priscilla said the doctor though i am sorry to do it the fact is the air here is altogether too bracing for your sister she will have to go to some inland town where the east winds are not felt then i must go too said miss priscilla we have lived together from girlhood and we cannot be separated i supposed you would be unwilling to leave her so i am afraid we must make up our minds to lose you both do you think doctor that sophia will by and by be strong enough to return here i am afraid not the effects of lung fever are always felt for a long time she will improve no doubt but a return to this harsh air would i fear bring back her old trouble i asked because i wanted to know whether it would be best to keep this place after what you have told me i shall try to sell it i am truly sorry miss priscilla so am i dr townley i dont expect any place will seem so much like home as this have you any particular place that you think of going to yes i have a niece married in a small town near syracuse new york state they dont have east winds there ill get priscilla shes named after me to hunt up a cottage that we can live in and move right out there i suppose wed better go soon better go at once weak lungs must be humored then ill write to priscilla to get me a boarding house and well start next week there was one person whom this removal was likely to affect seriously and this was our young hero i hope andyll be able to get a place said priscilla after she had communicated the doctors orders to her sister just so priscilla hes a good boy i will give him a good recommendation just so does he know it no i will call him in and tell him so that he can be looking out for another position just so andy answered the call of miss priscilla he had been sawing wood and there was sawdust in his sleeves how long have you been with us andy asked his mistress over a year maam i wish i could keep you for a year to come cant you asked andy startled no andy whats the matter miss priscilla have i done anything wrong no andy we are both of us quite satisfied with you you havent lost any money maam have you ill work for less if you cant afford to pay as much as youve been paying thank you andy but it isnt that my sisters lungs are weak and dr townley has ordered her to move to a less exposed place we are going to move away from the town im sorry said andy and he was for other reasons than because he was about to lose a good place we shall miss you andy just so chimed in miss sophia with a cough you see how weak my sisters lungs are its on her account we are going shant you come back again maam no andy the doctor says it will never be safe for us to do so i hope you will get a good place i hope so maam but you neednt think of that we are prepared to give you a good recommendation we feel perfectly satisfied with you in every way just so said sophia thank you maam and you too miss sophia ive tried to do my duty faithfully by you and you have andy how soon do you go maam next week if we can get away the doctor says we cant get away too soon so you had better be looking around to see if you can get a place somewhere i will maam but ill stay with you till the last day youll need me to pack up for you yes we shall tomorrow ill write you the recommendation thank you maam andy did not sleep as much as usual that night his wages were the main support of his mother and sister and he could think of no other place in the village where he was likely to be employed he had a little money saved up but he didnt like the idea of spending it besides it would not last long i wish dr townley wanted a boy thought andy id rather work for the doctor than for anybody else in the village hes a nice man and he cares just as much for poor folks as he does for rich folks i am sure he likes me better than he does godfrey preston but dr townley already had a boy whom he did not like to turn off nor could he have afforded to pay andy as high wages as he had received from the misses grant there really seemed to be no vacant place in the village for our young hero to fill and of course this troubled him next week the misses grant got away from the village they gave andy as a present an oldfashioned silver watch about the size and shape of a turnip andy was glad to get it oldfashioned as it was and he thanked them warmly the day afterward he was walking slowly along the village street when he came upon godfrey preston strutting along with an air of importance he and his mother had removed to boston but they were visiting the town on a little business hello there said godfrey halting hello said andy youve lost your place havent you asked godfrey with a sneer yes how are you going to live by eating i expect answered andy shortly if you can get anything to eat you mean we got enough so far perhaps you wont have long you may have to go to the poorhouse when i do i shall find you there what do you mean demanded godfrey angrily i mean i shant go there till you do youre proud for a beggar im more of a gentleman than you are id thrash you only i wont demean myself by doing it thats lucky or you might get thrashed yourself youre only an irish boy im proud of that same you wont find me go back on my country godfrey walked away somehow he could never get the better of andy i hope ill see you begging in rags some day he thought to himself but boys like andy are not often reduced to such a point chapter xxxiv the will at last the next three months passed very unsatisfactorily for andy in a small country town like that in which he lived there was little opportunity for a boy however industrious to earn money the farmers generally had sons of their own or were already provided with assistants and there was no manufacturing establishment in the village to furnish employment to those who didnt like agriculture andy had some idea of learning the carpenter trade there being a carpenter who was willing to take an apprentice but unfortunately he was unwilling to pay any wages for the first year only boarding the apprentice and our hero felt for his mothers sake that it would not do to make such an engagement when the three months were over the stock of money which andy and his mother had saved up was almost gone in fact he had not enough left to pay the next quarters rent to dr townley things were in this unsatisfactory state when something happened that had a material effect upon andys fortunes and as my readers will be glad to know for their improvement to explain what it was i must go back to a period shortly before colonels prestons death one day he met the doctor in the street and stopped to speak to him dr townley he said i have a favor to ask of you i shall be very glad to serve you colonel preston said the doctor thereupon colonel preston drew from his inside pocket a sealed envelope of large size i want you to take charge of this for me he said certainly said the doctor in some surprise please read what i have written upon the envelope the doctor his attention called to the envelope read inscribed in large distinct characters not to be opened till six months after my death i see you want an explanation said the colonel here it is the paper contained in this envelope is an important one i wont tell you what it is when you come to open it it will explain itself but colonel you are likely to live as long as i in that case i cant follow your directions of course we cant tell the duration of our lives still i think you will outlive me if not i shall reclaim the paper meanwhile i shall be glad to have you take charge of it for me of course i will it is a slight favor to ask it may prove important by the way there is no need of telling anyone unless perchance your wife i dont want to force you to keep anything secret from her mrs townley i know may be depended upon i think she may well colonel preston set your mind at rest i will take care of the paper when colonel preston died not long afterward the doctor naturally thought of the paper and as no will was left it occurred to him that this might be a will but in that case he couldnt understand why he should have been enjoined to keep it six months before opening it on the whole he concluded that it was not a will seated at the supper table about this time mrs townley said suddenly henry how long is it since colonel preston died let me see said the doctor thoughtfully it is yes it is six months tomorrow then it is time for you to open that envelope he gave into your charge so it is my dear your feminine curiosity inspired that thought said the doctor smiling perhaps you are right i own i am a little inquisitive in the matter i am glad you mentioned it i have so much on my mind that i should have let the day pass and i should be sorry not to fulfill to the letter the promise i made to my friend have you any suspicion as to the nature of the document i thought it might be a will but if so i cant understand why a delay of six months should have been interposed colonel preston may have had his reasons possibly he did not fully trust his wifes attention to his requests it may be so i am afraid his married life was not altogether harmonious mrs preston always struck me as a very selfish woman no doubt of that she evidently regarded herself as superior to the rest of us in that respect godfrey is like her he is a selfconceited disagreeable young jackanapes i wouldnt give much for his chances of honorable distinction in life ill tell you of a boy who will in my opinion beat him in the race of life who is that andy burke andy is a good boy but i am afraid the family is doing poorly now so i fear the fact is there doesnt appear to be much opening for a lad like andy in this village i hear that mr graves the storekeeper who is getting old wants to get a boy or young man with a small capital to take an interest in his business and eventually succeed him that would be a good chance for andy if he had the small capital but he probably hasnt ten dollars in the world thats a pity if i were a capitalist i wouldnt mind starting him myself but as you my dear are my most precious property and are not readily convertible into cash i dont quite see my way to do anything to assist him i didnt think of you henry country doctors are not likely to get rich but i thought colonel preston who seemed to take an interest in the boy might do something for him if he had lived he might have done so probably he would but mrs preston and godfrey hate the burkes like poison for no good reason that i know of and there is no chance of help from that quarter i should think not the next day dr townley immediately after breakfast drew the envelope already referred to from among his private papers and breaking the seal opened it to his surprise and excitement he discovered that the inclosure was the last will and testament of his deceased friend accompanying it was the following note my dear friend dr townley this is the duplicate of a will executed recently and expresses my wellconsidered wishes as to the disposition of my property the original will may have been found and executed before you open this envelope in that case of course this will be of no value and you can destroy it but i am aware that valuable papers are liable to loss or injury and therefore i deem it prudent to place this duplicate in your possession that if the other be lost you may see it carried into execution i have named you my executor and am sure out of regard to me you will accept the trust and fulfill it to the best of your ability i have always felt the utmost confidence in your friendship and this will account for my troubling you on the present occasion your friend anthony preston from this letter dr townley turned to the perusal of the will the contents filled him with equal surprise and pleasure five thousand dollars to andy burke he repeated that is capital it will start the boy in life and with his good habits it will make him sure of a competence by and by with half of it he can buy an interest in graves store and the balance will if well invested give him a handsome addition to his income then theres the bequest for the town library a capital idea that it will do a great deal to make the town attractive and be a powerful agency for refining and educating the people just then mrs townley who knew what her husband was about came into the room well henry she said is the paper important i should say it was it is colonel prestons last will and testatment is it possible how does he leave his property he leaves five thousand dollars for a town library does he remember andy burke he leaves him five thousand dollars and gives his mother the house they used to live in thats splendid but what will mrs preston say well that remains to be seen said the doctor laughing chapter xxxv mrs preston is unpleasantly surprised dr townley thought it best to consult with the town authorities as to the course to be pursued since as it appeared the town was interested in the will it was decided that the doctor and mr graves who was the chairman of the selectmen should go to boston the next day and inform mrs preston of the discovery of the will until after this interview it was deemed best not to mention the matter to andy or his mother mrs preston was established in a showy house at the south end at last she was living as she desired to do she went to the theater and the opera and was thinking whether she could afford to set up a carriage godfrey she had placed at a private school and was anxious to have him prepare for admission to harvard college but in this hope she seemed destined to be disappointed godfrey wanted to see life and enjoy himself and had no intention of submitting to the drudgery of hard study godfrey said his mother one morning i have received a letter from your teacher complaining that you dont work im not going to work myself to death answered godfrey i dont expect you to hurt yourself with work but i want you to go to college oh well ill get in somehow dont you want to stand well as a scholar she asked i leave that to the poor fellows that have got to work for a living i am rich you may lose your money i dont mean to suppose you do then i will go to work i should like to have you graduate well at college and then study law you might get into congress said his mother i guess ill know enough for that said godfrey carelessly i want to have a good time that was not the worst of it however he extorted from his mother a large allowance which he spent at bars and billiard saloons and one day was brought home drunk by a schoolfellow oh godfrey how can you do so exclaimed the selfish woman for once fairly alarmed on anothers account hush up old woman hiccoughed godfrey mrs preston was mortified to think this should be said to her before godfreys schoolmate he does not know what he is saying she said apologetically yes i do persisted godfrey im a a genlemans son i dont want you to interfere with genlemans son he was put to bed and awoke the next morning with a splitting headache it was the morning of the day which the doctor and mr graves had chosen to call on mrs preston she was preparing to go out when a servant came upstairs to announce that two gentlemen were in the parlor and wanted to see her two gentlemen what do they look like nancy one of em looks like he was from the country mum this referred to mr graves who did have a rustic look the doctor would readily have passed for a bostonian did they give their names no mum i will go down directly i suppose they wont stay long mrs preston sailed into the parlor with the air of a city lady as she proudly imagined but stopped short in some surprise when she recognized her visitors of course she did not suspect the nature of their business dr townley arose as she entered goodmorning mrs preston he said i hope i find you well i am quite well said mrs preston coldly for she had never liked the doctor she had an unpleasant feeling that he understood her and was not among her admirers goodmorning mr graves you come to the city occasionally i dont often get time to come up but the doctor thought i ought to come indeed i am sorry to say that i am just going out i must ask you to defer going till we have communicated our business said the doctor business repeated mrs preston seating herself in some surprise yes business of importance in short your husbands will has come to light my husbands will exclaimed mrs preston i thought she checked herself suddenly she was about to say i thought i had destroyed it and that would have let the cat out of the bag with a vengeance you thought that he left no will said the doctor finishing the sentence for her he really left two two thats it he executed two exactly alike one he left in my hands that is a likely story said mrs preston excitedly if that is the case why i ask have we heard nothing of this before because it was contained in an envelope which i was requested not to open for six months after his decease the time having expired may i ask what are the provisions of this pretended will demanded mrs preston in visible excitement mrs preston said the doctor with dignity you appear to forget that you are addressing a gentleman i am above fabricating a will as you seem to insinuate as to the provisions it leaves five thousand dollars to the town for the establishment of a public library and five thousand dollars to andy burke besides the small house in which she used to live to the widow burke the worst had come in spite of her criminal act she must lose the ten thousand dollars and worst of all those whom she hated and despised were to profit by her loss this is simply outrageous dr townley she said you are speaking of your husbands will mrs preston i dont believe he made it there can be no doubt of it mr graves has examined it and he and myself are so familiar with the handwriting of your husband that we have no hesitation in pronouncing the will genuine colonel preston must have been insane if he really made such a will i was his medical adviser said dr townley quietly and i never detected the least sign of an unsound mind the fact of robbing his wife and child to enrich an irishwoman and her son is proof enough of his insanity pardon me madam but such bequests are made every day outside of their legacies your husband left ample fortune and there is no danger of your being impoverished did you bring the will with you no i did not feel like incurring the risk i shall contest the will said mrs preston passionately i would not advise you to the proof of its genuineness is overwhelming i suppose you never saw the other will mrs preston at this unexpected question in spite of her strong nerves turned pale and faltered of course not she said after a slight pause your husband asserts positively in a note to me that he made one said the doctor bending his eyes searchingly upon her for he suspected the truth and that it was distrust of his wife that led colonel preston to take the precaution he had done its disappearance is mysterious what do you mean cried mrs preston sharply and not altogether without alarm i meant only to express my surprise if your business is over i will go out i have only this to say that being named in the will as executor i shall take immediate measures to have the will admitted to probate should you make up your mind to contest it you can give me due notice through your legal adviser in that case he added significantly the question of the disappearance of the other will will come up i will consult my lawyer said mrs preston though she said this her determination was already made conscience makes cowards of us all and the doctors last hint alarmed her so much that she decided to make no opposition to the setting up of the will but it was a bitter pill to swallow graves said dr townley as he left the house that woman destroyed the other will do you think so asked mr graves startled i feel sure of it let me predict also that she will not contest this will she is afraid to and the doctor was right chapter xxxvi alls well that ends well andy was quite unconscious of the good fortune which had come to him though a manly and stouthearted boy he was in fact getting discouraged he was willing and anxious to work but there seemed to be no work for him to do he would have left home some time since to try his fortune elsewhere but for the entreaties of his mother who didnt like to lose him in the morning after dr townleys visit to boston our hero knocked at the doctors front door is dr townley at home he asked yes andy said the doctor who overheard the inquiry come right in youre just the boy i want to see andy entered twirling his hat awkwardly in his hand goodmorning andy said the doctor cordially take a seat thank you sir said andy but did not sit down what is the matter you are looking rather blue this morning faith doctor and thats the way i feel entirely youre not sick are you let me feel your pulse no im not sick but its discouraged i am why should a stout boy in good health be discouraged i cant get any work to do and im afraid well all starve it strikes me said the doctor fixing his eyes on andy enjoying the effect of his intended announcement that i wouldnt talk of starving if i were as rich as you are andy as rich as me echoed andy shure doctor youre jokin not at all why i havent got but seventyfive cents in the world now its you that are joking andy i wish i was sighed andy why i had it on good authority that you were worth five thousand dollars andy stared in earnest i see youre laughin at me doctor he said suspecting that dr townley was making game of him no i am not i am in earnest who told you such a big falsehood as that now asked our hero bewildered perhaps i dreamed that somebody told me colonel preston had left you five thousand dollars in his will are you jokin is it true asked andy eagerly something in the doctors face telling him that he really meant what he said maybe i dreamed too that the colonel left your mother the house she used to live in is it true doctor tell me quick said andy trembling with excitement yes my boy its all true and im glad to be the first to congratulate you on your good fortune he held out his hand which our hero seized and then unable to repress his exultation threw up his cap to the ceiling and indulged in an extempore dance the doctor meanwhile looking on with benevolent gratification excuse me doctor i couldnt help it he panted its all right andy are you discouraged now divil a bit doctor its wild i am with joy and you dont think of starving yet eh andy ill wait a bit but why didnt i know before sit down and ill tell you all about it so andy heard the account which need not be repeated now continued the doctor ill tell you what plan i have for you mr graves wants to take a boy into his store who will buy an interest in the business and become his partner he thinks well of you and is willing to take you what do you say ill do whatever you think best doctor then i think this is a good opening for you mr graves wants to retire from business before long probably by the time you are twentyone he will leave everything in your hands you will be paid weekly wages and perhaps be entitled to a portion of the profits more than enough to support you all comfortably what do you say shall we have a new firm in the village graves burke andys eyes sparkled with proud anticipation it was so far above any dream he had ever formed its what id like above all things he said oh what will mother say i must go and tell her go by all means andy and when you have told her come back and ill go over with you to mr graves store and well talk over the arrangements with him mrs burkes delight at her own success and that of andy may be imagined she too had been getting despondent and it seemed almost like a fairy tale to find herself the owner of a house and her boy likely to be taken into partnership with the principal trader in the village she invoked blessings on the memory of colonel preston through whose largehearted generosity this had come to pass but could not help speculating on what mrs preston would say she understood very well that she would be very angry mrs preston did not dispute the will she might have done so but for her fear that her own criminal act would be brought to light godfrey who was even more disturbed than she was at the success of that low irish boy begged her to do it but in this case she did not yield to his entreaties she had never dared to take him into confidence respecting her destruction of the other will while we are upon this subject we may as well trace out the future career of mrs preston some years later she was induced by the expectation of aiding her social standing to marry an adventurer who appeared to be doing a flourishing business as a state street broker by spurious representations he managed to get hold of her property and to be appointed godfreys guardian the result may be foreseen he managed to spend or waste the whole and when godfrey was twentyone he and his mother were penniless andy who was now sole representative of the firm of graves burke and in receipt of an excellent income heard of the misfortunes of his old enemy and out of regard to the memory of his old benefactor voluntarily offered mrs preston an allowance of five hundred dollars it cost her pride a great deal to accept this favor from the boy she had looked down upon as only an irish boy but her necessity was greater than her pride and she saw no other way of escaping the poorhouse so she ungraciously accepted but andy did not care for thanks he felt that he was doing his duty and he asked no other reward than that consciousness mrs preston was allowed to make her home rent free in mrs burkes old house andy having built a better and more commodious one in which he had installed his mother as mistress mrs preston grew old fast in appearance and fretted without ceasing for the fortune and position which she had lost her husband left her and has not since been heard of as for godfrey andy secured him a passage to california where he led a disreputable life there is a rumor that he was killed in a drunken brawl at sacramento not long since but i have not been able to learn whether this is true or not his loss of fortune had something to do with his going to the bad but i am afraid with his character and tendencies that neither in prosperity nor in adversity would he have built up a good character or led an honorable career his course had been in all respects far different from that of our hero who already prosperous seems likely to go on adding to his wealth and growing in the esteem of the best portion of the community his success aided indeed by good fortune has served to demonstrate the favorable effects of honesty industry and good principles upon individual success he is not the first nor will he be the last to achieve prosperity and the respect of the community though beginning life as only an irish boy the end transcribers comments spelling has been left as in the original book specifically the
