 thursday by the time the grubby blue and grey metropolitana train emerged above ground at the piramide stop it was getting dark zen walked up the broad dim steps beneath a fascist mural depicting the army the family and the workers and out into the street the citys starlings were in the grip of the madness that seizes them at the changing of the light turning the trees into loudspeakers broadcasting their gibberish then swarming up out of the foliage to circle about in the dusky air like scraps of windborne rubbish in the piazza below gleaming tramlines crisscrossed in intricate patterns leading off in every direction only to finish abruptly a few metres further on under a coat of tarmac or running head long into a traffic divider instead of making a detour to the traffic lights on via ostiense zen walked straight out into the vehicles con vero ng on the piazza from every direction maybe that was where the starlings got the idea he thought maybe their frenzied swarming was just an attempt to imitate the behaviour patterns of the dominant lifeform but tonight the traffic didnt bother him he was as invulnerable to accidents as a prisoner under sentence of death respec ting his doomed selfassurance the traffic flowed around him casting him ashore on the far side of the piazza at the foot of the marble pyramid the most direct route to where he was going lay through porta san paolo and along via marmorata but now that he was nearly there zens fears about being followed revived so instead of the busy main road he took the smaller and quieter street flanked by the city walls on one side and dull apartment blocks on the other apart from a few pros titutes setting up their pitches in the strip of grass and shrubs between the street and the wall there was no one about he turned right through the arches opened in the wall then left circling the bulky mound which gave its name to the testaccio district at the base of the hill stood a line of squat formless jerrybuilt huts guarded by sav age dogs here metal was worked and spraypainted engines mended bodywork repaired serial numbers altered during zens time at the questura this had been one of the most important areas in the city for recycling stolen vehicles the other main business of the district had been killin but that had ceased with the closure of the slaughterhouse complex that lay between the testaccio hill and the river any killing that went on now was related to the parttime activities of some of the inhabitants of which the trade in secondhand cars was only the most notable example as for the abattoir it was now a mecca for aspirant yuppies like vincenzo fabri who thronged to the former killing floors in their mercedes and b m ws to acquire the art of sitting on a horse opposite a few exclusive nightclubs had sprung up to attract those of the citys gilded youth who liked to go slumming in safety skirting the oxbloodred walls of the slaughterhouse zen walked on into the grid of streets beyond although no more lovely than the suburb where tania and her husband lived testaccio was quite different it had a his tory for one thing two thousand years of it dating back to the time when the area was the port of rome and the hill in its midst had gradually been built up from fragments of amphorae broken in transit or handling the foursquare turnofthecentury tenements which now lined the streets were merely the latest expression of its essentially gritty nononsense character the merest change in the eco nomic climate would be enough to sweep away the outer suburbs as though they had never existed but the testac cio quarter would be there for ever lodged in romes throat like a bone night had fallen the street was sparsely lit by lamps suspended on cables strung across from one apartment block to another rows of jalousies painted a dull institu tional green punctuated the expanses of bare walling in an area where cars were a medium of exchange rather than a symbol of disposable income it was still possible to park in an orderly fashion at an angle to the kerb leaving the pavements free for pedestrians zen walked steadily along neither hurrying nor loitering showing no par ticular interest in his surroundings this was enemy terri tory and he had particular reasons for not wanting to draw attention to himself after crossing two streets run ning at right angles he caught sight of his destination a block of shops and businesses comprising a butchers a barbers a grocery and a paint wholesalers between the barbers and the butchers lay the rally bar it was years since zen had set foot there but as soon as he walked in he saw that nothing had changed the walls and the high ceiling were painted in the same terminal shade of brown and decorated with large photographs of motor racing scenes and the juventus football team and posters illustrating the various icecreams available from the freezer at the end of the bar two bare neon strips suspended by chains from the ceiling dispensed a frigid even glare reflected back by the indestructible slabs of highly polished aggregate on the floor above the bar hung a tearoff calendar distributed by an automobile spareparts com pany featuring a colour photograph of a peacock along with framed permits from the city council a price list a notice declaring the establishments legal closing day as wednesday advertisements for various brands of amaro and beer and a drawing of a tramp inscribed he always gave discounts and credit to everyone the three men talking in low voices at the bar fell silent as zen entered he walked up to them pushing against their silent stares as though into a strong wind a glass of beer the barman gaunt and lanternjawed plucked a bottle of beer from the fridge levered the cap off the bottle and dumped half the beer into a glass still dripping from the drainingboard the glass was thick and scored with scratches at the bottom a few centimetres of beer lay inaccessible beneath a layer of bubbles as thick and white as shavingfoam the barman picked up a copy of the gazzetta dello sport the other customers gazed up over their empty coffee cups at the bottles of halfdrunk spirits and cordials stacked on the glass shelving above the bar in pride of place stood a clock whose dial consisted of a china plate painted with a list showing the amount of time the pro prietor was allegedly prepared to spend on tax collectors rich aged relatives doortodoor salesmen sexy house wives and the like plainclothes policemen on unofficial business were not mentioned zen carefully poured the rest of the beer into the glass dousing the bubbles he drank half of it and then lit a cigarette fausto been in tonight the second hand described an almost complete revolu tion of the china plate before the barman swivelled smoothly to face zen as though his feet were on castors what zen looked him in the eye he said nothing eventually the barman turned away again and picked up his news paper the second hand on the clock moved from mothersinlaw through the blonde next door and back to its starting place this beer tastes like piss zen said the pink newspaper slowly descended and what do you expect me to do about it the barman demanded menacingly give me another one the barman rocked backwards and forwards on his feet for a moment then he snapped open the heavy wooden door of the fridge fished out another bottle decapitated it and banged it down on the zinc counter zen took the bottle and his glass and sat down at one of the three small round metal tables covered in blue and red plastic wickerwork as if they had been waiting for this the other two customers suddenly came to life one of them fed some coins into the videogame machine which responded with a deafening burst of electronic screams and shots the other man strode over to zens table he had slickedback dark hair and ears that stood out from his skull like a pair of gesturing hands there was a large soggy bruise on his forehead his nose was broken and his cheek had recently been slit from top to bottom wary of the fearful things that had happened to the rest of his face the mans eyes cowered in deep heavylidded sockets all right if i sit down he asked doing so on the video screen a gaunt grim detective in a trench coat stalked a nocturnal city street menacing figures wielding guns appeared at windows or popped out from behind walls if the detective shot them accurately they collapsed in a pool of blood and a number of points was added to the score but if he missed then there was a female scream and a glimpse of the busty halfnaked victim i couldnt help overhearing what you said zens new companion remarked zen stubbed out his cigarette in a smokedglass ashtray printed with the name address and telephone number of a wholesale meat supplier all homekilled produce read the slogan bulk orders our speciality hobbled downstairs past zen as soon as she had gone he walked down to the landing and knocked on the door in an authoritative way there was a scurry of steps inside who is it piped a childish voice gas board weve got a suspected leak to the building got to check all the apartments the door opened a crack secured by a chain there seemed to be no one there let me see your identification looking much lower down the opening zen finally spotted a small face and two eyes fixed unblinkingly on him he got his police identity card out and dropped it through the centimetrewide crack show this to your father the eyes regarded him doubtfully the girl couldnt have been more than about seven or eight years old she tried to shut the door but zen had planted his foot in it the child turned away the card held like something dangerous or disgusting between her index finger and thumb after some time an even younger girl appeared keeping well away from the door but watching zen with an air of fascination zen smiled at her hello there have you come to kill my daddy she asked brightly before zen could reply the child was shooed away by a mans voice good evening fausto called zen its been a long time a figure scarcely larger than the childrens appeared round the rim of the door dottore breathed a hushed voice what an honour what a pleasure youre alone alone youll have to move your foot i cant get the chain undone i just want to ask you a small favour fausto maybe i can do you one in return just move your fucking foot zen did so there was a metallic rattle and in a single movement the door opened a hand pulled zen inside and the door closed again please forgive my language dottore im a bit nervous at the moment fausto was a small wiry man with the extreme skin niness that betrays an undernourished childhood his face was marked by a scar which split his upper lip he claimed that hed got it in a knife fight but zen thought it was more likely the result of a bungled operation for a cleft palate in compensation for the rigours of his childhood fausto had survived the passing years with remarkably little sign of ageing that he had survived at all was a minor miracle given the number of men he had betrayed the recruit ment of fausto arcuti had led directly to one of the great successes of zens years at the questura in rome the smashing of the kidnap and extortion ring organized by a playboy named francesco fortuzzi arcuti had worked from inside the gang continuing to supply information right up until the last minute then when the police swooped he had been allowed a slip through the net along with various other minor figures who never realized that they owed their escape to the fact that zen was covering faustos tracks the longterm prospects for informers were bleak once a man had sold his soul to the authorities they could always threaten to expose him if he refused to collaborate again and the risks of such collabor ation grew with every successful prosecution sooner or later the criminal milieu worked out where the leaks were coming from against all the odds however arcuti had survived come in he said leading zen inside what a pleasure and so unexpected maria bring us something to drink you other kids get the fuck out of here the apartment consisted of two small smelly rooms crudely lit by exposed highwattage bulbs forlorn pieces of illassorted furniture stood scattered about like refugees in transit the walls were bedecked with images of the virgin the bleeding heart of jesus and various saints over the television hung a large threedimensional picture of the crucifixion as you moved your head christs eyes opened and closed and blood seeped from his wounds sit down dottore sit down arcuti exclaimed clearing the sofa of toys and clothes sorry about the mess the wifes out at work all day so we never seem to get things sorted out the eldest girl carried in a bottle of amaro and two glasses id prefer to take you out to the bar arcuti said pour ing them each a drink but the way things are ive just come from there zen told him i suppose you followed mario if thats his name the one with the mickey mouse ears arcuti nodded wearily halfsmart thats mario its ok when theyre clever and its ok when theyre stupid its the ones in between that kill you so whats the problem zen murmured sipping his drink arcuti sighed its this parrucci business its got us all spooked parrucci zen frowned the name meant nothing to him you probably havent heard about it theres no reason why you should have he wasnt working for you in fact he wasnt working for anyone thats what makes it worse hed given it all up years ago of course in this business you never really retire but parrucci had been out of it for so long he must have thought he was safe no one even knew hed been in the game until it happened the informer drained his glass in a single gulp and poured himself another we found out because of the way they did it so we asked around and it turned out that parrucci had been one of the top informers up north years ago but hed put all that behind him wanted to settle down and bring up his kids normally thats why they picked him i reckon how do you mean well if they knock off someone whos still active it looks like a personal vendetta people who are not involved dont take much notice but something like this is a warning to everyone once you inform youre marked for life well come for you even if it takes years thats what theyre saying zen lit a cigarette he knew he was smoking too much but this was not the time to worry about it what did they do to him he asked arcuti shook his head i dont even want to think about it he sat staring at the carpet for some time balanced on the forward edge of the threadbare armchair then he grabbed a cigarette from the packet lying open beside him and lit up glaring defiantly at zen you really want to know all right ill tell you in dialect if a man is full of energy and drive they say he has fire in his belly thats a good thing unless you have too much unless you break the rules and start playing the game on your own account what they used to do with traitors down south was to get a big iron cookingpot and build a charcoal fire inside then they stretched the poor bastard out on his back tied him up set the pot on his stomach and then used the bellows until the metal got redhot eventually the pot burnt its way down into the mans stomach under its own weight it could take hours depending on how much they used the bellows thats what they did to parrucci not exactly thats the traditional method but you know how it is these days people cant be bothered parrucci they kidnapped from his house and took him out to the country out near viterbo somewhere they broke into a weekend cottage stripped him naked laid him out across the electric cooker with his wrists and ankles roped together and then turned on the hot plates jesus arcuti knocked back the second glass of amaro amid frantic puffs at his cigarette now do you see why im nervous dottore because i could be the next name on the list how do you know therell be any more because no ones claimed responsibility usually when something like this happens you find out who did it and why they make damn sure you know thats the whole point but this time no ones saying anything the only reason for that is that the job isnt finished yet zen glanced at his watch to his dismay he found that it was almost ten to six at six oclock maria grazia would leave to go home and from then on zens mother would be alone in the apartment fausto arcuti had noticed his visitors gesture anyway thats enough of my problems what can i do for you dottore its a question of borrowing a car for a few days fausto any particular sort of car something fairly classy if you can but the main thing is it needs to be registered in switzerland actually registered zen corrected himself it needs to have swiss number plates arcuti drew the final puff of smoke from his cigarette and let it drown in the dregs of amaro this car how long do you want it for lets say the inside of a week and afterwards will it be er compromised in any way zen gave him a pained look fausto if i wanted to do anything illegal id use a police car arcuti conceded a thin smile and how soon do you need it tomorrow ideally but i dont suppose theres any chance of that the informer shrugged why ever not dottore youre doing business with the italy that works i may be shut up in this lousy rotten stinking hole but i still have my contacts he produced the piece of paper zen had given the man called mario i can contact you at this number in the evening during the day im at the ministry which department criminalpol arcuti whistled congratulations well if i have any luck ill phone you in the morning i wont give any name ill just say that i wanted to confirm our lunch date therell be a message for you at the bar here thanks fausto in return ill see what i can do to shed some light on this parrucci business id appreciate it dottore its not just for me though thats not exactly the way id choose to go but the girls its wrong for them to have to grow up like this zen walked away past the shuttered and gated market towards the bustle of activity on via marmorata he was well satisfied with the way things had gone fausto arcutis lifestyle might appear unimpressive but as a broker for favours and information he was second to none moreover zen knew that he would want to make up for the poor figure he had cut cowering in fear of his life in a squalid flat zens main preoccupation now was to get home with as little delay as possible he was in luck for no sooner had he turned on to the main traffic artery than a taxi stopped just in front of him the family which emerged from it seemed numerous enough to fill a bus never mind a taxi and still the matriarch in charge kept pulling them out like a conjuror producing rabbits from a hat at last the supply was exhausted however and after an acrimonious squab ble about extras discounts and tips they all trooped away in solitary splendour zen climbed into the cab which was as hot and smelly as a football teams changingroom and had himself driven home to his relief the red alfa romeo was nowhere to be seen the lift was ready and waiting for once and zen rode it up to the fourth floor the experiences of the day had left him utterly drained he saw it immediately he opened the front door a narrow black strip as thin as a razor blade and seemingly endless it continued all the way along the hallway gleaming where the light from the living room reflected off its surface he bent down and picked it up it felt cold smooth and slippery he walked slowly down the hallway gathering in the shiny strip as he went as he passed the glasspanelled door to the living room music welled up from the tele vision as though to signify his relief at finding his mother alive and well her eyes glued to the play of light and shadow on the screen then he looked past her uncom prehending disbelieving the gleaming strip ran riot over the entire room heaped in coils on the sofa and chairs running around the legs of the chairs draped over the table in its midst lay a small rectangular box with tape sprouting from slits in either end zen picked it up minis try of the interior he read index no yzg bur yggkgg whats the matter with you tonight his mother snap ped i asked you to bring me my camomile tea ages ago and you didnt even bother to answer zen slowly straightened up staring at her but mamma ive only just got home dont be ridiculous do you think i didnt see you i may be old but im not so old i dont recognize my own son besides who else would be here once maria grazias gone home eh a cold shiver ran through zens body im sorry mamma you didnt even have the common decency to reply when i spoke to you you always bring me my camomile tea before dynasty starts you know that but tonight you were too busy cluttering the place up with that ribbon or string or whatever it is ill fetch it straight away zen mumbled but he didnt do so for at that moment he heard a sound from the hallway and remembered that he had left the front door standing wide open among the furniture stored in the hall was a wardrobe inset with long rectangular mirrors which reflected an image of the front door on to the glass panel of the living room door thus it was that even before he set foot in the hallway zen could see that the entrance to the apartment was now blocked by a figure thrown into silhouette by the landing light the next moment this switched itself off plunging everything into obscurity aurelio said a voice from the darkness zens breathing started again he groped for the switch and turned on the light gilberto he croaked come in close the door what is the worst the most obscene and loathsome thing that one person can do to another go on rack your brains let your invention run riot i often used to talk to myself like this as i scuttled about well is that all i can think of far worse things than that ive done far worse things than that but lets not restrict ourselves to your handmedown imaginations because whatever you or i or anyone else can think up no matter how hideous or improb able one thing is sure it has happened not just once but time and time again this prison is also a torture house no one cares what goes on here you know vasco the blacksmith everyone still calls him the blacksmith though he repairs cars now what do you think of him a steady sort a bit obstinate gives himself airs as i was passing his workshop one morning i saw him pick up his three yearold daughter by the hair hold her dangling there a while then let her fall to the floor a moment later he was back to work moulding some metal tubing while the child wept in a heap on the ground her little world in pieces all around her i wanted to comfort her to tell her how lucky she had been all her daddy had done was pull her hair he could have done other things he could have used the blowtorch on her he could have buried her alive in the pit beneath the cars he could have done anything he could have done anything
