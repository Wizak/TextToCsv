roald dahl the witches a note about witches in fairytales witches always wear silly black hats and black cloaks and they ride on broomsticks but this is not a fairytale this is about real witches the most important thing you should know about real witches is this listen very carefully never forget what is coming next real witches dress in ordinary clothes and look very much like ordinary women they live in ordinary houses and they work in ordinary jobs that is why they are so hard to catch a real witch hates children with a redhot sizzling hatred that is more sizzling and redhot than any hatred you could possibly imagine a real witch spends all her time plotting to get rid of the children in her particular territory her passion is to do away with them one by one it is all she thinks about the whole day long even if she is working as a cashier in a supermarket or typing letters for a businessman or driving round in a fancy car her mind will always be plotting and scheming and churning and burning and whizzing and phizzing with murderous bloodthirsty thoughts which child she says to herself all day long exactly which child shall i choose for my next squelching a real witch gets the same pleasure from squelching a child as you get from eating a plateful of strawberries and thick cream she reckons on doing away with one child a week anything less than that and she becomes grumpy one child a week is fiftytwo a year squish them and squiggle them and make them disappear that is the motto of all witches very carefully a victim is chosen then the witch stalks the wretched child like a hunter stalking a little bird in the forest she treads softly she moves quietly she gets closer and closer then at last when everything is ready phwisst and she swoops sparks fly flames leap oil boils rats howl skin shrivels and the child disappears a witch you must understand does not knock children on the head or stick knives into them or shoot at them with a pistol people who do those things get caught by the police a witch never gets caught dont forget that she has magic in her fingers and devilry dancing in her blood she can make stones jump about like frogs and she can make tongues of flame go flickering across the surface of the water these magic powers are very frightening luckily there are not a great number of real witches in the world today but there are still quite enough to make you nervous in england there are probably about one hundred of them altogether some countries have more others have not quite so many no country in the world is completely free from witches a witch is always a woman i do not wish to speak badly about women most women are lovely but the fact remains that all witches are women there is no such thing as a male witch on the other hand a ghoul is always a male so indeed is a barghest both are dangerous bu neither of them is half as dangerous as a real witch as far as children are concerned a real witch is easily the most dangerous of all the living creatures on earth what makes her doubly dangerous is the fact that she doesnt look dangerous even when you know all the secrets you can still never be quite sure whether it is a witch you are gazing at or just a kind lady if a tiger were able to make himself look like a large dog with a waggy tail you would probably go up and pat him on the head and that would be the end of you it is the same with witches they all look like nice ladies kindly examine the picture opposite which lady is the witch that is a difficult question but it is one that every child must try to answer for all you know a witch might be living next door to you right now or she might be the woman with the bright eyes who sat opposite you on the bus this morning she might be the lady with the dazzling smile who offered you a sweet from a white paper bag in the street before lunch she might even and this will make you jump she might even be your lovely schoolteacher who is reading these words to you at this very moment look carefully at that teacher perhaps she is smiling at the absurdity of such a suggestion dont let that put you off it could be part of her cleverness i am not of course telling you for one second that your teacher actually is a witch all i am saying is that she might be one it is most unlikely but and here comes the big but it is not impossible oh if only there were a way of telling for sure whether a woman was a witch or not then we could round them all up and put them in the meatgrinder unhappily there is no such way but there are a number of little signals you can look out for little quirky habits that all witches have in common and if you know about these if you remember them always then you might just possibly manage to escape from being squelched before you are very much older my grandmother i myself had two separate encounters with witches before i was eight years old from the first i escaped unharmed but on the second occasion i was not so lucky things happened to me that will probably make you scream when you read about them that cant be helped the truth must be told the fact that i am still here and able to speak to you is due entirely to my wonderful grandmother my grandmother was norwegian the norwegians know all about witches for norway with its black forests and icy mountains is where the first witches came from my father and my mother were also norwegian but because my father had a business in england i had been born there and had lived there and had started going to an english school twice a year at christmas and in the summer we went back to norway to visit my grandmother this old lady as far as i could gather was just about the only surviving relative we had on either side of our family she was my mothers mother and i absolutely adored her when she and i were together we spoke in either norwegian or in english it didnt matter which we were equally fluent in both languages and i have to admit that i felt closer to her than to my mother soon after my seventh birthday my parents took me as usual to spend christmas with my grandmother in norway and it was over there while my father and mother and i were driving in icy weather just north of oslo that our car skidded off the road and went tumbling down into a rocky ravine my parents were killed i was firmly strapped into the back seat and received only a cut on the forehead i wont go into the horrors of that terrible afternoon i still get the shivers when i think about it i finished up of course back in my grandmothers house with her arms around me tight and both of us crying the whole night long what are we going to do now i asked her through the tears you will stay here with me she said and i will look after you arent i going back to england no she said i could never do that heaven shall take my soul but norway shall keep my bones the very next day in order that we might both try to forget our great sadness my grandmother started telling me stories she was a wonderful storyteller and i was enthralled by everything she told me but i didnt become really excited until she got on to the subject of witches she was apparently a great expert on these creatures and she made it very clear to me that her witch stories unlike most of the others were not imaginary tales they were all true they were the gospel truth they were history everything she was telling me about witches had actually happened and i had better believe it what was worse what was far far worse was that witches were still with us they were all around us and i had better believe that too are you really being truthful grandmamma really and truly truthful my darling she said you wont last long in this world if you dont know how to spot a witch when you see one but you told me that witches look like ordinary women grandmamma so how can i spot them you must listen to me my grandmother said you must remember everything i tell you after that all you can do is cross your heart and pray to heaven and hope for the best we were in the big livingroom of her house in oslo and i was ready for bed the curtains were never drawn in that house and through the windows i could see huge snowflakes falling slowly on to an outside world that was as black as tar my grandmother was tremendously old and wrinkled with a massive wide body which was smothered in grey lace she sat there majestic in her armchair filling every inch of it not even a mouse could have squeezed in to sit beside her i myself just seven years old was crouched on the floor at her feet wearing pyjamas dressinggown and slippers you swear you arent pulling my leg i kept saying to her you swear you arent just pretending listen she said i have known no less than five children who have simply vanished off the face of this earth never to be seen again the witches took them i still think youre just trying to frighten me i said i am trying to make sure you dont go the same way she said i love you and i want you to stay with me tell me about the children who disappeared i said my grandmother was the only grandmother i ever met who smoked cigars she lit one now a long black cigar that smelt of burning rubber the first child i knew who disappeared she said was called ranghild hansen ranghild was about eight at the time and she was playing with her little sister on the lawn their mother who was baking bread in the kitchen came outside for a breath of air wheres ranghild she asked she went away with the tall lady the little sister said what tall lady the mother said the tall lady in white gloves the little sister said she took ranghild by the hand and led her away no one my grandmother said ever saw ranghild again didnt they search for her i asked they searched for miles around everyone in the town helped but they never found her what happened to the other four children i asked they vanished just as ranghild did how grandmamma how did they vanish in every case a strange lady was seen outside the house just before it happened but how did they vanish i asked the second one was very peculiar my grandmother said there was a family called christiansen they lived up on holmenkollen and they had an old oilpainting in the living room which they were very proud of the painting showed some ducks in the yard outside a farmhouse there were no people in the painting just a flock of ducks on a grassy farmyard and the farmhouse in the background it was a large painting and rather pretty well one day their daughter solveg came home from school eating an apple she said a nice lady had given it to her on the street the next morning little solveg was not in her bed the parents searched everywhere but they couldnt find her then all of a sudden her father shouted there she is thats solveg feeding the ducks he was pointing at the oilpainting and sure enough solveg was in it she was standing in the farmyard in the act of throwing bread to the ducks out of a basket the father rushed up to the painting and touched her but that didnt help she was simply a part of the painting just a picture painted on the canvas did you ever see that painting grandmamma with the little girl in it many times my grandmother said and the peculiar thing was that little solveg kept changing her position in the picture one day she would actually be inside the farmhouse and you could see her face looking out of the window another day she would be far over to the left with a duck in her arms did you see her moving in the picture grandmamma nobody did wherever she was whether outside feeding the ducks or inside looking out of the window she was always motionless just a figure painted in oils it was all very odd my grandmother said very odd indeed and what was most odd of all was that as the years went by she kept growing older in the picture in ten years the small girl had become a young woman in thirty years she was middleaged then all at once fifty four years after it all happened she disappeared from the picture altogether you mean she died i said who knows my grandmother said some very mysterious things go on in the world of witches thats two youve told me about i said what happened to the third one the third one was little birgit svenson my grandmother said she lived just across the road from us one day she started growing feathers all over her body within a month she had turned into a large white chicken her parents kept her for years in a pen in the garden she even laid eggs what colour eggs i said brown ones my grandmother said biggest eggs ive ever seen in my life her mother made omelettes out of them delicious they were i gazed up at my grandmother who sat there like some ancient queen on her throne her eyes were mistygrey and they seemed to be looking at something many miles away the cigar was the only real thing about her at that moment and the smoke it made billowed round her head in blue clouds but the little girl who became a chicken didnt disappear i said no not birgit she lived on for many years laying her brown eggs you said all of them disappeared i made a mistake my grandmother said i am getting old i cant remember everything what happened to the fourth child i asked the fourth was a boy called harald my grandmother said one morning his skin went all greyishyellow then it became hard and crackly like the shell of a nut by evening the boy had turned to stone stone i said you mean real stone granite she said ill take you to see him if you like they still keep him in the house he stands in the hall a little stone statue visitors lean their umbrellas up against him although i was very young i was not prepared to believe everything my grandmother told me and yet she spoke with such conviction with such utter seriousness and with never a smile on her face or a twinkle in her eye that i found myself beginning to wonder go on grandmamma i said you told me there were five altogether what happened to the last one would you like a puff of my cigar she said im only seven grandmamma i dont care what age you are she said youll never catch a cold if you smoke cigars what about number five grandmamma number five she said chewing the end of her cigar as though it were a delicious asparagus was rather an interesting case a nineyearold boy called leif was summerholidaying with his family on the fjord and the whole family was picnicking and swimming off some rocks on one of those little islands young leif dived into the water and his father who was watching him noticed that he stayed under for an unusually long time when he came to the surface at last he wasnt leif any more what was he grandmamma he was a porpoise he wasnt he couldnt have been he was a lovely young porpoise she said and as friendly as could be grandmamma i said yes my darling did he really and truly turn into a porpoise absolutely she said i knew his mother well she told me all about it she told me how leif the porpoise stayed with them all that afternoon giving his brothers and sisters rides on his back they had a wonderful time then he waved a flipper at them and swam away never to be seen again but grandmamma i said how did they know that the porpoise was actually leif he talked to them my grandmother said he laughed and joked with them all the time he was giving them rides but wasnt there a most tremendous fuss when this happened i asked not much my grandmother said you must remember that here in norway we are used to that sort of thing there are witches everywhere theres probably one living in our street this very moment its time you went to bed a witch wouldnt come in through my window in the night would she i asked quaking a little no my grandmother said a witch will never do silly things like climbing up drainpipes or breaking into peoples houses youll be quite safe in your bed come along ill tuck you in how to recognise a witch the next evening after my grandmother had given me my bath she took me once again into the livingroom for another story tonight the old woman said i am going to tell you how to recognise a witch when you see one can you always be sure i asked no she said you cant and thats the trouble but you can make a pretty good guess she was dropping cigar ash all over her lap and i hoped she wasnt going to catch on fire before shed told me how to recognise a witch in the first place she said a real witch is certain always to be wearing gloves when you meet her surely not always i said what about in the summer when its hot even in the summer my grandmother said she has to do you want to know why why i said because she doesnt have fingernails instead of fingernails she has thin curvy claws like a cat and she wears the gloves to hide them mind you lots of very respectable women wear gloves especially in winter so this doesnt help you very much mamma used to wear gloves i said not in the house my grandmother said witches wear gloves even in the house they only take them off when they go to bed how do you know all this grandmamma dont interrupt she said just take it all in the second thing to remember is that a real witch is always bald bald i said bald as a boiled egg my grandmother said i was shocked there was something indecent about a bald woman why are they bald grandmamma dont ask me why she snapped but you can take it from me that not a single hair grows on a witchs head how horrid disgusting my grandmother said if shes bald shell be easy to spot i said not at all my grandmother said a real witch always wears a wig to hide her baldness she wears a firstclass wig and it is almost impossible to tell a really firstclass wig from ordinary hair unless you give it a pull to see if it comes off then thats what ill have to do i said dont be foolish my grandmother said you cant go round pulling at the hair of every lady you meet even if she is wearing gloves just you try it and see what happens so that doesnt help much either i said none of these things is any good on its own my grandmother said its only when you put them all together that they begin to make a little sense mind you my grandmother went on these wigs do cause a rather serious problem for witches what problem grandmamma they make the scalp itch most terribly she said you see when an actress wears a wig or if you or i were to wear a wig we would be putting it on over our own hair but a witch has to put it straight on to her naked scalp and the underneath of a wig is always very rough and scratchy it sets up a frightful itch on the bald skin it causes nasty sores on the head wigrash the witches call it and it doesnt half itch what other things must i look for to recognise a witch i asked look for the noseholes my grandmother said witches have slightly larger noseholes than ordinary people the rim of each nosehole is pink and curvy like the rim of a certain kind of seashell why do they have such big noseholes i asked for smelling with my grandmother said a real witch has the most amazing powers of smell she can actually smell out a child who is standing on the other side of the street on a pitchblack night she couldnt smell me i said ive just had a bath oh yes she could my grandmother said the cleaner you happen to be the more smelly you are to a witch that cant be true i said an absolutely clean child gives off the most ghastly stench to a witch my grandmother said the dirtier you are the less you smell but that doesnt make sense grandmamma oh yes it does my grandmother said it isnt the dirt that the witch is smelling it is you the smell that drives a witch mad actually comes right out of your own skin it comes oozing out of your skin in waves and these waves stinkwaves the witches call them go floating through the air and hit the witch right smack in her nostrils they send her reeling now wait a minute grandmamma dont interrupt she said the point is this when you havent washed for a week and your skin is all covered over with dirt then quite obviously the stinkwaves cannot come oozing out nearly so strongly i shall never have a bath again i said just dont have one too often my grandmother said once a month is quite enough for a sensible child it was at moments like these that i loved my grandmother more than ever grandmamma i said if its a dark night how can a witch smell the difference between a child and a grownup because grownups dont give out stinkwaves she said only children do that but i dont really give out stinkwaves do i i said im not giving them out at this very moment am i not to me you arent my grandmother said to me you are smelling like raspberries and cream but to a witch you would be smelling absolutely disgusting what would i be smelling of i asked dogs droppings my grandmother said i reeled i was stunned dogs droppings i cried i am not smelling of dogs droppings i dont believe it i wont believe it whats more my grandmother said speaking with a touch of relish to a witch youd be smelling of fresh dogs droppings that simply is not true i cried i know i am not smelling of dogs droppings stale or fresh theres no point in arguing about it my grandmother said its a fact of life i was outraged i simply couldnt bring myself to believe what my grandmother was telling me so if you see a woman holding her nose as she passes you in the street she went on that woman could easily be a witch i decided to change the subject tell me what else to look for in a witch i said the eyes my grandmother said look carefully at the eyes because the eyes of a real witch are different from yours and mine look in the middle of each eye where there is normally a little black dot if she is a witch the black dot will keep changing colour and you will see fire and you will see ice dancing right in the very centre of the coloured dot it will send shivers running all over your skin my grandmother leant back in her chair and sucked away contentedly at her foul black cigar i squatted on the floor staring up at her fascinated she was not smiling she looked deadly serious are there other things i asked her of course there are other things my grandmother said you dont seem to understand that witches are not actually women at all they look like women they talk like women and they are able to act like women but in actual fact they are totally different animals they are demons in human shape that is why they have claws and bald heads and queer noses and peculiar eyes all of which they have to conceal as best they can from the rest of the world what else is different about them grandmamma the feet she said witches never have toes no toes i cried then what do they have they just have feet my grandmother said the feet have square ends with no toes on them at all does that make it difficult to walk i asked not at all my grandmother said but it does give them a problem with their shoes all ladies like to wear small rather pointed shoes but a witch whose feet are very wide and square at the ends has the most awful job squeezing her feet into those neat little pointed shoes why doesnt she wear wide comfy shoes with square ends i asked she dare not my grandmother said just as she hides her baldness with a wig she must also hide her ugly witchs feet by squeezing them into pretty shoes isnt that terribly uncomfortable i said extremely uncomfortable my grandmother said but she has to put up with it if shes wearing ordinary shoes it wont help me to recognise her will it grandmamma im afraid it wont my grandmother said you might possibly see her limping very slightly but only if you were watching closely are those the only differences then grandmamma theres one more my grandmother said just one more what is it grandmamma their spit is blue blue i cried not blue their spit cant be blue blue as a bilberry she said you dont mean it grandmamma nobody can have blue spit witches can she said is it like ink i asked exactly she said they even use it to write with they use those oldfashioned pens that have nibs and they simply lick the nib can you notice the blue spit grandmamma if a witch was talking to me would i be able to notice it only if you looked carefully my grandmother said if you looked very carefully you would probably see a slight blueish tinge on her teeth but it doesnt show much it would if she spat i said witches never spit my grandmother said they darent i couldnt believe my grandmother would be lying to me she went to church every morning of the week and she said grace before every meal and somebody who did that would never tell lies i was beginning to believe every word she spoke so there you are my grandmother said thats about all i can tell you none of it is very helpful you can still never be absolutely sure whether a woman is a witch or not just by looking at her but if she is wearing the gloves if she has the large noseholes the queer eyes and the hair that looks as though it might be a wig and if she has a blueish tinge on her teeth if she has all of these things then you run like mad grandmamma i said when you were a little girl did you ever meet a witch once my grandmother said only once what happened im not going to tell you she said it would frighten you out of your skin and give you bad dreams please tell me i begged no she said certain things are too horrible to talk about does it have something to do with your missing thumb i asked suddenly her old wrinkled lips shut tight as a pair of tongs and the hand that held the cigar began to quiver very slightly i waited she didnt look at me she didnt speak all of a sudden she had shut herself off completely the conversation was finished goodnight grandmamma i said rising from the floor and kissing her on the cheek she didnt move i crept out of the room and went to my bedroom the grand high witch the next day a man in a black suit arrived at the house carrying a briefcase and he held a long conversation with my grandmother in the livingroom i was not allowed in while he was there but when at last he went away my grandmother came in to me walking very slowly and looking very sad that man was reading me your fathers will she said what is a will i asked her it is something you write before you die she said and in it you say who is going to have your money and your property but most important of all it says who is going to look after your child if both the mother and father are dead a fearful panic took hold of me it did say you grandmamma i cried i dont have to go to somebody else do i no she said your father would never have done that he has asked me to take care of you for as long as i live but he has also asked that i take you back to your own house in england he wants us to stay there but why i said why cant we stay here in norway you would hate to live anywhere else you told me you would i know she said but there are a lot of complications with money and with the house that you wouldnt understand also it said in the will that although all your family is norwegian you were born in england and you have started your education there and he wants you to continue going to english schools oh grandmamma i cried you dont want to go and live in our english house i know you dont of course i dont she said but i am afraid i must the will said that your mother felt the same way about it and it is important to respect the wishes of the parents there was no way out of it we had to go to england and my grandmother started making arrangements at once your next school term begins in a few days she said so we dont have any time to waste on the evening before we left for england my grandmother got on to her favourite subject once again there are not as many witches in england as there are in norway she said im sure i wont meet one i said i sincerely hope you wont she said because those english witches are probably the most vicious in the whole world as she sat there smoking her foul cigar and talking away i kept looking at the hand with the missing thumb i couldnt help it i was fascinated by it and i kept wondering what awful thing had happened that time when she had met a witch it must have been something absolutely appalling and gruesome otherwise she would have told me about it maybe the thumb had been twisted off or perhaps she had been forced to jam her thumb down the spout of a boiling kettle until it was steamed away or did someone pull it out of her hand like a tooth i couldnt help trying to guess tell me what those english witches do grandmamma i said well she said sucking away at her stinking cigar their favourite ruse is to mix up a powder that will turn a child into some creature or other that all grownups hate what sort of a creature grandmamma often its a slug she said a slug is one of their favourites then the grownups step on the slug and squish it without knowing its a child thats perfectly beastly i cried or it might be a flea my grandmother said they might turn you into a flea and without realising what she was doing your own mother would get out the fleapowder and then its goodbye you youre making me nervous grandmamma i dont think i want to go back to england ive known english witches she went on who have turned children into pheasants and then sneaked the pheasants up into the woods the very day before the pheasantshooting season opened owch i said so they get shot of course they get shot she said and then they get plucked and roasted and eaten for supper i pictured myself as a pheasant flying frantically over the men with the guns swerving and dipping as the guns exploded below me yes my grandmother said it gives the english witches great pleasure to stand back and watch the grownups doing away with their own children i really dont want to go to england grandmamma of course you dont she said nor do i but im afraid weve got to are witches different in every country i asked completely different my grandmother said but i dont know much about the other countries dont you even know about america i asked not really she answered although i have heard it said that over there the witches are able to make the grownups eat their own children never i cried oh no grandmamma that couldnt be true i dont know whether its true or not she said its only a rumour ive heard but how could they possibly make them eat their own children i asked by turning them into hotdogs she said that wouldnt be too difficult for a clever witch does every single country in the world have its witches i asked wherever you find people you find witches my grandmother said there is a secret society of witches in every country and do they all know one another grandmamma they do not she said a witch only knows the witches in her own country she is strictly forbidden to communicate with any foreign witches but an english witch for example will know all the other witches in england they are all friends they ring each other up they swop deadly recipes goodness knows what else they talk about i hate to think i sat on the floor watching my grandmother she put her cigar stub in the ashtray and folded her hands across her stomach once a year she went on the witches of each separate country hold their own secret meeting they all get together in one place to receive a lecture from the grand high witch of all the world from who i cried she is the ruler of them all my grandmother said she is allpowerful she is without mercy all other witches are petrified of her they see her only once a year at their annual meeting she goes there to whip up excitement and enthusiasm and to give orders the grand high witch travels from country to country attending these annual meetings where do they have these meetings grandmamma there are all sorts of rumours my grandmother answered i have heard it said that they just book into an hotel like any other group of women who are holding a meeting i have also heard it said that some very peculiar things go on in the hotels they stay in it is rumoured that the beds are never slept in that there are burn marks on the bedroom carpets that toads are discovered in the bathtubs and that down in the kitchen the cook once found a baby crocodile swimming in his saucepan of soup my grandmother picked up her cigar and took another puff inhaling the foul smoke deeply into her lungs where does the grand high witch live when shes at home i asked nobody knows my grandmother said if we knew that then she could be rooted out and destroyed witchophiles all over the world have spent their lives trying to discover the secret headquarters of the grand high witch what is a witchophile grandmamma a person who studies witches and knows a lot about them my grandmother said are you a witchophile grandmamma i am a retired witchophile she said i am too old to be active any longer but when i was younger i travelled all over the globe trying to track down the grand high witch i never came even close to succeeding is she rich i asked shes rolling my grandmother said simply rolling in money rumour has it that there is a machine in her headquarters which is exactly like the machine the government uses to print the banknotes you and i use after all banknotes are only bits of paper with special designs and pictures on them anyone can make them who has the right machine and the right paper my guess is that the grand high witch makes all the money she wants and she dishes it out to witches everywhere what about foreign money i asked those machines can make chinese money if you want them to my grandmother said its only a question of pressing the right button but grandmamma i said if nobody has ever seen the grand high witch how can you be so sure she exists my grandmother gave me a long and very severe look nobody has ever seen the devil she said but we know he exists the next morning we sailed for england and soon i was back in the old family house in kent but this time with only my grandmother to look after me then the easter term began and every weekday i went to school and everything seemed to have come back to normal again now at the bottom of our garden there was an enormous conker tree and high up in its branches timmy and i had started to build a magnificent treehouse we were able to work on it only at the weekends but we were getting along fine we had begun with the floor which we built by laying wide planks between two quite farapart branches and nailing them down within a month we had finished the floor then we constructed a wooden railing around the floor and that left only the roof to be built the roof was the difficult bit one saturday afternoon when timmy was in bed with flu i decided to make a start on the roof all by myself it was lovely being high up there in that conker tree all alone with the pale young leaves coming out everywhere around me it was like being in a big green cave and the height made it extra exciting my grandmother had told me that if i fell i would break a leg and every time i looked down i got a tingle along my spine i worked away nailing the first plank on the roof then suddenly out of the corner of my eye i caught sight of a woman standing immediately below me she was looking up at me and smiling in the most peculiar way when most people smile their lips go out sideways this womans lips went upwards and downwards showing all her front teeth and gums the gums were like raw meat it is always a shock to discover that you are being watched when you think you are alone and what was this strange woman doing in our garden anyway i noticed that she was wearing a small black hat and she had black gloves on her hands and the gloves came nearly up to her elbows gloves she was wearing gloves i froze all over i have a present for you she said still staring at me still smiling still showing her teeth and gums i didnt answer come down out of that tree little boy she said and i shall give you the most exciting present youve ever had her voice had a curious rasping quality it made a sort of metallic sound as though her throat was full of drawingpins without taking her eyes from my face she very a slowly put one of those gloved hands into her purse and drew out a small green snake she held it up for me to see its tame she said the snake began to coil itself around her forearm it was brilliant green if you come down here i shall give him to you she said oh grandmamma i thought come and help me then i panicked i dropped the hammer and shot up that enormous tree like a monkey i didnt stop until i was as high as i could possibly go and there i stayed quivering with fear i couldnt see the woman now there were layers and layers of leaves between her and me i stayed up there for hours and i kept very still it began to grow dark at last i heard my grandmother calling my name im up here i shouted back come down at once she called out its past your suppertime grandmamma i shouted has that woman gone what woman my grandmother called back the woman in the black gloves there was silence from below it was the silence of somebody who was too stunned to speak grandmamma i shouted again has she gone yes my grandmother answered at last shes gone im here my darling ill look after you you can come down now i climbed down i was trembling my grandmother enfolded me in her arms ive seen a witch i said come inside she said youll be all right with me she led me into the house and gave me a cup of hot cocoa with lots of sugar in it tell me everything she said i told her by the time i had finished it was my grandmother who was trembling her face was ashy grey and i saw her glance down at that hand of hers that didnt have a thumb you know what this means she said it means that there is one of them in our district from now on im not letting you walk alone to school do you think she could be after me specially i asked no she said i doubt that one child is as good as any other to those creatures it is hardly surprising that after that i became a very witchconscious little boy if i happened to be alone on the road and saw a woman approaching who was wearing gloves i would quickly skip across to the other side and as the weather remained pretty cold during the whole of that month nearly everybody was wearing gloves curiously enough though i never saw the woman with the green snake again that was my first witch but it wasnt my last summer holidays the easter holidays came and went and the summer term began at school my grandmother and i had already planned to take our summer holiday in norway and we talked about almost nothing else every evening she had booked a cabin for each of us on the boat from newcastle to oslo at the earliest possible moment after my school broke up and from oslo she was going to take me to a place she knew down on the south coast near arendal where she had spent her own summer holidays as a child nearly eighty years ago all day long she said my brother and i were out in the rowingboat the whole coast is dotted with tiny islands and theres nobody on them we used to explore them and dive into the sea off the lovely smooth granite rocks and sometimes on the way out we would drop the anchor and fish for cod and whiting and if we caught anything we would build a fire on an island and fry the fish in a pan for our lunch there is no finer fish in the world than absolutely fresh cod what did you use for bait grandmamma when you went fishing mussels she said everyone uses mussels for bait in norway and if we didnt catch any fish we would boil the mussels in a saucepan and eat those were they good delicious she said cook them in seawater and they are tender and salty what else did you do grandmamma we used to row out and wave to the shrimpboats on their way home andthey would stop and give us a handful of shrimps each the shrimps were still warm from having been just cooked and we would sit in the rowingboat peeling them and gobbling them up the head was the best part the head i said you squeeze the head between your teeth and suck out the inside its marvellous you and i will do all those things this summer my darling she said grandmamma i said i cant wait i simply cant wait to go nor can i she said when there were only three weeks of the summer term left an awful thing happened my grandmother got pneumonia she became very ill and a trained nurse moved into the house to look after her the doctor explained to me that pneumonia is not normally a dangerous illness nowadays because of penicillin but when a person is more than eighty years old as my grandmother was then it is very dangerous indeed he said he didnt even dare to move her to hospital in her condition so she stayed in her bedroom and i hung about outside the door while oxygen cylinders and all sorts of other frightening things were taken in to her can i go in and see her i asked no dear the nurse said not at the moment a fat and jolly lady called mrs spring who used to come and clean our house every day also moved in and slept in the house mrs spring looked after me and cooked my meals i liked her very much but she wasnt a patch on my grandmother for telling stories one evening about ten days later the doctor came downstairs and said to me you can go in and see her now but only for a short time shes been asking for you i flew up the stairs and burst into my grandmothers room and threw myself into her arms hey there the nurse said be careful with her will you be all right now grandmamma i asked the worst is over she said ill soon be up again will she i said to the nurse oh yes the nurse answered smiling she told us she simply had to get better because she had to look after you i gave her another hug they wont let me have a cigar she said but you wait till theyre gone shes a tough old bird the nurse said well have her up in another week the nurse was right within a week my grandmother was thumping around the house with her goldtopped cane and interfering with mrs springs cooking i thank you for all your help mrs spring she said but you can go home now oh no i cant mrs spring said doctor told me to see that you take it very easy for the next few days the doctor said more than that he dropped a bombshell on my grandmother and me by telling us that on no account were we to risk the journey to norway this summer rubbish my grandmother cried ive promised him well go its too far the doctor said it would be very dangerous but ill tell you what you can do you can take your grandson to a nice hotel on the south coast of england instead the sea air is just what you need oh no i said do you want your grandmother to die the doctor asked me never i said then dont let her go on a long journey this summer shes not yet strong enough and stop her smoking those vile black cigars in the end the doctor had his way about the holiday but not about the cigars rooms were booked for us in a place called the hotel magnificent in the famous seaside town of bournemouth bournemouth my grandmother told me was full of old people like herself they retired there by the thousand because the air was so bracing and healthy it kept them so they believed alive for a few extra years does it i asked of course not she said its tommyrot but just for once i think weve got to obey the doctor soon after that my grandmother and i took the train to bournemouth and settled into the hotel magnificent it was an enormous white building on the seafront and it looked to me like a pretty boring place to spend a summer holiday in i had my own separate bedroom but there was a door connecting my room with my grandmothers room so that we could visit each other without going into the corridor just before we left for bournemouth my grandmother had given me as consolation a present of two white mice in a little cage and of course i took them with me they were terrific fun those mice i called them william and mary and in the hotel i set out right away teaching them to do tricks the first trick i taught them was to creep up the sleeve of my jacket and come out by my neck then i taught them to climb up the back of my neck on to the top of my head i did this by putting cake crumbs in my hair on the very first morning after our arrival the chambermaid was making my bed when one of my mice poked its head out from under the sheets the maid let out a shriek that brought a dozen people running to see who was being murdered i was reported to the manager there followed an unpleasant scene in the managers office with the manager my grandmother and me the manager whose name was mr stringer was a bristly man in a black tailcoat i cannot permit mice in my hotel madam he said to my grandmother how dare you say that when your rotten hotel is full of rats anyway my grandmother cried rats cried mr stringer going mauve in the face there are no rats in this hotel i saw one this very morning my grandmother said it was running down the corridor into the kitchen that is not true cried mr stringer you had better get the ratcatcher in at once my grandmother said before i report you to the public health authorities i expect theres rats scuttling all over the kitchen floor and stealing the food off the shelves and jumping in and out of the soup never cried mr stringer no wonder my breakfast toast was all nibbled round the edges this morning my grandmother went on relentlessly no wonder it had a nasty ratty taste if youre not careful the health people will be ordering the entire hotel to be closed before everyone gets typhoid fever you are not being serious madam mr stringer said i was never more serious in my life my grandmother said are you or are you not going to allow my grandson to keep his white mice in his room the manager knew when he was beaten may i suggest a compromise madam he said i will permit him to keep them in his room as long as they are never allowed out of the cage hows that that will suit us very well my grandmother said and she stood up and marched out of the room with me behind her there is no way you can train mice inside a cage yet i dared not let them out because the chambermaid was spying on me all the time she had a key to my door and she kept bursting in at all hours trying to catch me with the mice out of the cage she told me that the first mouse to break the rules would be drowned in a bucket of water by the hallporter i decided to seek a safer place where i could carry on with the training there must surely be an empty room in this enormous hotel i put one mouse into each trouserpocket and wandered downstairs in search of a secret spot the ground floor of the hotel was a maze of public rooms all of them named in gold letters on the doors i wandered through the lounge and the smokingroom and the cardroom and the readingroom and the drawingroom none of them was empty i went down a long wide corridor and at the end of it i came to the ballroom there were doubledoors leading into it and in front of the doors there was a large noticeboard on a stand the notice on the board said rspcc meeting strictly private this room is reserved for the annual meeting of the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to children the doubledoors into the room were open i peeped in it was a colossal room there were rows and rows of chairs all facing a platform the chairs were painted gold and they had little red cushions on the seats but there was not a soul in sight i sidled cautiously into the room what a lovely secret silent place it was the meeting of the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to children must have taken place earlier in the day and now they had all gone home even if they hadnt even if they did suddenly come pouring in they would be wonderful kind people who would look with favour upon a young mousetrainer going about his business at the back of the room there was a large folding screen with chinese dragons painted on it i decided just to be on the safe side to go behind this screen and do my training there i wasnt a bit frightened of the prevention of cruelty to children people but there was always a chance that mr stringer the manager might pop his head round the door if he did and if he saw the mice the poor things would be in the hallporters bucket of water before i could shout stop i tiptoed to the back of the room and settled myself on the thick green carpet behind the big screen what a splendid place this was ideal for mousetraining i took william and mary out of my trouserpockets they sat beside me on the carpet quiet and wellbehaved the trick i was going to teach them today was tightrope walking it is not all that difficult to train an intelligent mouse to be an expert tightrope walker provided you know exactly how to go about it first you must have a piece of string i had that then you must have some good cake a fine currant cake is the favourite food of white mice they are dotty about it i had brought with me a rock cake which i had pocketed while having tea with grandmamma the day before now heres what you do you stretch the string tight between your two hands but you start by keeping it very short only about three inches you put the mouse on your right hand and a little piece of cake on your left hand the mouse is therefore only three inches away from the cake he can see it and he can smell it his whiskers twitch with excitement he can almost reach the cake by leaning forward but not quite he only has to take two steps along the string to reach this tasty morsel he ventures forward one paw on the string then the other if the mouse has a good sense of balance and most of them have he will get across easily i started with william he walked the string without a moments hesitation i let him have a quick nibble of the cake just to whet his appetite then i put him back on my right hand this time i lengthened the string i made it about six inches long william knew what to do now with superb balance he walked step by step along the string until he reached the cake he was rewarded with another nibble quite soon william was walking a twentyfour inch tightrope from one hand to the other to reach the cake it was wonderful to watch him he was enjoying himself tremendously i was careful to hold the string near the carpet so that if he did lose his balance he wouldnt have far to fall but he never fell william was obviously a natural acrobat a great tightrope walking mouse now it was marys turn i put william on the carpet beside me and rewarded him with some extra crumbs and a currant then i started going through the same routine all over again with mary my blinding ambition you see my dream of dreams was to become one day the owner of a white mouse circus i would have a small stage with red curtains in front of it and when the curtains were drawn apart the audience would see my worldfamous performing mice walking on tightropes swinging from trapezes turning somersaults in the air bouncing on trampolines and all the rest of it i would have white mice riding on white rats and the rats would gallop furiously round and round the stage i was beginning to picture myself travelling firstclass all over the globe with my famous white mouse circus and performing before all the crowned heads of europe i was about halfway through marys training when suddenly i heard voices outside the ballroom door the sound grew louder it swelled into a great babble of speech from many throats i recognised the voice of the awful hotel manager mr stringer help i thought but thank heavens for the huge screen i crouched behind it and peered through the crack between two of the folding sections i could see the entire length and width of the ballroom without anyone seeing me well ladies i am sure you will be quite comfortable in here mr stringers voice was saying then in through the doubledoors he marched black tailcoat and all spreading his arms wide as he ushered in a great flock of ladies if there is anything we can do for you do not hesitate to let me know he went on tea will be served for all of you on the sunshine terrace after you have concluded your meeting with that he bowed and scraped himself out of the room as a vast herd of ladies from the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to children came streaming in they wore pretty clothes and all of them had hats on their heads the meeting now that the manager had gone i was not particularly alarmed what better than to be imprisoned in a room full of these splendid ladies if i ever got talking to them i might even suggest that they come and do a bit of crueltytochildren preventing at my school we could certainly use them there in they came talking their heads off they began milling round and choosing their seats and there was a whole lot of stuff like come and sit next to me millie dear and oh hello beatrice i havent seen you since the last meeting what an adorable dress you have on i decided to stay where i was and let them get on with their meeting while i got on with my mousetraining but i watched them for a while longer through the crack in the screen waiting for them to settle down how many were there i guessed about two hundred the back rows filled up first they all seemed to want to sit as far back from the platform as possible there was a lady wearing a tiny green hat in the middle of the back row who kept scratching the nape of her neck she couldnt leave it alone it fascinated me the way her fingers kept scratching away at the hair on the back of her neck had she known somebody was watching her from behind im sure she would have been embarrassed i wondered if she had dandruff all of a sudden i noticed that the lady next to her was doing the same thing and the next one and the next the whole lot of them were doing it they were all scratching away like mad at the hair on the backs of their necks did they have fleas in their hair more likely it was nits a boy at school called ashton had had nits in his hair last term and the matron had made him dip his whole head in turpentine it killed the nits all right but it nearly killed ashton as well half the skin came away from his scalp i began to be fascinated by these hairscratching ladies it is always funny when you catch someone doing something coarse and she thinks no one is looking nosepicking for example or scratching her bottom hairscratching is very nearly as unattractive especially if it goes on and on i decided it had to be nits then the most astonishing thing happened i saw one lady pushing her fingers up underneath the hair on her head and the hair the entire head of hair lifted upwards all in one piece and the hand slid underneath the hair and went on scratching she was wearing a wig she was also wearing gloves i glanced swiftly around at the rest of the now seated audience every one of them was wearing gloves my blood turned to ice i began to shake all over i glanced frantically behind me for a back door to escape through there wasnt one should i leap out from behind the screen and make a dash for the doubledoors those doubledoors were already closed and i could see a woman standing in front of them she was bending forward and fixing some sort of a metal chain round the two doorhandles keep still i told myself no one has seen you yet theres no reason in the world why they should come and look behind the screen but one false move one cough one sneeze one noseblow one little sound of any sort and it wont be just one witch that gets you itll be two hundred at that point i think i fainted the whole thing was altogether too much for a small boy to cope with but i dont believe i was out for more than a few seconds and when i came to i was lying on the carpet and i was still thank heavens behind the screen there was absolute silence all around me rather shakily i got to my knees and peered once again through the crack in the screen frizzled like a fritter all the women or rather the witches were now sitting motionless in their chairs and staring as though hypnotised at somebody who had suddenly appeared on the platform that somebody was another woman the first thing i noticed about this woman was her size she was tiny probably no more than four and a half feet tall she looked quite young i guessed about twentyfive or six and she was very pretty she had on a rather stylish long black dress that reached right to the ground and she wore black gloves that came up to her elbows unlike the others she wasnt wearing a hat she didnt look to me like a witch at all but she couldnt possibly not be one otherwise what on earth was she doing up there on the platform and why for heavens sake were all the other witches gazing at her with such a mixture of adoration awe and fear very slowly the young lady on the platform raised her hands to her face i saw her gloved fingers unhooking something behind her ears and then then she caught hold of her cheeks and lifted her face clean away the whole of that pretty face came away in her hands it was a mask as she took off the mask she turned sideways and placed it carefully upon a small table near by and when she turned round again and faced us i very nearly screamed out loud that face of hers was the most frightful and frightening thing i have ever seen just looking at it gave me the shakes all over it was so crumpled and wizened so shrunken and shrivelled it looked as though it had been pickled in vinegar it was a fearsome and ghastly sight there was something terribly wrong with it something foul and putrid and decayed it seemed quite literally to be rotting away at the edges and in the middle of the face around the mouth and cheeks i could see the skin all cankered and wormeaten as though maggots were working away in there there are times when something is so frightful you become mesmerised by it and cant look away i was like that now i was transfixed i was numbed i was magnetised by the sheer horror of this womans features but there was more to it than that there was a look of serpents in those eyes of hers as they flashed around the audience i knew immediately of course that this was none other than the grand high witch herself i knew also why she had worn a mask she could never have moved around in public let alone book in at an hotel with her real face everyone who saw her would have run away screaming the doors shouted the grand high witch in a voice that filled the room and bounced around the walls are they chained and bolted the doors are chained and bolted your grandness answered a voice in the audience the brilliant snakes eyes that were set so deep in that dreadful rotting wormeaten face glared unblinkingly at the witches who sat facing her you may rrreemoof your gloves she shouted her voice i noticed had that same hard metallic quality as the voice of the witch i had met under the conker tree only it was far louder and much much harsher it rasped it grated it snarled it scraped it shrieked and it growled everyone in the room was peeling off her gloves i was watching the hands of those in the back row i wanted very much to see what their fingers looked like and whether my grandmother had been right ah yes i could see several of them now i could see the brown claws curving over the tips of the fingers they were about two inches long those claws and sharp at the ends you may rrreemoof your shoes barked the grand high witch i heard a sigh of relief going up from all the witches in the room as they kicked off their narrow highheeled shoes and then i got a glimpse under the chairs of several pairs of stockinged feet square and completely toeless revolting they were as though the toes had been sliced away from the feet with a carvingknife you may rrreemoof your vigs snarled the grand high witch she had a peculiar way of speaking there was some sort of a foreign accent there something harsh and guttural and she seemed to have trouble pronouncing the letter w as well as that she did something funny with the letter r she would roll it round and round her mouth like a piece of hot porkcrackling before spitting it out rrreemoof your vigs and get some fresh air into your spotty scalps she shouted and another sigh of relief arose from the audience as all the hands went up to the heads and all the wigs were lifted away there now appeared in front of me row upon row of bald female heads a sea of naked scalps every one of them red and itchylooking from being rubbed by the linings of the wigs i simply cannot tell you how awful they were and somehow the whole sight was made more grotesque because underneath those frightful scabby bald heads the bodies were dressed in fashionable and rather pretty clothes it was monstrous it was unnatural oh heavens i thought oh help oh lord have mercy on me these foul baldheaded females are childkillers every one of them and here i am imprisoned in the same room and i cant escape at that point a new and doubly horrifying thought struck me my grandmother had said that with their special noseholes they could smell out a child on a pitchblack night from right across the other side of the road up to now my grandmother had been right every time it seemed a certainty therefore that one of the witches in the back row was going to sniff me out at any moment and then the yell of dogs droppings would go up all over the room and i would be cornered like a rat i knelt on the carpet behind the screen hardly daring to breathe then suddenly i remembered another very important thing my grandmother had told me the dirtier you are she had said the harder it is for a witch to smell you out how long since i had last had a bath not for ages i had my own room in the hotel and my grandmother never bothered with silly things like that come to think of it i dont believe id had a bath since we arrived when had i last washed my hands or face certainly not this morning not yesterday either i glanced down at my hands they were covered with smudge and mud and goodness knows what else besides so perhaps i had a chance after all the stinkwaves couldnt possibly get out through all that dirt vitches of inkland shouted the grand high witch she herself i noticed had not taken off either her wig or her gloves or her shoes vitches of inkland she yelled the audience stirred uneasily and sat up straighter in their chairs miserrrable vitches she yelled useless lazy vitches feeble frrribbling vitches you are a heap of idle goodfornothing vurms a shudder went through the audience the grand high witch was clearly in an ugly mood and they knew it i had a feeling that something awful was going to happen soon i am having my breakfast this morning cried the grand high witch and i am looking out of the vindow at the beach and vot am i seeing i am asking you vot am i seeing i am seeing a rrreevolting sight i am seeing hundreds i am seeing thousands of rrrotten rrreepulsive little children playing on the sand it is putting me rrright off my food vye have you not got rrrid of them she screamed vye have you not rrrubbed them all out these filthy smelly children with each word she spoke flecks of paleblue phlegm shot from her mouth like little bullets i am asking you vye she screamed nobody answered her question children smell she screamed they stink out the vurld vee do not vont these children around here the bald heads in the audience all nodded vigorously vun child a veek is no good to me the grand high witch cried out is that the best you can do we will do better murmured the audience we will do much better better is no good either shrieked the grand high witch i demand maximum rrreesults so here are my orders my orders are that every single child in this country shall be rrrubbed out sqvashed sqvirted sqvittered and frrrittered before i come here again in vun years time do i make myself clear a great gasp went up from the audience i saw the witches all looking at one another with deeply troubled expressions and i heard one witch at the end of the front row saying aloud all of them we cant possibly wipe out all of them the grand high witch whipped round as though someone had stuck a skewer into her bottom who said that she snapped who dares to argue vith me it vos you vos it not she pointed a gloved finger as sharp as a needle at the witch who had spoken i didnt mean it your grandness the witch cried out i didnt mean to argue i was just talking to myself you dared to argue vith me screamed the grand high witch i was just talking to myself cried the wretched witch i swear it your grandness she began to shake with fear the grand high witch took a quick step forward and when she spoke again it was in a voice that made my blood run cold a stupid vitch who answers back must burn until her bones are black she screamed no no begged the witch in the front row the grand high witch went on a foolish vitch vithout a brain must sizzle in the fiery flame save me cried the wretched witch in the front row the grand high witch took no notice of her she spoke again an idiotic vitch like you must rrroast upon the barbecue forgive me o your grandness cried the miserable culprit i didnt mean it but the grand high witch continued with her terrible recital a vitch who dares to say im wrrrong vill not be vith us very long a moment later a stream of sparks that looked like tiny whitehot metalfilings came shooting out of the grand high witchs eyes and flew straight towards the one who had dared to speak i saw the sparks striking against her and burrowing into her and she screamed a horrible howling scream and a puff of smoke rose up around her a smell of burning meat filled the room nobody moved like me they were all watching the smoke and when it had cleared away the chair was empty i caught a glimpse of something wispywhite like a little cloud fluttering upwards and disappearing out of the window a great sigh rose up from the audience the grand high witch glared around the room i hope nobody else is going to make me cross today she remarked there was a deathly silence frrrizzled like a frrritter said the grand high witch cooked like a carrot you vill never see her again now vee can get down to business formula delayed action mousemaker children are rrreevolting screamed the grand high witch vee vill vipe them all avay vee vill scrrrub them off the face of the earth vee vill flush them down the drain yes yes chanted the audience wipe them away scrub them off the earth flush them down the drain children are foul and filthy thundered the grand high witch they are they are chorused the english witches they are foul and filthy children are dirty and stinky screamed the grand high witch dirty and stinky cried the audience getting more and more worked up children are smelling of dogs drrroppings screeched the grand high witch pooooooo cried the audience pooooooo pooooooo pooooooo they are vurse than dogs drrroppings screeched the grand high witch dogs drrroppings is smelling like violets and prrrimroses compared vith children violets and primroses chanted the audience they were clapping and cheering almost every word spoken from the platform the speaker seemed to have them completely under her spell to talk about children is making me sick screamed the grand high witch i am feeling sick even thinking about them fetch me a basin the grand high witch paused and glared at the mass of eager faces in the audience they waited wanting more so now barked the grand high witch so now i am having a plan i am having a giganticus plan for getting rrrid of every single child in the whole of inkland the witches gasped they gaped they turned and gave each other ghoulish grins of excitement yes thundered the grand high witch vee shall svish them and svollop them and vee shall make to disappear every single smelly little brrrat in inkland in vun strrroke whoopee cried the witches clapping their hands you are brilliant o your grandness you are fantabulous shut up and listen snapped the grand high witch

and crrrisp and all of them she added with a fiendish leer all of them homemade the witches in the audience grinned appreciating this joke at that point one foolish witch got so excited at the possibilities presented by owning a sweetshop that she leapt to her feet and shouted the children will come flocking to my shop and i will feed them poisoned sweets and poisoned chocs and wipe them all out like weasels the room became suddenly silent i saw the tiny body of the grand high witch stiffen and then go rigid with rage who spoke she shrieked it vos you you over there the culprit sat down fast and covered her face with her clawed hands you blithering bumpkin screeched the grand high witch you brrrainless bogvumper are you not rrreealising that if you are going rrround poisoning little children you vill be caught in five minutes flat never in my life am i hearing such a boshvolloping suggestion coming from a vitch the entire audience cowered and shook im quite sure they all

witch then it is no vunder inkland is still svorming vith rrrotten little children there was another silence the grand high witch glared at the witches in the audience do you not know she shouted at them that vee witches are vurrrking only with magic we know your grandness they all answered of course we know the grand high witch grated her bony gloved hands against each other and cried out so each of you is owning a magnificent sweetshop the next move is that each of you will be announcing in the window of your shop that on a certain day you will be having a great gala opening with frree sweets and chocs to every child that will bring them in the greedy little brutes cried the audience theyll be fighting to get through the doors next continued the grand high witch you will prepare

platform stamping her feet and clapping her hands the entire audience joined in the clapping and the footstamping they were making such a tremendous racket that i thought surely mr stringer would hear it and come banging at the door but he didnt then above all the noise i heard the voice of the grand high witch screaming out some sort of an awful gloating song down vith children do them in boil their bones and fry their skin bish them sqvish them bash them mash them brrreak them shake them slash them smash them offer chocs vith magic powder say eat up then say it louder crrram them full of

the screen on my hands and knees with one eye glued to the crack i dont know how long i had been there but it seemed like for ever the worst part of it was not being allowed to cough or make a sound and knowing that if i did i was as good as dead and all the way through i was living in constant terror that one of the witches in the back row was going to get a whiff of my presence through those special noseholes of hers my only hope as i saw it was the fact that i hadnt washed for days that and the neverending excitement and clapping and shouting that was going on in the room the witches were thinking of nothing except the grand high witch up there on the platform and her great plan for wiping out all the children of england they certainly werent sniffing around for a child in the room in their wildest dreams that would never have occurred to any of them i kept still and prayed the grand high witchs dreadful gloating song was over now and the audience was clapping madly and shouting brilliant sensational marvellous you are a genius o brainy one it is a thrilling invention this delayed action mousemaker it is a winner and the beauty of it is that the teachers will be the ones who bump off the stinking little children it wont be us doing it we shall never be caught vitches are never caught snapped the grand high witch attention now i vont everybodys attention for i am about to be telling you vot you must do to prepare formula delayed action mousemaker suddenly there came a great gasp from the audience this was followed by a hubbub of shrieking and yelling and i saw many of the witches leaping to their feet and pointing at the platform and crying out mice mice mice shes done it to show us the brainy one has turned two children into mice and there they are i looked toward the platform the mice were there all right two of them running around near the grand high witchs skirts but these were not field mice or house mice or wood mice or harvest mice they were white mice i recognised them immediately as being my own little william and mary mice shouted the audience our leader has made mice to appear out of nowhere get the mousetraps fetch the cheese i saw the grand high witch peering down at the floor and staring with obvious puzzlement at william and mary she bent lower to get a closer look then she straightened up and shouted qviet the audience became silent and sat down these mice are nothing to do vith me she shouted these mice are pet mice these mice are qvite obviously belonging to some rrreepellent little child in the hotel a boy it vill be for a certainty because girls are not keeping pet mice a boy cried the witches a filthy smelly little boy well swipe him well swizzle him well have his tripes for breakfast silence shouted the grand high witch raising her hands you know perrrfectly vell you must do nothing to drrraw attention to yourselves vhile you are living in the hotel let us by all means get rrrid of this evilsmelling little sqvirt but vee must do it as qvietly as possible for are vee not all of us the most rrreespectable ladies of the rrroyal society for the prrreevention of crrruelty to children what do you suggest then o brainy one they cried out how shall we dispose of this small pile of filth theyre talking about me i thought these females are actually talking about how to kill me i began to sweat whoever he is he is not important announced the grand high witch leave him to me i shall smell him out and turn him into a mackerel and have him dished up for supper bravo cried the witches cut off his head and chop off his tail and fry him in hot butter you can imagine that none of this was making me feel very comfortable william and mary were still running around on the platform and i saw the grand high witch aim a swift running kick at william she caught him right on the point of her toe and sent him flying she did the same to mary her aim was extraordinary she would have made a great football player both mice crashed against the wall and for a few moments they lay stunned then they got to their feet and scampered away attention again the grand high witch was shouting i vill now give to you the rrrecipe for concocting formula delayed action mousemaker get out pencils and paper handbags were opened all over the room and notebooks were fished out give us the recipe o brainy one cried the audience impatiently tell us the secret first said the grand high witch i had to find something that vould cause the children to become very small very qvickly and what was that cried the audience that part vos simple said the grand high witch all you have to do if you are vishing to make a child very small is to look at him through the wrrrong end of a telescope shes a wonder cried the audience who else would have thought of a thing like that so you take the wrrrong end of a telescope continued the grand high witch and you boil it until it gets soft how long does that take they asked her tventyvun hours of boiling answered the grand high witch and vhile this is going on you take exactly fortyfive brrrown mice and you chop off their tails vith a carvingknife and you fry the tails in hairoil until they are nice and crrrisp what do we do with all those mice who have had their tails chopped off asked the audience you simmer them in frogjuice for vun hour came the answer but listen to me so far i have only given you the easy part of the rrrecipe the rrreally difficult problem is to put in something that vill have a genuine delayed action rrreesult something that can be eaten by children on a certain day but vhich vill not start vurrrking on them until nine oclock the next morning vhen they arrive at school what did you come up with o brainy one they called out tell us the great secret the secret announced the grand high witch triumphantly is an alarmclock an alarmclock they cried its a stroke of genius of course it is said the grand high witch you can set a tventyfourhour alarmclock today and at exactly nine oclock tomorrow it vill go off but we will need five million alarmclocks cried the audience we will need one for each child idiots shouted the grand high witch if you are vonting a steak you do not cook the whole cow it is the same vith alarmclocks vun clock vill make enough for a thousand children here is vhat you do you set your alarmclock to go off at nine oclock tomorrow morning then you rrroast it in the oven until it is crrrisp and tender are you wrrriting this down we are your grandness we are they cried next said the grand high witch you take your boiled telescope and your frrried mousetails and your cooked mice and your rrroasted alarm clock and all together you put them into the mixer then you mix them at full speed this vill give you a nice thick paste vhile the mixer is still mixing you must add to it the yolk of vun grrruntles egg a gruntles egg cried the audience we shall do that underneath all the clamour that was going on i heard one witch in the back row saying to her neighbour im getting a bit old to go birds nesting those ruddy gruntles always nest very high up so you mix in the egg the grand high witch went on and vun after the other you also mix in the following items the claw of a crrrabcrrruncher the beak of a blabbersnitch the snout of a grrrobblesqvirt and the tongue of a catsprrringer i trust you are not having any trrrouble finding those none at all they cried out we will spear the blabbersnitch and trap the crabcruncher and shoot the grobblesquirt and catch the catspringer in his burrow excellent said the grand high witch vhen you have mixed everything together in the mixer you vill have a most marvellouslooking grrreen liqvid put vun drop just vun titchy droplet of this liqvid into a chocolate or a sveet and at nine oclock the next morning the child who ate it vill turn into a mouse in tventysix seconds but vun vurd of vorning never increase the dose never put more than vun drrrop into each sveet or chocolate and never give more than vun sweet or chocolate to each child an overdose of delayed action mousemaker vill mess up the timing of the alarmclock and cause the child to turn into a mouse too early a large overdose might even have an instant effect and you vouldnt vont that vould you you vouldnt vont the children turning into mice rrright there in your sveetshops that vould give the game away so be very carrreful do not overdose bruno jenkins disappears the grand high witch was starting to talk again i am now going to prrrove to you she said that this rrrecipe is vurrrking to perrrfection you understand of course that you can set the alarmclock to go off at any time you like it does not have to be nine oclock so yesterday i am personally prrreeparing a small qvantity of the magic formula in order to give to you a public demonstration but i am making vun small change in the rrrecipe before i am rrroasting the alarmclock i am setting it to go off not at nine oclock the next morning but at halfpast thrrree the next afternoon vhich means halfpast thrrree this afternoon and that she said glancing at her wristwatch is in prrreecisely seven minutes time the audience of witches was listening intently sensing that something dramatic was about to happen so vot am i doing yesterday vith this magic liqvid asked the grand high witch i vill tell you vot i am doing i am putting vun drrroplet of it into a very sqvishy chocolate bar and i am giving this bar to a rrreepulsive smelly little boy who is hanging rrround the lobby of the hotel the grand high witch paused the audience remained silent waiting for her to go on i votched this rrreepulsive little brrrute gobbling up the sqvishy bar of chocolate and vhen he had finished i said to him vos that good he said it vos great so i said to him would you like some more and he said yes so i said i vill give you six more chocolate bars like that if you vill meet me in the ballroom of this hotel at tventyfivepast thrrree tomorrow afternoon six bars cried this greedy little svine ill be there you bet ill be there so the stage is set shouted the grand high witch the prrroof of the pudding is about to begin do not forget that before i am rrroasting the alarmclock yesterday i am setting it for halfpast thrrree today it is now she glanced again at her watch it is now exactly tventyfive minutes past thrrree and the nasty little stinker who vill be turning into a mouse in five minutes time should at this very moment be standing outside the doors and by gum she was absolutely right the boy whoever he might be was already rattling the doorhandle and banging on the doors with his fist qvick shrieked the grand high witch put on your vigs put on your gloves put on your shoes there was a great rustle and bustle of putting on wigs and gloves and shoes and i saw the grand high witch herself reach for her facemask and put it on over that revolting face of hers it was astonishing how that mask transformed her all of a sudden she became once again a rather pretty young lady let me in came the boys voice from behind the doors where are those chocolate bars you promised me im here to collect dish them out he is not only smelly he is also grrreedy said the grand high witch rrreemoof the chains from the doors and let him come in the extraordinary thing about the mask was that its lips moved quite naturally when she spoke you really couldnt see it was a mask at all one of the witches leapt to her feet and unfastened the chains she opened the two huge doors then i heard her saying why hello little man how lovely to see you you have come for your chocolate bars have you not they are all ready for you do come in a small boy wearing a white teeshirt and grey shorts and gymshoes entered the room i recognised him at once he was called bruno jenkins and he was staying in the hotel with his parents i didnt care for him he was one of those boys who is always eating something whenever you meet him meet him in the hotel lobby and he is stuffing sponge cake into his mouth pass him in the corridor and he is fishing potato crisps out of a bag by the fistful catch sight of him in the hotel garden and he is wolfing a dairy milk bar and has two more sticking out of his trouserpocket whats more bruno never stopped boasting about how his father made more money than my father and that they owned three cars but worse than that yesterday morning i had found him kneeling on the flagstones of the hotel terrace with a magnifyingglass in his hand there was a column of ants marching across one of the flagstones and bruno jenkins was focusing the sun through his magnifyingglass and roasting the ants one by one i like watching them burn he said thats horrible i cried stop doing it lets see you stop me he said at that point i had pushed him with all my might and he had crashed sideways on to the flagstones his magnifyingglass had splintered into many pieces and he had leapt up shrieking my father is going to get you for this then he had run off presumably to find his wealthy dad that was the last time i had seen bruno jerkins until now i doubted very much that he was about to be turned into a mouse although i must confess that i was secretly hoping it might happen either way i didnt envy him being up there in front of all those witches darling boy cooed the grand high witch from up on the platform i have your chocolates all rrready for you do come up here firrrst and say hello to all these lovely ladies her voice was quite different now it was soft and gentle and absolutely dripping with syrup bruno was looking a bit bewildered but he allowed himself to be led up on to the platform where he stood beside the grand high witch and said okay where are my six bars of chocolate i saw the witch who had let him in quietly putting the chain back on the doorhandles bruno didnt notice this he was too busy asking for his chocolate the time is now vun minute before halfpast thrrree announced the grand high witch what the hecks going on bruno asked he wasnt frightened but he wasnt looking exactly comfortable either what is this he said gimme my chocolate thirty seconds to go cried the grand high witch gripping bruno by the arm bruno shook himself clear and stared at her she stared back at him smiling with the lips of her mask every witch in the audience was staring at bruno tventy seconds cried the grand high witch gimme the chocolate shouted bruno becoming suddenly suspicious gimme the chocolate and let me out of here fifteen seconds cried the grand high witch will one of you crazy punks kindly tell me what all this is about shouted bruno ten seconds cried the grand high witch nine eight seven six five four thrrree two vun zero vee have ignition i could have sworn i heard an alarmclock ringing i saw bruno jump he jumped as though someone had stuck a hatpin deep into his bottom and he yelled ow he jumped so high that he landed on a small table up there on the stage and he started hopping about on the top of this table waving his arms and yelling his head off then suddenly he became silent his whole body stiffened the alarm has gone off shrieked the grand high witch the mousemaker is beginning to vurrrk she started hopping about on the platform and clapping her gloved hands together and then she shouted out this smelly brrrat this filthy scum this horrid little louse vill very very soon become a lovely little mouse bruno was getting smaller by the second i could see him shrinking now his clothes seemed to be disappearing and brown fur was growing all over his body suddenly he had a tail and then he had whiskers now he had four feet it was all happening so quickly it was a matter of seconds only and all at once he wasnt there any more a small brown mouse was running around on the table top bravo yelled the audience shes done it it works its fantastic its colossal its the greatest yet you are a miracle o brainy one they were all standing up and clapping and cheering and the grand high witch produced a mousetrap from the folds of her dress and started to set it oh no i thought i dont want to see this bruno jenkins may have been a bit of a stinker but im dashed if i want to watch him having his head chopped off there is he snapped the grand high witch searching the platform vhere has that mouse got to she couldnt find him clever bruno must have jumped down off the table and scampered off into some corner or even down a small hole thank heavens for that it matters not shouted the grand high witch silence and sit down the ancient ones the grand high witch stood on the very centre of the platform and those dangerous eyes of hers travelled slowly around the audience of witches who were sitting so meekly before her all those over seventy put up your hands she barked suddenly seven or eight hands went up in the air it comes to me said the grand high witch that you ancient vuns vill not be able to climb high trrrees in search of grrruntles eggs we wont your grandness we are afraid we wont chanted the ancient ones nor vill you be able to catch the crrrabcrrruncher who lives high up on rrrocky cliffs the grand high witch went on i cant exactly see you sprrrinting after the speedy catsprrringer either or diving into deep vorters to spear the blabbersnitch or striding the bleak moors vith a gun under your arm to shoot the grrrobblesqvirt you are too old and feeble for those things we are chanted the ancient ones we are we are you ancient vuns have served me vell over many years said the grand high witch and i do not vish to deny you the pleasure of bumping off a few thousand children each just because you have become old and feeble i have therefore prepared personally vith my own hands a limited quantity of delayed action mousemaker which i will distrrribute to the ancient vuns before you leave the hotel oh thank you thank you cried the old witches you are far too good to us your grandness you are so kind and thoughtful here is a sample of vot i am giving you shouted the grand high witch she fished around in a pocket of her dress and brought out a very small bottle she held it up and shouted in this tiny bottle is five hundred doses of mousemaker is enough to turrrn five hundred children into mice i could see that the bottle was made of darkblue glass and that it was very small about the same size as the ones you can buy at the chemist with nosedrops in them each of you ancient vuns vill get two of these bottles she shouted thank you thank you o most generous and thoughtful one chorused the ancient witches not one drop will be wasted each of us will promise to squish and squallop and squiggle one thousand children our meeting is over announced the grand high witch here is the timetable for the rrreemainder of your stay in this hotel rrright now vee must all go out on to the sunshine terrace and have tea vith that rrridiculous manager next at six

everything clear any questions i have one question your grandness said a voice in the audience what happens if one of the chocolates we are giving away in our shops gets eaten by a grownup thats just too bad for the grrrownup said the grand high witch this meeting is over she shouted out you go the witches stood up and began gathering their things together i was watching them through the crack and hoping to heaven they would hurry up and leave so that i might be safe at last wait shrieked one of the witches in the back row hold everything her shrieking voice echoed through the ballroom like a trumpet all the witches suddenly stopped and turned and looked towards the speaker she was one of the taller witches and i could see her standing there with her head tilted back and her nose in the air and she was sucking in great long breaths of air through those curvy pink seashelly nostrils of hers wait she shouted again what is it the others cried out dogs droppings she yelled just then i got a whiff of dogs droppings surely not the others shouted there couldnt be yes yes shouted the first witch there it is again its not strong but its there i mean its here its definitely somewhere not too far away vots going on down there shouted the grand high witch glaring down from the platform mildreds just got a whiff of dogs droppings your grandness someone called back to her vot rrrubbish is this shouted the grand high witch she has dogs drrroppings on the brain there are no children in this rrroom hang on cried the witch called mildred hang on everybody dont move im getting it again her huge curvy noseholes were waving in and out like a pair of fishtails its getting stronger its hitting me harder now cant the rest of you smell it all the noses of all the witches in that room went up in the air and all the nostrils began to suck and sniff shes right cried another voice shes absolutely right dogs droppings it is strong and foul in a matter of seconds the entire assembly of witches had taken up the dreaded cry of dogs droppings dogs droppings they shouted the room is full of it poo pooooooooooooooo why did we not smell it before it stinks like a sewer some little swine must be hiding not so very far away from here find it screamed the grand high witch trrrack it down rrrootle it out follow your noses till you get it the hairs on my head were standing up like the bristles of a nailbrush and a cold sweat was breaking out all over me rrrootle it out this small lump of dung screeched the grand high witch dont let it escape if it is in here it has observed the most secret things it must be exterrrminated immediately metamorphosis i remember thinking to myself there is no escape for me now even if i make a run for it and manage to dodge the lot of them i still wont get out because the doors are chained and locked im finished im done for oh grandmamma what are they going to do to me i looked round and i saw a hideous painted and powdered witchs face staring down at me and the face opened its mouth and yelled triumphantly its here its behind the screen come and get it the witch reached out a gloved hand and grabbed me by the hair but i twisted free and jumped away i ran oh how i ran the sheer terror of it all put wings on my feet i flew around the outside of the great ballroom and not one of them had a chance of catching me as i came level with the doors i paused and tried to open them but the big chain was on them and they didnt even rattle the witches were not bothering to chase me they simply stood there in small groups watching me and knowing for certain that there was no way i could escape several of them were holding their noses with gloved fingers and there were cries of poo what a stink we cant stand this much longer catch it then you idiots screamed the grand high witch from up on the platform sprrread out in a line across the room and close in on it and grab it corner this filthy little gumboil and seize it and bring it up here to me the witches spread out as they were told they advanced towards me some from one end some from the other and some came down the middle between the rows of empty chairs they were bound to get me now they had me cornered from sheer and absolute terror i began to scream help i screamed turning my head towards the doors in the hope that somebody outside might hear me help help hellllp get it shouted the grand high witch grrrab hold of it stop it yelling they rushed at me then and about five of them grabbed me by the arms and legs and lifted me clear off the ground i went on screaming but one of them clapped a gloved hand over my mouth and that stopped me baring it here shouted the grand high witch brrring the spying little vurm up here to me i was carried on to the platform with my arms and legs held tight by many hands and i lay there suspended in the air facing the ceiling i saw the grand high witch standing over me grinning at me in the most horrible way she held up the small blue bottle of mousemaker and she said now for a little medicine hold his nose to make him open his mouth strong fingers pinched my nose i kept my mouth closed tight and held my breath but i couldnt do it for long my chest was bursting i opened my mouth to get one big quick breath of air and as i did so the grand high witch poured the entire contents of the little bottle down my throat oh the pain and the fire it felt as though a kettleful of boiling water had been poured into my mouth my throat was going up in flames then very quickly the frightful burning searing scorching feeling started spreading down into my chest and into my tummy and on and on into my arms and legs and all over my body i screamed and screamed but once again the gloved hand was clapped over my lips the next thing i felt was my skin beginning to tighten how else can i describe it it was quite literally a tightening and a shrinking of the skin all over my body from the top of my head to the tips of my fingers to the ends of my toes i felt as though i was a balloon and somebody was twisting the top of the balloon and twisting and twisting and the balloon was getting smaller and smaller and the skin was getting tighter and tighter and soon it was going to burst then the squeezing began this time i was inside a suit of iron and somebody was turning a screw and with each turn of the screw the iron suit became smaller and smaller so that i was squeezed like an orange into a pulpy mess with the juice running out of my sides after that there came a fierce prickling sensation all over my skin as though tiny needles were forcing their way out through the surface of the skin from the inside and this i realise now was the growing of the mousefur far away in the distance i heard the voice of the grand high witch yelling five hundred doses this stinking little carbuncle has had five hundred doses and the alarmclock has been smashed and now vee are having instantaneous action i heard clapping and cheering and i remember thinking i am not myself any longer i have gone clear out of my own skin i noticed that the floor was only an inch from my nose i noticed also a pair of little furry front paws resting on the floor i was able to move those paws they were mine at that moment i realised that i was not a little boy any longer i was a mouse now for the mousetrrrap i heard the grand high witch yelling ive got it right here and heres a piece of cheese but i wasnt going to wait for that i was off across the platform like a streak of lightning i was astonished at my own speed i leapt over witches feet right and left and in no time at all i was down the steps and on to the floor of the ballroom itself and skittering off among the rows of chairs what i especially liked was the fact that i made no sound at all as i ran i was a swift and silent mover and quite amazingly the pain had all gone now i was feeling quite remarkably well it is not a bad thing after all i thought to myself to be tiny as well as speedy when there is a bunch of dangerous females after your blood i selected the back leg of a chair and squeezed up against it and kept very still in the distance the grand high witch was shouting leave the little stinkpot alone it is not vurth bothering about it is only a mouse now somebody else vill soon catch it let us get out of here the meeting is over unlock the doors and shove off to the sunshine terrace to have tea vith that idiotic manager bruno i peeped round the leg of the chair and watched the hundreds of witches feet walking out through the doors of the ballroom when they had all gone and the place was absolutely silent i began to move cautiously about on the floor suddenly i remembered bruno he must surely be around here somewhere too bruno i called out i wasnt seriously expecting that i would be able to speak at all now that i had become a mouse so i got the shock of my life when i heard my own voice my own perfectly normal rather loud voice coming out of my tiny mouth it was wonderful i was thrilled i tried it again bruno jenkins where are you i called out if you can hear me give a shout my voice was exactly the same and just as loud as it had been when i was a boy hey there bruno jenkins i called where are you there was no answer i pottered about between the seatlegs trying to get used to being so close to the ground i decided i rather liked it you are probably wondering why i wasnt depressed at all i found myself thinking whats so wonderful about being a little boy anyway why is that necessarily any better than being a mouse i know that mice get hunted and they sometimes get poisoned or caught in traps but little boys sometimes get killed too little boys can be run over by motorcars or they can die of some awful illness little boys have to go to school mice dont mice dont have to pass exams mice dont have to worry about money mice as far as i can see have only two enemies humans and cats my grandmother is a human but i know for certain that she will always love me whoever i am and she never thank goodness keeps a cat when mice grow up they dont ever have to go to war and fight against other mice mice i felt pretty certain all like each other people dont yes i told myself i dont think it is at all a bad thing to be a mouse i was wandering around the ballroom floor thinking about all this when i spotted another mouse it was crouching on the floor holding a piece of bread in its front paws and nibbling away at it with great gusto it had to be bruno hello bruno i said he glanced up at me for about two seconds then went right on guzzling what have you found i asked him one of them dropped it he answered its a fishpaste sandwich pretty good he too spoke with a perfectly normal voice one would have expected that a mouse would do so with the smallest and squeakiest voice you could imagine it was terrifically funny to hear the voice of the rather loudmouthed bruno coming out of that tiny mouses throat listen bruno i said now that we are both mice i think we ought to start thinking a bit about the future he stopped eating and stared at me with small black eyes what do you mean we he said the fact that youre a mouse has nothing to do with me but youre a mouse too bruno dont be a fool he said im not a mouse im afraid you are bruno i most certainly am not he shouted why are you insulting me i havent been rude to you why do you call me a mouse dont you know whats happened to you i said what on earth are you talking about bruno said i have to inform you i said that not very long ago the witches turned you into a mouse then they did it to me youre lying he cried im not a mouse if you hadnt been so busy guzzling that sandwich i said you would have noticed your hairy paws take a look at them bruno looked down at his paws he jumped good grief he cried i am a mouse you wait till my father hears about this he may think its an improvement i said i dont want to be a mouse bruno shouted jumping up and down i refuse to be a mouse im bruno jenkins there are worse things than being a mouse i said you can live in a hole i dont want to live in a hole bruno shouted and you can creep into the larder at night i said and nibble through all the packets of raisins and cornflakes and chocolate biscuits and everything else you can find you can stay there all night eating yourself silly thats what mice do now thats a thought bruno said perking up a bit but how am i going to open the door of the fridge to get at the cold chicken and all the leftovers thats something i do every evening at home maybe your rich father will get you a special little mousefridge all to yourself i said one that you can open you say a witch did this to me bruno said which witch the one who gave you the chocolate bar in the hotel lobby yesterday i told him dont you remember the filthy old cow he shouted ill get her for this where is she who is she forget it i said you dont have a hope your biggest problem at the moment is your parents how are they going to take this will they treat you with sympathy and kindness bruno considered this for a moment i think he said that my father is going to be a bit put out and your mother shes terrified of mice bruno said then youve got a problem havent you why only me he said what about you my grandmother will understand perfectly i saidshe knows all about witches bruno took another bite of his sandwich what do you suggest he said i suggest we both go first of all and consult my grandmother i said shell know exactly what to do i moved towards the doors which were standing open bruno still grasping part of the sandwich in one paw followed after me when we get out into the corridor i said were going to run like mad stick close to the wall all the way and follow me do not talk and do not let anyone see you dont forget that just about anyone who catches sight of you will try to kill you i snatched the sandwich out of his paw and threw it away here goes i said keep behind me hello grandmamma as soon as i was out of the ballroom i took off like a flash i streaked down the corridor went through the lounge and the readingroom and the library and the drawingroom and came to the stairs up the stairs i went jumping quite easily from one to the other keeping well in against the wall all the time are you with me bruno i whispered right here he said my grandmothers room and my own were on the fifth floor it was quite a climb but we made it without meeting a single person on the way because everyone was using the lift on the fifth floor i raced along the corridor to the door of my grandmothers room a pair of her shoes was standing outside the door to be cleaned bruno was alongside me what do we do now he said suddenly i caught sight of a chambermaid coming along the corridor towards us i saw at once that she was the one who had reported me to the manager for keeping white mice not therefore the sort of person i wanted to meet in my present condition quick i said to bruno hide in one of those shoes i hopped into one shoe and bruno hopped into the other i waited for the maid to walk past us she didnt when she came to the shoes she bent down and picked them up in doing this she put her hand right inside the one i was hiding in when one of her fingers touched me i bit it it was a silly thing to do but i did it instinctively without thinking the maid let out a scream that must have been heard by ships far out in the english channel and she dropped the shoes and ran like the wind down the corridor my grandmothers door opened what on earth is going on out here she said i darted between her legs into her room and bruno followed me close the door grandmamma i cried please hurry she looked around and saw two small brown mice on the carpet please close it i said and this time she actually saw me talking and recognised my voice she froze and became absolutely motionless every part of her body her fingers and hands and arms and head became suddenly as stiff as a marble statue her face turned even paler than marble and her eyes were stretched so wide i could see the whites all around them then she started to tremble i thought she was going to faint and fall over please close the door quickly grandmamma i said that awful maid might come in she somehow managed to gather herself together enough to close the door she leaned against it staring down at me whitefaced and shaking all over i saw tears beginning to come out of her eyes and go dribbling down her cheeks dont cry grandmamma i said things could be a lot worse i did get away from them im still alive so is bruno very slowly she bent down and picked me up with one hand then she picked bruno up with the other hand and put us both on the table there was a bowl of bananas in the centre of the table and bruno jumped straight into it and began tearing away with his teeth at one of the banana skins to get at the fruit inside my grandmother grasped the arm of her chair to steady herself but her eyes never left me sit down dear grandmamma i said she collapsed into her chair oh my darling she murmured and now the tears were really streaming down her cheeks oh my poor sweet darling what have they done to you i know what theyve done grandmamma and i know what i am but the funny thing is that i dont honestly feel especially bad about it i dont even feel angry in fact i feel rather good i know im not a boy any longer and i never will be again but ill be quite all right as long as theres always you to look after me i was not just trying to console her i was being absolutely honest about the way i felt you may think it odd that i wasnt weeping myself it was odd i simply cant explain it of course ill look after you my grandmother murmured who is the other one that was a boy called bruno jenkins i told her they got him first my grandmother took a new long black cigar out of a case in her handbag and put it in her mouth then she got out a box of matches she struck a match but her fingers were shaking so much that the flame kept missing the end of the cigar when she got it lit at last she took a long pull and sucked in the smoke that seemed to calm her down a bit where did it happen she whispered where is the witch now is she in the hotel grandmamma i said it wasnt just one it was hundreds theyre all over the place theyre right here in the hotel this very moment she leant forward and stared at me you dont mean you dont actually mean you dont mean to tell me theyre holding the annual meeting right here in the hotel theyve held it grandmamma its finished i heard it all and all of them including the grand high witch herself are downstairs now theyre pretending theyre the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to children theyre all having tea with the manager and they caught you they smelt me out i said dogs droppings was it she said sighing im afraid so but it wasnt strong they very nearly didnt smell me because i hadnt had a bath for ages children should never have baths my grandmother said its a dangerous habit i agree grandmamma she paused sucking at her cigar do you really mean to tell me that they are now all downstairs having tea she said im certain of it grandmamma there was another pause i could see the old glint of excitement slowly coming back into my grandmothers eyes and all of a sudden she sat up very straight in her chair and said sharply tell me everything right from the beginning and please hurry i took a deep breath and began to talk i told about going to the ballroom and hiding behind the screen to do my mousetraining i told about the notice saying royal society for the prevention of cruelty to children i told her all about the women coming in and sitting down and about the small woman who appeared on the stage and took off her mask but when it came to describing what her face looked like underneath the mask i simply couldnt find the right words it was horrible grandmamma i said oh it was so horrible it was it was like something that was going rotten go on my grandmother said dont stop then i told her about all the others taking off their wigs and their gloves and their shoes and how i saw before me a sea of bald pimply heads and how the womens fingers had little claws and how their feet had no toes my grandmother had come forward now in her armchair so that she was sitting right on the edge of it both her hands were cupped over the gold knob of the stick that she always used when walking and she was staring at me with eyes as bright as two stars then i told her how the grand high witch had shot out the fiery whitehot sparks and how they had turned one of the other witches into a puff of smoke ive heard about that my grandmother cried out excitedly but i never quite believed it you are the first nonwitch ever to see it happening it is the grand high witchs most famous punishment it is known as getting fried and all the other witches are petrified of having it done to them i am told that the grand high witch makes it a rule to fry at least one witch at each annual meeting she does it in order to keep the rest of them on their toes but they dont have any toes grandmamma i know they dont my darling but please go on so then i told my grandmother about the delayed action mousemaker and when i came to the bit about turning all the children of england into mice she actually leapt out of her chair shouting i knew it i knew they were brewing up something tremendous weve got to stop them i said she turned and stared at me you cant stop witches she said just look at the power that terrible grand high witch has in her eyes alone she could kill any of us at any time with those whitehot sparks of hers you saw it yourself even so grandmamma weve still got to stop her from turning all the children of england into mice you havent quite finished she said tell me about bruno how did they get him so i described how bruno jenkins had come in and how i had actually seen him with my own eyes being shrunk into a mouse my grandmother looked at bruno who was guzzling away in the bowl of bananas does he never stop eating she asked never i said can you explain something to me grandmamma ill try she said she reached out and lifted me off the table and put me on her lap very gently she began stroking the soft fur along my back it felt nice what is it you want to ask me my darling she said the thing i dont understand i said is how bruno and i are still able to talk and think just as we did before its quite simple my grandmother said all theyve done is to shrink you and give you four legs and a furry coat but they havent been able to change you into a one hundred per cent mouse you are still yourself in everything except your appearance youve still got your own mind and your own brain and your own voice and thank goodness for that so im not really an ordinary mouse at all i said im a sort of mouseperson quite right she said you are a human in mouses clothing you are very special we sat there in silence for a few moments while my grandmother went on stroking me very gently with one finger and puffing her cigar with the other hand the only sound in the room was made by bruno as he attacked the bananas in the bowl but i wasnt doing nothing as i lay there on her lap i was thinking like mad my brain was whizzing as it had never whizzed before grandmamma i said i may have a bit of an idea yes my darling what is it the grand high witch told them her room was number right right she said well my room is number mine is on the fifth floor so hers will be on the fourth floor that is correct my grandmother said then dont you think its possible that room is directly underneath room thats more than likely she said these modern hotels are all built like boxes of bricks but what if it is would you please take me out on to my balcony so i can look down i said all the rooms in the hotel magnificent had small private balconies my grandmother carried me through into my own bedroom and out on to my balcony we both peered down to the balcony immediately below now if that is her room i said then ill bet i could climb down there somehow and get in and get caught all over again my grandmother said i wont allow it at this moment i said all the witches are down on the sunshine terrace having tea with the manager the grand high witch probably wont be back until six oclock or just before thats when shes going to dish out supplies of that foul formula to the ancient ones who are too old to climb trees after gruntles eggs and what if you did manage to get into her room my grandmother said what then then i should try to find the place where she keeps her supply of delayed action mousemaker and if i succeeded then i would steal one bottle of it and bring it back here could you carry it i think so i said its a very small bottle im frightened of that stuff my grandmother said what would you do with it if you did manage to get it one bottle is enough for five hundred people i said that would give each and every witch down there a double dose at least we could turn them all into mice my grandmother jumped about an inch in the air we were out on my balcony and there was a drop of about a million feet below us and i very nearly bounced out of her hand over the railings when she jumped be careful with me grandmamma i said what an idea she cried its fantastic its tremendous youre a genius my darling wouldnt it be something i said wouldnt that really be something wed get rid of every witch in england in one swoop she cried and the grand high witch into the bargain weve got to try it i said listen she said nearly dropping me over the balcony once again in her excitement if we brought this off it would be the greatest triumph in the whole history of witchery theres a lot of work to do i said of course theres a lot of work to do she said just for a start supposing you did manage to get hold of one of those bottles how would you get it into their food well work that out later i said lets try to get the stuff first how can we find out for sure if thats her room just below us we shall check it out immediately my grandmother cried come along theres not a second to waste carrying me in one hand she went bustling out of the bedroom and along the corridor banging her stick on the carpet with each step she took we went down the stairs one flight to the fourth floor the bedrooms on either side of the corridor had their numbers painted on the doors in gold here it is my grandmother cried number she tried the door it was locked of course she looked up and down the long empty hotel corridor i do believe youre right she said this room is almost certainly directly below yours she marched back along the corridor counting the number of doors from the grand high witchs room to the staircase there were six she climbed back up to the fifth floor and repeated the exercise she is directly below you my grandmother cried out her room is right below yours she carried me back into my own bedroom and went out once again on to the balcony thats her balcony down there she said and whats more the door from her balcony into her bedroom is wide open how are you going to climb down i dont know i said our rooms were in the front of the hotel and they looked down on to the beach and the sea immediately below my balcony thousands of feet below i could see a fence of spiked railings if i fell id be a gonner ive got it my grandmother cried with me in her hand she rushed back into her own room and began rummaging in the chestofdrawers she came out with a ball of blue knittingwool one end of it was attached to some needles and a halffinished sock she had been knitting for me this is perfect she said i shall put you in the sock and lower you down on to the grand high witchs balcony but we must hurry any moment now that monster will be returning to her room the mouseburglar my grandmother hustled me back into my own bedroom and out on to the balcony are you ready she asked im going to put you in the sock now i hope i can manage this i said im only a little mouse youll manage she said good luck my darling she popped me into the sock and started lowering me over the balcony i crouched inside the sock and held my breath through the stitches i could see out quite clearly miles below me the children playing on the beach were the size of beetles the sock started swinging in the breeze i looked up and saw my grandmothers head sticking out over the railings of the balcony above youre nearly there she called out here we go gently does it youre down i felt a slight bump in you go my grandmother was shouting hurry hurry hurry search the room i jumped out of the sock and ran into the grand high witchs bedroom there was the same musty smell about the place that i had noticed in the ballroom it was the stench of witches it reminded me of the smell inside the mens public lavatory at our local railwaystation as far as i could see the room was tidy enough there was no sign anywhere that it was inhabited by anyone but an ordinary person but then there wouldnt be would there no witch would be stupid enough to leave anything suspicious lying around for the hotel maid to see suddenly i saw a frog jumping across the carpet and disappearing under the bed i jumped myself hurry up came my grandmothers voice from somewhere high up outside grab the stuff and get out i started skittering round and trying to search the room this wasnt so easy i couldnt for example open any of the drawers i couldnt open the doors of the big wardrobe either i stopped skittering about i sat in the middle of the floor and had a think if the grand high witch wanted to hide something top secret where would she put it certainly not in any ordinary drawer not in the wardrobe either it was too obvious i jumped up on to the bed to get a better view of the room hey i thought what about under the mattress very carefully i lowered myself over the edge of the bed and wormed my way underneath the mattress i had to push forward hard to make any headway but i kept at it i couldnt see a thing i was scrabbling about under the mattress when my head suddenly bumped against something hard inside the mattress above me i reached up and felt it with my paw could it be a little bottle it was a little bottle i could trace the shape of it through the cloth of the mattress and right alongside it i felt another hard lump and another and another the grand high witch must have slit open the mattress and put all the bottles inside and then sewn it all up again i began tearing away frantically at the mattress cloth above my head with my teeth my front teeth were extremely sharp and it didnt take me long to make a small hole i climbed into the hole and grabbed a bottle by the neck i pushed it down through the hole in the mattress and climbed out after it walking backwards and dragging the bottle behind me i managed to reach the edge of the mattress i rolled the bottle off the bed on to the carpet it bounced but it didnt break i jumped down off the bed i examined the little bottle it was identical to the one the grand high witch had had in the ballroom there was a label on this one formula it said delayed action mousemaker then it said this bottle contains five hundred doses eureka i felt tremendously pleased with myself three frogs came hopping out from under the bed they crouched on the carpet staring at me with large black eyes i stared back at them those huge eyes were the saddest things i had ever seen it suddenly occurred to me that almost certainly once upon a time they had been children those frogs before the grand high witch had got hold of them i stood there clutching the bottle and staring at the frogs who are you i asked them at that exact moment i heard a key turning in the lock of the door and the door burst open and the grand high witch swept into the room the frogs jumped underneath the bed again in one quick hop i darted after them still clutching the bottle and i ran back against the wall and squeezed in behind one of the bedposts i heard feet walking on the carpet i peeped round the bedpost the three frogs were clustered together under the middle of the bed frogs cannot hide like mice they cannot run like mice either all they can do poor things is to hop about rather clumsily suddenly the grand high witchs face came into view peering under the bed i popped my head back behind the bedpost so there you are my little frrroggies i heard her saying you can stay vhere you are until i go to bed tonight then i shall thrrrow you out of the window and the seagulls can have you for supper suddenly very loud and clear there came the sound of my grandmothers voice through the open balcony door hurry up my darling it shouted do hurry up youd better come out quickly who is calling snapped the grand high witch i peeped round the bedpost again and saw her walking across the carpet to the balcony door who is this on my balcony she muttered who is it who dares to trrrespass on my balcony she went through the door on to the balcony itself vot is this knittingvool hanging down here i heard her saying oh hello came my grandmothers voice i just dropped my knitting over the balcony by mistake but its all right ive got hold of one end of it i can pull it up by myself thank you all the same i marvelled at the coolness of her voice who vur you talking to just now snapped the grand high witch who vur you telling to hurry up and come out quickly i was talking to my little grandson i heard my grandmother saying hes been in the bathroom for hours and its time he came out he sits in there reading books and he forgets completely where he is do you have any children my dear i do not shouted the grand high witch and she came quickly back into the bedroom slamming the balcony door behind her i was cooked my escape route was closed i was shut up in the room with the grand high witch and three terrified frogs i was just as terrified as the frogs i was quite sure that if i was spotted i would be caught and thrown out over the balcony for the seagulls there came a knock on the bedroom door vot is it this time shouted the grand high witch it is we ancient ones said a meek voice from behind the door it is six oclock and we have come to collect the bottles that you promised us o your grandness i saw her crossing the carpet towards the door the door was opened and then i saw a whole lot of feet and shoes beginning to enter the room they were coming in slowly and hesitantly as though the owners of those shoes were frightened of entering come in come in snapped the grand high witch do not stand out there dithering in the corrridor i dont have all night i saw my chance i jumped out from behind the bedpost and ran like lightning towards the open door i jumped over several pairs of shoes on the way and in three seconds i was out in the corridor still clutching the precious bottle to my chest no one had seen me there were no shouts of mouse mouse all i could hear were the voices of the ancient witches burbling their silly sentences about how kind your grandness is and all the rest of it i went scampering down the corridor to the stairs and up one flight i went to the fifth floor and then along the corridor again until i came to the door of my own bedroom thank goodness there was no one in sight using the bottom of the little bottle i began taptaptapping on the door tap tap tap rap i went tap tap tap tap tap tap would my grandmother hear me i thought that she must the bottle made quite a loud tap each time it struck tap tap tap tap tap tap just so long as nobody came along the corridor but the door didnt open i decided to take a risk grandmamma i shouted as loudly as i possibly could grandmamma its me let me in i heard her feet coming across the carpet and the door opened i went in like an arrow ive done it i cried jumping up and down ive got it grandmamma look here it is ive got a whole bottle of it she closed the door she bent down and picked me up and hugged me oh my darling she cried thank heavens youre safe she took the little bottle from me and read the label aloud formula delayed action mousemaker she read this bottle contains five hundred doses you brilliant darling boy youre a wonder youre a marvel how on earth did you get out of her room i nipped out when the ancient witches were coming in i told her it was all a bit hairy grandmamma i wouldnt want to do it again i saw her too my grandmother said i know you did grandmamma i heard you talking to each other didnt you think she was absolutely foul shes a murderer my grandmother said shes the most evil woman in the entire world did you see her mask i asked its amazing my grandmother said it looks just like a real face even though i knew it was a mask i still couldnt tell oh my darling she cried giving me a hug i thought id nearer see you again im so happy you got away mr and mrs jenkins meet bruno my grandmother carried me back into her own bedroom and put me on the table she set the precious bottle down beside me what time are those witches having supper in the dining room she asked eight oclock i said she looked at her watch it is now tenpast six she said weve got until eight oclock to work out our next move suddenly her eye fell upon bruno he was still in the banana bowl on the table he had eaten three bananas and was now attacking a fourth he had become immensely fat thats quite enough my grandmother said lifting him out of the bowl and putting him on the tabletop i think its time we returned this little fellow to the bosom of his family dont you agree bruno bruno scowled at her i had never seen a mouse scowl before but he managed it my parents let me eat as much as i want he said id rather be with them than with you of course you would my grandmother said do you know where your parents might be at this moment they were in the lounge not long ago i said i saw them sitting there as we dashed through on our way up here right my grandmother said lets go and see if they are still there do you want to come along she added looking at me yes please i said i shall put you both in my handbag she said keep quiet and stay out of sight if you must peep out now and again dont show more than your nose her handbag was a large bulgy blackleather affair with a tortoiseshell clasp she picked up bruno and me and popped us into it i shall leave the clasp undone she said but be sure to keep out of sight i had no intention of keeping out of sight i wanted to see everything i seated myself in a little sidepocket inside the bag near the clasp and from there i was able to poke my head out whenever i wanted to hey bruno called out give me the rest of that banana i was eating oh all right my grandmother said anything to keep you quiet she dropped the halfeaten banana into the bag then slung the bag over her arm and marched out of the room and went thumping along the corridor with her walking stick we went down in the lift to the ground floor and made our way through the readingroom to the lounge and there sure enough sat mr and mrs jenkins in a couple of armchairs with a low round glasscovered table between them there were several other groups in there as well but the jenkinses were the only couple sitting alone mr jenkins was reading a newspaper mrs jenkins was knitting something large and mustardcoloured only my nose and eyes were above the clasp of my grandmothers handbag but i had a super view i could see everything my grandmother dressed in black lace went thumping across the floor of the lounge and halted in front of the jenkinss table are you mr and mrs jenkins she asked mr jenkins looked at her over the top of his newspaper and frowned yes he said i am mr jenkins what can i do for you madam im afraid i have some rather alarming news for you she said its about your son bruno what about bruno mr jenkins said mrs jenkins looked up but went on knitting whats the little blighter been up to now mr jenkins asked raiding the kitchen i suppose its a bit worse than that my grandmother said do you think we might go somewhere more private while i tell you about it private mr jenkins said why do we have to be private this is not an easy thing for me to explain my grandmother said id much rather we all went up to your room and sat down before i tell you any more mr jenkins lowered his paper mrs jenkins stopped knitting i dont want to go up to my room madam mr jenkins said im quite comfortable here thank you very much he was a large coarse man and he wasnt used to being pushed around by anybody kindly state your business and then leave us alone he added he spoke as though he was addressing someone who was trying to sell him a vacuumcleaner at the back door my poor grandmother who had been doing her best to be as kind to them as possible now began to bristle a bit herself we really cant talk in here she said there are too many people this is a rather delicate and personal matter ill talk where i dashed well want to madam mr jenkins said come on now out with it if bruno has broken a window or smashed your spectacles then ill pay for the damage but im not budging out of this seat one or two other groups in the room were beginning to stare at us now where is bruno anyway mr jenkins said tell him to come here and see me hes here already my grandmother said hes in my handbag she patted the big floppy leather bag with her walkingstick what the heck dyou mean hes in your handbag mr jenkins shouted are you trying to be funny mrs jenkins said very prim theres nothing funny about this my grandmother said your son has suffered a rather unfortunate mishap hes always suffering mishaps mr jenkins said he suffers from overeating and then he suffers from wind you should hear him after supper he sounds like a brass band but a good dose of castoroil soon puts him right again where is the little beggar ive already told you my grandmother said hes in my handbag but i do think it might be better if we went somewhere private before you meet him in his present state this womans mad mrs jenkins said tell her to go away the plain fact is my grandmother said that your son bruno has been rather drastically altered altered shouted mr jenkins what the devil dyou mean altered go away mrs jenkins said youre a silly old woman i am trying to tell you as gently as i possibly can that bruno really is in my handbag my grandmother said my own grandson actually saw them doing it to him saw who doing what to him for heavens sake shouted mr jenkins he had a black moustache which jumped up and down when he shouted saw the witches turning him into a mouse my grandmother said call the manager dear mrs jenkins said to her husband have this mad woman thrown out of the hotel at this point my grandmothers patience came to an end she fished around in her handbag and found bruno she lifted him out and dumped him on the glasstopped table mrs jerkins took one look at the fat little brown mouse who was still chewing a bit of banana and she let out a shriek that rattled the crystals on the chandelier she sprang out of her chair yelling its a mouse take it away i cant stand the things its bruno my grandmother said you nasty cheeky old woman shouted mr jerkins he started flapping his newspaper at bruno trying to sweep him off the table my grandmother rushed forward and managed to grab hold of him before he was swept away mrs jerkins was still screaming her head off and mr jerkins was towering over us and shouting get out of here how dare you frighten my wife like that take your filthy mouse away this instant help screamed mrs jerkins her face had gone the colour of the underside of a fish well i did my best my grandmother said and with that she turned and sailed out of the room carrying bruno with her the plan when we got back to the bedroom my grandmother took both me and bruno out of her handbag and put us on the table why on earth didnt you speak up and tell your father who you were she said to bruno because i had my mouth full bruno said he jumped straight back into the bowl of bananas and went on with his eating what a very disagreeable little boy you are my grandmother said to him not boy i said mouse quite right my darling but we dont have time to worry about him at this moment we have plans to make in about an hour and a halfs time all the witches will be going down to supper in the dining room right right i said and every one of them has got to be given a dose of mousemaker she said how on earth are we going to do that grandmamma i said i think you are forgetting that a mouse can go places where human beings cant thats quite right she said but even a mouse cant go creeping around on the tabletop carrying a bottle and sprinkling mousemaker all over the witches roast beef without being spotted i wasnt thinking of doing it in the dining room i said then where she asked in the kitchen i said while their food is being got ready my grandmother stared at me my darling child she said slowly i do believe that turning you into a mouse has doubled your brainpower a little mouse i said can go scuttling round the kitchen among the pots and pans and if hes very careful no one will ever see him brilliant my grandmother cried out by golly i think youve got it the only thing is i said how will i know which food is theirs i dont want to put it in the wrong saucepan it would be disastrous if i turned all the other guests into mice by mistake and especially you grandmamma then youll just have to creep into the kitchen and find a good hidingplace and wait and listen just lie there in some dark cranny listening and listening to what the cooks are saying and then with a bit of luck somebodys going to give you a clue whenever they have a very big party to cook for the food is always prepared separately right i said thats what ill have to do i shall wait there and i shall listen and i shall hope for a bit of luck its going to be very dangerous my grandmother said nobody welcomes a mouse in the kitchen if they see you theyll squash you to death i wont let them see me i said dont forget youll be carrying the bottle she said so you wont be nearly so quick and nippy i can run quite fast standing up with the bottle in my arms i said i did it just now dont you remember i came all the way up from the grand high witchs room carrying it what about unscrewing the top she said that might be difficult for you let me try i said i took hold of the little bottle and using both my front paws i found i was able to unscrew the cap quite easily thats great my grandmother said you really are a very clever mouse she glanced at her watch at halfpast seven she said i shall go down to the diningroom for supper with you in my handbag i shall then release you under the table together with the precious bottle and from then on youll be on your own you will have to work your way unseen across the diningroom to the door that leads into the kitchen there will be waiters going in and out of that door all the time you will have to choose the right moment and nip in behind one of them but for heavens sake be sure that you dont get trodden on or squeezed in the door ill try not to i said and whatever happens you mustnt let them catch you dont go on about it grandmamma youre making me nervous youre a brave little fellow she said i do love you what shall we do with bruno i asked her bruno looked up im coming with you he said speaking with his mouth full of banana im not going to miss my supper my grandmother considered this for a moment ill take you along she said if you promise to stay in my bag and keep absolutely silent will you pass food down to me from the table bruno asked yes she said if you promise to behave yourself would you like something to eat my darling she said to me no thank you i said im too excited to eat and ive got to keep fit and frisky for the big job ahead its a big job all right my grandmother said youll never do a bigger one in the kitchen the time has come my grandmother said the great moment has arrived are you ready my darling it was exactly halfpast seven bruno was in the bowl finishing that fourth banana hang on he said just a few more bites no my grandmother said weve got to go she picked him up and held him tight in her hand she was very tense and nervous i had never seen her like that before im going to put you both in my handbag now she said but i shall leave the clasp undone she popped bruno into it first i waited clutching the little bottle to my chest now you she said she picked me up and gave me a kiss on the nose good luck my darling oh by the way you do realise youve got a tail dont you a what i said a tail a long curly tail i must say that never occurred to me i said good gracious me so i have i can see it now i can actually move it it is rather grand isnt it i mention it only because it might come in useful when youre climbing about in the kitchen my grandmother said you can curl it around and you can hook it on to things and you can swing from it and lower yourself to the ground from high places i wish id known this before i said i could have practised using it too late now my grandmother said weve got to go she popped me into her handbag with bruno and at once i took up my usual perch in the small sidepocket so that i could poke my head out and see what was going on my grandmother picked up her walkingstick and out she went into the corridor to the lift she pressed the button and the lift came up and she got in there was no one in there with us listen she said i wont be able to talk to you much once were in the diningroom if i do people will think im dotty and talking to myself the lift reached the ground floor and stopped with a jerk my grandmother walked out of it and crossed the lobby of the hotel and entered the diningroom it was a huge room with gold decorations on the ceiling and big mirrors around the walls the regular guests always had their tables reserved for them and most of them were already in their places and starting to eat their suppers waiters were buzzing about all over the place carrying plates and dishes our table was a small one beside the righthand wall about halfway down the room my grandmother made her way to it and sat down peeping out of the handbag i could see in the very centre of the room two long tables that were not yet occupied each of them carried a notice fixed on to a sort of silver stick and the notices said reserved for members of the rspcc my grandmother looked towards the long tables but said nothing she unfolded her napkin and spread it over the handbag on her lap her hand slid under the napkin and took hold of me gently with the napkin covering me she lifted me up close to her face and whispered i am about to put you on the floor under the table the tablecloth reaches almost to the ground so no one will see you have you got hold of the bottle yes i whispered back im ready grandmamma just then a waiter in a black suit came and stood by our table i could see his legs from under the napkin and as soon as i heard his voice i knew who he was his name was william good evening madam he said to my grandmother where is the little gentleman tonight hes not feeling very well my grandmother said hes staying in his room im sorry to hear that william said today there is greenpea soup to start with and for the main course you have a choice of either grilled fillet of sole or roast lamb pea soup and lamb for me please my grandmother said but dont hurry it william im in no rush tonight in fact you can bring me a glass of dry sherry first of course madam william said and he went away my grandmother pretended she had dropped something and as she bent down she slid me out from under the napkin on to the floor under the table go darling go she whispered then she straightened up again i was on my own now i stood clasping the little bottle i knew exactly where the door into the kitchen was i had to go about halfway round the enormous diningroom to reach it here goes i thought and like a flash i skittled out from under the table and made for the wall i had no intention of going across the diningroom floor it was far too risky my plan was to cling close to the skirting of the wall all the way round until i reached the kitchen door i ran oh how i ran i dont think anyone saw me they were all too busy eating but to reach the door leading to the kitchen i had to cross the main entrance to the diningroom i was just about to do this when in poured a great flood of females i pressed myself against the wall clutching the bottle at first i saw only the shoes and ankles of these women who were surging in through the door but when i glanced up a bit higher i knew at once who they were they were the witches coming in to dinner i waited until they had all passed me by then i dashed on towards the kitchen door a waiter opened it to go in i nipped in after him and hid behind a big garbagebin on the floor i stayed there for several minutes just listening to all the talk and the racket by golly what a place that kitchen was the noise and the steam and the clatter of pots and pans and the cooks all shouting and the waiters all rushing in and out from the diningroom yelling the food orders to the cooks four soups and two lambs and two fish for table twentyeight three applepies and two strawberry icecreams for number seventeen stuff like that going on all the time not far above my head there was a handle sticking out from the side of the garbagebin still clutching the bottle i gave a leap turned a somersault in the air and caught hold of the handle with the end of my tail suddenly there i was swinging to and fro upside down it was terrific i loved it this i told myself is how a trapeze artist in a circus must feel as he goes swishing through the air high up in the circus tent the only difference was that his trapeze could only swing backwards and forwards my trapeze could swing me in any direction i wanted perhaps i would become a circus mouse after all just then a waiter came in with a plate in his hand and i heard him saying the old hag on table fourteen says this meat is too tough she wants another portion one of the cooks said gimme her plate i dropped to the floor and peeped round the garbagebin i saw the cook scrape the meat off the plate and slap another bit on then he said come on boys give her some gravy he carried the plate round to everyone in the kitchen and do you know what they did every one of those cooks and kitchenboys spat on to the old ladys plate see how she likes it now said the cook handing the plate back to the waiter quite soon another waiter came in and he shouted everyone in the big rspcc party wants the soup thats when i started sitting up and taking notice i was all ears now i edged a bit farther round the garbagebin so that i could see everything that was going on in the kitchen a man with a tall white hat who must have been the head chef shouted put the soup for the big party in the larger silver souptureen i saw the head chef place a huge silver basin on to the wooden sidebench that ran along the whole length of the kitchen against the opposite wall into that silver basin is where the soup is going i told myself so thats where the stuff in my little bottle must go as well i noticed that high up near the ceiling above the sidebench there was a long shelf crammed with saucepans and fryingpans if i can somehow clamber up on to that shelf i thought then ive got it made i shall be directly above the silver basin but first i must somehow get across to the other side of the kitchen and then up on to the middle shelf a great idea came to me once again i jumped up and hooked my tail around the handle of the garbagebin then hanging upside down i began to swing higher and higher i swung i was remembering the trapeze artist in the circus i had seen last easter and the way he had got the trapeze swinging higher and higher and higher and had then let go and gone flying through the air so just at the right moment at the top of my swing i let go with my tail and went soaring clear across the kitchen and made a perfect landing on the middle shelf by golly i thought what marvellous things a mouse can do and im only a beginner no one had seen me they were all far too busy with their pots and pans from the middle shelf i somehow managed to shinny up a little waterpipe in the corner and in no time at all i was up on the very top shelf just under the ceiling among all the saucepans and the fryingpans i knew that no one could possibly see me up there it was a super position and i began working my way along the shelf until i was directly above the big empty silver basin they were going to pour the soup into i put down my bottle i unscrewed the top and crept to the edge of the shelf and quickly poured what was in it straight into the silver basin below the next moment one of the cooks came along with a gigantic saucepan of steaming green soup and poured the whole lot into the silver basin he put the lid on the basin and shouted soup for the big party all ready to go out then a waiter arrived and carried the silver basin away i had done it even if i never got back alive to my grandmother the witches were still going to get the mousemaker i left the empty bottle behind a large saucepan and began working my way back along the top shelf it was much easier to move about without the bottle i began using my tail more and more i swung from the handle of one saucepan to the handle of another all the way along that top shelf while far below me cooks and waiters were all bustling about and kettles were steaming and pans were spluttering and pots were boiling and i thought to myself oh boy this is the life what fun it is to be a mouse doing an exciting job like this i kept right on swinging i swung most marvellously from handle to handle and i was enjoying myself so much that i completely forgot i was in full view of anyone in the kitchen who might happen to glance upwards what came next happened so quickly i had no time to save myself i heard a mans voice yelling a mouse look at that dirty little mouse and i caught a glimpse below me of a whitecoated figure in a tall white hat and then there was a flash of steel as the carvingknife whizzed through the air and there was a shoot of pain in the end of my tail and suddenly i was falling and falling headfirst towards the floor even as i fell i knew just what had happened i knew that the tip of my tail had been cut off and that i was about to crash on to the floor and everyone in the kitchen would be after me a mouse they were shouting a mouse a mouse catch it quick i hit the floor and jumped up and ran for my life all around me there were big black boots going stamp stamp stamp and i dodged around them and ran and ran and ran twisting and turning and dodging and swerving across the kitchen floor get it they were shouting kill it stamp on itthe whole floor seemed to be full of black boots stamping away at me and i dodged and swerved and twisted and turned and then in sheer desperation hardly knowing what i was doing wanting only a place to hide i ran up the trouserleg of one of the cooks and clung to his sock hey the cook shouted jeepers creepers hes gone up my trouser hold on boys ill get him this time the mans hands began slapslapping at the trouserleg and now i really was going to get smashed if i didnt move quickly there was only one way to go and that was up i dug my little claws into the hairy skin of the mans leg and scuttled upwards higher and higher past the calf and past the knee and on to the thigh holy smoke the man was yelling its going all the way up its going right up my leg i heard shrieks of laughter coming from the other cooks but i can promise you i wasnt laughing myself i was running for my life the mans hands were slapslapslapping all around me and he was jumping up and down as though he was standing on hot bricks and i kept climbing and i kept dodging and very soon i reached the very top of the trouserleg and there was nowhere else to go help help help the man was screaming its in my knickers its running round in my flaming knickers get it out someone help me to get it out take off your trousers you silly slob someone else shouted pull down your pants and well soon catch him i was in the middle of the mans trousers now in the place where the two trouserlegs meet and the zip begins it was dark and awfully hot in there i knew i had to keep going i dashed onward and found the top of the other trouserleg i went down it like greased lightning and came out at the bottom of it and once again i was on the floor i heard the stupid cook still shouting its in my trousers get it out will somebody please help me to get it out before it bites me i caught a flashing glimpse of the entire kitchen staff crowding round him and laughing their heads off and nobody saw the little brown mouse as it flew across the floor and dived into a sack of potatoes i burrowed down in among the dirty potatoes and held my breath the cook must have started taking his trousers right off because now they were shouting its not in there theres no mice in there you silly twerp there was i swear there was the man was shouting back youve never had a mouse in your trousers you dont know what it feels like the fact that a tiny little creature like me had caused such a commotion among a bunch of grownup men gave me a happy feeling i couldnt help smiling in spite of the pain in my tail i stayed where i was until i was sure they had forgotten about me then i crept out of the potatoes and cautiously poked my tiny head over the edge of the sack once again the kitchen was all of a bustle with cooks and waiters rushing about everywhere i saw the waiter who had come in earlier with the complaint about tough meat coming in again hey boys he shouted i asked the old hag if the new bit of meat was any better and she said it was perfectly delicious she said it was really tasty i had to get out of that kitchen and back to my grandmother there was only one way to do this i must make a dash clear across the floor and out through the door behind one of the waiters i stayed quite still watching for my chance my tail was hurting terribly i curled it round so as to have a look at it about two inches of it were missing and it was bleeding quite a lot there was a waiter loading up with a batch of plates full of pink icecream he had a plate in each hand and two more balanced on each arm he went towards the door he pushed it open with his shoulder i leapt out of the sack of potatoes and went across that kitchen floor and into the diningroom like a streak of light and i didnt stop running until i was underneath my grandmothers table it was lovely to see my grandmothers feet again in those oldfashioned black shoes with their straps and buttons i shinnied up one of her legs and landed on her lap hello grandmamma i whispered im back i did it i poured it all into their soup her hand came down and caressed me well done my darling she whispered back well done you they are at this very moment eating that soup suddenly she withdrew her hand youre bleeding she whispered my darling whats happened to you one of the cooks cut off my tail with a carving knife i whispered back it hurts like billyo let me look at it she said she bent her head and examined my tail you poor little thing she whispered im going to bandage it up with my handkerchief that will stop the bleeding she fished a small laceedged handkerchief out of her bag and this she somehow managed to wrap around the end of my tail youll be all right now she said just try to forget about it did you really manage to pour the whole bottle into their soup every drop i said do you think you could put me where i can watch them yes she answered my handbag is on your own empty chair beside me im going to pop you in there now and you can peep out as long as you are careful not to be seen bruno is there as well but take no notice of him i gave him a roll to eat and thats keeping him busy for a while her hand closed around me and i was lifted off her lap and transferred to the handbag hello bruno i said this is a great roll he said nibbling away in the bottom of the bag but i wish there was butter on it i peered over the top of the handbag i could see the witches quite clearly sitting at their two long tables in the centre of the room they had finished their soup now and the waiters were clearing away the plates my grandmother had lit up one of her disgusting black cigars and was puffing smoke over everything all around us the summer holiday guests in this rather grand hotel were babbling away and tucking into their suppers about half of them were old people with walkingsticks but there were also plenty of families with a husband a wife and several children they were all welltodo people you had to be if you wanted to stay in the hotel magnificent thats her grandmamma i whispered thats the grand high witch i know my grandmother whispered back shes the tiny one in black sitting at the head of the nearest table she could kill anyone in this room with her whitehot sparks look out my grandmother whispered the waiters coming i popped down out of sight and i heard william saying your roast lamb madam and which vegetable would you like peas or carrots carrots please my grandmother said but no potatoes i heard the carrots being dished out there was a pause then my grandmothers voice was whispering its all right hes gone i popped my head up again surely no one will notice my little head sticking out like this i whispered no she answered i dont suppose they will my problem is ive got to talk to you without moving my lips youre doing beautifully i said ive counted the witches she said there arent nearly as many as you thought you were just guessing werent you when you said two hundred it just seemed like two hundred i said i was wrong too my grandmother said i thought there were a lot more witches than this in england how many are there i asked eightyfour she said there were eightyfive i said but one of them got fried at that moment i caught sight of mr jenkins brunos father heading straight for our table look out grandmamma i whispered here comes brunos father mr jenkins and his son mr jenkins came striding up to our table with a very purposeful look on his face where is that grandson of yours he said to my grandmother he spoke rudely and looked very angry my grandmother put on her frostiest look but didnt answer him my guess is that he and my son bruno are up to some devilment mr jenkins went on bruno hasnt turned up for his supper and it takes a lot to make that boy miss his food i must admit he has a very healthy appetite my grandmother said my feeling is that youre in on this as well mr jenkins said i dont know who the devil you are and i dont much care but you played a nasty trick on me and my wife this afternoon you put a dirty little mouse on the table that makes me think all three of you are up to something so if you know where brunos hiding kindly tell me at once that was no trick i played on you my grandmother said that mouse i tried to give you was your own little boy bruno i was being kind to you i was trying to restore him to the bosom of his family you refused to take him in what the blazes do you mean madam shouted mr jenkins my son isnt a mouse his black moustache was jumping up and down like crazy as he spoke come on woman where is he out with it the family at the table nearest to us had all stopped eating and were staring at mr jerkins my grandmother sat there puffing away calmly at her black cigar i can well understand your anger mr jerkins she said any other english father would be just as cross as you are but over in norway where i come from we are quite used to these sort of happenings we have learnt to accept them as part of everyday life you must be mad woman cried mr jerkins where is bruno if you dont tell me at once i shall summon the police bruno is a mouse my grandmother said calm as ever he most certainly is not a mouse shouted mr jerkins oh yes i am bruno said poking his head up out of the handbag mr jerkins leapt about three feet into the air hello dad bruno said he had a silly sort of mousy grin on his face mr jenkinss mouth dropped open so wide i could see the gold fillings in his back teeth dont worry dad bruno went on its not as bad as all that just so long as the cat doesnt get me bbbruno stammered mr jenkins no more school said bruno grinning a broad and asinine mousegrin no more homework i shall live in the kitchen cupboard and feast on raisins and honey bbbut bbbruno stammered mr jenkins again hhow did this happen the poor man had no wind left in his sails at all witches my grandmother said the witches did it i cant have a mouse for a son shrieked mr jenkins youve got one my grandmother said be nice to him mr jenkins mrs jerkins will go crazy yelled mr jerkins she cant stand the things shell just have to get used to him my grandmother said i hope you dont keep a cat in the house we do we do cried mr jerkins topsy is my wifes favourite creature then youll just have to get rid of topsy my grandmother said your son is more important than your cat he certainly is bruno shouted from inside the handbag you tell mum shes got to get rid of topsy before i go home by now half the diningroom was watching our little group knives and forks and spoons had been put down and all over the place heads were turning round to stare at mr jerkins as he stood there spluttering and shouting they couldnt see either bruno or me and they were wondering what all the fuss was about by the way my grandmother said would you like to know who did this to him there was a mischievous little smile on her face and i could see that she was about to get mr jerkins into trouble who he cried who did it that woman over there my grandmother said the small one in a black dress at the head of the long table shes rspcc cried mr jerkins shes the chairwoman no shes not my grandmother said shes the grand high witch of all the world you mean she did it that skinny little woman over there shouted mr jenkins pointing at her with a long finger by gad ill have my lawyers on to her for this ill make her pay through the nose i wouldnt do anything rash my grandmother said to him that woman has magic powers she might decide to turn you into something even sillier than a mouse a cockroach perhaps turn me into a cockroach shouted mr jenkins puffing out his chest id like to see her try he swung around and started marching across the diningroom towards the grand high witchs table my grandmother and i watched him bruno had jumped up on to our table and was also watching his father practically everyone in the diningroom was watching mr jenkins now i stayed where i was peeping out of my grandmothers handbag i thought it might be wiser to stay put the triumph mr jenkins had not gone more than a few paces towards the grand high witchs table when a piercing scream rose high above all the other noises in the room and at the same moment i saw the grand high witch go shooting up into the air now she was standing on her chair still screaming now she was on the tabletop waving her arms what on earths happening grandmamma wait my grandmother said keep quiet and watch suddenly all the other witches more than eighty of them were beginning to scream and jump up out of their seats as though spikes were being stuck into their bottoms some were standing on chairs some were up on the tables and all of them were wiggling about and waving their arms in the most extraordinary manner then all at once they became quiet then they stiffened every single witch stood there as stiff and silent as a corpse the whole room became deathly still theyre shrinking grandmamma i said theyre shrinking just like i did i know they are my grandmother said its the mousemaker i cried look some of them are growing fur on their faces why is it working so quickly grandmamma ill tell you why my grandmother said because all of them have had massive overdoses just like you its thrown the alarmclock right out of whack everyone in the diningroom was standing up now to get a better view people were moving closer they were beginning to crowd round the two long tables my grandmother lifted bruno and me up so that we wouldnt miss any of the fun in her excitement she jumped up on to her chair so that she could see over the heads of the crowd in another few seconds all the witches had completely disappeared and the tops of the two long tables were swarming with small brown mice all over the diningroom women were screaming and strong men were turning white in the face and shouting its crazy this cant happen lets get the heck out of here quick waiters were attacking the mice with chairs and winebottles and anything else that came to hand i saw a chef in a tall white hat rushing out from the kitchen brandishing a fryingpan and another one just behind him was wielding a carvingknife above his head and everyone was yelling mice mice mice we must get rid of the mice only the children in the room were really enjoying it they all seemed to know instinctively that something good was going on right there in front of them and they were clapping and cheering and laughing like mad its time to go my grandmother said our work is done she got down off her chair and picked up her handbag and slung it over her arm she had me in her right hand and bruno in her left bruno she said the time has come to restore you to the famous bosom of your family my mums not very crazy about mice bruno said so i noticed my grandmother said shell just have to get used to you wont she it was not difficult to find mr and mrs jenkins you could hear mrs jenkinss shrill voice all over the room herbert it was screaming herbert get me out of here theres mice everywhere theyll go up my skirts she had her arms high up around her husband and from where i was she seemed to be swinging from his neck my grandmother advanced upon them and thrust bruno into mr jenkinss hand heres your little boy she said he needs to go on a diet hi dad bruno said hi mum mrs jenkins screamed even louder my grandmother with me in her hand turned and marched out of the room she went straight across the hotel lobby and out through the front entrance into the open air outside it was a lovely warm evening and i could hear the waves breaking on the beach just across the road from the hotel is there a taxi here my grandmother said to the tall doorman in his green uniform certainly madam he said and he put two fingers into his mouth and blew a long shrill whistle i watched him with envy for weeks i had been trying to whistle like that but i hadnt succeeded once now i never would the taxi came the driver was an oldish man with a thick black drooping moustache the moustache hung over his mouth like the roots of some plant where to madam he asked suddenly he caught sight of me a little mouse nestling in my grandmothers hand blimey he said whats that its my grandson my grandmother said drive us to the station please i always liked mice the old taxidriver said i used to keep undreds of em when i was a boy mice is the fastest breeders in the world did you know that maam so if ees your grandson then i reckon youll be having a few great grandsons to go with im in a couple of weeks time drive us to the station please my grandmother said looking prim yes maam he said right away my grandmother got into the back of the taxi and sat down and put me on her lap are we going home i asked her yes she answered back to norway hooray i cried oh hooray hooray hooray i thought youd like that she said but what about our luggage who cares about luggage she said the taxi was driving through the streets of bournemouth and this was the time of day when the pavements were crowded with holidaymakers all wandering about aimlessly with nothing to do how are you feeling my darling my grandmother said fine i said quite marvellous she began stroking the fur on the back of my neck with one finger we have accomplished great feats today she said its been terrific i said absolutely terrific the heart of a mouse it was lovely to be back m norway once again in my grandmothers fine old house but now that i was so small everything looked different and it took me quite a while to find my way around mine was a world of carpets and tablelegs and chairlegs and the little crannies behind large pieces of furniture a closed door could not be opened and nothing could be reached that was on a table but after a few days my grandmother began to invent gadgets for me in order to make life a bit easier she got a carpenter to put together a number of slim tall stepladders and she placed one of these against each table in the house so that i could climb up whenever i wanted to she herself invented a wonderful dooropening device made out of wires and springs and pulleys with heavy weights dangling on cords and soon every door in the house had a dooropener on it all i had to do was to press my front paws on to a tiny wooden platform and hey presto a spring would stretch and a weight would drop and the door would swing open next she rigged up an equally ingenious system whereby i could switch on the light whenever i entered a room at night i cannot explain how it worked because i know nothing about electricity but there was a little button let into the floor near the door in every room in the house and when i pressed the button gently with one paw the light would come on when i pressed it a second time the light would go off again my grandmother made me a tiny toothbrush using matchstick for the handle and into this she stuck little bits of bristle that she had snipped off one of her hairbrushes you must not get any holes in your teeth she said i cant take a mouse to a dentist hed think i was crazy its funny i said but ever since i became a mouse ive hated the taste of sweets and chocolate so i dont think ill get any holes you are still going to brush your teeth after every meal my grandmother said and i did for a bathtub she gave me a silver sugarbasin and i bathed in it every night before going to bed she allowed no one else into the house not even a servant or a cook we kept entirely to ourselves and we were very happy in each others company one evening as i lay on my grandmothers lap in front of the fire she said to me i wonder what happened to that little bruno i wouldnt be surprised if his father gave him to the hallporter to drown in the firebucket i answered im afraid you may be right my grandmother said the poor little thing we were silent for a few minutes my grandmother puffing away at her black cigar while i dozed comfortably in the warmth can i ask you something grandmamma i said ask me anything you like my darling how long does a mouse live ah she said ive been waiting for you to ask me that there was a silence she sat there smoking away and gazing at the fire well i said how long do we live us mice i have been reading about mice she said i have been trying to find out everything i can about them go on then grandmamma why dont you tell me if you really want to know she said im afraid a mouse doesnt live for a very long time how long i asked well an ordinary mouse only lives for about three years she said but you are not an ordinary mouse you are a mouseperson and that is a very different matter how different i asked how long does a mouseperson live grandmamma longer she said much longer how much longer i asked a mouseperson will almost certainly live for three times as long as an ordinary mouse my grandmother said about nine years good i cried thats great its the best news ive ever had why do you say that she asked surprised because i would never want to live longer than you i said i couldnt stand being looked after by anybody else there was a short silence she had a way of fondling me behind the ears with the tip of one finger it felt lovely how old are you grandmamma i asked im eightysix she said will you live another eight or nine years i might she said with a bit of luck youve got to i said because by then ill be a very old mouse and youll be a very old grandmother and soon after that well both die together that would be perfect she said i had a little doze after that i just shut my eyes and thought of nothing and felt at peace with the world would you like me to tell you something about yourself that is very interesting my grandmother said yes please grandmamma i said without opening my eyes i couldnt believe it at first but apparently its quite true she said what is it i asked the heart of a mouse she said and that means your heart is beating at the rate of five hundred times a minute isnt that amazing thats not possible i said opening my eyes wide its as true as im sitting here she said its a sort of a miracle thats nearly nine beats every second i cried working it out in my head correct she said your heart is going so fast its impossible to hear the separate beats all one hears is a soft humming sound she was wearing a lace dress and the lace kept tickling my nose i had to rest my head on my front paws have you ever heard my heart humming away grandmamma i asked her often she said i hear it when you are lying very close to me on the pillow at night the two of us remained silent in front of the fire for a long time after that thinking about these wonderful things my darling she said at last are you sure you dont mind being a mouse for the rest of your life i dont mind at all i said it doesnt matter who you are or what you look like so long as somebody loves you its off to work we go for supper that evening my grandmother had a plain omelette and one slice of bread i had a piece of that brown norwegian goats milk cheese known as gjetost which i had loved even when i was a boy we ate in front of the fire my grandmother in her armchair and me on the table with my cheese on a small plate grandmamma i said now that we have done away with the grand high witch will all the other witches in the world gradually disappear im quite sure they wont she answered i stopped chewing and stared at her but they must i cried surely they must im afraid not she said but if shes not there any longer how are they going to get all the money they need and who is going to give them orders and jazz them up at the annual meetings and invent all their magic formulas for them when a queen bee dies there is always another queen in the hive ready to take her place my grandmother said its the same with witches in the great headquarters where the grand high witch lives there is always another grand high witch waiting in the wings to take over should anything happen oh no i cried that means everything we did was for nothing have i become a mouse for nothing at all we saved the children of england she said i dont call that nothing i know i know i cried but thats not nearly good enough i felt sure that all the witches of the world would slowly fade away after we had got rid of their leader now you tell me that everything is going to go on just the same as before not exactly as before my grandmother said for instance there are no longer any witches in england thats quite a triumph isnt it but what about the rest of the world i cried what about america and france and holland and germany and what about norway you must not think i have been sitting back and doing nothing these last few days she said i have been giving a great deal of thought and time to that particular problem i was looking up at her face when she said this and all at once i noticed that a little secret smile was beginning to spread slowly around her eyes and the corners of her mouth why are you smiling grandmamma i asked her i have some rather interesting news for you she said what news shall i tell it to you right from the beginning yes please i said i like good news she had finished her omelette and i had had enough of my cheese she wiped her lips with a napkin and said as soon as we arrived back in norway i picked up the telephone and made a call to england who in england grandmamma to the chief of police in bournemouth my darling i told him i was the chief of police for the whole of norway and that i was interested in the peculiar happenings that had taken place recently in the hotel magnificent now hang on a sec grandmamma i said theres no way an english policeman is going to believe that you are the head of the norwegian police i am very good at imitating a mans voice she said of course he believed me the policeman in bournemouth was honoured to get a call from the chief of police for the whole of norway so what did you ask him i asked him for the name and address of the lady who had been living in room in the hotel magnificent the one who disappeared you mean the grand high witch i cried yes my darling and did he give it to you naturally he gave it to me one policeman will always help another policeman by golly youve got a nerve grandmamma i wanted her address my grandmother said but did he know her address he did indeed they had found her passport in her room and her address was in it it was also in the hotel register everyone who stays in an hotel has to put a name and address in the book but surely the grand high witch wouldnt have put her real name and address in the hotel register i said why ever not my grandmother said nobody in the world had the faintest idea who she was except the other witches wherever she went people simply knew her as a nice lady you my darling and you alone were the only nonwitch ever to see her with her mask off even in her home district in the village where she lived people knew her as a kindly and very wealthy baroness who gave large sums of money to charity i have checked up on that i was getting excited now and that address you got grandmamma that must have been the secret headquarters of the grand high witch it still is my grandmother said and that will be where the new grand high witch is certain to be living at this very moment with her retinue of special assistant witches important rulers are always surrounded by a large retinue of assistants where is her headquarters grandmamma i cried tell me quick where it is it is a castle my grandmother said and the fascinating thing is that in that castle will be all the names and addresses of all the witches in the world how else could a grand high witch run her business how else could she summon the witches of the various countries to their annual meetings where is the castle grandmamma i cried impatiently which country tell me quick guess she said norway i cried right first time she answered high up in the mountains above a small village this was thrilling news i did a little dance of excitement on the tabletop my grandmother was getting pretty worked up herself and now she heaved herself out of her chair and began pacing up and down the room thumping the carpet with her stick so we have work to do you and i she cried out we have a great task ahead of us thank heavens you are a mouse a mouse can go anywhere all ill have to do is put you down somewhere near the grand high witchs castle and you will very easily be able to get inside it and creep around looking and listening to your hearts content i will i will i answered no one will ever see me moving about in a big castle will be childs play compared with going into a crowded kitchen full of cooks and waiters you could spend days in there if necessary my grandmother cried in her excitement she was waving her stick all over the place and suddenly she knocked over a tall and very beautiful vase that went crashing on to the floor and smashed into a million pieces forget it she said its only ming you could spend weeks in that castle if you wanted to and theyd never know you were there i myself would get a room in the village and you could sneak out of the castle and have supper with me every night and tell me what was going on i could i could i cried out and inside the castle i could go snooping around simply everywhere but your main job of course my grandmother said would be to destroy every witch in the place that really would be the end of the whole organisation me destroy them i cried how could i do that cant you guess she said tell me i said mousemaker my grandmother shouted formula delayed action mousemaker all over again you will feed it to everyone in the castle by putting drops of it into their food you do remember the recipe dont you every bit of it i answered you mean were going to make it ourselves why not she cried if they can make it so can we its just a question of knowing what goes into it whos going to climb up the tall trees to get the gruntles eggs i asked her i will she cried ill do it myself theres plenty of life in this old dog yet i think id better do that part of it grandmamma you might come a cropper those are just details she cried waving her stick again we shall let nothing stand in our way and what happens after that i asked her after the new grand high witch and everyone else in the castle have been turned into mice then the castle will be completely empty and i shall come in and join you and wait i cried hold on grandmamma ive just had a nasty thought what nasty thought she said when the mousemaker turned me into a mouse i said i didnt become just any old ordinary mouse that you catch with mousetraps i became a talking thinking intelligent mouseperson who wouldnt go near a mousetrap my grandmother stopped dead in her tracks she already knew what was coming next therefore i went on if we use the mousemaker to turn the new grand high witch and all the other witches in the castle into mice the whole place will be swarming with very clever very nasty very dangerous talking thinking mousewitches theyll all be witches in mouses clothing and that i added could be very horrible indeed by golly youre right she cried that never occurred to me i couldnt possibly take on a castleful of mousewitches i said nor could i she said theyd have to be got rid of at once theyd have to be smashed and bashed and chopped up into little pieces exactly as they were in the hotel magnificent im not doing that i said i couldnt anyway i dont think you could either grandmamma and mousetraps wouldnt be the slightest use by the way i added the grand high witch who did me in was wrong about mousetraps wasnt she yes yes my grandmother said impatiently but im not concerned with that grand high witch shes been chopped up long ago by the hotel chef its the new grand high witch weve got to deal with now the one up in the castle and all her assistants a grand high witch is bad enough when shes disguised as a lady but just think of what she could do if she were a mouse she could go anywhere ive got it i shouted leaping about a foot in the air ive got the answer tell me my grandmother snapped the answer is cats i shouted bring on the cats my grandmother stared at me then a great grin spread over her face and she shouted its brilliant absolutely brilliant shove halfadozen cats into that castle i cried and theyll kill every mouse in the place in five minutes i dont care how clever they are youre a magician my grandmother shouted starting to wave her stick about once again look out for the vases grandmamma to heck with the vases she shouted im so thrilled i dont care if i break the lot just one thing i said youve got to make absolutely sure im well out of the way myself before you put the cats in thats a promise she said what will we do after the cats have killed all the mice i asked her ill take all the cats back to the village and then you and i will have the castle completely to ourselves and then i said then we shall go through the records and get the names and addresses of all the witches in the whole wide world and after that i said quivering with excitement after that my darling the greatest task of all will begin for you and me we shall pack our bags and go travelling all over the world in every country we visit we shall seek out the houses where the witches are living we shall find each house
