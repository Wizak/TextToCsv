witness in death j d robb chapter one there was always an audience for murder whether it took its form in horror or glee in dark humor or quiet grief mankinds fascination with the ultimate crime made it a ripe subject for exploration in fact and in fiction at its bottom line murder sold tickets and had packed theaters throughout history romans had pushed and shoved their way into the coliseum to watch gladiators hack each other to bloody bits or to alleviate the boredom of the day by catching a matinee where a few hapless christians were pitted against happytooblige lions for the amusement of a cheering audience since the outcome of these uneven matches was pretty much a sure bet the crowd hadnt packed the stands to see if maybe this time the christians would win the day they wanted the results and all the blood and gore they offered people could go home pleased that theyd gotten their moneys worth and more that they themselves were alive and whole vicarious murder was a simple way of reassuring yourself that your personal problems werent really so bad after all human nature and the need for such entertainment hadnt changed very much in a millennium or two lions and christians might have been passe but in the last gasp of winter in the year murder still sold strong and bumped the ratings in the media in a more civilized way of course families wooing couples the sophisticated and their country cousins continued to queue up and plunk down hardearned credits to be entertained by the idea of murder crime and punishment was lieutenant eve dallass business and murder was her specialty but tonight she sat in a comfortable seat in a packed house and watched the canny business of murder play out onstage he did it hmm roarke was every bit as interested in his wifes reaction to the play as he was the play itself she leaned forward in her chair her arms crossed on the gleaming rail of the owners box her brandycolored eyes scanned the stage the players even as the curtain came down for intermission the vole guy he killed the woman bashed her head in for her money right roarke took the time to pour them each a glass of the champagne he had chilling he hadnt been certain how shed react to an evening with murder as the entertainment and was pleased shed gotten into the spirit perhaps you dont have to tell me i know eve took the flute glass studied his face and a hell of a face it was she thought it seemed to have been carved by magic into a staggering male beauty that made a womans glands hum a happy tune the dark mane of hair framed it those long sculpted bones the firm full mouth that was curved now in the faintest of smiles as he watched her he reached out ever so casually to skim those long fingers over the ends of her hair and those eyes that brilliant almost burning blue could still make her heart stumble it was mortifying the way the man could turn her inside out with no more than a look what are you staring at i like looking at you the simple phrase delivered with that musical hint of ireland was a power all its own yeah she angled her head relaxed by the idea of having the entire evening to do nothing but be with him enjoy him she let him nibble on her knuckles so you want to fool around amused he set his glass down and watching her ran his hand up the long line of her leg to where the slit in her narrow skirt ended at the hip pervert cut it out you asked you have no shame but she laughed and handed him back his glass half the people in this fancy joint of yours have their spyglasses on this box everybody wants a look at roarke theyre looking at my very nifty wife the homicide cop who brought me down she sneered at that as he knew she would it gave him the opening to lean over and sink his teeth lightly into her soft bottom lip keep it up she warned well have to sell tickets were still basically newlyweds its perfectly acceptable for newlyweds to neck in public places like you care about whats acceptable she put a hand on his chest nudged him back to a safe distance so youve packed them in tonight i guess you figured you would she turned back to look out on the audience again she didnt know much about architecture or design but the place dripped with class she imagined roarke had employed the best minds and talents available to rehab the old building into its former glory people wandered in and out of the enormous multilevel theater during the break and the sound of their voices rose in a low roar of humanity some were dressed to kill so to speak others were decked out in the casual wear of airboots and oversized retro flak jackets that were all the rage that winter with its soaring muraled ceilings its miles of red carpet and acres of gilt the theater itself had been redone to roarkes exacting specifications everything he owned was done to his specifications and eve thought he owned damn near everything that could be owned in the known universe it was something she still wasnt used to something she doubted shed ever be fully comfortable with but that was roarke and theyd taken each other for better or worse in the year since theyd met theyd had more than their share of both its a hell of a place youve got here pal i didnt get the full punch of it from the holomodels models only provide the structure and elements of ambiance a theater needs people the smell and sound of them to have impact ill take your word for it what made you pick this play for the opening its a compelling story and i think has timeless themes as the best stories do love betrayal murder all in a layered and untidy package and its a stellar cast and it all has your stamp on it still leonard voles guilty she narrowed her eyes at the shimmering redandgold drawn curtain as if she could see through it to measure and judge his wifes a very cool customer with some trick up her sleeve the lawyer guys good barrister roarke corrected the play takes place in london midtwentieth century barristers plead criminal cases in that particular system whatever the costumes are cool and authentic circa when witness for the prosecution came out on film it was a huge hit and its proven an enduring one they had a stellar cast then too he had it on disc of course roarke had a particular fondness for the blackandwhite films of the early and midtwentieth century some saw blackandwhite as simple and clear cut he saw shadows that he thought his wife would understand very well theyve done a good job casting actors who reflect the original players while maintaining their own style he told her well have to watch the movie sometime so you can judge for yourself he too scanned the theater however much he enjoyed an evening out with his wife he was a businessman the play was an investment i think were in for a good long run with this hey theres mira eve leaned forward as she spotted the police psychologist elegant as always in a winterwhite sheath shes with her husband and it looks like a couple of other people would you like me to get a message down to her we could invite them for a drink after curtain eve opened her mouth then slid her gaze to roarkes profile no not tonight ive got other plans do you yeah got a problem with that none whatsoever he topped off their wine now we have a few minutes before the next act why dont you tell me why youre so sure leonard vole is guilty too slick not to be not slick like you she added and made roarke grin his is a what do you call it a veneer your slick goes down to the bone darling you flatter me anyway this guys an operator and he does a good job with the honest innocent act of a hopeful trusting man whos down on his luck but greatlooking guys with beautiful wives dont piddle time away with older much less attractive women unless they have an agenda and his goes a lot deeper than selling some goofy kitchen tool he invented she sipped her champagne settling back as the houselights flickered to signal the end of intermission the wife knows he did it shes the key not him shes the study if i were investigating shes the one id be looking into yeah id have myself a nice long talk with christine vole then the plays working for you its pretty clever when the curtain rose roarke watched eve instead of the courtroom drama she was he thought the most fascinating of women a few hours before shed come home with blood on her shirt fortunately not her own the case that caused it had opened and closed almost immediately with the dead she stood for and a confession shed drawn out within an hour of the crime itself it wasnt always that simplistic he supposed that was the word hed seen her drive herself to exhaustion risk her life to bring justice to the dead it was only one of the myriad facets of her he admired now she was here for him dressed in sleek and elegant black her only jewelry the diamond hed once given her dripping like a tear between her breasts and her wedding ring her hair was short a careless cap of dozens of shades of brown she watched the play with those cool cops eyes dissecting he imagined evidence motive and character just as she would a case that landed in her lap her mouth was unpainted she rarely remembered or thought of lip dye her strong face with its takemeon chin and its shallow cleft didnt need it he watched that mouth thin and those eyes narrow and gleam as the character of christine vole took the stand and betrayed the man shed called her husband shes up to something i told you she was up to something roarke danced his fingers over the back of eves neck so you did shes lying eve murmured not all the way pieces of lies where does the knife come into it so he cut himself with it its not a vital point the knifes a red herring not the murder weapon which by the way they havent introduced into evidence thats a flaw but if he cut himself slicing bread with the knife and everyone agrees he did why do they need it he either cut himself on purpose to explain the blood on his sleeves or by accident as he claims doesnt matter its smoke her brow furrowed oh hes good her voice lowered vibrated with the intense dislike shed developed for leonard vole look at him standing in the what is it the dock yeah standing in the dock looking all shocked and devastated by her testimony isnt he somethings off ill figure it out she liked putting her mind to it looking for the angles and the twists before her involvement with roarke shed never seen an actual live play shed passed some time in front of the screen had let her friend mavis drag her to a couple of holograph acts over the years but she had to admit watching live performers act out the scenes deliver the lines and make the moves took the whole entertainment aspect to a higher level there was something about sitting in the dark looking down on the action that made you a part of it while separating you just enough that you didnt have a real stake in the outcome it removed responsibility eve thought the foolish and wealthy widow whod gotten her skull bashed in wasnt looking to lieutenant eve dallas to find the answers that made looking for those answers an interesting game if roarke had his way and it was rarely otherwise that rich widow would die six nights a week and during two matinees for a very very long time for the amusement and entertainment of an audience of armchair detectives hes not worth it she muttered drawn in by the action enough to be annoyed by the characters shes sacrificing herself performing for the jury so they look at her as an opportunist a user a coldhearted bitch because she loves him and hes not worth a damn one would assume roarke commented that shes just betrayed him and hung him out to dry uhuh shes turned the case on its ear shifted it so that shes the villain whos the jury looking at now shes the center and hes just a sap damn smart thinking if he was worth it but hes not does she figure that out watch and see just tell me if im right he leaned over kissed her cheek no no im not right no im not telling and if you keep talking youll miss the subtleties and the dialogue she scowled at him but fell silent to watch the rest of the drama unfold she rolled her eyes when the not guilty verdict was read juries she thought you couldnt depend on them in fiction or in real life a panel of twelve decent cops would have convicted the bastard she started to say so then watched christine vole fight her way through a crowd of spectators who wanted her blood into the nearly empty courtroom eve nodded pleased when the character confessed her lies and deceptions to voles barrister she knew he was guilty she knew it and she lied to save him idiot hell brush himself off and dump her now you watch eve turned her head at roarkes laugh whats so funny i have a feeling dame christie would have liked you who the hell is that ssh here he comes watch him gloat leonard vole crossed the courtroom set flaunting his acquittal and the slinky brunette on his arm another woman eve thought big surprise she felt both pity and frustration for christine as she threw herself into voles arms tried to cling she watched his arrogance christines shock and disbelief sir wilfreds anger it was no less no more than she expected however well played and then she came straight up out of her chair son of a bitch down girl delighted roarke dragged eve back into her seat while onstage christine vole plunged the knife shed snatched from the evidence table into her husbands black heart son of a bitch eve said again i didnt see it coming she executed him yes roarke thought agatha christie would have enjoyed his eve sir wilfred echoed those precise words as people rushed out onstage to huddle over the body to draw christine vole away somethings wrong again eve pushed to her feet and now her blood was humming to a different beat this time she gripped the rail tight in both hands her eyes riveted to the stage somethings wrong how do we get down there eve its a performance somebodys not acting she shoved the chair out of her way and strode out of the box just as roarke noted one of the kneeling extras scramble to his feet and stare at the blood on his hand he caught up with eve grabbed her arm this way theres an elevator itll take us straight down to backstage he keyed in a code from somewhere down below a woman began to scream is that part of the script eve demanded as they stepped into the elevator no okay she dug her communicator out of her evening bag this is dallas lieutenant eve i need a medivac unit new globe theater broadway and thirtyeighth condition and injury as yet unknown she tossed the communicator back in her bag as the elevator opened onto chaos get these people back and under control i dont want any of the cast or crew to leave the building can you get me a head count ill take care of it they separated with eve shoving her way through to the stage someone had had the presence of mind to drop the curtain but behind it were a dozen people in various stages of hysteria step back she snapped out the order we need a doctor the cooleyed blonde whod played voles wife stood with both hands clutched between her breasts there was blood staining her costume her hands oh my god somebody get a doctor but eve crouched beside the man sprawled facedown on the floor and knew it was too late for doctors she straightened dug out her badge im lieutenant dallas new york police and security i want everyone to step back dont touch anything dont remove anything from the stage area theres been an accident the actor who played sir wilfred had pulled off his barristers wig his stage makeup ran with sweat a terrible accident eve looked down at the pool of blood the goredtothehilt bread knife this is a crime scene i want you people to step back where the hell is security she tossed out a hand slapped it on the shoulder of the woman she still thought of as christine vole i said back when she spotted roarke come out of the wings with three men in uniform she signaled get these people offstage i want them sequestered youve got dressing rooms or whatever get them stashed and keep the guards on them that goes for crew as well hes dead that or he wins best actor award for the century we need to move the audience along to a safe area keep it controlled go ahead and make it happen see if you can find out if miras still around i could use her i killed him the blonde staggered back two steps holding up her bloody hands staring at them i killed him she said again and fainted great terrific roarke ill take care of it you she jabbed a finger at one of the guards start moving these people into dressing rooms keep them there you she ordered the second guard start rounding up the crew the techs i want the doors secured nobody comes in nobody goes out a woman began to sob several men began to argue in raised voices eve counted to five lifted her badge in the air and shouted now listen up this is a police investigation anyone refusing to follow the directives will be interfering with that investigation and will find themselves transported to the nearest station house where they will be kept in holding i want this stage cleared and cleared now lets move the brunette with the bit part as voles tootsie gracefully stepped over the unconscious christine a couple of you big strong men pick up our leading lady will you i need a goddamn drink she glanced around her eyes cool clear and green is that allowed lieutenant as long as its not on my crime scene satisfied eve pulled out her communicator dallas lieutenant eve once more she crouched beside the body i need a crime scene unit dispatched immediately o o eve doctor mira hurried across the stage roarke told me she trailed off looked down at the body good lord she let out a long breath shifted her gaze back to eve what can i do right now you can stand by i dont have a field kit peabodys on the way and ive sent for the crime scene team and the me but until they get here youre both the doctor onscene and a designated police and security official sorry to screw up your evening mira shook her head started to kneel by the body no watch the blood youll contaminate my scene and ruin your dress how did it happen you tell me we all watched it using my acute powers of observation i identify that knife as the murder weapon eve spread her hands i dont even have a damn can of sealit where the hell is peabody frustrated that she couldnt begin a true examination or investigation without her tools she spun around and spotted roarke would you hold here for me dr mira without waiting for an answer eve strode stage left tell me the bit with the knife in the last scene how does it work she asked roarke dummy knife the blade retracts when its pressed against a solid surface not this time eve murmured the victim whats his real name richard draco a very hot property i suppose hes cooled off considerably now how well did you know him not well ive met him socially a few times but primarily i knew his work roarke tucked his hands in his pockets and rocked back on his heels as he studied dracos stunned and staring eyes hes a fourtime tony award winner garnered excellent reviews in the films hes done hes a top box office draw stage and screen and has been so for a number of years he has a rep roarke continued for being difficult arrogant and childish juggles women enjoys a certain amount of chemical enhancements that might not meet the police departments code the woman who killed him areena mansfield brilliant actress a rare untemperamental type and dedicated to her art very well respected in theater circles she lives and works primarily in london but was persuaded to relocate to new york for this role by who partially by me weve known each other for a number of years and no he added dipping his hands in his pockets again ive never slept with her i didnt ask that yes you did okay if i did well have the followup why havent you slept with her a faint smile lifted his mouth initially because she was married then when she wasnt he ran a fingertip along the dent in eves chin i was my wife doesnt like me to sleep with other women shes very strict about it ill make a note of that she considered her options juggled them you know a lot of these people or have impressions of them anyway im going to want to talk to you later she sighed on the record of course is it possible this was an accident anythings possible i need to examine the knife and i cant touch the fucker until peabody gets here why dont you go back there do a pat and stroke on your people and keep your ears open are you asking me to assist in an official police investigation no i am not and despite the circumstances her lips wanted to quiver i just said keep your ears open she tapped a finger on his chest and stay out of my way im on duty she turned away as she heard the hard clop of what could only be policeissue shoes peabodys were shined to a painful gleam eve could spot across the length of the stage her winterweight uniform coat was buttoned to the throat of a sturdy body her cap sat precisely at the correct angle atop her dark straight hair they crossed the stage from opposite ends met at the body hi dr mira peabody glanced down at the body pursed her lips looks like a hell of an opening night eve held out a hand for her field kit record on peabody yes sir because it was warm under the stage lights peabody shrugged out of her coat folded it set it aside she clipped her recorder to the collar of her uniform jacket record on she said as eve coated her hands and evening shoes with sealit dallas lieutenant eve onscene stage set of new globe theater also in attendance peabody officer delia and mira dr charlotte victim is richard draco mixed race male late forties to early fifties she tossed the sealit to peabody cause of death stabbing single wound visual exam and minimal amount of blood indicate a heart wound she crouched and with her coated fingers picked up the knife wound inflicted by what appears to be a common kitchen knife serrated blade approximately eight inches in length ill measure and bag lieutenant not yet eve murmured she examined the knife dug out microgoggles examined it again from hilt to tip initial exam reveals no mechanism for retracting the blade on impact this is no prop knife she shoved the goggles up so they rested on the top of her head no prop knife no accident she passed the knife to peabodys sealed hand its homicide chapter two i could use you eve said to mira while the sweepers worked over the crime scene dracos body was already bagged tagged and on its way to the morgue what can i do for you weve got a couple of dozen uniforms logging names and addresses of audience members she didnt want to think about the manhours the mountains of paperwork that would go into interviewing over two thousand witnesses but i want to start the interview process on the main players before i kick them clear for the night i dont want anybody lawyering on me until i get a better handle on the setup right out in the open eve thought as she studied the stage the set the tiers after tiers of plush velvet seats that had held a rapt audience someone was cool and cocky and smart people are comfortable with you she went on i want areena mansfield comfortable ill do what i can appreciate it peabody youre with me eve crossed the stage moved into the wings there were uniforms scattered throughout the backstage area civilians were either tucked behind closed doors or huddled in miserable little groups what do you give our chances of keeping the media locked out of this until morning peabody glanced over at eve id say zero but thats optimistic yeah officer eve signaled a uniform i want guards posted at every entrance every exit already done sir i want the guards inside nobody leaves the building not even a cop nobody comes in especially reporters clear yes sir a corridor bent off the wing narrowed eve scanned the door vaguely amused by the gold stars affixed to several of them name plaques were displayed as well she stopped by the door marked for areena mansfield knocked briefly then walked in she only lifted her eyebrows when she saw roarke sitting on a royal blue daybed holding areenas hand the actress had yet to remove her stage makeup and though tears had ravaged it she was still stunning her eyes darted to eve and were instantly full of fear oh god oh my god am i going to be arrested i need to ask you some questions ms mansfield they wouldnt let me change they said i couldnt his blood her hands fluttered in front of her costume fisted i cant stand it im sorry dr mira would you help miss mansfield out of her costume peabody will bag it of course roarke outside please eve stepped back to the door opened it dont worry areena the lieutenant will sort this out after giving areenas hand a comforting squeeze he rose and walked by eve i asked you to keep your ears open not to cozy up with one of my suspects trying to keep a hysterical woman lucid isnt particularly cozy he blew out a breath i could use a very large brandy well go home and have one i dont know how long ill be i believe i can find what i need here just go home she said again theres nothing for you to do here as im not one of your suspects he added in a quiet voice and i own this theater i believe i can come and go as i please he ran a finger down her cheek and strolled off you always do she muttered then went back into the dressing room it seemed to eve that dressing room was a lowly term for a space so large so lush a long creamtoned counter held a forest of pots tubes wands bottles all arranged with soldierly precision over it all gleamed a wide triple mirror ringed with slim white lights there was the daybed several cozy chairs a fullsized autochef and friggie unit a trim minicommunication system wardrobe hung in a long closet area open now so that eve noted the costumes and street clothes were as precisely arranged as the makeup on every table in groupings on the floor were flowers the overfragranced air made eve think of weddings and funerals thank you thank you so much areena shivered slightly as mira helped her into a long white robe i dont know how much longer i could have stood id like to clean off my makeup her hand reached for her throat id like to feel like myself go ahead eve made herself comfortable in one of the chairs this interview will be recorded do you understand i dont understand anything with a sigh areena sat on the padded stool in front of her makeup mirror my mind seems numb as if everythings happening one step after it should be its a very normal reaction mira assured her it often helps to talk about the event that caused the shock to go over the details of it so they can be dealt with set aside yes i suppose youre right shifting her gaze in the mirror she watched eve you have to ask me questions and it has to be on the record all right i want to get it done record on peabody dallas lieutenant eve in interview with mansfield areena in subjects dressing room at the new globe theater also present are peabody officer delia and dr charlotte mira while areena creamed off her stage makeup eve recited the revised miranda do you understand your rights and responsibilities miss mansfield yes its another part of the nightmare she closed her eyes tried to envision a pure white field tranquil serene and could see only blood is he really dead is richard really dead yes i killed him i stabbed him the shudder ran from her shoulders down a dozen times she said opening her eyes again to meet eves in the center of the triple mirror at least a dozen times we rehearsed that scene we choreographed it so carefully for the biggest impact what went wrong why didnt the knife retract the first hint of anger showed in her eyes how could this have happened take me through it the scene youre christine youve protected him lied for him youve ruined yourself for him then after all that he blows you off flaunts another woman a younger woman in your face i loved him he was my obsession my lover my husband my child all in one she lifted her shoulders above all else christine loved leonard vole she knew what he was what he did but it didnt matter she would have died for him so deep and obsessive was her love calmer now areena tossed the used tissues into her recycle chute turned on the stool her face was marble pale her eyes red and swollen and still she radiated beauty in that moment every woman in the audience understands her if they havent felt that kind of love in some part of themselves they wish they had so when she realizes that after all shes done he can discard her so casually when she fully understands what he is she grabs the knife areena lifted a fisted hand as if holding the hilt despair no she is a creature of action she is never passive its an instant an impulse but a bonedeep one she plunges the knife into him even as she embraces him love and hate both in their highest form both inside her in that one instant she stared at the hand shed flung out and it began to tremble god god in a frantic move she yanked open a drawer of her dressing table eve was on her feet her hand clamped over areenas wrist in a flash i it a cigarette she managed i know im not supposed to smoke in the building but i want a cigarette she pushed at eves hand i want a damn cigarette eve glanced in the drawer saw the pricey tenpack of herbals were on the record youll get an automatic fine but she stepped back my nerves she fumbled with the lighter until mira stepped over gently pried it from her fingers and flicked it on thanks okay areena took a deep drag blew it out slowly im sorry im not usually so fragile the theater smashes the fragile to bits and quickly youre doing very well mira kept her voice low calm talking it through with lieutenant dallas will help i dont know what to say areena stared back at mira with the trust eve had wanted to see radiating in her eyes it just happened when you picked up the knife eve interrupted did you notice anything different different areena blinked as she focused on eve again no it was exactly where it was supposed to be hilt toward me to make the movement fast and smooth i swept it up to give the audience that one shocked instant to see the blade the lightings designed to catch it to glint off the edges then i charged its only two steps from the table to richard i take his right arm between the elbow and the shoulder with my left hand holding him draw back with the right then the impact she said after another long drag of the prop knife against his chest releases the pack of stage blood we hold there for an instant just two beats intimately before the others onstage rush forward to pull me away what was your relationship with richard draco what areenas eyes had glazed your relationship with draco tell me about it with richard areena pressed her lips together her hand running up between her breasts to massage the base of her throat as if words were stuck there like burrs weve known each other several years worked with each other before and well most recently in a london production of twice owned and personally there was a hesitation less than a half beat but eve noticed and filed it away we were friendly enough areena told her as i said weve known each other for years the media in london played up a romance between us during that last work the play was a romance we enjoyed the benefit of the interest it sold tickets i was married at the time but that didnt discourage the public from seeing us as a couple we were amused by it but never acted on it i was married and smart enough lieutenant to know richard wasnt the kind of man to throw out a marriage for because hes a fine actor was she corrected swallowed hard before she drew one last time on her cigarette he wasnt a particularly fine human being oh that sounds vicious horrible her hand lifted to her throat again fingers restless against flesh i feel vicious and horrible saying it but i i want to be as honest as i can im afraid im terrified youll think that i meant this to happen at the moment i dont think anything i want you to tell me about richard draco all right all right she drew in a breath sucked on the cigarette as if it were a straw others will say it in any case richard was very selfinterested and egocentric as many most of us are in this business i didnt hold it against him and i jumped at the chance to work with him in this play are you aware of anyone else who believing him not a particularly fine human being might have held that against him i imagine richard insulted or offended everyone attached to this production at one time or another she pressed a fingertip to the inside corner of her eye as if to relieve some pressure certainly there were bruised feelings complaints mutters and grudges thats theater o o the theater as far as eve was concerned was a screwy business people wept copiously gave rambling monologues when any halfwit lawyer would have advised them to say yes no and shut the hell up they expounded they expanded and a great many of them managed to turn the death of an associate into a drama where they themselves held a starring role ninety percent bullshit peabody i guess peabody crossed the backstage area trying to look everywhere at once but its kind of cool all those lights and the holoboard and therere some really mag costumes if youre into antique dont you think itd be amazing to be standing out front and having all those people watching you creepy were going to have to let some of these people go before they start whining about their civil rights i hate when that happens eve smirked scanned her memo pad so far were getting an interesting picture of the victim nobody really wants to say so but he was well disliked even when they dont want to say so they do anyway while they dab tears from their eyes im going to look around back here go ahead and have the uniforms cut these people loose make sure we have all pertinent data on them that theyre issued the standard warning set up interviews for tomorrow at central or in the field lets keep it light and go to them for now after youve set them up youre relieved meet me at central at oh eight hundred peabody shifted her feet are you going home eventually i can hang until you do no point in it well do better with a fresh start tomorrow just scramble the interviews in i want to talk to as many people as possible as soon as possible and i want a followup with areena mansfield yes sir great dress she added as she tucked her memo log away youre going to have to get the blood and sweeper gunk off the skirt before it sets in eve looked down scowled at the elegant black column damn it i hate not being dressed for the job she turned strode deeper backstage where a uniform stood by a huge locked cabinet key she held out a hand while the uniform took out a key in an evidence bag anybody try to get in this thing the prop master came back old guy pretty shaky but he didnt give me any hassle fine go out front and tell the sweepers theyll be cleared to run this area in about ten minutes yes sir alone eve unlocked the cabinet and pulled the double doors open she frowned noting the box of cigars the oldfashioned telephone and a few other items neatly arranged in an area marked sir wilfreds office another section held props that had been used in the bar scene the courtroom section was empty apparently the prop master was very careful about replacing and arranging his props and did so directly after the scene where they were needed was wrapped someone that meticulous wouldnt have mistaken a kitchen knife for a dummy lieutenant dallas eve glanced back and saw the young brunette from the last act moving from the shadows of the wings into the lights of backstage shed changed from her costume and wore a simple black jumpsuit her hair had been combed out of its tight waves and fell straight and richly brown down the center of her back i hope im not disturbing your work she had the faintest accent soft and southern and an easy smile on her face as she walked closer i was hoping to have a word with you your aide told me i was free to go for the moment thats right eve cast her mind back over the program shed scanned after the murder miss landsdowne carly landsdowne diane in this tragic production she shifted her large blue eyes to the cabinet i hope you dont think pete had anything to do with what happened to richard old pete wouldnt hurt a fly if it was buzzing in his ear pete would be the property master yes and as harmless as they come that cant be said for everyone in this little circus obviously is there something specific you want only to say what i doubt most of the others will at least initially everyone hated richard including you oh absolutely she said it with a brilliant smile hed step on your lines every chance he got cut off your mark anything that would draw the attention onto him and off anyone else offstage he was a vicious little worm his world revolved around one thing his own ego she gave a delicate shrug youll hear it from someone eventually so i thought it would be best if you heard it from me we were lovers for a brief period it ended a couple of weeks ago in a nasty little scene richard was fond of nasty little scenes and staged this one for the biggest impact during our first full dress rehearsal i take it he broke things off he did she said it carelessly but the gleam in those green eyes told eve the resentment still simmered he went out of his way to charm me and once i was charmed he went out of his way to humiliate me in front of the cast and crew this was my first broadway production she glanced around and though her lips were curved the smile was sharp as broken glass i was green lieutenant but i ripen fast i wont bother to say im sorry hes dead but i will say i dont think he was worth killing were you in love with him i dont have room for love at this point in my career but i was dazzled much i think as my character was dazzled by leonard vole i doubt theres anyone involved in this production who didnt have some grudge against richard i wanted to be up front about mine i appreciate that you said he humiliated you in what way in his last scene the one where i come down with him into the courtroom and he confronts christine he broke off my lines to her stormed around the stage claiming my delivery was flat her lips compressed her eyes slitted he compared its lack of passion and style to my performance in bed he called me a brainless rube who was trying to trade her lack of talent on mildly attractive looks and a good pair of breasts carly brushed back her hair a lazy gesture in direct contrast with the bright fury in her eyes he said i was boring and while id amused him for a while if i couldnt pretend to act in my minor capacity hed see i was replaced with someone who could and this came as a complete surprise to you he was a snake snakes strike quickly because theyre cowards i gave back a few shots but they werent my best i wasnt prepared and i was embarrassed richard stalked offstage locked himself in his dressing room the assistant director went off to try to placate him and we ran the scene again with richards standin whos the standin michael proctor hes very good by the way and if the play goes back into production would he step into the part thats a question for the producers i imagine but it wouldnt surprise me at least in the short term i appreciate the information miss landsdowne and that much information unbidden was always suspect ive got nothing to hide she moved her shoulders again and kept those big green eyes on eves face and if i did i imagine youd dig it out ive heard quite a bit about roarkes cop wife over the last few months it took a certain arrogance dont you think to choose a night youd be in the audience to do murder arrogance is required to take anothers life ill be in touch miss landsdowne i dont doubt it eve waited until the woman was nearly to the wings one thing yes you dont care much for areena mansfield either i dont have strong feelings about her one way or the other carly tilted her head lifted one eyebrow in a high arch why do you ask you werent very sympathetic when she fainted the smile came back bright enough to play to the back rows a damn graceful faint wasnt it actors lieutenant dallas you cant trust them with a casual toss of her hair she made her exit so eve murmured whos performing lieutenant one of the sweepers a young freshfaced woman marched up to eve her baggy protective jumpsuit made little swishing noises with each step got a little toy here i think youll want to take a look at well well eve took the evidence bag pursed her lips as she studied the knife through the clear plastic she fingered the tip of the blade felt it retract whered you find this ah she scanned the name stitched on the breast of the dull gray jumpsuit lombowsky in a vase full of genuine longstemmed red roses nice flowers the room was packed with them like it was a state funeral or something areena mansfields dressing room good work thanks lieutenant do you know where mansfield is shes in the cast lounge your mans with her peabody no sir your husband lombowsky waited until eve scowled down at the prop knife before she dared to raise her eyebrows it had been her first upclose look at roarke and she considered him worth two big eyesful finish the sweep lombowsky on it lieutenant eve strode offstage and caught peabody coming out of a dressing room ive got four of the interviews scheduled fine change of plan for tonight eve held up the dummy knife sweepers found this in mansfields dressing room tucked in with some roses you going to charge her her lawyerd get her bounced before i got her into central its awfully damn pat isnt it peabody she kills him in front of a packed house and stashes the prop knife in her own dressing room very neat or very stupid eve turned the evidence bag over in her hands lets see what she has to say about it wheres the cast lounge lower level we can take the stairs fine you know anything about actors sure freeagers are big on all the arts my mother did some little theater when i was coming up and two of my cousins are actors live stage work and small screen stuff and my greatgrandmother was a performance artist in san francisco before she retired then theres my okay all right shaking her head eve clattered down the stairs how did you stand all those people crowding into your life i like people peabody said cheerfully why since it wasnt a question that required an answer peabody gestured to the left as they came to the bottom of the steps you like them too you just pretend to be snarly i am snarly if and when i cut mansfield loose or she lawyers i want you to stick with her if she goes home settles in call for a couple of uniforms to watch her place weve got enough for a surveillance clearance i want to know where she goes and what she does want me to run the background check on her now no ill take care of it eve pulled open the door to the lounge as with anything roarke had his fingers in it was far from shabby obviously he wanted the talent comfortable and had spared no expense to insure it there were two separate seating areas with plush sofas flanked by serving droids the room bent into an ell with the short leg offering an autochef she assumed was fully stocked a clearfronted friggie holding a variety of cold drinks and a small separate table with a slick little computer setup roarke sat cozily to eves mind beside areena in the sitting area on the right swirling a snifter of brandy his gaze that lightningstrike blue shifted to his wifes face gleamed there and reminded her of the first time shed seen him facetoface he hadnt been babysitting a murder suspect then hed been one his lips curved in a lazy confident smile hello peabody he said but his eyes remained on eves face i have a few more questions for you miss mansfield areena blinked up at eve fluttered her hands oh but i thought we were finished for the evening roarkes just arranged my transportation back to my penthouse the transpo can wait record on peabody do you need me to refresh you on your rights and obligations as pertains to this investigation miss mansfield i the fluttering hand landed on her throat rested there no i just dont know what else i can tell you recognize this eve tossed the sealed prop knife onto the table between them it looks like her hand still restless reached out then fisted drew back its the dummy knife its the prop that should have been on the set when oh god where did you find it in your dressing room buried in red roses no no very slowly areena shook her head from side to side she crossed her arms over her breasts fingers digging into her shoulders thats not possible if it was an act eve mused it was damn good the eyes were glazed the lips and fingers trembled its not only possible its fact how did it get there i dont know i tell you i dont know in a sudden spurt of energy areena leaped to her feet her eyes werent glazed now but wild and wheeling someone put it there whoever switched the knives put it there they want me to be blamed for richard they want me to suffer for it wasnt it enough god wasnt it enough that i killed him she held out her hand a lady macbeth staring at blood already washed away why eves voice was cold and flat why not just toss the prop away into a corner a recycling bin why would anyone hide it in your dressing room i cant think who would hate me so much and richard tears shimmered fell gorgeously as she turned roarke you know me please help me tell her i couldnt do this terrible thing whatever the answers are shell find them he rose letting her come into his arms to weep as he watched his wife over her head you can be sure of it cant she lieutenant are you her representative eve snapped back and earned a lifted brow who other than yourself has access to your dressing room miss mansfield i dont know anyone really in the cast and crew i dont keep it locked its inconvenient with her head still resting on roarkes shoulder she drew steadying breaths who sent you the red roses and who brought them into the room i dont know there were so many flowers my dresser took the cards she would have marked the type on each one of the gofers brought some of the deliveries in people were in and out up till thirty minutes before curtain thats when i cut off visitors so i could prepare myself you were back in your dressing room after your initial scene and again for costume changes throughout the play thats right calmer areena drew back from roarke faced eve i have five costume changes my dresser was with me she was in the dressing room with me each time eve drew out her memo your dressers name tricia tricia beets shell tell you i didnt hide the prop shell tell you ask her ill do that my aide will see you back to your penthouse i can go for the moment ill be in touch record off peabody see miss mansfield back to her home yes sir areena grabbed the coat shed draped over the arm of the sofa passed it to roarke in a way eve had to appreciate so female so smoothly confident a man would be right there to wrap her up warm i want you to catch who did this lieutenant dallas i want that very much and even then even when whoever arranged for this to happen is punished ill always know it was my hand that caused it ill always know that she reached back touched the back of roarkes hand with her fingers thank you roarke i couldnt have gotten through tonight without you get some rest areena i hope i can head bowed she walked out with peabody trailing sturdily behind frowning eve picked up the evidence bag put it in her field kit shed like to rectify the fact that you didnt sleep with her do you think so the faint trace of amusement in his voice was just enough to put her back up and you just lap that up dont you men are pigs he stepped forward brushed his fingers over her cheek jealous darling eve if i was jealous of every woman youve had sex with compounded by every woman who wishes you did or would id spend my life green she started to turn shoved at his hand when he grabbed her arm hands off i dont think so to prove it he took her other arm pulled her firmly against him the humor was in his face and so damn him was a tenderness she had no defense against i love you eve yeah yeah he laughed leaned down and bit her bottom lip gently you romantic fool you know your trouble ace why dont you tell me youre a walking orgasm she had the pleasure of seeing his eyes widen i dont believe thats entirely flattering it wasnt meant to be it was very rare to sneak under that slick polish and hit a nerve she thought which was why she enjoyed it so much im going to talk to mansfields dresser see if she confirms the story then im done here for tonight i can start some background runs on the way home he retrieved his coat and hers and his equilibrium i believe youre going to be too busy to do background runs on the way home doing what he held her coat up before she could take it and shrug into it herself rolling her eyes she turned stuck her arms in the sleeves then let out a choked sound when he whispered a particularly imaginative suggestion in her ear you cant do that in the back of a limo want to bet twenty he took her hand to lead her out done she lost but it was money well spent o o if it were done when tis done then twere well it were done quickly well it is done done well and done quickly and i dare quote from the scottish play as i sit alone a murderer or as christine vole was in our clever play am i but an executioner its foolish of me to record my thoughts but those thoughts are so loud so huge so brilliantly colored i wonder the world cant see them bursting out of my head i think this speaking aloud where no one can hear might quiet them those thoughts must be silenced must be buried this is a precarious time i must steel my nerve the risks were weighed before the deed was done but how was i to know how could i have imagined what it would be like to see him dead and bleeding center stage so still he lay so still in the white wash of lights its best not to think of it its time now to think of myself to be cautious to be clever to be calm there were no mistakes made there must be none now i will keep my thoughts quiet tucked deep inside my heart though they want to scream out in jubilation richard draco is dead chapter three given the state of the equipment at her disposal at cop central eve saved herself considerable frustration and ran her initial background checks at home roarke loved his toys and the computer and communications systems in her home office made the junk at central look like something out of the second millennium which it very nearly was pacing her office with her second cup of coffee she listened while her computer listed the official details of areena mansfields life areena mansfield born jane stoops eight november wichita kansas parents adalaide munch and joseph stoops cohabitation union dissolved one sibling male donald stoops bom twelve august she let it run through education data for form all standard stuff as far as eve could tell right through her enrollment in new yorks institute of dramatic arts at the age of fifteen got the hell out of kansas first chance eve mused and couldnt blame her what did people do out there with all that wheat and corn anyway areenas professional credits started young teen model a scatter of plays a brief stint in hollywood before a return to live theater yeah yeah blah blah eve wandered back to her machine computer search and list any criminal record all arrests working the computer hummed with quiet efficiency comparing it to the useless pile of chips she was cursed with at central made her sneer gotta marry a billionaire to get a decent tool these days search complete possession of illegals new los angeles now were talking intrigued eve sat behind the desk keep going plea

production of drama twice owned starring subject and draco richard from february through june of that year interesting timing eve murmured reaching over idly to scratch the ears of the plump cat that leaped onto her desk as galahad made himself comfortable directly in front of the computer screen eve watched roarke stroll in through the door connecting their personal offices you didnt mention areena had an illegals habit had being the operative word is it relevant everythings relevant are you sure her affection for illegals is past tense to my knowledge shes been clean more than a dozen years when he sat on the edge of the desk galahad slithered over to bump his head against roarkes longfingered hand dont you believe in rehabilitation lieutenant i married you didnt i because it made him grin she angled her head you also didnt mention that she and draco were in some productions together over the years you didnt ask the timing of two of their acting connections coincide down the line with her illegals convictions ah hmmm roarke sent galahad into feline ecstasy with one slim finger over fur how tight were they roarke they may have been involved gossip ran that way during their last project together in london i didnt meet areena until a few years ago when she was married and living in london and i never saw her and richard together until we were casting this play he lifted a shoulder helped himself to what was left of eves coffee when i do my run on the victim am i going to find illegals charges probably if areena was still using she was discreet and professional no missed rehearsals no temperamental scenes i wouldnt use the term discreet in the same sentence with draco but he did his job and if they were involved in a romantic or sexual fashion they kept it behind locked doors nobodys ever discreet enough if they were banging each other someone knew and if they were rolling around sweaty together or popping illegals it adds some angles do you want me to find out she got to her feet leaned forward until her nose bumped his no now if theres any part of that you didnt understand let me repeat no got it i believe i do i have a meeting in san francisco in a few hours summerset knows how to reach me if you need to her scowl at the mention of roarkes tightassed aide de camp was instant and heartfelt i wont need to i should be home before nine he rose sliding his hands up the sides of her body then down again to her hips ill call if ill be any later she understood he was reassuring her she wouldnt be alone at night alone where the nightmares chased her you dont have to worry about me i like to he bent his head to give her a light kiss but she changed the tone the texture by pulling him close her mouth hot and greedy her hands were fisted in his hair and her blood was up before she released him there was satisfaction in seeing his eyes had darkened and his breath quickened well what was that for i like to she said and picked up her empty coffee cup see you she gave him a smile over her shoulder as she went to the kitchen for a refill o o eve screened her calls on her home unit her palm unit her vehicle and her equipment in her office at central if her math held shed received twentythree calls from reporters which ran the gamut from charm pleas vague threats and minor bribes since midnight six of them at varying locations and with increasing levels of frustration and urgency were from nadine furst at channel they might have been friends which never failed to surprise eve but for both of them business was business nadine wanted an exclusive oneonone with the primary investigator in the death of richard draco eve just wanted his killer she dumped each and every one of the calls from the media signaled peabody to stand by and played the terse message from her commanding officer that one was simple enough his office now it was still shy of eight am commander whitney didnt keep her waiting his aide gestured eve straight into his office where whitney sat behind his desk juggling his own communications his big hands tapped the surface of his desk impatiently one lifting to jab a finger at a chair as she entered he continued to man his telelink his broad dark face betraying nothing his voice calm and brisk well brief the press at two no sir it cannot be done any sooner im well aware richard draco was a prominent celebrity and the media is demanding details well accommodate them at two the primary will be prepared her report is on my desk he said lifting a brow at eve she rose quickly set a disc at his fingertips ill contact you as soon as ive analyzed the situation for the first time since eve entered irritation rippled over whitneys face mayor bianci whether or not draco was a luminary of the arts hes dead i have a homicide and the investigation will be pursued with all energy and dispatch that is correct two oclock he repeated then ended the transmission and pulled off his privacy headphones politics it was all he said he leaned back rubbed at a line of tension at the base of his neck i read the prelim report you filed last night we have a situation yes sir the situation should be in autopsy right about now his lips stretched in what was almost a smile youre not much of a theater buff are you dallas i get my quota of entertainment on the street all the worlds a stage whitney murmured by now youre aware that the victim was a celebrity of considerable note his death in such a public and shall we say dramatic venue is news major news the storys already hit on and off planet draco to mansfield to roarke to you roarke isnt involved even as she said it a dozen curses ran through her head he owns the theater he was the primary backer for the play and from the information thats come to me already he was personally responsible for wooing both draco and mansfield into the production is that accurate lieutenant yes sir commander whitney if every crime that took place in a property roarke owns or has interest in was connected to him hed be tied to every cop and perpetrator on planet and half of them off this time whitney did smile thats quite a thought however the smile vanished in this case his connection and yours is considerably more tangible youre among the witnesses i prefer to look at that as an advantage in this instance the fact that you were onscene and were able to contain it quickly keeps this from being more unwieldy than it is the medias going to be a problem respectfully sir the media is always a problem he said nothing for a moment i take it youve seen some of the early headlines she had running right after the flash of draco dies for art had been annoying little tidbits such as murder most foul renowned actor richard draco was brutally stabbed and killed last night the murder committed under the nose of top nypsd homicide detective lieutenant eve dallas so much she thought for plugging media leaks at least they didnt refer to me as roarkes wife until the third paragraph theyll use him and you to keep the story hot she knew it detested it ive worked under media heat before commander true enough as his link beeped he pushed its all hold button and silenced it dallas this isnt an ordinary murder or even an extraordinary one its as my grandchildren say got juice and youre part of it youll need to prepare carefully for the press conference at two believe me the actors involved will play to the cameras they wont be able to help themselves and as they do the story adds layers he leaned back tapping his thigh im also aware youre not particularly interested in the public and media end of this youll have to consider that end in this case part of the job dont grant interviews or discuss any area of the case with any reporter prior to the press conference no sir i want this to move fast ive already requested the me put a rush on the autopsy the labs on alert we go by the book here but turn those pages quickly has areena mansfield requested her lawyer or representative not as yet interesting i dont expect that to last long she was shaken but my impression is shell want a rep once her mind clears her dresser confirms she was in the dressing room with areena at every costume change i dont put complete faith in her statement the woman worships mansfield meanwhile im running background checks on all members of cast and crew its going to take some time there are a lot of players here interviews are starting this morning are the estimates of three thousand witnesses in the ballpark just thinking about it made eves head throb im afraid they are commander obviously we couldnt hold the audience members in the theater for long we did a personbyperson id for name and residence as each was released some statements were taken because basically some people couldnt shut up most of those which ive reviewed were disjointed and essentially useless divvy up the audience witnesses in the squad ill pull in some detectives from other areas lets run some eliminations to get those numbers down ill start that today commander delegate it he ordered you cant be spared for drone work tag feeney for the backgrounds on cast and theater personnel i want this to close hes to prioritize the backgrounds over his current caseload hell moan over that one eve thought but she was pleased to be able to pass that part of the load over to the edetective ill communicate that to him commander and send him the list copies to my attention after the press conference ill need you to clear any and all media interviews with me before confirmation dallas you can expect to see yourself and your husband onscreen in print and blasted out of the goddamn tourist trams until this matter is satisfactorily closed if you require a larger team let me know ill start with what i have thank you commander be here this office at thirteenthirty for premedia briefing it was dismissal and acknowledging it eve headed out of the office and down the glide before she reached her level she pulled out her communicator and contacted feeney in the electronic detective division hey dallas heard you caught a hell of a show last night the reviews were a killer okay got that out of my system ive got direct orders from the commander ill be shooting you a full list of cast and crew from the play and additional theater personnel i need full backgrounds with correlation runs any and all connections of any and all individuals with richard draco and or areena mansfield love to lend a hand dallas but im up to my nostrils here direct from the commander she repeated he tagged you pal not me well hell feeneys already hangdog face filled the screen with sorrow she watched him drag a hand through his wiry rustcolored hair how many backgrounds we talking including nonspeaking roles walkon tech and talent crew concessions maintenance and so on four hundred give or take jesus dallas ive done mansfield but you could go deeper instead of sympathy she felt amusement that lightened her step as she passed through the bullpen and gave peabody the comeahead sign whitney wants it prioritized and rushed media conference at fourteen hundred i need all i can get by then youre authorized to put as many hands on the team as you need isnt that just dandy works for me ill be in the field peabodyll get you the list asap look for sex feeney you get to be my age you slow down on that some ha ha sex and illegals ive got a tie already lets see if it spreads out any ill be in touch she pocketed her communicator leading the way down to the lower level where her vehicle was parked shoot the witness and suspect lists to feeney were dumping backgrounds on edd good for us peabody drew out her palm unit and began the transfer so is he using mcnab i didnt ask eve slid her gaze toward peabody then shook her head and coded open the locks on her vehicle you want to know dont you eve strapped in started the car i dont know what youre talking about about me and mcnab as far as im concerned there is no you and mcnab it does not exist in my world my aide is not having some weirdass sexual fling with the fashion plate from edd it is weird peabody admitted then let out a long sigh were not talking about it give me the first address kenneth stiles aka sir wilfred park avenue and its really good sex peabody you were wondering i was not but she winced as a distressingly clear image of peabody and mcnab popped gleefully into her head keep your mind on the job i have lots of compartments in my mind with a happy sigh peabody settled back room for everything then make room for kenneth stiles and give me a rundown yes sir obediently peabody took out her ppc stiles kenneth age fiftysix a rare new york city native born and bred in midtown parents were entertainers no criminal record educated by private tutor through secondary level with additional classes in drama stage design costuming and elocution whoopee so weve got a serious thespian on our hands first performance at age two guys won a pot load of awards always live stage no video an artist is my guess probably temperamental and emotional wont this be fun has he worked with draco before several times a couple of times with mansfield last time in london hes unmarried at the moment had two spouses and one formal cohabitation partner all female eve scanned for a parking place rejected the idea and pulled up to the front of the posturban war building on park before shed climbed out the uniformed doorman was at her side im sorry madam this is a nonparking zone and this is a badge she held up her shield kenneth stiles mr stiles occupies the apartment on the fiftieth floor five thousand the deskman will clear you madam does this say madam eve asked and waited for the doormans eyes to skim down read her badge i beg your pardon lieutenant might i arrange to have your vehicle garaged during your visit a valet will return it when youre ready to leave thats a nice offer but if i gave you the ignition code id have to arrest myself it stays right here eve kept her badge out and walked into the building leaving the doorman staring sadly at her peagreen police issue it was hard to blame him the lobby area was lush and elegant with gleaming brass and spearing white flowers huge squares of polished black tiles covered the floor behind a long white counter a tall slim woman sat gracefully on a stool and beamed welcoming smiles good morning how may i direct you kenneth stiles eve laid her badge on the counter beside a brass pot teeming with flowers is mr stiles expecting you lieutenant dallas hed better be just one moment please she swiveled to a link her smile never dimming her voice maintaining that same smooth and pleasant tone of an expensive and wellprogrammed droid good morning mr stiles i have a lieutenant dallas and companion at the lobby desk may i clear them she waited a beat thank you have a lovely day turning from the link she gestured toward the east bank of elevators the far right car is cleared for you lieutenant enjoy your day you bet i used to wonder why roarke didnt use more droids she said to peabody as they crossed the black tiles then i run into one like that and i understand that much politeness is just fucking creepy the ride up to the fiftieth floor was rapid enough to have eves stomach jump and her ears pop shed never understand why people equated height with luxury another droid was waiting for them when the doors slid open one of stiless serving units eve concluded done up in such stark and formal attire he made the dreaded summerset look like a sidewalk sleeper his steel gray hair was slicked back and matched with a heavy mustache that dominated his thin bony face the black of his slacks and long jacket was offset with snowwhite gloves he bowed then spoke in a fruity voice with a rolling english accent lieutenant dallas and officer mr stiles is expecting you this way please he led them down the hall to double doors that opened into the corner apartment the first thing eve saw when she entered was the sweeping window wall that opened onto new yorks bustling sky traffic she wished stiles had drawn the privacy screen the room itself was wild with color rubies and emeralds and sapphires tangled together in the pattern on the wide ushaped conversation pit centered in it was a white marble pool where fat goldfish swam in bored circles among lily pads a strong scent of citrus spread out from the tidy forest of dwarf orange and lemon trees heavy with fruit the floor was a violent geometric pattern of color that on closer look shifted into an erotic orgy of naked bodies in inventive forms of copulation eve strode across blue breasts and green cocks to where stiles lounged posed she thought in a saffron ankleduster some place he smiled a surprisingly sweet expression on his craggy face why live without drama may i offer you anything before we begin lieutenant no thanks that will be all walter he dismissed the droid with a wave of his hand then gestured eve to sit i realize this is routine for you lieutenant dallas but its new and i confess exciting territory to me having an associate murdered in front of you is exciting after the initial shock yes its human nature to find murder exciting and fascinating dont you think else why does it play so well through the ages his eyes were deep dark brown and very shrewd i could have taken any number of tacks with this interview im a very skilled actor i could be prostrate nervous frightened confused sorrowful i chose honesty she thought of carly landsdowne it seems to be going around record on peabody she said and sat and sank into the clouds of cushions biting off an oath eve shoved herself up sat on the edge of the couch balanced she read off the pertinent data and issued the standard warning do you understand your rights and obligations in this matter mr stiles i do indeed that sweet smile spread over his face again might i say you read your lines with authority and panache lieutenant gee thanks now what was your relationship with richard draco professional associates over the years we worked together from time to time most recently in the play that had its unusual opening night yesterday oh yeah eve thought hes enjoying this milking this and your personal relationship i dont know as we had one in the way i assume you mean actors often he made a vague gesture with his hand and set the multicolored stone cuff bracelet on his wrist to winking cheerfully gravitate toward each other you might say like minds like egos we marry each other with a kind of distressing regularity it rarely lasts as do the temporary friendships and other intimacies between players on the same stage still you knew him for a number of years knew him certainly but we were never chums lets say in point of fact he paused again his eyes glittering as happily as his bracelet i despised him loathed him found him a particularly vile form of life for any particular reason for any number of very particular reasons stiles leaned forward as if imparting confidences he was selfish egocentric rude arrogant all of those traits i could forgive even appreciate as we who act require a certain sheen of vanity to do what we do but under richards sheen was a sheer nastiness of spirit he was a user lieutenant one who not so quietly rejoiced at crushing hearts and souls im not the least bit sorry hes dead though i regret the method of his ohsotimely demise why the play was brilliant and my part one i relished this incident will postpone if not cancel the rest of the run its very inconvenient its going to get a lot of publicity that wont hurt you stiles ran a fingertip down his chin naturally not and when the play resumes itll pack the house night after night there is that so his death in so dramatic and public a way is on some levels an advantage clever he murmured eyeing her more closely now thats cleverly thought out we have a play within a play here lieutenant and youre writing it well you had access to the prop knife and enough time to make the switch i suppose i did what a thought he blinked several times as if processing new data im a suspect how entertaining i had seen myself as a witness well well yes i suppose i had opportunity but no real motive youve stated on record you hated richard draco oh my dear lieutenant if i arranged the death of every person i disliked the stage would be littered with bodies but the fact is however much i detested richard on a personal level i admired his talent he was an exceptional artist and that is the only reason i agreed to work with him again the world might have rid itself of a nasty smallminded man but the theater has lost one of its brightest lights and you one of your toughest competitors stiless eyebrows lifted no indeed richard and i were much different types i dont recall that we ever competed for the same role eve nodded it would be easy enough to check that data she shifted tactics whats your relationship with areena mansfield shes a friend one i admire as a woman and as an associate he lowered his eyes shook his head this business is very difficult for her shes a delicate creature under it all i hope youll consider that his eyes darker now with hints of anger in them came back to eves someone used her horribly i can tell you this lieutenant if i had decided to kill richard draco i would have found a way to do so that wouldnt have involved a friend there were two victims on stage last night and my heart breaks for her o o an operator eve murmured as they rode down to lobby level slick smart and selfsatisfied of all the actors hes the one with the most experience he knows the theater in and out if hes really a friend of mansfields would he have set it up so she killed draco planted the weapon in her dressing room why not eve strode out of the building flipped the doorman a sneer its theatrical and if you wind it all around the plant was so obvious it looks like a plant so she climbed behind the wheel drummed her fingers on it and frowned whoever planted it wanted us to find it wanted us to know it was put there to toss suspicion on mansfield otherwise its just stupid and whoever set the murder up isnt i want to know who worked backstage who wanted to be on it lets see how many frustrated actors were doing tech duty on this thing eve pulled away from the curb toss that ball to feeney she ordered peabody and used her car link to contact the morgue morse the chief medical examiner came onscreen his luxurious hair was slicked back to show off a duo of gold and silver hoops in his right ear i was expecting you dallas you cops are damned demanding we get our rocks off hassling dead doctors what have you got on draco hes most sincerely dead morse smiled thinly single stab wound to the heart did the job quickly and neatly no other wounds or injuries hes had some excellent body sculpting work over the years and a recent tummy toner a superior practitioner in my opinion as the laser marks are microscopic his liver shows some rehabilitation id say your guy was a serious drinker and had at least one treatment to revitalize he did however have a lovely little mix of illegals in his system at time of death exotica and zing with a soupcon of zeus he chased that with a double shot of unblended scotch hell of a combo you bet this guy was a serious abuser who continued to pay to have his body put back in shape this kind of cycle eventually takes its toll but even at this rate he likely had another twenty good years in him not anymore thanks morse any chance of getting me seats when this play goes back on you got the connections he added with a wink she sighed a little ill see what i can do chapter four the trip from stiless rarified uptown air to alphabet citys aroma of overturned recyclers and unwashed sidewalk sleepers was more than a matter of blocks they left the lofty buildings with their uniformed doormen the pristine glidecarts and serene air traffic for prefab sootscarred complexes blatting maxibuses and slyeyed street thieves eve immediately felt more at home michael proctor lived on the fourth floor of one of the units tossed up haphazardly after the devastation of the urban wars at election time city officials made lofty speeches about revitalizing the area made stirring promises to fight the good fight against neglect crime and the general decay of that ailing sector of the city after the elections the entire matter went back in the sewer to rot and ripen for another term still people had to live somewhere eve imagined a struggling actor who managed bit parts and understudy roles couldnt afford to pay much for housing eves initial background check revealed that michael proctor was currently six weeks behind on his rent and had applied for universal housing assistance which meant desperation she mused most applicants to uha became so strangled so smothered in red tape reeled out by the sticky fingers of bureaucrats they stumbled off into the night and were pitifully grateful to find a bed in one of the shelters she imagined that stepping into dracos bloody shoes would considerably up proctors salary money was an old motive as tried as it was true eve considered doubleparking on seventh then spotting a parking slot on the second level street side went into a fast vertical lift that had peabody yelping and shot forward to squeeze in between a rusted sedan and a battered air bike nice job peabody thumped a fist on her heart to get it going again eve flipped on the on duty light to keep the meter droids at bay then jogged down the ramp to street level this guy had something tangible to gain by dracos death hes got a good shot at the starring role if only temporarily that gives him an ego a career and a financial boost all rolled into one nothing popped on his record but every criminal has to start somewhere i love your optimistic view of humanity sir yeah im a peoplelover all right she glanced at the street hustler on air skates eyed his wide canvas shoulder bag hey she jabbed a finger at him as he hunched his shoulders and sulked you set up that game on this corner im going to be insulted take it off two blocks minimum and ill pretend i didnt see your ugly face im just trying to make a living make it two blocks over shit he shifted his bag then scooted off heading west through the billowing steam from a glidecart peabody sniffed hopefully those soy dogs smell fresh they havent been fresh for a decade put your stomach on hold i cant it has a mind of its own glancing back wistfully at the glidecart peabody followed eve into the grimy building at one time the place had boasted some level of security but the lock on the outer doors had been drilled out likely by some enterprising kid who was now old enough for retirement benefits the foyer was the width of a portajohn and the color of dried mud the old mail slots were scarred and broken above one in hopeful red ink was m proctor eve glanced at the skinny elevator the tangle of raw wires poking out of its control plate she dismissed it and headed up the stairs someone was crying in long pitiful sobs behind a door on level two came the roaring sounds of an arena football game and someones foul cursing at a botched play she smelled must urine gone stale and the sweet scent of old zoner on level three there was classical music something shed heard roarke play accompanying it were rhythmic thumps a dancer peabody said ive got a cousin who made it to the regional ballet company in denver somebodys doing jetes i used to want to be one a dancer eve glanced back peabodys cheeks were pretty and pink from the climb yeah well when i was a kid but i dont have the build dancers are built more like you i went to the ballet with charles a couple of weeks back all the ballerinas were tall and skinny makes me sick hmmm it was the safest response when peabody mentioned her connection to the licensed companion charles monroe im built more like an opera singer sturdy peabody added with a grimace you into opera now ive been a few times its okay she blew out a relieved breath when they reached the fourth floor and tried not to be irritated that eve wasnt winded charles goes for that culture stuff must keep you busy juggling him and mcnab peabody grinned i thought there was no me and mcnab in your reality shut up peabody annoyed eve rapped on proctors door was that a snort no sir peabody sucked it in and tried to look serious absolutely not i think my stomachs growling shut that up too she held her badge up when she heard footsteps approaching the door and the peephole the building didnt run to soundproofing a series of clicks and jangles followed she counted five manual locks being disengaged before the door opened the face that poked into the crack was a study of gods generosity or a really good face sculptor pale gold skin stretched taut and smooth over long cheekbones and a heroic square jaw that boasted a pinpoint dimple the mouth was full and firm the nose narrow and straight and the eyes the true green of organic emeralds michael proctor framed this gift with a silky flow of rich brown hair worn with a few tumbling boyish curls as his eyes darted from eve to peabody and back he streamed long fingers through the mass of it slicking it back before he tried out a hesitant smile um lieutenant houston dallas right i knew it was somewhere in texas nerves had his voice jumping over the words but he stepped back widening the opening im still pretty shaken up i keep thinking its all some kind of mistake if it is its a permanent one eve scanned what there was of the apartment the single room held a ratty sleep chair proctor hadnt bothered to make up for the day a skinny table that held a lowend telelink computer combo a pole lamp with a torn shade and a threedrawer wall chest for some she supposed acting wasnt lucrative um let me get um coloring slightly he opened the long closet fumbled inside and eventually came out with a small folding chair sorry i dont do much more than sleep here so its not company friendly dont think of us as company record on peabody you can sit mr proctor if youd be more comfortable im his fingers danced with each other tips to tips im fine i dont really know how to do this i never worked in any police dramas i tend to be cast in period pieces or romantic comedies good thing ive worked in a number of police dramas eve said mildly you just answer the questions and well be fine okay all right after glancing around the room as if hed never seen it before he finally sat on the chair crossed his legs uncrossed them smiled hopefully he looked eve thought like some schoolboy called down to the principals office for a minor infraction dallas lieutenant eve in interview with proctor michael in subjects residence peabody officer delia as aide watching proctor she recited the revised miranda as he listened he tapped his fingers on his knees and succeeded in looking as guilty as a man with six ounces of zeus in each pocket do you understand your rights and obligations in this matter yes i think do i need a lawyer he looked up at eve like a puppy one hoping not to be whacked on the nose for spotting the carpet ive got a representative a theatrical rep maybe i should call her thats up to you and would waste time and complicate matters you can request one at any time during the interview if you prefer we can move the process down to central well now gosh he blew out a breath glanced toward his link i dont guess ill bother her now shes pretty busy why dont you start by telling me what happened last night you mean he shuddered visibly i was in the wings stage left it was brilliant just brilliant i remember thinking that if the play had a long run id get a chance to be vole draco was bound to miss a performance or two along the way he trailed off looked stunned then appalled i dont mean to say i never wished for anything bad to happen to him it was more thinking that hed catch a cold or something or maybe just need a night off like that sure and what did you see from the wings stage left in the last scene he was perfect proctor murmured those deep green eyes going dreamy arrogant careless smooth the way he celebrated his acquittal even as he cast christine off like a leftover bone his pleasure in winning in circumventing the system fooling everyone then the shock the shock in his eyes in his body when she turned on him with the knife i watched knowing i could never reach that high never find so much in myself i didnt realize even after everyone broke character it didnt sink in he lifted his hands let them fall im not sure it has yet when did you realize that draco wasnt acting i think i think when areena screamed at least i knew then that something was horribly wrong then everything happened so quickly people were running to him and shouting they brought the curtain down very fast he remembered and he was still lying there hard to jump up and take your bows with eight inches of steel in your heart eve thought what was your personal relationship with richard draco i dont suppose we had one you had no personal conversations with him no interactions well um the fingers started dancing again sure we spoke a couple of times im afraid i irritated him in what way you see lieutenant i watch people he added with another of those shaky smiles to develop character types to learn i guess my watching him put draco off and he told me to keep out of his sight or or hed hmmm hed see to it that the only acting job i got was in sex holograms i apologized right away and he threw a paperweight at me the prop paperweight on sir wilfreds desk proctor winced he missed im sure he meant to that must have pissed you off no not really i was embarrassed to have annoyed him during rehearsal he had to take the rest of the day off to calm down a guy threatens your livelihood throws a paperweight at you and you dont get pissed off it was draco proctors tone was reverent hes he was one of the finest actors of the century the pinnacle his temperament is part was part of making him what he was you admired him oh yes ive studied his work as long as i can remember i have discs and recordings of every one of his plays when i had a chance to understudy vole i jumped at it i think its the turning point in my career his eyes were shining now all my life i dreamed of walking the same stage as richard draco and there i was but you wouldnt walk that stage unless something happened to him not exactly in his enthusiasm proctor leaned forward the cheap chair creaked ominously but i had to rehearse the same lines the same blocking know the same cues it was almost like being him in a way you know now youll have a shot at stepping onto his what do you call it his mark wont you yes proctors smile was brilliant and quickly gone i know how awful how selfish and cold that must sound i dont mean it that way youre having some financial difficulties mr proctor he flushed winced tried that smile again yes ah well one doesnt go into the theater for money but for love but money comes in handy for things like eating and keeping a roof over your head youre behind on your rent a little the understudy job pays enough to keep you current with your rent you gamble mr proctor oh no no i dont just careless with money i dont think so i invest you see in myself acting and voice lessons body maintenance enhancement treatments they dont come cheap especially in the city i suppose all that seems frivolous to you lieutenant but its part of my craft tools of the trade i was considering a parttime job to help defray the expenses no need to consider that now is there with draco out of the way i suppose not he paused considering it i wasnt sure how i was going to manage the time itll be easier to he broke off sucked in a breath i dont mean that the way it sounds its just that following your line of thinking it takes some strain off my mind im used to doing without money lieutenant whatever else the theaters lost one of its finest and one of my personal idols but i guess id feel better if i said if i was honest and said that theres a part of me thats thrilled to think that ill play vole even temporarily he sighed long and loud closed his eyes yeah yeah i do feel better i wish hed just caught a cold though o o eves head was throbbing lightly as she walked back up the steps to her car nobodys that naive she muttered nobodys that guileless hes from nebraska peabody scanned her pocket unit from where nebraska peabody waved a hand vaguely west farm boy done a lot of regional theater some video billboard ads bit parts onscreen hes only been in new york three years she climbed into the car they still grow them pretty guileless in nebraska i think its all that soy and corn whatever he stays on the short list his fee for walking into the part of vole is a big step up from watching in the wings hes living like a transient in that dump moneys a motivator and sos ambition he wanted to be draco what better way than to eliminate draco ive got this idea eve glanced at her wrist unit to check the time as she zipped down into traffic goddamn press conference which is okay its more of a theory spill it if its good can i get a soy dog christ whats the theory so theyre all actors in a play a good actor slides into the character during the performance stays there its all immediate but another part of them is distant gauging the performances remembering the staging picking up vibes from the audience and stuff like that my theory is whoever switched the knives was performing yeah performing murder sure but this is like another level they could be part of the play and watch it go down without actually doing the crime the objectives reached and its all still a role even if its a tech who did it its all part of the play voles dead hes supposed to be the fact that dracos dead too just makes it all the more satisfying eve mulled it over then pulled over at the next corner where a glidecart smoked and sizzled so its a good theory its decent get your soy dog you want anything coffee but not off that bug coach peabody sighed wow that sure stirs my appetite but she got out beelined through the pedestrian traffic and ordered the double wide soy dog and a mega tube of diet coke to convince herself she was watching her weight happy now eve asked when peabody dropped back into the passenger seat and stuffed the end of the dog into her mouth ummm good wanna bite peabody was saved from a scathing response by the beep of the car link nadine furst reporter for channel floated onscreen dallas i need to talk to you soon as you can manage yeah i bet eve ignored the transmission and whipped around the corner to head back to central why she thinks ill give her an exclusive oneonone before a scheduled press conference i dont know because youre friends peabody hazarded with her mouth full of soy dog and rehydrated onion flakes nobodys that friendly dallas nadines pretty cameraready face was strained as eve noted with mild curiosity was her perfectly pitched voice its important and its personal please if youre screening transmissions give me a break here ill meet you anywhere you say whenever you say cursing eve engaged transmission the blue squirrel now dallas i can give you ten minutes make it fast o o it had been a while since shed swung through the doors into the blue squirrel as joints went there were worse but not by much still the dingy club held some sentimental attachment for eve at one time her friend mavis had performed there slithering bouncing and screaming out songs in costumes that defied description and once during a difficult and confusing case eve had gone in with the sole purpose of drinking her mind to mush there roarke had tracked her down hauled her out before she could accomplish the mission that night shed ended up in his bed for the first time sex with roarke shed discovered did a much better job of turning the mind to mush than a vatful of screamers so the squirrel with its debatable menu and disinterested servers held some fond memories she slid into a booth considered ordering the hideous excuse for coffee for old times sake then watched nadine come in thanks nadine stood by the booth slowly unwinding a brilliant multicolored scarf from around her neck her fingers plucked at the long dark fringe peabody would you mind giving us a minute here no problem peabody pushed herself out of the booth and because nadines eyes were clouded gave the reporter a quick reassuring squeeze on the arm ill just go sit at the bar and watch the hologames thanks been a while since weve been in here never long enough eve commented when nadine took her seat across the wobbly table at a servers approach eve merely took out her badge and set it in clear view on the table she didnt think she or nadine were in the mood for a snack much less possible ptomaine whats the problem im not sure maybe there isnt one nadine closed her eyes shook back her hair shed added some blonde streaky things in it eve noticed she could never figure out why people were always changing colors all that maintenance baffled her richard draco nadine said im not going to discuss the case with you eve scooped up her badge with one impatient swipe press conference at fourteen hundred i slept with him eve paused in the act of getting out of the booth settled back and took a closer look at nadines face when not long after i got the onair job at i wasnt doing the crime beat then mostly fluff stories social gigs celebrity profiles anyway he contacted me wanted to tell me how good i was how much he enjoyed watching my reports which were pretty damn solid considering i hated every fucking minute of it she picked up her scarf wound it around her hand unwound it set it down again he asked me to dinner i was flattered he was gorgeous one thing led to another okay that would have been what five years ago six actually six nadine lifted a hand rubbed her fingers over her mouth it was a gesture eve had never seen her make before onair reporters didnt like mussing their makeup i said one thing led to another she continued but it led there romantically we didnt just jump into bed we dated for a couple of weeks quiet dinners theater walks parties then he asked me to go away with him for the weekend to paris this time nadine simply dropped her head in her hands oh jesus jesus dallas you fell for him oh yeah i fell for him all the way i mean i was gone stupid in love with the son of a bitch we were together for three months and i actually dallas i was thinking marriage kids the house in the country the whole ball eve shifted in her seat emotional declarations always made her feel clumsy so i take it things didnt work out nadine stared for a moment then let her head fall back with a long shaky laugh yeah you could say things didnt work out i found out he was twotiming me hell three and fourtiming me i caught a gossip report right before i went on air and there was richard cuddled up with some bigbreasted blonde at some swank club uptown when i confronted him about it he just smiled and said he enjoyed women so what so what she murmured the fucker broke my heart and didnt have the decency to lie to me he even talked me back into bed im ashamed of that i let him talk me back into bed and when i was still wet from him he takes a call from another woman makes a date with her while im lying there naked how long was he hospitalized nadine managed a weak smile theres the pity i cried i sat there in his bed and cried like a baby okay im sorry it was a raw deal but it was six years ago i saw him the night he was killed oh hell nadine he called me shut up just shut up right now dont say another word to me get a lawyer dallas nadines hand shot out and her fingers dug into eves wrist please i need to tell you everything then i need you to tell me how much trouble i could be in fuck fuck fuck eve jabbed at the menu ordered coffee after all i havent read you your rights im not going to i cant use anything you say to me he called me said hed been thinking about me about old times he wondered if id like to get together i started to tell him to go to hell but i realized even after all that time i wanted some of my own back i wanted to burn his ass in person so i agreed to drop by his hotel theyll have me on the security discs yeah they will hed ordered up a dinner for two the bastard remembered what wed had on our first date maybe he orders it on all his first dates it would be just like him may he rot in hell she blew out a breath well i pulled out the stops myself id really put myself together new dress new hair i let him pour me champagne and we made small talk while we drank i knew his moves i remembered every one of them and when he ran his fingertips down my cheek gave me that long soulful look i threw my champagne in his face and said everything i wish id said six years ago we had a terrible fight broken glass vicious words a couple of slaps on both sides he got physical with you more the other way around i guess i slapped him he slapped me back then i punched him in the gut that took the air out of him while he was wheezing i walked out feeling really good will the security disc show you looking disheveled emotional i dont know she rubbed her fingers over her mouth again maybe i didnt think of that but no matter what im glad i went im glad i finally stood up for myself but then dallas i made a really big mistake the coffee slid greasily through the serving slot eve simply pushed it toward nadine waited until her friend gulped it down i went to the theater last night i wanted to prove to myself that i could go see him and feel nothing the coffee was barely lukewarm but it managed to take the worst chill out of her belly i did i felt nothing it was like a celebration to finally have that bastard out of my system i even oh god i even went backstage used my press pass at intermission to tell him you talked to him backstage last night no when i got back there started toward his dressing room it occurred to me that confronting him again made him too important it would only feed his ego so i left i went out the stage door and i took a long walk i did some windowshopping i stopped off at a hotel bar and bought myself a glass of wine then i went home this morning i heard i panicked called in sick ive been sick all day then i realized i had to talk to you i had to tell you i dont know what to do when you went back you headed for the dressing rooms nowhere else no i swear did anyone see you i dont know i imagine i wasnt trying to be invisible i want to do this formally putting it on record that you came to me with this information thats the best for you meanwhile i want you to get a lawyer a good one do it quietly and tell the rep everything you told me okay did you leave anything out nadine anything no thats all i only saw him that once in his hotel room then again onstage i might have been a sap dallas but ive come a long way and im no coward if id wanted the son of a bitch dead id have killed him myself not pawned it off on someone else oh yeah eve picked up the coffee finished it up i know it talk to the lawyer well do the interview tomorrow she rose then after a slight hesitation patted nadines shoulder itll be okay you know what sucks here dallas i was feeling so damn good about everything ever since you know i do the therapy thing with mira eve shifted her feet yeah one of the things we got down to is i havent been open to love not the real thing since richard he really messed me up then last night when i was in that hotel bar i realized that now i could be i wanted to be lousy timing all around thanks for listening dont mention it eve signaled for peabody nadine take that literally chapter five the calendar claimed spring was just around the corner but it was taking a slow walk eve drove home in a thin spitting sleet that was nearly as nasty as her mood press conferences annoyed her the only good thing about it as far as she was concerned was that it was over between that and a day spent in interviews that gave her no more than a murky picture of people and events she was edgy and dissatisfied the fact was she shouldnt be going home there was more field work that could be should be done but shed cut peabody loose much to her aides undisguised delight shed take an hour she told herself maybe two do some pacing juggle her thoughts into some sort of order she chugged and dodged through badtempered traffic and tried to block out the irritatingly chirpy sky blimp shouting about the new spring fashions on sale at bloomingdales she got caught at a light and in a stinking stream of smoke from a glidecart currently on fire and being sprayed with gel foam by its unhappy operator since the flames seemed reasonably under control she left him to it and tagged feeney via her car link progress some i got you backgrounds and current locations financial data and criminal records on cast and crew including permanent theater personnel eves voice calmed all yeah feeney rubbed his chin well i cant take full credit told you we were backed up here roarke passed it on her agitation returned roarke he got in touch early this afternoon figured id be doing the search he had all the data anyway saved me some time here always helpful she muttered i shot it to your office unit fine great feeney kept rubbing his chin eve began to suspect the gesture was to hide a grin i started mcnab on running patterns probabilities percentages its a long list so its not going to be quick but i figure we should have simple eliminations by tomorrow with a mostlikely list to shuffle in with your interview results hows it going slow she inched her way across the intersection spied a break in traffic and went for it the chorus of horns exceeded noise pollution levels and made her smile thinly we managed to make the murder weapon standard kitchen knife it came right out of the sublevel kitchen at the theater open access to cast and crew not to the public i had a uniform pick up the security discs well see what we see look im going to run some probability scans myself see if they jibe with yours i should have some profile from mira tomorrow lets see if we can whittle this down from a few thousand suspects how fars mcnab gotten he got a ways before i sprang him for the day you let him go he had a date feeney said and grinned eve winced shut up feeney she ordered and broke transmission she brooded because it made her feel better then shot through the gates of home even in miserable weather it was magnificent maybe more magnificent she thought in that gloom and gray the sprawling lawns were faded from winter the naked trees shimmering with wet atmosphere she supposed roarke would say it was all about atmosphere and it showcased the glorious stoneandglass structure with its towers its turrets its sweep of terraces and balconies that he had claimed as his own it belonged on a cliff somewhere she mused with the sea boiling and pounding below the city with its crowds and noise and sneaky despair couldnt beat its way through those tall iron gates to the oasis hed built out of canniness ruthlessness sheer will and the driving need to bury the miseries of his childhood every time she saw it her mind was of two conflicting parts one told her she didnt belong there the other told her she belonged nowhere else she left the car at the base of the front steps knowing summerset would send it lumbering into the garage on principle the peagreen city issue offended his sensibilities she supposed nearly as much as she did herself she jogged up the steps in her scarred boots and walked inside to the warmth the beauty and all the style money could buy and power could maintain summerset was waiting for her his thin face dour his mouth in a flattened line lieutenant you surprise me youve arrived home in a timely fashion dont you have anything better to do than to clock me in and out of here she stripped off her jacket tossed it on the newel post to annoy him you could be out scaring small children summerset sniffed and to annoy her picked up her damp leather jacket with the delicate tips of two fingers he examined it with dark disapproving eyes what no blood today that can still be arranged roarke home yet roarke is in the lowerlevel recreation area a boy and his toys she strode past him youre tracking wet on the floor she glanced back glanced down well thatll give you something to do well satisfied with their evening exchange summerset went off to dry her jacket she took the steps then wound her way through the pool house where wisps of steam danced invitingly over water of deep secret blue she thought fleetingly about stripping to the skin and diving in but there was roarke to deal with she bypassed the gym the dressing area and a small greenhouse when she opened the door of the recreation area the noise poured through it was in eves opinion a twelveyearolds wet dream though she herself had long since ceased dreaming of toys by the age of twelve perhaps roarke had too which was why she supposed he indulged himself now there were two pool tables three multiperson vr tubes a variety of screens designed for transmissions or games a small holodeck and a forest of brightly colored noisy game stations roarke stood at one long legs comfortably spread elegant hands on either side of a long waistheight box with a glass top his fingers were tapping rhythmically on what seemed to be large buttons the top of the box was a riot of lights cops and robbers she read and had to roll her eyes as a highpitched siren began to scream there was an explosion of what she recognized as gunfire the wild squeal of tires on pavement and blue and red lights crowned the vertical length of the box as it began to spin eve hooked her thumbs in her front pockets and strolled over to him so this is what you do with your downtime hello darling he never took his eyes off the duo of silver balls that raced and ricochetted under the glass youre home early only temporarily i want to talk to you mmmhmm one minute she opened her mouth to object then nearly jumped as bells began to clang and lights shot like lasers what the hell is this thing antique prime condition just fucker just got it in today he bumped the machine lightly with his hip its a pinball machine latetwentieth century cops and robbers how could i resist the machine ordered him to freeze in menacing tones and roarke responded by zipping his remaining ball up a chute where it banged and bumped against a trio of diamond shapes then slid into a hole free ball he stepped back rolled his shoulders but that can wait as he leaned down to kiss her she slapped a hand on his chest hold on ace what do you mean by calling feeney offering my assistance to new yorks finest he said easily doing my duty as a concerned citizen give us a bite of this so saying he drew her against him and nipped at her lower lip lets play a game im primary darling you most certainly are on the case smart guy that as well and as such youd have requested the data from the theaters files and funneled it to feeney now its done your hairs damp he said and sniffed at it its sleeting she wanted to argue but didnt see the point when he was exactly right why do you have deep background and extensive data on everyone involved with the globe and this production because lieutenant everyone involved with the globe and this production works for me he eased back picked up the bottle of beer hed set beside the machine had an annoying day have you mostly when he offered the bottle she started to shake her head then shrugged and took a small swig i wanted to take a couple of hours to clear my mind me too and ive the perfect method strip pinball she snorted get out oh well if youre afraid youll lose ill give you a handicap he smiled when he said it knowing his wife very well im not afraid ill lose she shoved the beer back at him struggled lost how much of a handicap still smiling he toed off both his shoes that and five hundred points a ball seems fair as youre a novice she considered studying the machine you just got this in today right just a bit ago yes you go first my pleasure and as he enjoyed watching her fume compete and lose herself in the moment it proved to be within twenty minutes shed lost her boots her socks her weapon harness and was currently losing her shirt damn it this thing is rigged out of patience she threw her weight against the machine then hissed when her flippers froze tilt why does it keep saying that to me perhaps youre a bit too aggressive why dont i help you with this he offered and began unbuttoning her shirt she slapped his hands away i can do it youre cheating while she tugged off her shirt she scowled at him she was down to a sleeveless undershirt and her trousers i dont know how but youre cheating it couldnt be that im just the superior player no he laughed then pulled her in front of him ill give you another go here and help you out now he placed his fingers over hers on the control buttons you have to learn to finesse it rather than attack it the idea is to keep the ball lively and in play i got the idea roarke you want it to smash up against everything wisely he swallowed a chuckle more or less all right here it comes he released the ball leaned into her watching over her shoulder no no wait you dont just flip madly about wait for it his fingers pressed over hers and sent the little silver ball dancing to the tune of automatic weapon fire i want the gold bars over there in time all in good time he leaned down to skim his lips over the back of her neck there now youve evaded the squad car and racked yourself up five thousand points i want the gold why am i not surprised lets see what we can do for you feel my hands he was pressed into her back snug and cozy eve turned her head thats not your hands his grin flashed right you are these are slowly he skimmed those clever hands up her body over her breasts beneath the thin cotton he felt her heart give one fast leap you could forfeit his mouth went to the curve of her neck this time with the light scrape of teeth in a pigs eye he caught the lobe of her ear between his teeth and the resulting jolt to her system had her fingers jabbing into the buttons even as she moaned the machine exploded under her hands what what you got the gold bonus points he tugged at the button of her trousers extra ball nice job thanks bells were clanging in the machine in her head she let him turn her so they were facetoface games not over not nearly his mouth came down on hers hot and possessive his hands had already snaked under her shirt to cup her breasts i want you i always want you breathless eager she dragged at his shirt you shouldve lost a few times you wouldnt be wearing so many clothes ill remember that the need reared up so fast so ripe it burned her body was a treasure to him the long clean lines of it the sleekness of muscle the surprising delicacy of skin standing wrapped tight he sank into her she wanted to give no one else had ever made her so desperate to give whatever she had whatever he would take through all the horrors of her life through all the miseries of her work this what they brought to each other time and time again was her personal miracle she found his flesh with her hands firm warm and sighed deeply she found his mouth with hers rough hungry and she moaned when she would have pulled him to the floor he turned stumbled with her until her back was pressed against something cool and solid look at me his name caught in her throat as those skilled fingers slid over her into her and sent her spinning as madly as the silver ball under glass he watched her eyes cloud then the rich brown of them go opaque as she came more again while she shuddered while her hands gripped his shoulders he took her mouth swallowed her cry of release his breath was as tattered as hers as he took her hips lifted them and plunged he pinned her pummeled her system with a pleasure too outrageous for reason energized her so that she fought to give it back beat for beat when her hands slipped from his shoulders she lifted them to his hair fisted her fingers in all that black silk they drove each other up and over o o i didnt lose roarke glanced over smiled at the view of her pretty naked butt as she gathered up her clothes i didnt say you did youre thinking it i can hear you thinking it i just dont have time to finish playing that stupid game itll hold he fastened his trousers im hungry lets have something to eat itll have to be quick ive got work i want to go over and take a look at dracos hotel room thats fine then roarke wandered to the autochef considered and decided a cool sleety night called for something homey he ordered beef and barley stew for both of them ill go with you its police business naturally just doing my civic duty again lieutenant because he knew that would irritate her he offered her a bowl and a smile its my hotel after all it would be because she knew he meant to irritate her she scooped up a bite and scalded her tongue it wasnt a crime scene she thought as she blew some of the heat from the second spoonful and she could use roarkes eyes his mind not that she wanted to admit it fine she shrugged but you stay out of my way he nodded agreeably not that he had any intention of doing what she asked where was the fun in that will we be picking up peabody shes off she had a date ah with mcnab eve felt her appetite take an abrupt nosedive she doesnt date mcnab at roarkes look of surprise she stubbornly stuffed more stew in her mouth look maybe in some alternate universe far far away they have sex but theyre not dating thats it darling there comes a time however sad for mum when the children must leave home shut up she jabbed her spoon at him i mean it they are not dating she insisted and polished off her stew o o some might have called ian mcnabs ramshackle apartment on the lower west side an alternate universe it was a guys space badly decorated heavy on the sports memorabilia and scattered with dirty dishes while he did occasionally think to stuff some of the worst of the debris in some dusty closet when female company was expected it was a long way from the sumptuous space of roarkes home and it smelled a great deal like overcooked veggie hash but it worked for him at the moment with his heart stuttering and his skin slick from sex it worked just fine jesus peabody he flopped over on his back much like a landed trout he didnt bother to gasp for air he had a lush naked woman in his bed he could die a happy man we had to break a record that time we ought to be writing this down she lay where she was stunned as she always was when she found herself in this situation with ian mcnab i cant feel my feet obligingly he propped himself on his elbow but as theyd ended up crosswise on the bed he couldnt see past her knees she had he noted really cute knees i dont think i bit them off id remember but with a grunt he scooted down just to be sure theyre there all right both of them good im going to need them later as the shock wore off she blinked stared at mcnabs pretty profile and wondered not for the first time when shed lost her mind im naked in bed with mcnab naked in bed mcnab jesus always selfconscious about body flaws she tugged at the knotted sheets cold in here she muttered bastard super cut the main furnace back first of march like its his money first chance i get im rerouting the system he yawned hugely dragged both hands through his long and tangled blond hair his narrow shoulders seemed weighed down by the mass of it peabody had to order her fingers not to reach up to play with the long loops of reddish gold he had skinny hips with the right one currently decorated with a temp tattoo of a silver lightning bolt it matched the four earrings winking in his left earlobe his skin was milk white his eyes a cagey green she still couldnt figure out why anything about him attracted her on a physical level much less how shed ended up having regular and outrageous sex with him when out of bed they spent most of their time annoying each other shed liked to have said he wasnt her type but she didnt think she actually had a type her luck with men was usually distressingly pisspoor id better get going why its early when she sat up he leaned over and nipped suggestively at her shoulder im starving christ mcnab we just finished having sex that too but i was thinking more of pizza loaded he knew her weaknesses lets fuel up her taste buds stirred to attention im dieting what for she rolled her eyes yanking the rumpled sheet around her as she climbed out of bed because im pudgy no youre not youre built he caught the edge of the sheet surprising her with his quickness and pulled it down to her waist seriously built as she fumbled for the sheet he sprang up caught her around the waist with an affectionate squeeze that both disarmed and worried her come on lets eat then see what happens next ive got some wine around here if its anything like the wine you had last time id as soon dip a cup in the sewer new bottle he picked his bright orange jumpsuit off the floor stepped into it you want some pants the fact that he would offer her his pants made her want to pinch all four of his cheeks mcnab i couldnt have squeezed into your pants when i was twelve i actually have an ass true thats okay i love a woman in uniform he strolled off struggling not to brood he always had to talk her into staying in the corner of the living area that doubled for his kitchen he pulled out the bottle of wine hed bought the day before when hed been thinking of her he thought about her just often enough to be demoralized if he could keep her in bed theyd be fine he didnt have to think about his moves there they just happened he flipped on his link the pizza joint was keyed in on memory in the primo position due to frequency of transmissions he ordered a mongo pie loaded then dug out a corkscrew the damn wine had cost him twice what he usually spent but when a guy was competing with a slick experienced lc he needed to hold his own he didnt doubt charles monroe knew all about fine wines he and peabody probably took baths in champagne since the image infuriated him he glugged down half a glass of wine then he turned as peabody came out of the bedroom she was wearing her uniform pants with her shirt open at the throat he wanted to lick her there just there where the stiff cotton gave way to soft flesh goddamn it whats the matter she asked noticing the scowl on his face they run out of pepperoni no its coming he held out her glass of wine i was thinking about work mmm she sipped the wine pursed her lips at its smooth and subtle fruity taste this is pretty good youre running backgrounds on the draco case right already done dallas should have them by now quick work he answered with a shrug he didnt have to tell her roarke had dropped the data in his lap we in edd aim to please even after eliminations and probability scans its going to take days to shift the list down to a workable number guy gets his heart jabbed in front of a couple thousand people its complicated yeah peabody sipped again then wandered off to drop into a chair without being aware of it on a conscious level she was as comfortable in mcnabs mess of an apartment as she was in her own tidy one somethings going on somethings always going on no not the usual she struggled with herself brooded into her wine if she didnt talk to someone shed explode and hell he was here look this is confidential okay since the pizza wouldnt arrive for a good ten minutes more mcnab snagged an open bag of soy chips he settled on the arm of peabodys chair whats the deal i dont know nadine furst tagged the lieutenant today and she was razzed nadine i mean absently peabody reached into the bag you dont see nadine razzed very often she makes a meet with dallas a personal meet it was serious they stashed me across the room but i could tell and after dallas didnt say a word about it maybe it was just personal shit no nadines not going to ask for a meet like that unless theres trouble nadine was her friend too and part of peabody was bruised that shed been brushed aside i think it ties to the case dallas shouldve told me peabody crunched on chips she should trust me want me to poke around i can do my own poking i dont need an e division hotshot running plays for me suit yourself shebody just lay off i dont even know why i told you its just sitting in my gut nadines a friend shes supposed to be a friend youre jealous bullshit yeah you are he was beginning to have an intimate relationship with the feeling dallas and nadine are playing without you so youre jealous girl dynamics one oh one she shoved him off the arm of the chair youre an asshole and there he said as his security bell rang is the pizza chapter six dont touch anything and stay out of the way darling roarke watched eve slip her master into the security lock on penthouse a youre repeating yourself thats because you never listen before she opened the door she turned met his eyes why does a man whose primary residence is new york whose main source of work is new york opt to live in a hotel rather than a private residence first the panache mr draco keeps the penthouse at the palace when in the city next the convenience at the crook of a finger whatever you need or want done for you can be is and lastly perhaps most tellingly the utter lack of commitment everything around you is someone elses problem and responsibility from what ive learned of draco so far thats the one i go for she opened the door stepped inside it belonged to roarke she thought therefore it was plush and lush and perfect if you went for that kind of thing the living area was enormous and elegantly furnished with walls of silky rose the ceiling was arched and decorated with a complicated design of fruit and flowers around a huge glass and gold chandelier three sofas all in deep cushy red were piled with pillows bright as jewels tables and she suspected they were genuine wood and quite old were polished like mirrors as was the floor the rug was an inch thick and matched the ceiling pattern grape for grape one wall was glass the privacy screen drawn so that new york exploded with light and shape outside but couldnt intrude there was a stone terrace beyond and as the flowers decked in big stone pots were thriving she assumed it was heated a glossy white piano stood at one end of the room and at the other carved wood panels hid what she assumed was a full entertainment unit there were plants of thick and glossy foliage glass displays holding pretty dust catchers she concluded were art and no discernable sign of life housekeeping would have come in after he left for the theater roarke told her i can ask the team on duty that evening to come up and let you know the condition of the rooms at that time yeah she thought of nadine if she knew the reporter the condition of the rooms had been something approaching the wake of a tornado she walked over to the panels opened them and studied the entertainment unit unit on she commanded and the screen flickered to soft blue play back last program with barely a hiccup the unit burst into color and sound eve watched two figures slide and slither over a pool of black sheets why do guys always get off watching other people fuck were sick disgusting and weak pity us she started to laugh then the couple on the bed rolled the womans face soft with pleasure turned toward the camera goddamn it thats nadine nadine and draco in support roarke laid a hand on eves shoulder it wasnt taped here thats not the bedroom her hairs different i dont think its recent im going to have to take it in prove it isnt and ive got a damn sex tape of one of the medias cream as evidence on a murder case she stopped the play ejected the disc and sealed it in an evidence bag from her field kit damn it damn it she began to pace to struggle with herself all this relationship stuff was so complicated and still so foreign to her nadine had told her what shed told her as a friend in confidence the man currently and patiently watching her from across the room was her husband love honor and all the rest of it if she told him about nadine and draco was she breaching a confidence and the trust of a friend or was she just doing the marriage thing how the hell she wondered did people get through life juggling all this stuff darling eve sympathizing roarke waited until shed stopped prowling the room and turned to face him youre giving yourself a headache i can make it easier on you dont feel you have to tell me something that makes you uncomfortable she frowned at him narrowed her eyes i hear a but at the end of that sentence you have very sharp ears but he continued crossing to her i can deduce that nadine and draco were involved at one time and given your current concern that something happened between them a great deal more recently oh hell in the end she went with the gut and told him everything he listened then tucked eves hair behind her ear youre a good friend dont say that it makes me nervous all right ill say this nadine didnt have anything to do with dracos murder i know that and theres no hard evidence indicating any different but its going to be messy for her personally messy okay what else is in this place ah if memory serves kitchen through there he gestured office bath bedroom dressing room bath ill start in the office i want to run his links and see if he had any conversations that involved threats or arguments do me a favor she handed him her kit bag the rest of the video discs yes sir lieutenant she smirked but let it ride she worked systematically he loved watching her at it the focus the concentration the absolute logic of her method not so long before in his life if anyone had suggested he could find a cop and her work sexy hed have been both appalled and insulted stop staring at me he smiled was i she decided to let it pass lots of communications in and out if i were a shrink id guess this was a guy who couldnt stand being alone with himself needed contact on a constant basis nothing out of the ordinary though unless you count some pretty heavy link shopping eight pairs of shoes three snazzy suits antique wrist unit she straightened but you wouldnt count that on the contrary id never buy snazzy suits via link fit is everything ha ha he did have a short pithy kind of conversation with his agent seems our boy discovered that his leading lady was pulling in the same salary for the run of the play he was pretty pissed off about it wanted his rep to renegotiate and get him more one credit more per performance yes i knew about that no deal puzzled she turned away from the neat little desk you wouldnt give him a credit when dealing with a child roarke said mildly you set boundaries the contract was a boundary the amount of the demand was inconsequential youre tough certainly did he give you trouble over it no he may have planned to push it but we never had words over it the fact is his agent went to my lawyers they to me me back to them and so on it hadnt progressed beyond my refusal before opening night okay that keeps you clean i want to check out the bedroom she moved past him across a small circular hallway and through the door the bed was big elaborate with a high padded wall behind and covered with sheer smoky gray it looked like a bank of soft fog she moved briefly into the adjoining dressing room shook her head at the forest of clothes and shoes a builtin mirrored counter held a chorus line of colored bottles and tubes enhancers skin soothers scents powders okay weve got vain selfish egocentric childish and insecure i wouldnt argue with your assessment all those personality traits are motive for dislike but for murder sometimes having two feets a motive for murder she moved back to the bedroom a man that full of ego and insecurity wouldnt sleep alone very often he dumped carly landsdowne id say he had someone else lined up to take her place idly she pulled open the drawer of the bedside table well well look at the toys the drawer was fitted with compartments and each was jammed with various erotic enhancers suitable for partnership or solo bouts lieutenant i really think you should take these in for further examination no touching she slapped roarkes hand away as he reached in spoilsport civilian what the hell does this do she held up a long coneshaped piece of rubber it made cheerful tinkling noises when she shook it roarke tucked his tongue in his cheek and sat on the bed well in the interest of your investigation id be happy to demonstrate smiling he patted the bed beside him no i mean it so do i never mind but she was still pondering when she put the cone back and opened the bottom drawer ah heres a little gold mine looks like a months supply of exotica a bit of zeus and she opened a small vial sniffed cautiously then shook her head like a dog coming out of a pool of water shit wild rabbit she fumbled the stopper back in grabbed for an evidence bag and sealed the vial pure too she blew out a breath if hes using that on his dates no wonder they all think hes a sex god one or two drops of rabbit and youd screw a doorknob did you know he was into this no all humor fled roarke rose i dont have particularly strong feelings about most of the illegals but this one is the same as rape as far as im concerned are you all right yeah yeah a little dizzy she thought and annoyingly horny and that was only from a quick whiff of the fumes stuff this pure goes for ten thousand an ounce minimum and it isnt easy to come by it only works on the female system she murmured only takes a drop too many to overdose roarke cupped a hand under her chin lifted it to examine her eyes clear enough he decided there was never any talk about him using anything like this if there had been and id discovered it was true id have broken his contract and very likely his arms okay she lifted a hand to his wrist squeezed thats enough in here for now im going to need you to keep this room vacant another day or two i want an illegals unit to run through it all right she slipped the vial into her kit and hoped to lighten his mood so how much is it costing you excuse me to keep this place vacant how much does it run a night oh this little place i believe its in the neighborhood of eightyfive hundred a night though i imagine we have weekly and monthly rates as well chump change mansfield has a unit in here too right penthouse b the other tower lets pay her a visit she and draco had an illegals history in common eve began as she gathered her field kit and started out she may know his sources it could all come down to a bad drug deal i dont think so okay i dont think so either but the majority of cop work is eliminating she locked the door started to reach for a police seal in her kit must you do that he eyed the seal with dislike its very offputting to the other guests yes i must besides itll give them a secret thrill oooh look george thats where the dead actor lived get the vid cam your attitude toward society at large is sadly cynical and accurate she stepped into the elevator ahead of him waiting for the doors to close then pounced just give me a quick god desperate for release she rubbed herself against him bit his lip moaning as her hands squeezed hard on his butt whew on a long breath she pushed him away circled her shoulders thats better for you maybe he made a grab for her but she slapped a hand on his chest no games in public elevators dont you know thats a violation of city code tower a penthouse level she ordered and the car slid seamlessly into motion youll definitely have to pay for that she leaned back against the wall as the elevator started its horizontal ride please youre scaring me he only smiled and slipped his hands into his pocket toyed idly with the rubber cone hed palmed out of the drawer be afraid he murmured and made her laugh as the car came to a stop i had to clear my head before talking to a witness didnt i mmmhmmm listen you know mansfield fairly well id like your observations when this is done ah there i am useful again she stopped turned and laid a hand on his cheek love for him reared up and bit her at the oddest times you do come in handy when he turned his head and brushed his lips over her palm she felt the thrill of it right down to her toes no mushy stuff she ordered and strode to areenas door she pressed the buzzer waited areena dressed in a white lounging robe opened the door she looked flushed obviously surprised and not altogether pleased lieutenant dallas roarke i i wasnt expecting then those limpid eyes went wide went bright is there news have you caught whoever no im sorry to disturb you but i have a few questions oh i thought i hoped it might all be over well she lifted a hand pressed pinktipped fingers under her eye as if to soothe an ache indeed there were faint bruises of fatigue under it im afraid this isnt really a good time is this absolutely necessary im sorry its inconvenient but it wont take long of course this is awkward you see im not alone i in surrender areena let her hand fall stepped back please come in eve stepped inside the penthouse was very like its opposite in setup in size the furnishings were softer more female somehow and the colors a symphony of blues and creams and seated on one of the trio of sofas looking sleek and gorgeous in black was charles monroe terrific eve thought and immediately wanted to kick his expensive balls into his throat he grinned a quick snap of pleasure then seeing the chill in her eyes the look shifted into lazy amusement as he got languorously to his feet lieutenant always a delight to see you charles night work still keeping you busy fortunately roarke nice to see you again charles can i freshen your drink areena what her eyes had whipped back and forth between faces and her fingers twirled and twisted the silver links at her throat no no thank you ah you know each other the flush that had pinked prettily on her face deepened she lifted her hands again in that feminine gesture of helplessness the lieutenant and i have met a number of times we even have a mutual friend watch your step eve said very quietly temper had already stormed into her eyes and was ready to snap is this a social call charles or are you on the clock you should know a man in my position doesnt discuss such matters please this is embarrassing areena lifted her hand to toy restlessly with her necklace again and didnt notice charless mouth twist in a thin cynical line but eve did obviously youre aware charles is a professional i didnt want to be alone and i needed some simple companionship charles mr monroe came highly recommended areena smooth as silk roarke stepped forward id love some coffee would you mind oh of course forgive me i can why dont i see to it charles brushed a hand over areenas arm and started toward the kitchen ill just give him a hand with a last look at eve roarke strolled away i know how this must look to you areena began it must seem very cold and very selfinterested for me to have hired a sexual partner the night after it seems odd to me that a woman like you would have to hire anyone to be with her with a light laugh areena picked up a glass of wine and sipping began to pace the silk whispered around her legs a pretty compliment wrapped in barbed suspicion and well delivered im not here to pay you compliments no areenas eyes lost their light of humor no of course not the simple answer to your underlying question is that i keep to myself a great deal it comes i suppose from spending too much of my youth at parties in groups youll have learned about my indiscretions my difficulties with illegals thats behind me now she turned back lifted her chin it wasnt easy to put it behind me but i did in doing so i lost a number of what i once considered friends i ruined relationships that mattered to me because of addictions lost those that shouldnt have mattered when i beat the addictions and now im at a point in my life where my career needs all my attention it doesnt leave much time for socializing or for romance were you romantically involved with draco no never we had sex a lifetime ago the sort hearts and minds have nothing to do with for some time weve had nothing in common but the theater i came back to new york lieutenant because i wanted this play and i knew richard would shine in his part i wanted that therell never be another like him onstage god she squeezed her eyes shut shivered its horrible horrible im more sorry to have lost the actor than the man im sorry to know that about myself no i cant be alone she sank down on the sofa cant bear it i cant sleep if i sleep i wake up and my hands are covered in blood richards blood the nightmares she lifted her head and her eyes swam as they met eves i have horrible nightmares every time i lie down they leap into my head and i wake up sick wake up screaming with his blood all over me you cant imagine you cant but eve could a small freezing room washed in the dirty red light from the sign across the street the pain the sheer hideousness of the rape of the bone hed broken in her arm when shed fought him the blood his blood everywhere slicked on her hands dripping from the blade of the knife as she crawled away shed been eight in her nightmares eve was forever eight i want you to find who did this areena whispered you have to find who did it when you do the nightmares will stop wont they wont they stop i dont know eve forced herself to step forward forced herself to step away from her own memories and stay in the present stay in control tell me what you know about the illegals who were his contacts who supplied him who played with him o o in the kitchen charles sipped his wine and roarke made do with the reasonably decent faux coffee the autochef offered areenas having a difficult time charles began i imagine she is theres no law against paying for comfort no my job is as viable as hers roarke inclined his head monroe eve has no personal vendetta against licensed companions just against me in particular shes protective of peabody with his eyes clear and direct roarke sipped again so am i im fond of delia very fond id never hurt her ive never deceived her on a sound of disgust charles turned away to stare through the window at the lights i lost my chance to have a relationship outside my job to have a life outside my job because i deceived a woman then because i cared enough about her to be honest ive come to terms with that i am what i am he turned back and his lips curved and im good at what i do delia accepts that perhaps but women are the oddest creatures arent they a man never really knows and that i think is part of their continual appeal a mysterys more interesting isnt it before its completely solved with a half laugh charles looked over his shoulder and eve walked through the door she couldnt have said precisely why it annoyed her to see charles and her husband sharing a moment of what couldnt be mistaken for anything but male amusement but since it did she scowled at roarke sorry to break up the boy talk but could you keep areena company for a moment while i speak to charles of course the coffees reasonably good she waited until hed walked out then moved to the autochef more to give herself a moment to settle than out of a desire for hotel coffee when did ms mansfield make the appointment for your services this afternoon about two i believe isnt that late notice for you yes eve pulled the coffee out leaned back against the wall with the steam rising from her cup no bookings tonight i rearranged my schedule why areena indicated you hadnt met before socially or professionally why go to that trouble for a stranger because she doubled my fee he said simply what did she buy straight sex an overnighter he paused stared down at his wine when he lifted his gaze again his eyes had gone cool i dont have to answer that and wont im investigating a homicide i can pull you in for an interview at central yes you can will you youre making this sticky she set the coffee down paced up and down the narrow space between the wall and the counter i have to put you in my report as it is thats bad enough but you make me take you in formalize this its right up peabodys nose and neither of us want that he murmured then sighed look dallas i got a call a client of mine gave my name to areena as someone who could give her a comfortable evening she was obviously upset id heard about draco so i didnt have to ask why she wanted a companion for the night dinner in conversation sex to compensate for my inconvenience she doubled my usual overnight fee its simple did you talk about draco no we talked about art we talked about theater shes had three glasses of wine and half a pack of herbals her hands stopped shaking about twenty minutes before you got here shes an emotional wreck whos trying to hold on okay i appreciate it she jammed her hands in her pockets peabodys going to see the report he could feel his own hackles rise delia knows what i do right it stuck in her craw like barbed wire shes a grown woman dallas grown my ass she gave up and kicked the wall shes out of her league with an operator like you damn it her familys freeagers she grew up out in bumfuck somewhere a vague gesture took care of the midwest shes a good cop shes a solid cop but shes still got blind sides and shes going to get really pissed off when she finds out i said anything to you about it shell jam that stick up her ass and freeze me out but damn it she matters he shot back she matters to you doesnt it occur to you that she could matter to me women are a business to you when they pay me to be my business it isnt like that with delia for christs sake we dont even have sex what she cant meet your fee as soon as it was out she hated herself hated herself more when she saw those cool eyes register simple hurt im sorry im sorry that was wrong that was way off yeah it was suddenly tired she scooted down and sat on the floor with her back against the wall i dont want to know this stuff i dont want to think about this stuff i like you intrigued he lowered to the floor his back to the counter so their knees almost brushed really yeah mostly youve been seeing her since before christmas and you havent whats wrong with her he laughed and this time it was easy and rich jesus dallas which way do you want it i have sex with her im a bastard i dont im a bastard roarke was right what do you mean roarke was right you cant figure women he took a drink of his wine shes a friend it just happened that way i dont have many friends who arent clients or in the business watch yourself they start to multiply when youre not paying attention it complicates your whole damn life youre a good friend one more thing he said and gave her foot an easy pat i mostly like you too lieutenant sugar o o the nightmare came she should have expected it areenas talk of dreams and blood and terror triggered it but even knowing she could never stop it once it slid into her mind she saw him come into the room her father that nasty little room in dallas so cold even with the temperature gauge stuck on high but seeing him smelling him knowing hed been drinking but not drinking enough had sweat popping out on her chilled arms she dropped the knife shed been so hungry so hungry it had been worth the risk of finding a snack just a little piece of cheese the knife fell out of her hand took days years centuries to reach the floor and in the dream the clatter of it was like thunder that echoed echoed echoed across his face as he walked to her the red light from the sign washed red then white then red please dont please dont please dont but it never did any good to beg it would happen again and again and again the pain of his hand smashing almost casually across her face hitting the floor so hard it rattled her bones and then his weight on top of her eve there now eve come back to me youre home her breath burned in her throat and she struggled bucking shoving against the arms that held her and roarkes voice seeped into the dream warm calm lovely safe thats right hold on to me he gathered her closer in the dark rocking her as he would a child until her shudders quieted youre all right now dont let go no he pressed his lips to her temple i wont when she woke in the morning the dream only a vague smear on her mind his arms were still around her chapter seven eve beat peabody into central it was deliberate and it cost her a full hours sleep that morning she hoped to file her updated report then move on before her aide showed up if she was lucky there would be no discussion involving charles monroe the detectives bullpen was buzzing it turned out that detective zenos wife had given birth to a baby girl the night before and hed celebrated by bringing in two dozen donuts knowing detectives eve snagged one before the unit fell on them like hyenas on scavenged meat who won the pool i did baxter grinned around a cinnamon twist with raspberry jelly six hundred and thirty smackeroos damn it i never win the baby pool consoling herself eve snagged a cruller taking the first bite she grinned at him good old baxter she thought he could be a pain in the ass but he was meticulous and sharp with details he was just perfect looks like this is your lucky day no shit ive had my eye on this new autoentertainment system the six bills plus is going to go a long way toward putting that baby in my ride thats great baxter but i mean its really your lucky day she pulled a clear file of discs out of her bag those gathered from the uniforms and detectives whod logged witness names the night of the draco homicide you get the grand prize run standard backgrounds and probabilities on these individuals re draco we got close to three thousand names here grab a couple of detectives a few uniforms if you need them and get statements lets see if you can cut that number in half by the end of the week he snorted very funny dallas i have orders from whitney to tag somebody for this duty tag baxter youre it this is bullshit when she dropped the file on his desk his eyes wheeled you cant dump this nightmare on me dallas can have did youre dropping crumbs baxter you should remember to always keep your area clean pleased with the mornings work she headed for her office with his curses following her the door was open and the sounds of riffling came clearly into the hall eve pressed her back to the wall danced her fingers over her weapon the son of a bitch she had him this time the sneaking candy thiefs ass was hers at last she charged into the room leading with her fist and caught the intruder by the scruff of the neck gotcha hey lady she had six inches and a good twenty pounds on him eve calculated she could squeeze him through her skinny window without too much trouble hed make an interesting smear on the pavement below im not going to read you your rights she said as she bounced him against the file cabinets you wont need them where youre going call lieutenant dallas his voice piped out like a rusty flute call lieutenant dallas she hauled him around stared into his jittery eyes doubled in size behind microgoggles i am dallas you candystealing putz well jeez jeez im lewis tomjohn lewis from maintenance i got your new equipment what the hell are you talking about let me smell your breath you got candy breath im going to pull out your tongue and strangle you with it with his feet dangling an inch from the floor he puffed out his cheeks and blew explosive air in her face cracked wheat waffles down to the eatery and and the fruit cup i aint had candy swear to god no but you might want to consider a stronger mouthwash whats this about new equipment there right there i was just finishing the transfer still holding him off the floor she turned her head her mouth fell open seconds before she dropped lewis in a heap and leaped on the industrial gray shell of the computer mine its mine yes sir lieutenant sir shes all yours with her arms possessively circled around the unit she looked back at him look maintenance boy if youre toying with me ill bite your ears off and make them into stew i got the order right here moving cautiously he reached in his pocket for his logbook punched in the code see here dallas lieutenant eve homicide division you got yourself a new xe you requisitioned it yourself i requisitioned it two goddamn years ago yeah well he smiled hopefully here she is i was just hooking her to the mainframe you want i should finish yeah i want you should finish okay have it done in a wink then get right out of your way he all but dived under the desk what the hell kind of name is tomjohn its my name lieutenant you got your complete owners manual and users guide in that box over there she looked over snorted at the foothigh box i know how it works i have this model at home its a good machine once youre linked to the main all we gotta do is transfer your code and data from your old equipment take about thirty minutes tops i got time she skimmed her eyes over her old unit dented battered despised some of the dents had been put into it by her own frustrated fist what happens to my old equipment i can haul it out for you take it down to recycle fine no no i want it i want to take it home shed perform a ritual extermination she decided she hoped it suffered okay by me since he figured his tongue and his ears were safe again he began to whistle with his work that things been obsolete for five years dont know how you managed to get anything done with it her only response to that was a low throaty growl o o when peabody came in an hour later eve was sitting at her crowded desk grinning look peabody its christmas whoa peabody came in circled around whoa squared its beautiful yeah its mine tomjohn lewis my new best friend hooked it up for me it listens to me peabody it does what i tell it to do thats great sir i know youll be very happy together okay funs over she picked up her coffee jerking her thumb toward the autochef so peabody knew she was welcome to a cup of her own i did a runthrough on dracos apartment last night i didnt know you planned to do that i would have adjusted my personal time it wasnt necessary eve had a nasty image of the scene in areenas apartment if peabody had come along draco kept a stash of illegals in his penthouse a variety pack that included nearly an ounce of pure wild rabbit creep you bet also a number of inventive sex toys some of which were out of the scope of even my wide range of experience he had a collection of video discs and a large percentage of them are personal sexual encounters so we have a dead sexual deviant the toys and the discs are personal choice but the rabbit shuffles him over into sd territory it could go to motive or motives since theyre piling up like freeagers at a protest rally no offense none taken weve got as potentials ambition personal gain money sex illegals woman or women scorned and allaround general dislike he enjoyed preying on women generally pushing members of both sexes around he had a regular illegals habit he was also an irritating son of a bitch and had everyone who knew him wanting to string him up by his intestines it doesnt cut the list by much but she shifted in her chair i started running probabilities last night made some headway my handy new xe will copy that data to you so you can continue to run scans i have a consult with mira shortly that may help shave the working list down set up a conference with our pals in edd for eleven and the interviews this afternoon go as scheduled ill be back in an hour two at most she pushed away from her desk if i get held up contact the lab and nag dickhead into verifying the illegals i sent down this morning a pleasure bribe or threat how long have you worked with me now peabody almost a year sir eve nodded as she strode out long enough use your own judgment o o miras area was more civilized eve imagined that was the word compared with the warrens and hives of the majority of cop central a bubble of calm she supposed especially if you didnt know what went on behind the doors of testing eve knew and she hoped eons passed before she was forced to step through them again but miras individual space was a world away from the depersonalizing and demoralizing cage of testing she favored shades of blues in her cozy scoop chairs in the soothing ocean waves she often set on her mood screen today she was dressed in one of her soft and snazzy pastel suits a hopeful green the color of spring leaf buds her hair waved back from a face of composed beauty eve constantly admired there were teardrop pearls at her ears that matched the single dangle on a goldlinked chain at her throat she was to eves mind the perfect example of gracious femininity i appreciate you fitting me in this morning i feel a vested interest mira began as she programmed her autochef for tea being a witness in all my years attached to the nypsd ive never witnessed a murder she turned with two cups of floralscented tea in her hand and caught the dark flicker in eves eyes richard draco was not a murder eve it was an execution an entirely different matter she took her seat handing eve the tea they both knew shed barely sip i study murder murderers i listen to them and i analyze them i profile them and as a doctor i know understand and respect death but having a murder take place right in front of my eyes not to know it was real well its given me some bad moments its difficult i was thinking ingenious well a ghost of a smile curved miras lips your viewpoint and mine come from different angles i suppose yeah and eves angle was often standing over the dead with blood on her boots it occurred to her now she hadnt taken miras state of mind into consideration that night at the theater she had simply drafted her onto the team and used her as it seemed most efficient im sorry i didnt think of it i never gave you a choice you had no reason to think of it and at the time neither did i she shook it off lifted her tea you were backstage and at work very quickly how soon did you realize the knife was real not soon enough to stop it thats what counts ive started my interviews concentrating on the actors first yes the crimes steeped in theatrics the method the timing the staging more comfortable with the analytical distance mira ran the scene in her mind an actor or someone who aspires or aspired to be one fits the profile on the other hand the murder was clean well produced carefully executed your killer is bold eve but also coolheaded would they have needed to see it happen yes i think so to see it under the lights on the stage with the audience gasping in shock that in my opinion was as important to this individual as dracos death the thrill of it and the ensuing act their own shock and horror well rehearsed she considered it was too well staged not to have been rehearsed draco was touted as one of the greatest actors of our time killing him was one step replacing him even if only in the killers mind was an essential second youre saying it was professionally motivated yes on one level but it was also very personal if we look at an actor or an aspiring one professional and personal motives could be easily blended the only one to tangibly benefit from dracos death professionally is michael proctor the understudy logically yes yet everyone onstage or attached to that performance benefits the media attention the names fixed in the minds of the public that indelible moment in time isnt that what an actor aspires to the indelible moment i dont know i dont understand people who spend their lives being other people the work the skill is in making the viewing audience believe they are other people the theater is more than a job to those who do it well who devote their life to it it is just as your job is to you a way of life and on the night draco was murdered the spotlight shone a little brighter for everyone in that play in the play or involved with the play not in the audience with current data i cant eliminate audience members but am more inclined toward a person or persons closer to the stage mira set her cup aside laid a hand over eves youre concerned about nadine eve opened her mouth shut it again nadines a patient and shes very open with me im fully aware of her history with the victim and im fully prepared should it become necessary to give my professional opinion that she isnt capable of planning and executing a violent crime if shed wanted to punish draco she would have found a way to do so through the media shes capable of that very capable okay good ive spoken with her mira went on i know youre interviewing her formally today after i leave here just me nadine and her lawyer i want it on record that she came to me with the information i can bury the statement for a few days give her some breathing room that will help but mira scanned eves face saw more what else off the record of course eve took a sip of the tea then told mira about the video disc in dracos penthouse she doesnt know mira said immediately she would have told me it would have troubled and infuriated her embarrassed her he must have taped it without her knowledge then the next line would be what if he showed it to her when she went to see him the day he was murdered housekeeping would have reported considerable damage to the suite and draco would have been forced to seek emergency medical care before his performance mira sat back its good to see you smile im sorry youve been worried about her she was shook when we had our meet really shook eve pushed out of the chair wandered to the mood screen and watched the waves ebb and flow ive got too many people buzzing in my ears its distracting would you go back to your life as it was a year ago eve two years ago parts of it were easier i got up in the morning and did my job maybe hung out with mavis a couple of times a week she blew out a breath no i wouldnt go back doesnt matter anyway im where i am so back to draco eve continued he was a sexual predator yes i read your updated report just before you arrived i will agree that sex was one of his favored weapons but it wasnt the sex itself that fulfilled him it was the control the package of his looks his style his talent and sexuality used to control women women whom he considered his playthings and through them showing his superiority to other men he was obsessed with being the center and the illegal a guy uses rabbit on a woman because he doesnt think hes going to score with her it takes away her right to choose agreed but in this case i would say it was just another prop to him no different in his mind than candlelight and romantic music he believed himself a great lover just as he knew himself to be a great actor his indulgences in his mind were no more than his right as a star im not saying that sex doesnt play a part in the motive eve i believe in this case you have layers and layers of motives and a very complex killer very likely every bit as egocentric as the victim two of a kind eve murmured o o he had it figured actors they thought they were so fucking brilliant so special so important well he couldve been an actor if hed really wanted but it was just like his father had always told him you work backstage you work forever actors they came and they went but a good stagehand never had to go looking for work linus quim had been a stagehand for thirty years for the last ten hed been top dog thats why hed been offered the head job at the new globe thats why he pulled in the highest wage the union could squeeze out of the stingy bastards of management and even then his pay didnt come close to what the actors raked in and where would they be without him that was going to change now because he had it figured pretty shortly the new globe was going to be looking for a new head stagehand linus quim was going to retire in style when he worked he kept his eyes and his ears open he studied nobody knew what was what and who was what to who in a theater company the way linus quim knew above all he was an expert on timing cues were never missed when linus was in charge he knew the last time hed seen the prop knife exactly when and where and knowing that left only one window of opportunity for the switch and only one person to linuss thinking who could have managed it so slick could have had just enough time to stick the dummy knife in areena mansfields dressing room it had taken guts hed give em that linus stopped by a corner glidecart for a latemorning snack loading down a pretzel with bright yellow mustard hey the operator snatched at the tube with a hand protected with ratty fingerless gloves you gonna use that much you gonna pay extra up yours wigwam linus added another blob for the hell of it you use twice too much the operator a battlescarred asian with less than three months on the corner danced in place on tiny feet you pay extra linus considered squirting what was left in the tube in the mans pruney face then remembered his upcoming fortune it made him feel generous he dug a fiftycent credit out of his pocket flipped it in the air now you can retire he said as the operator snagged it on the downward arc he sucked at the mustarddrowned pretzel as he strolled away he was a little man and skinny too but for the soccer ballsized potbelly over his belt his arms were long for his height and ropey with muscle his face was like a smashed dish badly glued back together flat and round and cracked with lines his exwife had often urged him to spend a little of his hoarded savings on some simple cosmetic repair linus didnt see the point what did it matter how he looked when his job was essentially not to be seen but he thought he might spring for some work now he was going to take himself off to tahiti or bali or maybe even to one of the resort satellites bask in sun and sand and women the half million hed be paid to keep his little observations to himself would pump up his lifes savings nicely he wondered if he should have asked for more hed kept the payoff on the low end nothing an actor couldnt scrape up in linuss opinion hed even be willing to take it in installments he could be reasonable and the fact was he had to admire the guts and skill involved here and the choice of target hed never met an actor hed despised more than draco and linus hated actors with almost religious equality he stuffed the rest of the pretzel in his mouth wiped mustard from his chin the letter hed sent would have been delivered first thing that morning hed paid the extra freight for that an investment the letter was better than a link call or a personal visit those sorts of things could be traced cops might have everybodys links bugged he wouldnt put it past the cops who he distrusted nearly as much as actors hed kept the note simple and direct he recalled i know what you did and how you did it good job meet me at the theater backstage lower level eleven oclock i want i wont go to the cops he was a son of a bitch anyway he hadnt signed it everyone who worked with him knew his square block printing hed had some bad moments worrying that the note would be passed to the cops and hed be arrested for attempted blackmail but hed put that possibility away what was half a million to an actor he used the stage door keying in his code his palms were a little sweaty nerves and excitement the door closed behind him with a metallic echoing clang then he breathed in the scent of the theater drew in the glorious silence of it he felt a tug at his heart sharp and unexpected after today hed be giving this up the smells the sounds the lights and lines it was all hed really ever known and the sudden realization of love for it rocked him didnt matter a damn he reminded himself and turned to the stairs that led below the stage they had theaters on tahiti if he wanted a busmans holiday he could even maybe open his own little regional place a theatercasino palace that was a thought the linus quim theater had a ring to it at the base of the stairs he turned right down the twisty corridor he was humming now happy in his own space bubbling lightly with anticipation of what was to come an arm snaked out hooked around his neck he yelped more in surprise than fear started to turn fumes poured into his mouth and nose his vision blurred his head rang he couldnt feel his extremities what what you need a drink the voice whispered in his ear friendly comforting come on linus you need a drink i got the bottle out of your locker his head drooped down weighing like a stone on his skinny neck all he could see behind his eyelids were bleeding colors his feet shuffled over the floor as he was gently led to a seat he swallowed obediently when a glass was held to his lips there thats better isnt it dizzy thatll pass the voice stayed soft and soothing youll just feel very calm the tranqs mild hardly more than a kiss you just sit there ill take care of everything okay he smiled vaguely thanks oh its no trouble the noose had already been prepared from a long length of rope culled from the fly floor gloved hands slipped it smoothly around linuss neck snugged and straightened it how do you feel now linus pretty good pretty damn good i thought youd be pissed no but there was a sigh that might have been regret im taking the money and going to tahiti are you im sure youll enjoy that linus i want you to write something for me heres your pen thats the way heres the pad you always use to make your notes you never use an epad do you papers good enough for me goddamn it he hiccupped grinned of course write this down would you i did it thats all you have to say just write i did it then sign your name perfect thats just perfect i did it he signed his name in a stingy little scrawl i figured it out yes you did that was very clever of you linus are you still dizzy nope i feel okay i feel fine did you bring money im going to tahiti you did everybody a favor by wasting that stupid bastard thank you i thought so too lets stand up now steady as a rock good would you do me a favor could you climb up the ladder here id like you to loop this end of the rope over that pole and tie it off nice and snug nobody ties knots like a veteran stagehand sure thing he went up humming on the ground his killer watched with heartthrumming anticipation there had been fear when the note had arrived tidal waves of fear and panic and despair those were done now had to be done only mild irritation and the spur of challenge remained how to deal with it the answer had come so smoothly so clearly eliminate the threat give the police their killer all in one stroke in moments only moments now it would all be done all tied off linus called shell hold im sure oh no linus dont walk back down confused he shifted on the ladder looked down at the smiling face below dont walk down no jump jump off the ladder linus wont that be fun just like jumping into the pretty blue water in tahiti like in tahiti thats where im going once im flush yes like tahiti the laughter was delighted encouraging a careful ear might have heard the strain beneath it but linus only laughed in return come on linus dive right in the waters fine he grinned held his nose and jumped this time death wasnt quiet the panicked kicking feet knocked the ladder down with a thunderous clatter it hit the bottle of brew in an explosion of glass choked gasps forced their way through the tightened noose became rattles for seconds only seconds but the air seemed to scream with them and then there was only the faint creak of the rope swinging like the creak of a mast in high seas it was curiously romantic chapter eight weighing in miras profile of the killer the scales drop on the side of a performer an actor eve continued or someone who wants or wanted to be one well you got your headliners feeney stretched out his legs your second string your extras add them all up you still got more than thirty potentials you add the wannabes to that and christ knows we divvy them up and cut them down the same way baxter should cut down audience members feeney spread his lips in a grin we heard his whining all the way over in edd then my job there is done we factor in connections to the victim eve went on placement during the last act we haul the most probables into interview and start sweating them mcnab shifted in his chair lifted a finger its still possible that the killer was someone in the audience somebody who knew draco had theater experience even working baxter and whoever he drags into it with him twentyfour seven on probabilities and backgrounds itll take weeks to eliminate we dont have weeks eve shot back this is high profile pressures going to build on the tower she said referring to the office of the commissioner that means its going to squeeze us and squeeze us soon we run the audience as baxter passes on potentials and keep running them until we whittle it down meantime we focus on the stage she moved to the board where the stills of the murder scene the body the graphs and charts from the probability scans and background checks run to date were already tacked this wasnt a spree killing it wasnt an impulse it was planned staged it was performed and it was recorded ive got copies of the discs for everyone were going to watch the play each of us study it until we know the lines the moves so well we could go on the road with it ourselves its about twisting the law she murmured about playing with it and in the end its about a kind of justice the murderer might see dracos death that way a kind of justice feeney rattled the sugared nuts in the bag in his pocket nobody loved him then we figure out who hated him most o o the boys name was ralph and he looked both terrified and excited he wore a battered yankees jacket over his dull brown janitorial uniform he either had a very bad haircut or roarke supposed was sporting some new fashion whichever he was forced to blow sweep or shake the ragged streams of dark hair out of his eyes on a continual basis i didnt think youd come yourself sir part of ralphs panicked excitement came from the idea of speaking facetoface with the legendary roarke everybody knew the man was totally ice orders are to report anything out of the ordinary to control so when i saw how the stage door wasnt locked and coded i figured how i should report it right off thats right did you go inside well i ralph didnt see any point in admitting his overactive imagination hadnt let him get two feet beyond the door i started to you know then i saw how there were lights on that arent supposed to be on i thought it was smarter to stay out here and be guarding the door like good thinking roarke crouched down studied the locks glanced up idly at the security camera its indicator light was off and it shouldnt have been do you usually work alone oh no sir but since you know the buildings closed because of that guy getting dead and stuff my super asked one of the cleaning crew to volunteer for light maintenance with the whole deal on opening night nobody ever got to cleaning the bathrooms and stuff the super he said how the cops gave us clearance to go back in since they got what they needed already yes roarke had been informed only that morning that certain areas of the building were not cleared were not supposed to pass the police barriers onstage or back super said theyll give you a bitch of a shock if you try to mess with them super is quite correct so im just supposed to deal with the bathrooms is all i popped for it cause i can use the money you know yes roarke straightened smiled at the boy i know very well well then ralph is it well just go in and see whats what sure there was an audible gulp as ralph stepped inside behind roarke you know they say a murderer always returns like to the scene of his crime do they roarkes voice was mild as he scanned the area youll learn theres very little always in the world ralph but its possible they could be right this time around the rooms beyond the anteroom were dark but there was a backwash of light shining up the stairs from the lower level roarke started down tucked a hand in his pocket where hed slipped a small illegalforcivilianuse stunner when hed gotten the call of a potential breakin he followed the glow toward the understage area he smelled home brew the justgoingsour punch of it and a nasty undertone he recognized as death yes im afraid theyre right this time he murmured then turned the corner oh shit oh man ralphs voice jumped over the words and his eyes goggled at the figure dangling from a stout length of rope is that a guy it was if youre going to be sick theres no shame in it but find another place huh roarke glanced back the boys face was sheet white his eyes going glassy to keep it simple roarke simply pressed a hand on ralphs shoulder and lowered him to the floor put your head down take slow breaths thats the way son youll do fine turning from the boy roarke walked to the hanged man poor stupid bastard he thought aloud and took out his palm link to call his wife dallas what roarke i cant talk to you now im up to my neck here speaking of necks im looking at one now thats been considerably stretched youll need to come to the theater lieutenant lower level ive found another body for you o o death demanded routine even if the primary investigators husband discovered the body can you identify him she asked roarke and signaled for peabody to record the scene quim linus quim i checked the employment records after i called you head stagehand he was fiftysix divorced no children he lived on seventh alone according to his file did you know him personally no okay stand by peabody get me a ladder i dont want to use this one until weve done a full sweep whos the kid she asked roarke ralph biden one of the janitorial team he was going to work solo today saw the stage door was unlocked and called it in give me times eve demanded as she studied the angle of the fallen ladder the pattern of shattered glass from the broken brew bottle after one long stare roarke took out his log he contacted maintenance control at eleven twentythree i was alerted six minutes later and arrived onscene at noon precisely is that exact enough to satisfy lieutenant she knew the tone and couldnt help it if he decided to be annoyed still she scowled at his back and he walked away to take a small stepladder from peabody did you or the kid touch anything i know the routine roarke set the ladder under the body nearly as well as you by now she merely grunted shouldered her field kit and started up the ladder hanging is an unpleasant death and the shell left behind reflects it it bulges the eyes purples the face he hadnt weighed more than onetwenty eve thought not enough not nearly enough for the weight to drop down fast and heavy and mercifully snap his neck instead hed choked to death slowly enough to be aware to fight to regret with hands coated with sealit she tugged the single sheet of cheap recycled paper out of his belt after a quick scan she handed the paper down bag it peabody yes sir selftermination cops who jump to conclusions trip over same and fall on their asses call for a crime scene team alert the me we have an unattended death chastised peabody pulled out her communicator eve logged time of death for the recorder and examined the very precise hangmans knot why selftermination officer peabody ah subject is found hanged to death a traditional method of selftermination in his place of employment there is a signed suicide note a broken bottle of home brew with a single glass there are no apparent signs of struggle or violence first people have been hanged as an execution method for centuries second we have no evidence at this time the subject wrote the note found onscene last until a full examination of the body is complete we cannot determine if there are other marks of violence even if there are not eve continued backing down the ladder a man can be coerced into a noose yes sir on the surface it looks like selftermination its not our job to stop at the surface and assume but to observe record gather evidence and eventually conclude eve stepped away studied the scene why would a man come here to an empty theater sit and drink a glass of brew write a brief note fashion himself a nice tidy noose secure it walk up a ladder then step off since she understood she was expected to answer peabody gave it her best the theater is his workplace selfterminators often take this step in their place of employment im talking about quim linus specifics peabody not generalities yes sir if he was responsible for dracos death which could be the meaning of the note he may have been overcome by guilt and he returned here to where draco was killed balancing the scales by taking his own life under the stage think of the profile peabody think of the original crime and its method of execution i find calculation ruthlessness and daring tell me where do you find guilt with this eve strode off to where ralph was sitting pale and silent in a corner screwed that up peabody muttered big time she blew out a breath trying not to be embarrassed shed had her wings pinned in front of roarke shes pissed now shes angry not at you particularly roarke added nor at me he looked back at the corpse the pathetic waste of it and understood his wife perfectly death offends her each time every time she deals with it shell tell you that you cant take it personally yes he watched eve sit beside ralph automatically shielding his view of death with her body shell tell you that o o he could be patient roarke knew how to wait to choose his time and his place just as he knew that eve would seek him out would find him if for no other reason than to assure herself he hadnt stuck his fingers too deeply into her work so he sat on the stage still dressed with the final courtroom set an odd place for a man with his background he thought with some amusement as he used his personal palm computer to scan updated stock reports and revise a departmental memo hed turned the stage lights on though that had simply been for convenience when she tracked him down he sat in the dock under a cool blue spot and he looked as seductive as a condemned angel they ever get you that far hmm he glanced up youve seen my records no arrests ive seen whats left of your records after you played with them lieutenant thats a serious accusation still a smile flirted with his mouth but no ive never had the pleasure of defending myself in a court of law on a criminal matter hows the boy who oh ralph a little shaky she climbed the stairs to the dock i had a couple of uniforms take him home we shouldnt need to talk to him again and after he recovers hell have all his pals buying him a beer to hear the story exactly so youre a fine judge of human nature and hows our peabody what do you mean youre a good teacher lieutenant but a fierce one i wondered if shed recovered from the bruising you gave her she wants to make detective she wants to work murders first rule you go on a scene you dont bring anything with you no preconceptions no conclusions and you dont take what you see at first glance on face value you think feeney didnt slap me upside the head with that a few times when he was my trainer i imagine he did and had plenty of bruises of his own when he hit the rock of it if thats a fancy way of saying im hardheaded it doesnt insult me shell learn and shell think more carefully next time she hates screwing up he reached up idly to brush his knuckles over her cheek i thought the same myself now why dont you think this is selftermination i didnt say i didnt there are a number of tests to be run the me will make the call i wasnt asking for the medical examiners opinion but yours she started to speak then set her teeth and jammed her hands in her pockets you know what that was down there that was a fucking insult that was a stage carefully set for my benefit somebody thinks im stupid now he did smile no someone knows youre smart very smart and took great care right down to the bottle of what will undoubtedly turn out to be quims own home brew ive checked his locker you can still smell the stuff he kept a bottle in there all right what did he know she muttered head stagehand that means hed have to know where everything needs to be and when people props the works yes id assume so what did he know she said again what did he see what did he think what did he die for he wrote down stuff in this little notebook the handwriting on the death note looks like a match if the me doesnt find something off hes likely to rule it selftermination roarke rose youll be working late yeah looks like see that you eat something other than a candy bar her mouth went grim somebody stole my candy bars again the bastard he leaned down kissed her lightly ill see you at home o o if eves preconception that theater people led richly bohemian lives had taken a dent after a look at michael proctors living quarters it suffered a major blow when she reached linus quims excuse for an apartment one step up from streetsleeping she shook her head as she took her first scan of the single streetlevel room the antiburglar bars covering the two grimy arrowslot windows were coated with muck and caged out whatever pitiful sunlight might have struggled to fight its way into the gloom but bars and muck werent enough to keep out the constant clamor of street traffic or the uneasy vibrations from the subway that ran directly under the ugly room lights on she ordered and was rewarded with a flickering hopeless yellow glow from the dusty ceiling unit absently she stuck her hands in her jacket pockets it was colder inside than it was out in the frisky latewinter wind the entire place such as it was smelled of old sweat older dust and what she assumed was last nights dinner of hash and beans what did you say this guy pulled down a year she asked peabody peabody pulled out her ppc scanned union scale for his position is eight hundred and fifty a show with ascending hourly wage for putups teardowns turnaround and overtime pay union takes a twentyfive percent bite for dues retirement health plans and blahblah but our guy still raked in about three hundred thousand annually and chose to live like this well he was either spending it or stashing it somewhere she strode across the bare floor to the computer unit this piece of craps older than the piece of crap i just got rid of computer on it coughed wheezed snorted then emitted a sickly blue light display financial records for quim linus password required for data display ill give you a password halfheartedly she rapped the unit with her fist and recited her rank and badge number privacy act protects requested data password required peabody deal with this thing eve turned her back on it and began riffling through the drawers in a cabinet that had the consistency of cardboard arena ball programs she announced while peabody tried to reason with the computer and more notebooks our boy liked to bet on the games which might explain where his salary went hes got it all written down here wins and losses mostly losses pettyante stuff though doesnt look like he was spinecracker material she moved on to the next drawer well well look at this brochures of tropical islands forget the financials peabody see if he went searching for data on tahiti she moved onto the closet pushed through a handful of shirts feeling the pockets checking for hiding places in the two pairs of shoes as far as she could see the guy had kept nothing no mementos no photographs no personal discs just his notebooks he had a weeks worth of clothes obviously old which included one wrinkled suit his cupboards turned up several dehydrated single packs of hash several bottles of brew one jumbo bag of soy chips as yet unopened she took the bag out frowned over it why does a man so obviously tight with his money spring for a jumbo bag of chips then hang himself before he eats them maybe he was too depressed some people cant eat when theyre depressed me i head right for the highest caloric content available looks to me like he ate last night and again this morning autopsy will confirm that but his recyclers overstaffed wincing she reached into the slot and pulled out an empty bag soy chips my guess is he finished them off yesterday and had his backup bag ready for his next nutritious meal theres a half bottle of brew chilling in his friggie box and two backups in the cupboard well maybe good call on tahiti dallas peabody straightened it was his last data search weve got pictures tourist data climate scans as she spoke the machine began to play exotic music heavy on the drums and halfnaked dancing girls why does our urbanite do scans of faraway islands eve walked back over watched the native women shake impressively in some tribal dance computer replay most recent search for transpo choices and costs from new york city to tahiti working last search for transpo data initiated oh three thirtyfive twentyeight march by quim linus data as follows roarke airlines offers the most direct flights daily naturally eve said dryly computer hold quim spent time just this morning researching flights to tahiti doesnt sound like a guy suffering from guilt and depression computer list quim linus passport and or visa data working quim linus request for passport initiated fourteen hundred hours twentysix march going on a trip werent you linus she stepped back what did you see what did you know she murmured and who were you going to tap for the money to pay for your island vacation lets take this unit in to feeney peabody o o eliza rothchild had made her debut on stage at the age of six months as a fretful baby causing her parents distress in a drawing room comedy the play had flopped but eliza had been the critics darling her own mother had pushed her pulled her from audition to audition by the age of ten eliza was a veteran of stage and screen by twenty shed been a respected character actress with a room full of awards homes on three continents and her first and last unhappy marriage behind her at forty shed been around so long no one wanted to see her including producers she claimed to be retired rather than used up and had spent the next decade of her life traveling throwing lavish parties and fighting excruciating boredom when the opportunity arose to play the nagging nurse miss plimsoll in the stage production of witness shed pretended reluctance allowed herself to be wooed and had privately wept copious tears of relief and gratitude she loved the theater more than she had ever loved any man or any woman now as her security screen announced the arrival of the police she prepared to play her role with dignity and discretion she answered the door herself a sternly attractive woman who didnt bother to disguise her age her hair was a rich auburn threaded with silver the lines around her hazel eyes fanned out without apology she wore a hipskimming tunic and sweeping trousers over a short sturdy body she offered eve a hand glittering with rings smiled coolly and stepped back good afternoon she said in her smooth voice that held the granite of new england its comforting to see the police are prompt i appreciate your time ms rothchild well i dont really have a choice do i but to give it to you youre free to speak through or with a lawyer or representative of course my lawyer is standing by should i decide to do so she gestured toward the living area i know your husband lieutenant quite the most fatally attractive man ive ever encountered he may have told you i was reluctant to come out of retirement and accept the role of miss plimsoll but quite frankly i couldnt resist him she smiled again sat in an elegant highbacked chair with a tapestry seat rested her elbows on the wide arms folded her hands who could roarke persuaded you to come out of retirement lieutenant im sure youre aware theres nothing roarke couldnt talk a woman into or out of her eyes measured and judged eve then shifted idly to peabody still youre not here to discuss roarke but another fatally attractive man though in my opinion richard lacked your husbands charm and underlying well say decency for lack of a better word were you and richard draco involved romantically eliza blinked several times then laughed the sound was a steady bubbling gurgle oh my dear girl should i be flattered or insulted oh me with a sigh she patted her breast as if the bout of humor had been a strain on the heart let me say that richard would never have wasted that particular area of his skills on me even when we were young he considered me much too plain too physically ordinary too intellectual i believe was one of his terms he considered cultural intellect a flaw in a woman she paused as if realizing shed gone too far in the wrong direction then opted to finish it out gallantry was not one of his talents he often made snide little jokes about my lack of appeal i chose to be neither amused nor offended as what it came down to was simple we were of an age you see which meant i was years too old for his taste and if i may say several notches too selfreliant he preferred the young and the vulnerable and that eve thought had come out in a flood as if it had been dammed up quite some time then your relationship with him would have been strictly professional yes we certainly socialized theater people tend to be an incestuous little group metaphorically and literally as well i suppose we attended many of the same parties performances and benefits over the years never as a couple we were civil enough as we both knew he wasnt interested in me in a sexual manner it took away that tension civil eve repeated but not friendly no i cant claim we were ever friendly can you tell me where you were on opening night between the scenes that took place in the bar and the courtroom the scene where christine vole is called back as a witness yes of course as its as much a routine as what i do onstage i went back to my dressing room to check my makeup i prefer doing my own makeup as most of us do then i was backstage for a time my next scene has me in the balcony watching the courtroom and sir wilfred along with the character of diana and a number of extras did you see or speak with anyone between those scenes im sure i did eliza lifted her fingers making a little steeple then collapsed them a number of the technical crew would have been backstage and i might have exchanged a word or two carly and i passed each other passed each other yes as i was coming out of my dressing room she was going toward hers hurriedly as our cue was coming up shortly did we speak she paused pursing her lips searching the ceiling as if for the memory i believe we did she made some offhand complaint about richard i think she said hed given her ass a bit of a pinch or pat it annoyed her as well it should given his treatment of her she continued to sit regally her eyes bright and fixed on eves i find it hard to sympathize as shes smart enough to know better than to get involved with a man of his nature i believe i made just that sort of comment to kenneth before i started up to the second level of the set to take my mark you saw him as well yes pacing about muttering to himself he often does so before a scene i couldnt tell you if he heard me or noticed kenneth tries to stay in character and he works very hard to ignore nurse plimsoll anyone else well i yes i saw michael proctor he was in the wings im sure he was dreaming of the night when he might have his chance to play vole not that i believe for a moment he arranged to do so he has such a helpless air doesnt he i can see this business devouring him whole in another year or so and areena mansfield did you see her as well certainly she made the dash to her dressing room she had a full costume and makeup change between those scenes she raced right past me but honestly lieutenant if you want the positions and activities of the cast between scenes you dont want to talk to one of us you want quim hes head stagehand a rumpled little man with sneaky eyes that miss little to nothing hes everywhere not anymore eve said quietly linus quim was found hanged this morning in the theater lower level for the first time elizas polished veneer cracked her hand went to her heart trembled there hanged the welltrained voice was husky on the single word hanged she repeated there must be a mistake who would kill a harmless little toad like quim it appeared to be selftermination nonsense eliza got to her feet why thats nonsense it takes great bravery or great cowardice to end your own life he had neither he was just an irritating little man one who did his job well and never seemed to enjoy it if hes dead someone killed him thats two she said almost to herself two deaths in the theater tragedies come in threes whos next she shuddered lowered herself to her chair again someones killing us the avid interest in her eyes was gone the play of amusement around her mouth turned down to worry theres another play lieutenant dallas by the late dame christie and then there were none ten people subtly linked who are murdered one at a time i dont intend to have a role in it you have to stop this i intend to is there a reason anyone would wish you harm ms rothchild no no i have no enemies on the scope that leads to murder but there will be at least one more its theater and were a superstitious lot if theres two there must be three there will be three she said unless you do something about it she jolted when her security beeped the lobby clerks face came cheerfully onscreen ms landsdowne is here to see you ms rothchild shall i send her up im engaged at the moment she began but eve held up a hand please have her come up i eliza lifted a hand to her hair patted it yes yes please send her up does carly often drop by eve asked not really shes been here of course i enjoy entertaining i dont recall her simply popping in this way im really not up to chatting with her at the moment thats all right i am ill get the door eve said when the buzzer sounded eve took a moment to study carlys face on the security screen frantic would have been her description she watched it change to shock then smooth out quickly to careless curiosity after she opened the door lieutenant i didnt realize you were here apparently ive chosen a bad time to pay a call on eliza saves me tracking you down for a followup interview too bad i dont have my lawyer in my pocket she stepped inside i was just out shopping and decided to drop by she caught eves speculative look at her empty hands i had a few things sent on to my apartment i do hate lugging parcels eliza carly swept in arms spread and met eliza in the center of the living area they exchanged light hugs and doublecheeked air kisses i didnt realize you were entertaining the nypsd shall i leave you alone no eliza gripped her arm carly the lieutenants just told me quims dead linus quim i know turning she linked arms with eliza i caught the news onscreen i thought you were shopping i was carly nodded at eve there was a young man entertaining himself with a palm unit while his young woman tried on half the wardrobe in sportswear and separates i heard the name she lifted a hand appeared to struggle with herself briefly it upset me panicked me frankly i didnt know what to think when i heard the report i was just a few blocks away and i came here i wanted to tell someone whod understand understand what eve prompted the report said its believed his death is linked to richards i dont see how it could be richard never took notice of techs or crew as far as he was concerned the sets were dressed and changed by magic unless there was a problem then hed abuse them verbally or physically quim never missed a cue so richard wouldnt have known he existed how could there be a link but you noticed him of course creepy little man she gave a delicate shudder eliza i hate to impose but i could really use a drink i could use one myself she decided and rang for a serving droid did you notice quim on opening night eve asked just that he was doing what he did in his usual silent scowling way did you speak to him i may have i dont recall id like a vodka rocks carly added when the droid appeared a double you didnt appear this upset when draco was killed and in front of your eyes i can think of a dozen reasons any number of people would want to kill richard carly snapped back including yourself yes she took the glass from the droid took one quick sip most definitely including myself but quim changes everything if their deaths are connected i want to know because the idea scares me tragedies happen in threes eliza stated her voice round and full and passionate oh thanks darling just what i needed to hear carly lifted her glass drained the contents o o weird these people are fucking weird eve got in her vehicle and headed back to central one of their associates gets stuck in the heart basically at their feet and theyre like my goodness would you look at that a tech is hanged and they fall apart she flipped on her car link and contacted feeney no home link calls in or out in a fortyeighthour period he reported no calls to anyone on your list period he had biweekly contact with a bookie for bets on arena ball kept it under the legal limit tell me something interesting im dozing off here he put a hold on a royalclass ticket to tahiti but didnt book it one way heading out a week from tuesday also put a hold on a vip suite at the island pleasure resort a full months stay made some inquiries about real estate looking into some cliffside house in the neighborhood of two mil the guys financials add up to about a quarter of that the ticket and the suite would have gobbled most of that up so he was looking to come into a nice pile or he was a hell of a dreamer cant find anything on his unit to indicate he did previous scans you know like a hobby blackmailing a murderer might net you a nice pile or a noose feeney added yeah im heading by the morgue to nag morse nobody does it better feeney said before eve cut him off chapter nine ah lieutenant dallas chief medical examiner morses dark eyes glittered behind his microgoggles above the serviceable lenses his eyebrows arched in two long slim triangles at the peak of the left was a small shiny silver hoop he snapped his fingers held out his sealed hand palm up a grumbling assistant flipped a twentydollar credit into it dallas you never disappoint me you see rochinsky never bet against the house the credit disappeared into one of the pockets of his pukegreen protective jumpsuit win a bet eve asked oh yes indeed a small wager with my associate that you would show up in our happy home before five pm its nice to be predictable she looked down at the middleaged mixedrace woman currently stretched out under morses laser scalpel the y cut had already been made thats not my dead guy very observant meet allyanne preen detective harrisons dead gal who was several slots ahead of yours licensed companion street level she was found stretched out in an abandoned lexus coupe in the great automotive morgue we call longterm parking la guardia trouble with a john no outward signs of violence no recent sexual encounters he scooped out her liver weighed and logged it shes got a faint blue tinge to her skin eve bent down to examine the hands most noticeable under the nails looks like an od probably exotica and jumper very good any time you want to switch to my side of the slab just let me know i can promise we have a lot more fun around here yeah words out on you party animals the reports of the saint patricks day celebration in the ice room were his eyes laughed behind his goggles accurate sorry i missed it wheres my guy i need his tox report mmmhmm morse poked at a kidney before removing it his hands were quick and skilled and seemed to keep time to the beat of the rebel rock music playing over the speakers i assumed youd be in a hurry i gave your guy to young finestein he just started here last month has potential you gave mine to some rookie we were all rookies once dallas speaking of which wheres the stalwart peabody shes outside doing some runs listen morse this is a tricky one so they say all the time every time im betting on homicide but it was set up to look like selftermination i need good hands and eyes on my guy i dont take on anyone without them relax dallas stress can kill you unruffled he strolled over to a link put out a call for herbert finestein hell be right along rochinsky run this young ladys internals to the lab start the blood work morse ive got two bodies and the probability is that theyre linked yes yes but thats your area he wandered to a detox bowl washed the soiled sealant from his hands ran them under the radiant heat in the drying hood ill look over the boys work dallas but give him a chance yeah yeah fine morse pulled off his goggles and mask smiled his black hair was intricately braided to hang down to the middle of his back he disposed of his protective suit to reveal the stunning pink of his shirt and electric blue of his trousers nice threads eve said dryly going to another party im telling you every days a party around here she imagined he habitually chose snazzy clothes to distance himself from the starkness of his job the brutality of it whatever works eve thought wading through blood and gore and the misery human beings inflicted on each other on a daily basis wore on you without an escape valve youd explode and what was hers and hows roarke morse asked good fine roarke yes he was hers before him there had just been work only been work and would she have one day reached the limit felt her own soul shatter hell of a thought ah heres finestein be nice morse murmured to eve what am i an asskicker morse said pleasantly and laid a friendly hand on her shoulder herbert lieutenant dallas would like an update on the dos i assigned to you this afternoon yes the dead onscene quim linus white male fiftysix years cause of death strangulation by hanging finestein a skinny mixed race with black skin and pale eyes spoke in quick piping tones and fiddled nervously with a small forest of pencils tucked in a breast pocket protector not only a rookie eve thought with frustration a nerd rookie did you want to review the body im standing here arent i eve began then relented with a quick gnashing of teeth when morses long fingers squeezed her shoulder yes thank you id like to review the body and your report please just this way eve rolled her eyes at morse as finestein hurried across the room hes fucking twelve years old hes twentysix patience dallas i hate patience slows everything down but she walked over to the floortoceiling line of drawers waited while finestein uncoded one pulled it open with a frigid puff of cold gas as you can see finestein cleared his throat there are no marks of violence on the body other than those caused by the strangulation no offensive or defensive wounds there were microscopic fibers of the rope found under the subjects nails indicating he secured the rope personally by all appearances the subject willingly hanged himself youre handing me selftermination eve demanded just like that wheres the tox report the blood work im im getting to that lieutenant there were traces of ageloxite and give her the street names herbert morse said mildly shes a cop not a scientist oh yes sir sorry traces of um easeup were found in the victims system along with a small amount of home brew this mix is quite commonly ingested by selfterminators to calm any nerves this guy didnt pull his own plug damn it yes sir i agree finesteins quiet agreement cut off eves tirade before it could begin you agree yes the victim also ingested a large pretzel with considerable mustard less than an hour before death prior to this he enjoyed a breakfast of wheat wafers powdered eggs and the equivalent of three cups of coffee so if the subject knew enough to mix a cocktail of easeup and alcohol before termination he would have known that coffee can potentially counteract and cause anxiety this and the fact that the alcohol consumed was in very small proportion to the drug casts some doubt on selftermination so youre ruling homicide im ruling suspicious death undetermined he swallowed as eves eyes bored into him until more evidence weighs in on either side i feel its impossible to make the call just so well done herbert morse nodded the lieutenant will feed you details as she finds them finestein looked relieved and lie fled you give me nothing eve complained on the contrary herberts given you a window most mes would have slammed it shut ruling st instead hes cautious exacting and thorough and he considers the attitude of the victim rather than only the cold facts medically undetermined was the best you were going to get o o undetermined eve muttered as she slid behind the wheel well it gives us a window peabody glanced up from her palm unit caught the coldly narrowed stare eve aimed at her what what did i say next person says that im throwing them out the goddamn window she started the car peabody am i an asskicker are you asking to see my scars or is that a trick question shut up peabody eve suggested and headed back to central quim had a hundred on tonights arena ball game peabodys smile was thin and selfsatisfied mcnab just relayed the data a hundreds his top bet odd hed place a bet a few hours before offing himself then not even wait around to see if he won ive got the name and address of his bookie here oh but im supposed to shut up sorry sir you want more scars i really dont now that i have a sex life theyre embarrassing maylou jorgensen shes got a hole in the west village o o peabody loved the west village she loved the way it ran from bohemian chic to pinstriped drones who wanted to be bohemian chic she liked to watch the street traffic stroll by in ankle dusters or buttonedup jumpsuits the shaved heads the wild tangles of multicolored curls she liked watching the sidewalk artists pretend they were too cool to worry about selling their work even the street thieves had a veneer of polish the glidecart operators sold veggie kabobs plucked fresh from the fields of greenpeace park she thought longingly of dinner eve pulled up in front of a tidy rehabbed warehouse doubleparked and turned on her on duty sign one of these days id like to live in one of these lofts all that space and a view of the street peabody scanned the area as she climbed from the car look theres a nice clean deli on the corner there and a market on the other you look for living quarters due to the proximity of food its a consideration eve flashed her badge at a security screen in working order then entered the building the tiny foyer boasted an elevator and four mail slots all freshly scrubbed four units in a building this size peabody heaved a sigh imagine im imagining a bookie shouldnt be able to afford a place in here on a hunch eve bypassed the buzzer for a and used her shield to gain access to stairs well go up this way surprise maylou the building was utterly silent telling her the soundproofing was firstrate she thought of quims miserable flop a few telling blocks away bookies apparently did a lot better than the majority of their clients never bet against the house morse had said truer words she pressed the buzzer on a waited moments later the door swung open in front of an enormous redhead and a small white yapping dog about time you the woman blinked hard gold eyes narrowed them in a wild and striking face the tone and texture of alabaster i thought you were the dog walker hes late if youre selling im not buying maylou jorgensen so what nypsd eve held up her badge then found her arms full of barking fur well hell eve tossed the yelping dog at peabody then charged into the loft leaping she tackled the redhead as the woman scrambled for a wide console studded with controls and facing a wall of busy screens they went down like felled trees before eve could catch her breath she was flipped to her back pinned under a hundred eightyfive pounds of panicked female she took a knee to the groin spit in the eye and only through lightning reflexes managed to avoid the rake of inchlong blue nails down her face instead they dug rivers in the side of her neck the smell of her own blood irritated her she bucked once swore then swung up elbow in the lead it slammed satisfactorily into maylous white face her nose erupted with blood she said quite clearly eek her gold eyes rolled up white and her considerable weight flopped lifelessly on eve get her off of me for christs sake theres a ton of her and all of its smothering me give me a hand dallas shes like a slab of granite must be sixthree push sweating liberally sprayed with blood eve shoved peabody pulled eventually maylou was rolled onto her back and eve came up gasping for air it was like being buried under a mountain jesus shut that dog up i cant hes terrified peabody glanced over with some sympathy as the little dog backed his white butt into a corner and sent out high earpiercing barks stun it oh dallas peabodys tone was a whisper of utter horror never mind eve looked down at the blood spray on her shirt and jacket gingerly lifted a hand to her raw neck is much of this mine she made some mag grooves peabody announced after a quick exam ill get the first aid kit later eve crouched down frowned at the unconscious woman lets roll her over and get the restraints on her before she wakes up it took some time brought on more sweat but they managed to secure her wrists behind her back eve straightened studied the console shes got something going on here thought we were a bust lets see what i remember about vice and bunko do you want me to call for a warrant heres my warrant eve rubbed her fingers over her throbbing neck as she sat at the console lots of numbers lots of games so what names accounts bets wagered money owed looks clean enough on the surface she glanced back is she coming around yet dead out sir you knocked her cold go find something to stuff in that dogs mouth before i use my foot hes just a little dog peabody murmured and went to search out the kitchen too many numbers eve said to herself the pools too damn deep for a nice little betting parlor loansharking yeah i bet we got some loansharking here and where you got sharks youve got spine crackers what else what else she turned saw peabody cooing to the dog and holding out a biscuit of some kind eve slipped out her pocketlink and called the one person she knew who could cut through the ocean of numbers and ride the right wave i need roarke a minute she hissed it to his assistant when she came onscreen just one quick minute of course lieutenant hold please theres a sweet little dog theres a nice little doggie arent you pretty instead of razzing peabody over the baby talk eve left her at it lieutenant roarkes face filled the screen what can i instantly his easy smile vanished and his eyes were bright and hard what happened how badly are you hurt not much mostly its somebody elses blood look im in a private betting parlor and somethings off ive got some ideas but take a quick look give me your take all right if your next stop is a health center i havent got time for a health center then i havent time for a consult goddamn it she was tempted just to cut transmission but took a steadying breath instead peabodys going to get the first aid kit i got a couple of scratches thats all i swear turn your head to the left she rolled her eyes but complied get them seen to he snapped it out then shrugged as if in acceptance let me see what youre looking at lots of numbers different games she began as she turned her unit so that hed have her view arena ball baseball the horses the droid rats i think the third screen from the right is overdue loans on bets interest compounded well above legal limits the screen directly below is outlay for loan collection on the screen beside that you have what looks like private games casino style look on your console see if you find a control thats linked to that screen if its simple itll be something like c for the placement of the screen in the grid yeah here give it a flip ah he said as the screen switched to monitor and played a busy casino full of smoke and tables and glassyeyed patrons what kind of building are you in loft west village two levels four units i wouldnt be surprised if the other level isnt very busy at this moment this area isnt zoned for gambling well then he grinned at her shame on them thanks for the tip my pleasure lieutenant see to that injury darling eve or ill be seeing to it myself first chance i wont be happy with you he cut her off before she could make some snippy remark which she figured was just as well she turned and caught peabody the little white dog nestled in her arms watching her with speculation he knows a lot about illegal gambling runs he knows a lot about legal ones too he gave us a lever with maylou here do you care how or why no peabody rubbed her cheek on the dogs fur smiled its just interesting you going to bust the operation thats going to depend on maylou here eve rose as the woman began to moan and stir she made bubbling sounds coughed then began to buck her enormous butt humping up her surprisingly small feet kicking eve simply crouched down assaulting an officer she began in an easy voice resisting arrest loansharking spine cracking running an illegal gambling facility hows that for starters maylou you broke my nose at least thats what eve assumed she said as the words were muffled and slurred yep looks like you have to call the mts its the law interesting you refreshing me on the law i think we can hold off on the broken nose a little while of course the broken arms going to need attention i dont have a broken arm yet eve bared her teeth now maylou if you want medical attention and want me to consider looking the other way as regards your enterprise downstairs tell me all there is to tell about linus quim youre not here to bust me thats up to you quim pennyante not a gambler he just plays at it like a hobby hes lousy at it costs him an average of a hundred k a year never bets more than a hundred bills straight and usually half that but hes regular jesus my face is killing me cant i have some gonumb when did you talk to him last last night he likes to do the ebetting deal rather than over the link transmits twice a week minimum last night he laid a hundred on the brawlers on tonights arena ball and thats rich for him said he was feeling lucky did he eve leaned closer did he say that exactly yeah he says put me down a hundred on the brawlers for tomorrow night im feeling lucky he even smiled sort of said he was going to double it and let it ride on the next night once he won in a good mood was he for quim he was doing a happy dance guys mostly a pain in the ass a whiner but he pays up and hes regular so i got no beef with him good thing now that wasnt so bad was it maylou youre not going to bust me i dont work vice or bunko youre not my problem she released the restraints hooked them in her back pocket if i were you id call the mts and tell them i walked into a wall tripped over your little dog squeakie maylou rolled over to her ample butt threw open her arms the dog leaped out of peabodys hold and into maylous lap did the nasty cop hurt mamas baby girl with a shake of her head eve headed out give it two weeks she told peabody then call hanson in vice and give him this address you said you werent going to bust her no i said she wasnt my problem shes going to be hansons peabody glanced back whats going to happen to the dog hey and the apartment maybe the bust will drive down the rent you should see the kitchen dallas its mag keep dreaming she got in the car then scowled when peabody popped the dash compartment what are you doing first aid kit stay away from me its either me or the health center i dont need a health center dont touch me stop being a baby enjoying the role of nurse peabody chose her tools asskickers arent afraid of a little first aid kit close your eyes if you dont want to see trapped eve gripped the wheel closed her eyes she felt the quick biting sting of the antiseptic before the numbing properties took hold the smell of it spun in her head rolled into her belly she heard the low hum of the suture wand she started to make some sarcastic comment to take her mind off the annoyance of the procedure then suddenly she was sucked back the dim and dingy health center ward the hundreds of stings as hundreds of cuts were treated the vile buzz of the machines as her broken arm was examined whats your name you have to give us your name tell us who hurt you whats your name what happened to you i dont know in her mind she screamed it again and again but she lay still she lay silent trapped in terror as strangers poked and prodded as they stared and they questioned whats your name i dont know sir dallas hey eve opened her eyes stared into peabodys wide ones what what is it youre really pale dallas you look a little sick maybe we should swing by a health center after all im all right her hands fisted hard until she felt herself steady again im okay just need some air she ordered the window down started the car and pushed the helpless young girl back into the darkest corner of her mind chapter ten needs must when the devil drives i cant remember who said that but i dont suppose its important whoever it was is long dead now as linus quint is dead now needs must my needs must but who was the devil in this coupling foolish greedy quim or myself perhaps thats not important either for its done there can be no going back no staging events to another outcome i can only hope events were staged convincingly enough to satisfy those sharp eyes of lieutenant dallas she is an exacting audience and i fear the most severe of critics yes with her in the house i fear my performance must be perfection in every way every line every gesture every nuance or her view will no doubt ruin me o o motive and opportunity eve thought as she walked to her own front door too many people had both richard draco would be memorialized the next day and she had no doubt there would be a lavish display of grief passionate and emotional eulogies copious tears and it would all be just another show hed helped seduce areena mansfield into drugs and put a smear on her rise to stardom hed stood in the spotlight michael proctor desperately wanted for his own hed humiliated and used carly landsdowne in a very public fashion hed been a splinter under the wellmanicured fingernail of kenneth stiles hed considered eliza rothchild too old and unattractive to bother with there had been others so many others it was impossible to count who had reason to wish richard draco ill but whoever had acted on it planned and executed the murder had enough cool enough will to have lured a greedy theater tech into a hangmans noose she wasnt looking for brutality or rage but for cold blood and a clear mind those qualities in a killer were much more difficult to root out she wasnt moving forward she thought with frustration every step she took simply pushed her further into the artifice of a world she found mildly annoying what kind of people spent their lives dressing up and playing makebelieve children it struck her as she closed her hand around the doorknob on some level wasnt she looking for a very clever very angry child she gave a half laugh great what she knew about children wouldnt fill the pinhole made by a laser drill she flung open the front door intending to throw herself into a blisteringly hot shower then back into work the music pierced her ears rattled her teeth she all but felt her eyes jiggle in her head it was a screech of sound punctuated by a blast of noise layered with braying waves of chaos it was mavis the irritable mood that had come through the door with eve didnt have a chance it exploded in the sheer volume and exuberance of mavis freestones unique musical style eve found herself grinning as she stepped up to the doorway of what roarke referred to as the parlor there in all the splendor the elegance the antiquity mavis danced eve supposed that was the closest word for it bouncing and jiggling atop graduated stacked heels that lifted her tiny frame a full six inches from the floor their swirling pink and green pattern matched the hair that flew in yardlong braids around her flushed delighted face and fairy body her slim legs were green with little pink butterflies fluttering up in a spiral pattern then disappearing under the tiny flippy skirt of fuschia that barely covered her crotch her torso was decorated in a crisscross of the two colors with one pretty breast in pink another in green eve could only be relieved that mavis had chosen to go with the green for both eyes you just never knew roarke sat in one of his lovely antique chairs a glass of strawcolored wine in one hand he was either relaxing into the show eve thought or hed lapsed into a protective coma the music such as it was crescendoed led by a long plaintive wail from the singer blessed silence fell like a cargo ship of bricks what do you think mavis tossed back the mop of bicolored braids its a good followup number for the new video not too tame is it ah roarke took a moment to sip his wine thered been a moment when hed been mildly concerned that the decibel level would shatter the crystal no no indeed tame isnt the word that comes to mind mag she bounced over and her little butt wriggled with energy as she bent down to kiss him i wanted you to see it first since youre like the money man money always bows to talent if eve hadnt already loved him shed have fallen face first then and there seeing the absolute joy his words put in maviss eyes its so much fun the recordings the concerts the way iced costumes leonardo gets to design for me its hardly even like work if it werent for you and dallas id still be scraping gigs at joints like the blue squirrel she did a quick spin as she spoke spotted eve and beamed like sunshine hey ive got a new number i heard totally mag roarke said youd be late and you oh wow is that blood what where because her mind had switched channels eve whipped her gaze around the room before mavis leaped toward her its all over you maviss panicked hands patted eves breasts shoulders we should call a doctor a mediunit roarke make her lie down and there is my constant goal in life har har its not my blood mavis oh instantly maviss hands jumped back ick dont worry its dry i was going to shower and change at central but i weighed the potential of a piss stream of chilly water against a flood of hot and came home instead got another of those around she asked roarke with a nod toward his wine absolutely turn your head she made a sound of annoyance but tilted her head to show the treated scratches already healing mano mavis said with admiration in her voice somebody swiped you good musta had mag nails but bad aim she missed the eyes she took the wine roarke brought her thanks for the tip before she told him it panned out happy to oblige tilt your head up why i showed you the nail rakes up he repeated nudging it back himself with the tip of his finger then closing his mouth warm and firmly over hers as you can see i have excellent aim awwww you guys are so cute with her hands folded at breast level mavis beamed at them yeah were just like a couple of puppies amused eve sat on the arm of a sofa sipped at her wine its a great new number mavis all you you think i ran it for leonardo and now you two but nobody elses seen it its eve remembered whitneys comment got juice thats what i thought roarke can i tell her tell me what mavis bit her lip looked to roarke for agreement then at his nod drew two deep breaths okay my last disc cut curl your hair roarke got early word that its hitting in the top five of next weeks vidtracks dallas im fucking number three right behind the buttbusters and indigo she might not have had a clue who buttbusters or indigo might be but eve knew vidtracks was maviss bible thats fabulous eve rose quickly gave mavis a hard hug you kick ass thanks mavis sniffed wiped a tear off silvertipped lashes youre the first person ive told i started to call leonardo but i want to tell him upface you know and im glad i got to tell you first anyhow hell understand hell go nuts yeah weve got some serious celebrating to do im really glad you werent late after all so i could tell you and so you didnt miss the girl deal instantly warning flags sprang up in eves gut fluttered nervously girl deal yeah you know trinas already down in the pool house setting up figured we could use a swim and a spin in the relaxation tank were up for the full treatment full treatment no was all eve could think not the full treatment anything but that look mavis i just came home to work ive got this case youve always got a case undeterred mavis poured herself a glass of wine then brought the bottle to top eves off as roarke lazily lighted a cigarette and smiled youve got to take time for you or your internal organs get all shriveled and your skin goes saggy i read all about it anyway trinas got some outrageous new body paint no absolutely i dont do body paint mavis rolled her eyes for me dallas we know you but i think you should give it a try one of these days i bet roarke would really go for the golddust it does amazing things for the boobs makes them sparkle i dont want sparkling boobs its flavored too frangipani really roarke blew out a stream of smoke im very fond of tropical flavors see anyway you can think about that after youre all relaxed and your hairs gooped up summerset made snacks goodie but really i oops theres the door ill get it she escaped forcing herself not to simply break into a run bowl over whoever was at the door and just keep running until she reached the sanctuary of cop central she beat summerset there by half a step im getting it greeting and escorting guests falls into my job requirements he reminded her miss furst is here to see you so saying he bumped eve aside and opened the door i should have called nadine knew just how eve felt about reporters in her home im not here for she continued quickly its personal good fine come in to nadines surprise eve clamped a hand on hers and all but dragged her toward the parlor ive taken a couple of days off nadine began i noticed i didnt much care for your onair substitute hes a putz but anyway i wanted to come by and tell you she paused pulled herself back oh hi mavis nadine hi hey its practically a party however flighty mavis seemed on the surface she had a solid core of sense with compassion and loyalty wrapped tightly around it it took less than two seconds for her to see the strain in nadines eyes listen im just going to run down and see how trinas doing back in a flash she went out in one dashing through the door in a blur of color sit down nadine roarke was already up leading her to a chair would you like some wine i would thanks i would but id really like one of those cigarettes i thought you were quitting eve said as roarke offered one i am nadine sent roarke a look of gratitude as he flicked on his lighter i quit regularly listen im sorry to bust in on you both this way friends are always welcome he poured the wine gave it to her i assume you want to talk to eve ill leave you alone no dont feel you have to go nadine took another long drag of the pricey tobacco jesus i forget you have the real thing a bigger kick than herbals no dont go she said again dallas tells you everything anyway roarkes face showed surprise does she no eve said definitely but lowered to the arm of a chair i did tell him about your problem because of his connection to draco and his connection to you its all right nadine managed a weak smile mortification builds character you have nothing to be embarrassed about life would be awfully dull if we could look back without regretting at least one affair her smile relaxed you plucked a winner here dallas nothing like a man who says the right thing at the right time well richard draco is my regret dallas she shifted her gaze to eves i know you dont have to tell me couldnt obviously during the interview earlier maybe you cant tell me at all but i have to ask am i in trouble what did your lawyer say not to worry and not to talk to you without him present she smiled grimly im having a hard time following his advice i cant scratch you off the list nadine but she added as nadine closed her eyes and nodded since youre coming in dead last id give taking the first part of your lawyers advice another try nadine huffed out a breath sipped her wine first time ive ever been happy to be a loser miras opinion weighs heavily and she doesnt believe youre capable of calculated murder neither does the primary on a personal level or considering the current evidence on a professional one thank you thanks nadine lifted a hand to her head pressed her fingers to the center of her brow i keep telling myself this is going to go away soon that youll wrap it up but the stress is like a spike through my brain im going to have to give you just a little more were you aware draco had a video of you video nadine dropped her hand frowned you mean of my work well some people consider sex work nadine stared eyes blank with confusion then they cleared and eve saw exactly what she wanted to see shock fury embarrassment he had a video of he took he had a camera when we she slammed down the wine surged to her feet that slimy son of a bitch that perverted bastard id say the answers no roarke murmured and nadine whirled on him what kind of man takes videos of a woman in his bed when she doesnt consent what kind of sick thrill does he get from raping her that way because thats just what it is she jabbed a finger in his chest for no other reason than he was a man would you do that to dallas shed kick your butt from here to tarus iii if you did thats just what id like to do to draco no no id like to take his puny dick in my hands and twist it until it popped right off under the circumstances id prefer not to be his standin she hissed out a breath sucked one in then held up her hands palms out sorry its not your fault to find control again she paced then turned to face eve i guess that little display of temper moved me up the list a few notches just the opposite if youd known about the disc youd have attempted a quick castration you wouldnt have let someone else stick him you just verified your own profile well good for me yippee nadine dropped into the chair again i guess the discs in evidence has to be no ones going to view it for thrills nadine if it helps you dont show up that much he angled things so hes in the spotlight so to speak yes he would dallas if the media gets hold of that they wont if you want my advice go back to work keep your mind busy and let me do my job im good at it if i didnt know that id be on tranqs inspiration struck how about a girl night instead huh mavis and trina are all set i dont have time for it and theres no point in trina dragging her whole bag of tricks over here and not putting it to full use take my place go have the works i could use some relaxation therapy there you go eve hauled her out of the chair youll feel like a new woman in no time go for the body paint she suggested as she pulled nadine out of the room itll give you a fresh outlook and sparkling boobs moments later eve came back into the parlor dusting her hands well done lieutenant yeah that was pretty slick theyre all down there cooing like what coos doves he suggested yeah like doves now everybodys happy and i can go back to work so you up for a video nadines can we have popcorn men are perverts no not nadines funny guy but the popcorns a good idea o o shed intended to set up in her office to keep it official she should have known better she ended up in one of the secondlevel lounging rooms snuggled into the sinfully soft cushions of the milelong sofa watching the taped play on a huge wall screen and with a bowl of popcorn in her lap the size of the screen had been roarkes selling point it was impossible to miss even the smallest detail when every feature was larger than life it was she realized almost like being onstage herself she had to give roarke points for that one eliza she noted had embraced her role of the fussy irritating nurse assigned to monitor sir wilfred her period costume was anything but flattering her hair was scraped back her mouth a constant purse she affected an annoyingly lilting voice like the ones eve had heard some parents use on recalcitrant offspring kenneth hadnt stinted on his portrayal of the pompous cranky barrister his movements were jerky restless his eyes sly his voice would by turns boom loud enough to shake the rafters then drop into a crafty murmur but it was draco who owned the play during the first scenes he was undeniably handsome outrageously charming carelessly amused yes she could see how a vulnerable woman would fall for him as vole or as himself freeze screen she pushed the bowl at roarke and rose to move closer to the image of draco heres what i see the others are acting theyre good theyre skilled theyre enjoying the roles he is the role he doesnt have to act hes an egocentric as arrogant and as smooth as vole its a part tailored for him so i thought when i put his name forward for the play what does that tell you that whoever planned his murder probably thought the same thing and saw the irony of it vole dies in the last act draco dies in the last act a dramatic bit of justice executed before witnesses she walked back to sit it doesnt tell me anything new really but it solidifies the angles resume play she waited watched areenas entrance she saw now was brilliant in its timing that was the writer of course the director but the style of it had to come from the actor beautiful classy mysterious and coolly sexy that was the role but that wasnt the true character eve remembered the real christine vole revealed herself to be a woman consumed by love one who would lie for the man she knew to be a murderer who would sacrifice her dignity her reputation to save him from the law and who in the end executed him for dismissing that love its acting on two levels eve murmured just as draco is neither of them show the face of their character until the last scene theyre both very skilled no theyre all skilled all used to manipulating words and actions to present an image i havent chipped through the image yet sir wilfred believes hes defending an innocent man and in the end learns he was duped thats enough to piss you off if were correlating life and makebelieve its enough to kill for hed thought the same himself and nodded go on the character of diana believed every bullshit line vole fed her that his wife was a cold bitch that he was innocent that he was going to leave her the other woman roarke put in the younger one a little naive a little grasping in the end wont she figure out she was duped and used and be mortified just as carly learned she was duped and used and mortified as christine learned and theres michael proctor standing in the wings hungry to take it all on she studied the faces listened to the voices measured the connections its one of them one of the players i know it its not some tech with a grudge or with dreams of being in the lights its someone whos been in the lights and knows how to wear the right face at the right time she fell silent again watching the play progress searching for some chink some instant when a glance a gesture indicated the feelings and plans beneath the facade but no they were good she mused every one of them thats the dummy knife first courtroom scene freeze screen enhance sector pq twentyfive percent the screen shifted smoothly with the evidence table enlarging the knife on it was in clear view from this angle and enlarged eve could see the subtle differences between it and the murder weapon the blades nearly the same size and shape but the handles a bit wider thicker its the same color but its not the same material she let out a breath but you wouldnt notice it unless you were looking for it you expect to see the prop so you see it draco could have looked right at it hell he might have picked it up himself and he wouldnt have noticed resume normal play her head was beginning to throb lightly she barely noticed when roarke began to rub her shoulders she watched the change of scenes the curtain drop the soundless circling of one set for another a few techs slipped across behind the curtain nearly indistinguishable in their traditional black but she spotted quim he was clearly in charge now in his element he gestured a kind of theater sign language that meant little to her she saw him consult briefly with the prop master nod then glance downstage left there eve leaped to her feet again he sees something something that doesnt fit hes hesitating yeah just for a second studying and now hes moving off in the same direction what did you see who did you see damn it she turned back to roarke that was the switch the real knifes on the courtroom set now waiting she ordered the disc to reverse then set her wrist unit to time and replayed okay now he spots it behind her roarke rose moved to the autochef and ordered her coffee when he stepped beside her she took the cup without realizing it drank onscreen extras moved out to their marks the bartender took his position techs vanished areena dressed in the cheap and gaudy costume that suited a midtwentiethcentury barfly took her seat on a stool at the end of a bar she angled herself away from the audience a train whistle blew curtain up two minutes twelve seconds time enough to stash the knife right in the roses or somewhere no one would notice until it could be moved but its close very close and very ballsy sex and ambition roarke murmured what sex and ambition thats what killed leonard vole and thats what killed richard draco life imitates art o o peabody wouldnt have said so at least not if she used the animated painting she was currently trying to study and pretend she understood she sipped the champagne charles had given her and struggled to look as sophisticated as the rest of the guests at the art show she was dressed for it at least she thought with some relief eves christmas present to her had been her gorgeous undercover wardrobe designed by maviss wonderful lover leonardo but the shimmering sweep of blue silk couldnt transform the midwestern sensibility she couldnt make head nor tail of the creeping movement of shape and color well its really something since that was the best she could come up with she drank more champagne charles chuckled and gave her shoulder an affectionate rub youre a sweetheart for putting up with me delia you must be bored to death no im not she glanced up at his marvelous face smiled im just artstupid theres nothing stupid about you he bent down gave her a light kiss she wanted to sigh it was still next to impossible to believe she could be in a place like this dressed like this with a gorgeous man on her arm and it galled galled to think that she was much more suited to takeout chinese in mcnabs pitiful apartment well she was just going to keep going to art shows operas and ballets until some of it rubbed off on her even if it all made her feel as if she was acting in some classy play and didnt quite have her lines down ready for supper im always ready for supper that line she realized came straight from the heart or the gut hed reserved an intimate private room at some swank restaurant with candlelight and flowers he was always doing something like that peabody mused as he pulled out her chair at a pretty table with pink roses and white candles she let him order for both of them because hed know just the right thing he seemed to know all the right things and all the right people she wondered if eve ever felt so clunky and out of place when she found herself with roarke in posh surroundings she couldnt imagine her lieutenant ever feeling clunky besides roarke loved her no the man adored her everything had to be different when you were sitting across candlelight with a man who thought you were the most vital woman in the world the only woman in the world where have you gone charles asked quietly she jerked herself back sorry i guess theres a lot on my mind she picked up her fork to sample the saucy seafood appetizer the perfection of it on the tongue nearly had her eyes crossing in ecstasy your work he reached across the table to pat her hand im glad you were able to take a break from it after all and come out tonight we didnt work as late as i thought we would the draco matter do you want to talk about it it was just one more perfect thing about him he would ask and listen if she chose to unburden herself no not really cant anyway at this stage except to say dallas is frustrated so many levels and angles make it slow going im sure it does still she seemed her usual competent self when she spoke to me peabodys hand froze as she reached for her wineglass she spoke to you about the case caught off guard charles set his fork down she didnt mention it to you no did you know draco charles cursed himself briefly considered dancing around the truth then shrugged hed never been anything but honest with peabody and didnt want that to change no not really i happened to be with areena mansfield the other night when dallas and roarke dropped by to speak with her i was working oh charless profession didnt bother peabody he did what he did just as she did what she did maybe if theyd been lovers shed have a different attitude but they werent damn it oh she said again because his profession did a lot more than bother her lieutenant shit put simply yeah it was awkward but dallas and i came to terms what kind of terms we talked delia ive tried not to say too much because it puts you in the middle i never wanted that you never put me there she said immediately dallas did because you matter very much to her my personal life is a concern to her as a friend delia the quiet censure in his tone made her wince then give up okay i know it i dont have to like it i think things should be smoother now she had her say i had mine and we both felt better for it and when i explained to her that we werent having sex she what the word squeaked out as peabody jumped to her feet sparkling silver glittering crystal danced on the white linen cloth you told her that that good god why dont you just strip me naked and push me into the squad room i wanted her to know we had a friendship not a professional agreement im sorry recognizing his misstep too late charles rose lifted his hands i didnt mean to embarrass you you tell my immediate superior that ive been seeing a professional for what nearly three months and havent done the mattress dance no no jeez what could be embarrassing about that i didnt realize youd wanted sex to be part of our relationship he spoke stiffly now if you had you had only to ask oh yeah right i say how about it charles and im a client the muscles in his belly went taunt as wire is that what you think i dont know what to think she dropped into her chair again briefly held her head in her hand why did you have to tell her that i suppose i was defending myself it was a tough admission to swallow i didnt think beyond it im very sorry he moved his chair over so that he could sit close and take her hand delia i didnt want to spoil our friendship and for the first stages of it i was hung up on someone who couldnt who wouldnt be with me because of what i am you helped me through that i care very much about you if you want more he lifted her hand brushed his lips over the inside of her wrist her pulse gave a little dance it was only natural she supposed just as it was natural for her blood to go warm very warm when he shifted that skilled mouth from her wrist to her lips but doubts churned inside of her side by side with simple lust it was infuriating to realize not all the doubts were directed at charles sorry she broke the kiss eased back and wondered when shed lost her mind there was a gorgeous man she liked very much and who knew all there was to know about sexual pleasures ready to show her just what could be done to the human body and she was playing coy ive hurt your feelings no well maybe a little she drummed up a smile fact is this is a first for me ive completely lost my appetite all across the board chapter eleven working out of her home office could be an advantage the equipment even counting her new computer system at central was far superior there were fewer distractions and it was next to impossible to run out of coffee eve chose to do so from time to time even if only to have a fresh view to clear her mind her plan today was to start the morning with something fulfilling she stood in the center of her home office smirking down at her old despised computer today she told it death comes to all your circuits will it be slow and systematic or fast and brutal considering she circled it tough decision ive waited so long for this moment dreamed of it showing her teeth she began to roll up her sleeves what roarke asked from the doorway that connected their work areas is that the former bane of my existence the antichrist of technology do we have a hammer studying the pile on the floor he walked in several i imagine of various types i want all of them tiny little hammers big wallbangers and everything in between might one ask why im going to beat this thing apart byte by byte until theres nothing left but dust from the last trembling chip hmmm roarke crouched down examined the pitifully outofdate system when did you haul this mess in here just now i had it in the car maybe i should use acid just stand here and watch it hiss and dissolve that could be good saying nothing roarke took a small case out of his pocket opened it and chose a slim tool with a few deft moves he had the housing open hey hey whatre you doing i havent seen anything like this in a decade fascinating look at this corrosion christ this is a soc chip system and its crosswired when he began to fiddle she rushed over and slapped at his hands mine i get to kill it get a grip on yourself he said absently and delved deeper into the guts ill take this into research no uhuh i have to bust it apart what if it breeds he grinned and quickly replaced the housing this is an excellent learning tool id like to give it to jamie whatre you talking about jamie lingstrom the eprodigy mmm he does a little work for me now and then hes a kid a very bright one bright enough that i prefer having him on my team rather than competing with him itll be interesting to see what he can do with an old defective system like this but i want it dead he had to smother a chuckle it was as close to a whine as hed ever heard from her there there darling ill find you something else to beat up or better he said wrapping his arms around her another outlet entirely for all that delightful natural aggression sex wouldnt give me the same rush ah a dare he accepted it by leaning down and biting her jaw when she swore at him he took her mouth in a hot hungry brainsucking kiss okay that was pretty good but just what are you doing with your hands back there hardly anything until i lock the door and then okay okay you can have the damn thing she shoved away from him tried to catch her breath her system was vibrating just get it out of my sight thank you he caught her hand lifted it nibbled on her fingers as he watched her one taste of her always made him crave another and another he tugged her forward intending to nudge her into his office peabody walked in sorry she averted her eyes tilting her head to study the ceiling summerset said i should come right up good morning peabody roarke gave his wifes furrowed brow a quick brush of his lips can we get you some coffee ill get it dont mind me just a lowly aide she muttered it as she crossed the room giving eve a wide berth as she aimed for the kitchen shes upset about something roarke frowned toward the kitchen area as he listened to peabody muttering as she programmed the autochef she just hasnt had her morning fix yet take that heap of junk out of here if you want it so much i have to get to work he hefted the system discovered he had to put his back into it they made them a lot heavier back then ill be working from home until noon he called over his shoulder then his door closed behind him it was probably shallow it was definitely girlie to have gotten such a rise out of watching that ripple of muscle eve told herself she wouldnt have noticed if he hadnt stirred her up in the first place peabody bring me a cup of that she went behind her desk called up the draco file and separating it into suspects witnesses evidence gathered and lab reports ordered all data on the screens i reviewed the disc of the play last night she began when she heard the sturdy clop of peabodys hardsoled cop shoes cross the room i have a theory your coffee lieutenant shall i record sir huh eve was studying the screens trying to shift and rearrange data in her mind but peabodys stiff tone distracted her no im just running it by you she turned back and saw that once again roarke was right something was up with her aide she ordered herself not to poke into the personal and sat weve pretty well nailed down the time of the switch the prop knife is clearly visible here computer visual evidence b on screen five youve marked and recorded this ve peabody asked her voice cold as february last night after my review eve moved her shoulders the snipe was like a hot itch between her shoulder blades so just updating my own records lieutenant it is my job fuck it nobodys telling you not to do your job im briefing you arent i selectively it appears okay what the hell does that mean i had occasion to return to central last night that just added to her slow burn in the process of reviewing the file assimilating evidence and the time line certain pieces of that evidence marked and sealed for level five came to my attention i was unaware until that point that there were areas of this investigation considered off limits to your aide and your team respectfully sir this policy can and will hamper the efficiency of said aide and said team dont use that snotty tone on me pal i marked level five what in my judgment required level five you dont need to know every goddamn thing little spots of heat bloomed on peabodys cheeks but her voice was frosty so i am now aware lieutenant i said knock it off its always your way isnt it yeah damn right im your superior and im the primary on this investigation so you bet your tight ass its my way then you should have advised subject monroe charles to keep his mouth shut shouldnt you sir eve set her teeth ground them try to spare feelings she thought and you get kicked in the face subject monroe charles has in my opinion no connection to this investigation therefore any communication ive had with him is none of your goddamn business its my goddamn business when you interrogate him over my goddamn personal relationship with him i didnt interrogate him her voice spiked with frustrated fury he spilled it all over me they were both standing now leaning over the desk nearly nosetonose eves face was pale with temper peabodys flushed with it when mcnab walked in the scene had him letting out a low nervous whistle um hey guys neither of them bothered to so much as glance in his direction and said in unison at a roar out you bet im gone to insure it eve marched over and slammed the door in his fearful and fascinated face sit down she ordered peabody i prefer to stand and i prefer to give you a good boot in the ass but im restraining myself eve reached up fisted her hands in her own hair and yanked until the pain cleared most of the rage okay stand you couldnt sit with that stick up your butt anyway one you shove up it every time subject monroe charles is mentioned you want to be filled in you want to be briefed fine here it is she had to take another deep breath to insure her tone was professional on the evening of march twentysix at or about nineteenthirty i accompanied by roarke had occasion to visit areena mansfields penthouse suite at the palace hotel this city upon entering said premises investigation officer found subject mansfield in the company of one charles monroe licensed companion it was ascertained and confirmed that lc monroe was there in a professional capacity and had no links to the deceased or the current investigation his presence and the salient details pertaining to it were noted in the report of the interview and marked level five in a stupid illconceived attempt by the investigating officer to spare her fatheaded aide any unnecessary embarrassment eve stomped back to her desk snatched up her coffee gulped some down record that she snapped peabodys lip trembled she sat she sniffled oh no in genuine panic eve stabbed out a finger no you dont no crying were on duty there is no crying on duty im sorry knowing she was close to blubbering peabody fumbled for her handkerchief and blew her nose lavishly im just so mad so embarrassed he told you weve never had sex jesus peabody do you think i put that in the report no i dont know no she sniffled again but you know ive been seeing him for weeks and weeks and weve never we never even got close to it well he explained that when at peabodys howl of horror eve winced wrong thing to say very wrong but what the hell was the right thing look hes a nice guy i didnt give him enough credit he likes you then why hasnt he ever jumped me peabody lifted drenched eyes um sex isnt everything eve hazarded oh sure easy for you to say youre married to the mongo sex god of the century jesus peabody you are hes gorgeous hes built hes smart and sexy and and dangerous and he loves you no he adores you hed jump in front of a speeding maxibus for you they dont go very fast eve murmured and was relieved when peabody gave a watery laugh you know what i mean yeah eve glanced toward the connecting doors felt a hard almost painful tug yeah i know its ah its not that charles isnt attracted to you its that where the hell was mira when she needed her that he respects you thats it peabody crumpled her handkerchief and moped ive had too much respect if you ask me i know im not beautiful or anything you look good im not really sexy sure you are at her wits end eve came around the desk patted peabodys head if you were a guy or into samesex relationships would you want to have sex with me absolutely id jump you in a heartbeat really brightening at the idea peabody wiped her eyes well mcnab cant keep his hands off me oh man peabody please i dont want him to know i dont want mcnab to know that charles and i havent been hitting the sheets hell never hear it from me i can guarantee it okay sorry dallas after charles told me and i went back to work to take my mind off it and found those sealed files it kept me up most of the night i mean if he didnt say anything relevant i couldnt figure out why you had two reports and a video disc sealed eve blew out a breath interpersonal relationships were tough she thought and tricky one of the reports and the disc dont involve charles damn it peabody was right about one thing covering them up hampered the investigation they involve nadine oh i thought something was up there look she had a thing with draco years ago she came to me about it he used her dumped her in his usual pattern when roarke and i went through his penthouse we found those personal discs the one i sealed oh he recorded sex with nadine scum peabody sighed shes not a suspect at least not one were looking at so you wanted to spare her the embarrassment dallas im sorry all around sorry okay lets forget it go wash your face or something so mcnab doesnt think ive been slapping you around right boy i feel like an idiot good that bucks me right up now go pull yourself together so i can pry mcnab out of whatever corner hes hiding in and we can get to work yes sir o o by the time they were assembled in her office feeney had arrived hed reviewed the video of the play himself had enlarged refocused enhanced and worked his emagic so that the team was able to confirm the time frame of the switch the two courtroom scenes were side by side on a split screen with feeney in front showing the minute difference in the shape of the knife its angle of placement from one to the other whoever did the switch copped a knife that so closely resembled the dummy nobody would have noticed it without picking it up and giving it a good looking over the prop master mcnab asked hed have no reason to do more than check to see that the knife was still on its mark the courtroom set stayed what do you call it dressed throughout the performance hed have noticed if the knife was missing feeney added according to his statement he checked the set immediately after the scene change and immediately before it changed again he had no reason to check otherwise that gives the perpetrator approximately five minutes eve tapped her fingers on her mug however we narrow that if we follow the line that quim saw something or someone suspicious as it appears he did during the scene break under three minutes to get the dummy knife hidden and be back wherever he needed to be onstage or in the wings then the perp had to wait peabody narrowed her eyes wait and count on no one making the switch through the next courtroom scene through the dialogue and action wait out the play until christine vole grabs it up and uses it thats about thirty minutes a long time to wait our killers patient systematic i think he or she enjoyed the wait watching draco prance around emoting drawing applause all the while knowing it was his last act i think the killer reveled in it eve set down her coffee sat on the edge of her desk roarke said something last night life imitates art peabody scratched her nose i thought it was the opposite not this time why this play why this time there were easier less risky more subtle ways to off draco im thinking the play itself meant something to the killer the theme of love and betrayal of false faces sacrifice and revenge the characters of leonard and christine vole have a history maybe draco had a history with his killer something that goes back into the past that twisted their relationship feeney nodded munched on a handful of nuts a lot of the players and techs had worked with him before theaters like a little world and the people in it bump into each other over and over not a professional connection a personal one look vole comes off charming handsome even a little naive until you find out hes a heartless ruthless opportunist from what weve uncovered this mirrors draco so who did he betray whose life did he ruin from the interviews he fucked over everybody mcnab lifted his hands nobodys pretending they loved the guy so we go deeper we go back i want you to run the players look for the history something that pops out vole destroyed a marriage or relationship ruined someone financially seduced someones sister setback their career you look for the data she told mcnab and feeney peabody and i will chip away at the players o o eve decided to start with carly landsdowne something about the woman had set off alarms in her head since their first conversation the actress lived in a glossy building with full security glitzy shops and circling people glides the expansive lobby area was elegantly spare with watertoned tile floors modest indoor shrubbery and a discreet security panel worked into an arty geometric design in the wall good morning the panel announced in a pleasant male voice when eve approached please state your business in the broadway view my business is with carly landsdowne one moment please there was a quiet tinkle of music to fill the silence thank you for waiting according to our logs ms landsdowne has not informed us of any expected visitors ill be happy to contact her for you and ask if she is able to receive guests at this time please state your name and produce a photo id you want id heres some id eve shoved her badge up to the needlesized lens of the camera tell ms landsdowne lieutenant dallas doesnt like waiting in lobbies of course lieutenant one moment please the music picked up where it had left off and it had eve gritting her teeth i hate this shit why do they think recorded strings do anything but cause annoyance and an urgent desire to find the speakers and rip them out i think its kind of nice peabody said i like violins reminds me of my mother she plays peabody added when eve just stared at her thank you for waiting ms landsdowne will be happy to see you lieutenant dallas if you would proceed to elevator number two you have been cleared have a safe and happy day i hate when they say that eve strode to the proper elevator the doors opened and the same violin music seeped out it made her snarl welcome to the broadway view a voice oozed over the strings we are a fully selfcontained fully secured building

our shopping area can be reached through public or private access and welcomes all major debit cards the view also offers its patrons and with proper reservations the public three fivestar restaurants

press extension ninetyfour on any houselink and request an appointment with one of our friendly concierges for a tour of our three model units id rather have all the skin peeled from my bones eve decided i wonder if they have efficiencies please exit to the left and proceed to apartment number two thousand eight we at the view wish you a pleasant visit eve stepped out of the car and headed left the apartment doors were widely spaced down a generously sized hallway whoeverd designed the place hadnt worried about wasted space she decided then she had the uncomfortable feeling she was going to discover her husband owned the building carly opened the door before eve could buzz the actress wore a deep blue lounging robe her feet bare and tipped with ripe pink but her hair and face were done and done well eve noted good morning lieutenant carly leaned against the door for a moment a deliberately cocky pose how nice of you to drop by youre up early eve commented and here i thought theater people werent morning people carlys smirk wavered a bit but she firmed it again as she stepped back i have a performance today richards memorial service you consider that a performance of course i have to be sober and sad and spout all the platitudes its going to be a hell of an act for the media carly gestured toward an attractive curved sofa of soft green in the living area i could have put on the same act for you and quite convincingly but it seemed such a waste of your time and my talent can i offer you coffee no it doesnt worry you to be a suspect in a murder investigation no because i didnt do it and because its good research i may be called on to play one eventually eve wandered to the window wall privacy screened and lifted her brows at the killer view of times square the animated billboards were alive with color and promises the air traffic thick as fleas on a big sloppy dog if she looked over and down and it was the down that always bothered her she could see the gothic spires of roarkes new globe theater whats your motivation for murder carly sat obviously enjoying the morning duel it would of course depend on the victim but parallelling life lets call him a former lover who done me wrong the motivation would be a combination of pride scorn and glee and hurt eve turned back pinned her before carly could mask the shadow of distress perhaps you want to know if richard hurt me yes he did but i know how to bind my wounds lieutenant a man isnt worth bleeding over not for long did you love him i thought i did at the time but it was astonishingly easy to switch that emotion to hate if id wanted to kill him well i couldnt have done it better than it was done except i would never have sacrificed the satisfaction of delivering the killing blow personally using a proxy takes all the fun out of it is this a joke to you the end of a life by violent means do you want me to pretend to grieve believe me lieutenant i could call up huge choking and rather gorgeous tears for you though her mouth continued to smile little darts of angry lights played in her eyes but i wont i have too much respect for myself and as it happens for you to do something so pitifully obvious im not sorry hes dead i just didnt kill him and linus quim carlys defiant face softened i didnt know him very well but i am sorry he died you dont believe he killed richard then hanged himself or you wouldnt be here i suppose i dont either however convenient it would be he was a little sourfaced man and in my opinion didnt think of richard any more than he thought of the rest of us actors we were part of his scenery hanging it takes time doesnt it not like with richard yes it takes time i dont like suffering it was eve thought the first simple statement the woman had made i doubt whoever helped him into the noose thought about it are you worried ms landsdowne that tragedies come in threes carly started to make some careless remark then looking into eves eyes changed her mind yes yes i am theater people are a superstitious lot and im no exception i dont speak the name of the scottish play i dont whistle in a dressing room or wish another performer good luck but superstitious wont stop me from going back on that stage the moment were allowed to do so i wont let it change how i live my life ive wanted to be an actor for as long as i can remember not just an actor she added with a slow smile a star im on my way and i wont take a detour from the goal the publicity from dracos murder may just give you a boost toward that goal thats right if you think i wont exploit it you havent taken a good look at me ive taken a look at you a good look eve glanced around the lovely room toward the staggering view from the window for someone who hasnt yet achieved that goal you live very well i like living well carly shrugged im lucky to have generous and financially responsible parents i have a trust fund and i make use of it as i said i dont like suffering im not the starvingforart type it doesnt mean i dont work at my craft and work hard i simply enjoy comfortable surroundings did draco come here once or twice he preferred using his place in hindsight i see it gave him more control and were you aware he recorded your sexual activities it was a bombshell eve had her rhythm now and recognized simple and utter shock in the eyes in the sudden draining of color thats a lie draco had a recording unit installed in his bedroom he had a collection of personal discs detailing certain sexual partners theres one of you recorded in february it included the use of a certain apparatus fashioned of black leather and carly leaped off the sofa stop you enjoy this dont you no no i dont you were unaware of the recording yes i was unaware carly snapped back i might very well have agreed to one have been intrigued by the idea if hed suggested it but i detest knowing it was done without my consent that a bunch of snickering cops can view it and get their kicks im the only cop whos viewed it so far and i didnt get any kick out of it you werent the only woman he recorded ms landsdowne without her consent pardon me if i dont give a fuck she pressed her fingers to her eyes until she could find a thread of control all right what do i have to do to get it its in evidence and ive had it sealed it wont be used unless it has to be used when the case is closed and you prove to be cleared ill see that the disc is given to you i guess thats the best i can expect she took a long breath thank you ms landsdowne did you employ illegals in the company of richard draco for sexual stimulation or any reason i dont do illegals i prefer using my own mind my own imagination not chemicals you used them eve thought but maybe you didnt know what he was slipping into that pretty glass of champagne chapter twelve roarke had two holoconferences an interspace transmission and a headofdepartments meeting all scheduled for the afternoon and all dealing with his olympus resort project it was over a year in the works and he intended for it to be open for business by summer not all of the enormous planetwide pleasure resort would be complete but the main core with its luxury hotels and villas its plush gambling and entertainment complexes was good to go he had taken eve there on part of their honeymoon it had been her first offplanet trip he intended to take her back kicking and screaming no doubt as interplanetary travel was not on her list of favorite delights he wanted time away with her away from work his and hers not just one of the quick fortyeighthour jaunts he managed to push her into but real time intimate time as he pushed away from his inhome control center he rotated his shoulder it was nearly healed and didnt trouble him overmuch but now and again a faint twinge reminded him of how close both of them had come to dying only weeks before hed looked at death then into eves eyes theyd both faced bloody and violent ends before but there was more at stake now that moment of connection the sheer will in her eyes the grip of her hand on his had pulled him back they needed each other two lost souls he thought taking a moment to walk to the tall windows that looked out on part of the world hed built for himself out of will desire sweat and dubiously accumulated funds two lost souls whose miserable beginnings had forged them into what appeared to be polar opposites love had narrowed the distance then had all but eradicated it shed saved him the night his life had hung in her furious and unbreakable grip shed saved him he mused the first moment hed locked eyes with her as impossible as it should have been she was his answer he was hers he had a need to give her things the tangible things wealth could command though he knew the gifts most often puzzled and flustered her maybe because they did he corrected with a grin but underlying that overt giving was the fierce foundation to give her comfort security trust love all the things theyd both lived without most of their lives he wondered that a woman who was so skilled in observation in studying the human condition couldnt see that what he felt for her was often as baffling and as frightening to him as it was to her nothing had been the same for him since shed walked into his life wearing an ugly suit and cooleyed suspicion he thanked god for it feeling sentimental he realized he supposed it was the irish that popped out of him at unexpected moments more he kept replaying the nightmare shed suffered through a few nights before they came more rarely now but still they came torturing her sleep sucking her back into a past she couldnt quite remember he wanted to erase them from her mind eradicate them and knew he never would never could for months hed been tempted to do a full search and scan to dig out the data on that tragic child found broken and battered in a dallas alley he had the skill and he had the technology to find everything there was to find details the social workers the police the child authorities couldnt he could fill in the blanks for her and he admitted for himself but it wasnt the way he understood her well enough to know that if he took on the task gave her the answers to questions she wasnt ready to ask it would hurt more than heal wasnt it the same for him when hed returned to dublin after so many years hed needed to study some of the shattered pieces of his childhood alone even then hed only glanced at the surface of them what was left of them were buried at least for now he intended to leave them buried the now was what required his attention he reminded himself and brooding over the past there was the irish again solved nothing whether the past was his or eves it solved nothing he gathered up the discs and hard copies hed need for his afternoon meetings then hesitated he wanted another look at her before he left for the day but when he opened the connecting doors he saw only mcnab stuffing what appeared to be an entire burger in his mouth while the computer droned through a background search solo today ian mcnab jerked from a lounging to a sitting position swallowed too fast choked amused roarke strolled over and slapped him smartly on the back it helps to chew first yeah thanks ah i didnt have much breakfast so i thought itd be okay if i my autochef is your autochef the lieutenants in the field i take it yeah she hauled peabody out about an hour ago feeney headed into central to tie up some threads im working here he smiled then a quick flash of strong white teeth i got the best gig lucky you roarke managed to find a french fry on mcnabs plate that hadnt been drowned in ketchup he sampled it while he studied the screen running backgrounds again yeah well mcnab rolled his eyes shifting so his silver ear loops clanged cheerfully together dallas has some wild hair about there might be some wayback connection some business between draco and one of the players that simmered all these years me i figure we already scanned all the data and found zippo but she wants another run below the surface im here to serve especially when real cow meats on the menu well now if there is some bit of business youre unlikely to find it this way arent you im not something old and simmering you say considering the possibility roarke hooked another fry if i wanted to find something long buried so to speak id figure on getting a bit of dirt under my nails i dont follow you sealed records i dont have the authority to open sealeds you gotta have probable cause and a warrant and all that happy shit when roarke merely smiled mcnab straightened glanced at the entrance door of course if there was a way around all that off the record there are ways ian and there are ways yeah but theres also the cya factor well then well just have to make sure your ass is covered wont we o o dallas is going to know isnt she mcnab said a few minutes later when their positions were reversed and roarke sat at the computer of course but youll find that knowing and proving are far different matters even to the redoubtable lieutenant in any case roarke enjoyed his little forays into police work and he was a man who rarely saw a need to limit his enjoyments now you see here ian weve accessed the onrecord fingerprints and dna pattern of your primary suspects perfectly legitimate yeah if i was doing the accessing only a technicality computer match current identification codes with any and all criminal records civil actions and suits including all juvenile and sealed data a good place to start he said to mcnab working access to sealed data is denied without proper authority or judicial code open records are available shall i continue hold roarke sat back examined his nails clean as a whistle he thought for the moment mcnab be a pal would you and fetch me some coffee mcnab stuck his hands in his pockets pulled them out did a quick mental dance over the thin line between procedure and progress um yeah okay sure he ducked into the kitchen area ordered up the coffee he dawdled mcnab didnt have a clue how long it would take to bypass the red tape and access what was not supposed to be accessed to calm himself he decided to see if there was any pie available he discovered to his great delight that he had a choice of six types and agonized over which to go for ian are you growing the coffee beans in there huh he poked his head back in i was just figured youd need some time he was a sharp tech roarke thought and a delightfully naive young man i think this might interest you you got in already but how mcnab cut himself off as he hurried back to the desk no id better not know how that way when im being charged and booked i can claim ignorance charged and booked for what roarke tapped a finger on a sheet of paper heres your warrant for the sealeds my eyes goggling mcnab snatched up the sheet it looks real its signed by judge nettles so it appears wow youre not just ice mcnab said reverently youre fucking antarctica ian please youre embarrassing me right um why did i ask for judge nettles for the warrant again with a laugh roarke got to his feet im sure you can come up with some appropriately convoluted cop speak to justify the request if and when youre asked my suggestion would be a variation on a shot in the dark yeah thats a good one then ill leave you to it okay thanks ah hey roarke yes theres this other thing mcnab shifted from foot to foot on his purple airboots its kind of personal i was going to work around to talking to the lieutenant about it but well you know how she is i know precisely he studied mcnabs face felt a stir of pity wrapped around amusement women ian oh yeah well woman i guess i gotta figure a guy like you knows how to handle them as well as you handle electronics i just dont get women i mean i get them he rushed on i dont have any problem with sex i just dont get them in an intellectual sense i guess i see ian if you want me to discuss the intricacies and capriciousness of the female mind well need several days and a great deal of liquor yeah ha i guess youre in a hurry right now actually time was short there were a few billion dollars waiting to be shifted juggled and consumed but roarke eased a hip on the corner of the desk the money would wait i imagine this involves peabody were you know doing it ian i had no idea you were such a wild romantic a virtual poet roarkes dry tone had mcnab flushing then grinning we have really amazing sex thats lovely for both of you and congratulations but im not sure peabody would appreciate you sharing that piece of information with me its not really about sex mcnab said quickly afraid hed lose his sounding board before hed sounded off i mean it is because we have it a lot of it and it rocks so thats mag and all thats how i figured it would be if i could ever get her out of that uniform for five damn minutes but thats like it thats all every time we finish you know the naked pretzel i have to bribe her with food or get her going about a case or shes out the door or booting me out if we landed at her place roarke understood the frustration hed only had one woman ever try to shake him off the only woman who mattered and youre looking for more weird huh with a half laugh mcnab began to pace i really like women all sorts of women i especially like them naked who could blame you exactly so i finally get a chance to bounce on the naked shebody and its making me crazy im all tied up inside and shes cruising right along i always figured women you know mostly they were supposed to want the whole relationship thing talking about stuff so you come up with all those nice lies i mean they know youre lying but they go along with it because maybe you wont be later on or something thats a fascinating view on the male female dynamic one roarke was certain would earn the boy a female knee to the balls if ever voiced in mixed company i take it peabody isnt interested in pleasant lies i dont know what shes interested in thats the whole deal wound up now he waved his arms i mean she likes sex shes into her work she looks at dallas like the lieutenant has the answers to the mysteries of the universe then she goes off with that goddamn monroe son of a bitch to the opera it was the last delivered with vitriol that had roarke nodding its perfectly natural to be jealous of a rival rival my ass what the hells wrong with her going around with that slick lc fancy dinners and art shows listening to music you cant even dance to i ought to smash his face in roarke thought about it a moment and decided under similar circumstances hed be tempted to do just that it would be satisfying no doubt but bound to annoy the woman in question have you tried romance what do you mean like goofy stuff roarke sighed lets try this have you ever asked her out sure we see each other a couple three nights a week out ian in public in places where youre both required by law to wear clothes of some kind oh not really it might be a place to start a date where youd pick her up at her apartment at a time agreed upon then take her to a place where food and entertainment are offered while enjoying that food and or entertainment you might try having a conversation with her one that doesnt directly involve sex or work i know what a date is mcnab grumbled and felt put upon i havent got the credit base to take her places like that bastard monroe ah therein lies one of the wonders of the female mind and heart go with your strengths take her places that appeal to her sense of adventure romance humor dont compete with monroe ian contrast with him he gives her orchids grown in greenhouses on flora i you give her daisies you picked from the public field in greenpeace park as the information the idea of it processed mcnabs eyes cleared brightened hey thats good that could work i guess i could try it youre really into this shit thanks my pleasure roarke picked up his briefcase ive always been a gambling man ian and one who likes to win if i were to wager on your little triangle id put my money on you the idea pumped up mcnabs mood so high he forgot about the pie in the kitchen and got straight to work he was having such a good time planning out his first date with peabody he nearly missed the data that scrolled onscreen holy shit he jumped back up on his boots did a little dance and grabbed his communicator dallas hey lieutenant hey i think ive got something criminal charges assault and a civil suit bodily harm property damage and blah blah both filed by richard draco june charges were dropped then sealed civil action settled to the tune of five million smackeroonies and sealed defendant in both cases was how did you access sealeds mcnab he blinked and his mind went blank how did i what detective how did you access sealed records without the proper authority or the orders of the primary investigation to obtain said authority i wheres roarke even on the small communicator screen he could see flames leap into her eyes roarke though he had a bad feeling it was already too late mcnab tried to shift his expression into innocence confusion and righteousness all at once i dont know i guess hes working somewhere um did you want him for something has he been playing with you no sir absolutely not im on duty her eyes stared out from the communicator screen for a very long twenty seconds he felt sweat begin to slip greasily down the center of his back i as to how i accessed data lieutenant it occurred to me that well previous backgrounds had been negative and your instincts which i respect and admire and trust absolutely indicated there should be something so i took what you could call a shot in the dark thats it a shot in the dark and communicated our position to judge nettles who agreed to issue the proper authority i have the warrant he picked it up waved it its signed and everything i just bet it is is this going to spring back and bite my ass mcnab think carefully before you answer because i promise you if it bites mine its going to have a chew fest on yours no sir he hoped everythings in proper order im ten minutes away hold everything in proper order and mcnab if i see roarkes fingerprints anywhere im going to wring your skinny neck o o the first thing eve did when she walked back into the house was hit the house scanner where is roarke she demanded roarke is not currently on the premises he is logged at this time at his midtown offices shall i direct a transmission for you darling eve no sneaky bastard it called you darling sir thats so sweet one of roarkes little jokes and if i hear it repeated ill have to kill you she headed up the stairs out of habit peabody sighed again knowing there were numerous elevators that would be delighted to save them the climb when they walked into the office she smirked at mcnab on principle but she did offer up a quick little prayer for his skinny neck shed grown however reluctantly fond of it he sprang to his feet leading with the warrant all proper and official sir eve snatched it away took a good hard look the tension in her shoulders unknotted muscle by muscle she was dead sure roarke was behind this sudden bounty of data but the warrant would pass muster okay mcnab you can live for the time being contact feeney put him on a conferencelink and lets see what weve got o o what they had was twentyfour years old but it was violent petty meanspirited and provocative so the sophisticated kenneth whopped big time on one richard draco really big time peabody put in he knocked out two teeth busted his nose bruised his ribs and managed to break several articles of furniture before security got through the door and pulled him off it says in the civil action that draco was unable to work for three weeks suffered emotional damage extreme embarrassment physical trauma and this is my personal favorite loss of consortium both the criminal charges and the civil action were taken against stiles in his birth name stipple which he legally changed to his current stage name immediately after the suit was settled eve turned the new data over in her mind he made a deal with draco to take the payment and im banking it was more than the aforesaid five million smackeroonies to agree to having all of it sealed the media didnt get hold of it and that had to cost too twentyfour years ago peabody pointed out neither of them were major names but from what we know of draco hed have whined to the press unless it was worth his while not to he could have spewed it out any time could have continued to hold it over stiless head bad for the image developed still she shook her head i cant see stiles being overly worried about this coming out now hes an established celebrity he could spin it into a positive ah my wild youth or some such thing its why he broke dracos balls thats the key she checked her wrist unit figured angles mcnab continue search and scan if you turn up anything else interesting relay it to me or feeney ill be at central feeney reserve us an interview room first available you hauling him in feeney asked yeah lets see how he does on my stage peabody have dispatch send some uniforms to kenneth stiless address i want him to have a ride in a black and white she started out while peabody dug for her communicator hey peabody just a minute she hesitated glanced over her shoulder im busy mcnab yeah yeah he grabbed her hand gave her a tug cut it out but her own hand reached back and gave his butt a quick squeeze ive got real cop work to do you uniforms only wish you could dance the cop dance like us edds listen you want to go out tonight being pressed against him always managed to get her lust quotient hopping i guess i could come by after shift he nearly let it go at that as an image of her out of that uniform swirled into his mind still roarke hadnt said they couldnt have sex after the date no i was thinking we could go out its too cold to have sex outdoors he opened his mouth closed it again as the image in his mind switched to rolling naked with peabody in the shadows of central park if they didnt get mugged knifed or murdered it would be incredible is sex all you think about not that im against it but how about we go to the nexus club catch some music ill pick you up at eight pick me up youll pick me up thatll give you time to change it was interesting he thought seeing her look at him as if hed grown a third ear in the center of his forehead peabody move your ass you better go he smiled as eves irritated voice boomed up the stairs ill catch you later and because he was feeling lucky he crushed his mouth down on hers sucking until the kiss broke with a wet sexy sound peabody stumbled back and staggered out the door chapter thirteen eve grabbed a cup of coffee and was forced to settle for an energy bar as the candy thief had hit her again the first chance she got she was setting a trap for the sneaky bastard but at the moment she had other priorities she caught the glide to the interview area and picked up feeney on the way this guy likes to role play eve began i dont want to give him the chance to latch onto a character type lets mess with his rhythm i want to be bad cop this time feeney youre she stopped sniffed the air whats that smell feeney hunched his shoulder i dont smell anything im taking bad cop he said it so decisively eve rolled her eyes then shrugged okay fine ill start off being pleasant and reasonable then well jam him if hes lawyered she sniffed again scenting the air like a bloodhound as other cops and central personnel streamed by it smells i dont know green she decided like a salad i dont know what youre talking about lets keep focused okay a guy whips hell out of somebody like this one did hes got a temper lets see if we can heat it up fine as they stepped off the glide she leaned in sniffed at feeney hey its you shut up dallas she grinned now as the back of the neck shed just sniffed turned cherry red how come you smell like a fancy green salad feeney quiet down will you christ he darted looks right and left until he was sure no one was close enough to hear then he lowered his voice to a mutter just in case look my wife gave me this stuff for our anniversary youre supposed to put salad dressing on lettuce and stuff feeney its not salad dressing its cologne you smell good enough to eat his mouth found a spot between a snarl and a sneer yeah thats what she says keep it down will you i couldnt get out of the house this morning without putting it on or idve hurt her feelings you have to get pretty close to catch it but the damn stuff lasts hours ive been taking stairs and glides all day i cant risk an elevator gee thats really sweet feeney maybe you could tell her you want to save it for special occasions you think shed tumble for that dallas you dont understand women got me there they turned the corner and saw peabody outside interview three talking to another uniform eve recognized the tall young cop sent him a nod when he turned saw her flushed well its officer trueheart hows it going its going good lieutenant the suspects inside subject eve corrected were not calling him suspect at this point she watched him process the difference in procedure she could smell rookie on him as clearly as she could smell feeneys cologne did the subject request a lawyer or representative no sir i think he cut himself off stiffened his already soldierly back i beg your pardon lieutenant youre allowed to think trueheart in fact we encourage thinking around here she remembered with some bitterness his first trainer whod not only discouraged thinking but humanity give me your take yes sir well sir i think hes too mad to ask for representation at this time mad lieutenant plus he wants to go a few rounds with you in my opinion the subject referred to you in inflammatory terms during transport and here i was planning to be nice to him stand by trueheart you can go to observation if you want well need you to transport the subject one way or the other after interview yes sir thank you sir and id like to express my appreciation for your assistance in having me transferred from stiffscooping detail to central the transfer was easy trueheart staying here will be up to you are we set she asked peabody and feeney she opened the door strolled inside stiles sat at the small table his arms crossed his face mutinous he sent eve one steely glare and what is the meaning of this outrage lieutenant dallas i want an explanation as to why i was removed from my home by two uniformed officers and shoved into the backseat of a police car peabody make a note to speak with said uniformed officers no shoving so noted sir record on she said meandering to the table interview with subject kenneth stiles regarding case number hsc dallas lieutenant eve as primary also in attendance feeney captain ryan and peabody officer delia mr stiles have you been informed of your rights and obligations in this matter the cop with peach fuzz on his chin recited the standard i want to know and do you understand these rights and obligations mr stiles he showed his teeth im not a nitwit of course i understand them i insist i apologize for the inconvenience she settled back tried out a smile there was no need to repeat the revised miranda and remind him he could holler lawyer i realize this is unpleasant for you again apologize for the inconvenience and will try to expedite this interview feeney gave a sharp snort so that eve sent him a quick worried look that had stiles shifting in his seat what is this about stiles demanded i have a right to know why ive been dragged down here like a common criminal youve been read your rights stiles feeneys voice was clipped and harsh now were the ones who ask the questions ive already answered questions i dont know anything other than what ive already told lieutenant dallas i guess you dont know anything about that poor slob who ended up dangling by his neck a couple feet off the floor either feeney eve held up her hands for peace easy feeney folded his arms over his chest and tried to look burly he keeps pulling my chain im pulling his back lets take a minute want some water stiles blinked at her baffled hed been ready to rip into eve and now she was giving him sympathetic looks and offering him water yes yes i would why dont you offer him a snack while youre at it ignoring feeney eve rose to fill a small cup with lukewarm water mr stiles some new information has come to light regarding your relationship with richard draco what new information i told you i said we ask the questions feeney came half out of his chair you didnt tell us squat you didnt tell us you kicked dracos face in did you a guy puts another guy in the hospital maybe he finds a way to come back around and put him in the ground i dont know what youre talking about stiless voice was smooth even but his hand trembled lightly as he took the cup of water mr stiles im going to warn you that theres a very stiff penalty for lying in interview eve leaned forward so that stiles would focus on her face you dont want that kind of trouble take my word for it you cooperate with me and im going to do what i can to straighten this out if youre not straight with me i cant help you and its going to be tough for you to help yourself guys a coward feeney said in disgust takes draco out but hides behind some poor woman to do it i never the mutiny in stiless eyes turned to horrified shock my god you cant believe i actually arranged richards death thats absurd at least he used to have some guts feeney went on and deliberately cracked his knuckles in three nasty little pops used his own hands to pound dracos face in mustve really ticked him off huh stiles you actor guys are fussy about your pretty faces stiles moistened his lips i had absolutely nothing to do with richards death ive told you everything i know about it eve put a hand on feeneys shoulder as if to restrain him then with a sigh rose the file officer peabody hard copy yes sir keeping her face blank peabody offered eve a folder eve sat with it opened it gave stiles a chance to read as much as he could manage upside down and watched his color drain i have documents here relating to both criminal and civil actions which involve you as defendant those matters were resolved years ago years and sealed i was assured they were sealed this is murder pal feeneys mouth twisted into a sneer seals broken lets give the guy a chance to settle into this feeney mr stiles we were authorized to break the seal due to the course of this investigation you dont owe him explanations lets just keep it smooth eve murmured to feeney you were charged with assaulting richard draco causing extensive bodily harm mental and emotional trauma it was twentyfour years ago for gods sake i know i understand that but you indicated to me in your previous statement on record that you and the deceased had no overt difficulties and yet eve said letting the silence hang a moment at one time you were driven to assault him seriously enough to result in his hospitalization in your arrest in a sevenfigure civil suit the paper cup crumpled in stiless hand little drops of water flew it was all resolved look kenneth she used his first name now establishing intimacy the fact is everything ive come up with on draco points to him being a sorry son of a bitch i have to figure you had cause to lay into him good cause you were seriously provoked you dont strike me as a violent man im not the sheen of sophistication had turned into a sheen of sweat it gleamed on his face as he nodded at eve no im not of course im not feeney snorted again ill buy that one didnt even have the nerve to stick draco himself i didnt kill richard stiless voice rose boomed as he looked at feeney i had nothing to do with it what happened before good lord i was hardly more than a boy i understand that mr stiles you were young you were provoked sympathy rang in eves voice she got up filled another cup with water brought it back to him tell me how it happened why it happened all i want to do is clear this up so you can go home stiles closed his eyes drew air in slowly released it wed both begun to make our marks in theater in small regional theaters not much of a mark of course but we were beginning we were both aiming for new york broadway was enjoying a rich revival in those days his voice warmed a bit as he remembered his youth that sense of anticipation invulnerability color came back to his cheeks it was a return to the lights the glamour the brilliance after the destruction of the urban wars people were looking for entertainment for escape and i suppose for heroes who didnt carry weapons we were a tight and perhaps an arrogant circle it was a heady time lieutenant a renaissance we were treated like royalty offstage we lived very large lives excessive lives sex illegals lavish parties he picked up his water again drank deeply it ruined some of us i would say it ruined richard he reveled in the fame in the excesses it never affected his work that was his genius but offstage he indulged in every possible vice there was a cruelty to him particularly toward women he crushed more than one on his way he liked to brag about it to make bets about which woman hed have next i found it unpleasant he cleared his throat shoved his cup away there was a woman a girl really we were seeing each other it wasnt serious but we enjoyed each others company then richard began the hunt he stalked her lured her and in the end ruined her when he cast her off it broke her i went to her apartment i dont know what instinct sent me there when i found her she she was on the point of taking her own life she had already slashed her wrists i got her to a health center i he trailed off hesitated then continued with obvious difficulty they saved her but something inside me snapped when i looked at her lying there so pale so used i got drunk then i went after richard stiles ran his hands over his face i might have killed him that night i admit it but people from the neighboring apartments stopped me afterward i realized what a useless gesture it had been it changed nothing and cost me a great deal instead of damaging richard i could have destroyed my own career my own life i put myself at his mercy you see he agreed to the settlements and the seals to protect his own image i had reason to be grateful he was just that selfinterested it took me three years to pay off the suit with merciless interest then i put it behind me seems to me you had plenty of reason to hate the son of a bitch feeney put in perhaps steadier now that the story was told stiles nodded but hate takes enormous amounts of time and energy i prefer employing mine in more positive channels i have everything i want i enjoy my life i would never risk it again on the likes of richard draco not such a risk when you put the knife in the hands of a woman stiless head snapped up his eyes burned i dont use women ive had nearly twentyfive years to learn a lesson lieutenant richard draco stopped mattering to me a very long time ago what happened to the woman i dont know he heaved a huge sigh full of regret she ceased to be part of my life i believe the fact that i knew what had happened made it difficult for her to be around me to maintain our friendship seems to me shed have been grateful she was lieutenant but like me she had to put the incident all of it behind her i went to london very shortly after the incident worked there and then in california in canada we didnt keep in touch and i never heard of her again convenient eve thought maybe just a little too convenient what was her name is that necessary its a sad story you tell mr stiles an effective one but theres no one here to back it up what was her name anja carvell he looked back into the past then down at his hands her name was anja ive told you all i can one more thing where were you yesterday morning between the hours of ten and eleven yesterday its the hour i take my daily exercise a brisk walk in the park can anyone verify that i was alone his voice was cold again the temper was coming back but it was more controlled am i to be detained any longer i have a memorial service to attend youre advised not to leave the city eve studied his face there was something off but she couldnt put her finger on it any attempt to do so will result in an immediate warrant for your detention she rose signaled toward observation and trueheart an officer will take you back to your apartment oh mr stiles one last thing did you ever have occasion to converse with linus quim quim stiles got to his feet brushed the back of his fingertips down his lapel no one didnt converse with quim he had a disdain for people in my profession an odd little man i wouldnt be surprised if you discovered hed switched the knives he really couldnt stand actors o o peabody start tracking down anja carvell i dont like the way it plays feeney commented too slick yeah i was waiting for the lights to come up and the music to start still it couldve gone down pretty much like he said even if it did it doesnt change anything he had a hardon for draco a big fat one he strikes me as the type whod chew on it for at least two decades i like him for a longterm planner eve agreed somebody who keeps slights and annoyances tucked in little boxes and as someone who wouldnt want to get his hands dirty not a second time but something was out of step details left out or details added in well see how the carvell connection shakes out she decided he was leaving holes picking what he wanted to tell us how he wanted it told adlibbing she mused isnt that what they call it he did a good job of it i think he was in love with anja peabody had her palm unit out but hadnt yet started the scan it makes a difference if he was eve shuffled back her own thoughts turned to her aide where do you get that from it was the way he talked about her before he started to think it through before he started picking his way he got this look in his eyes wistful eve hooked her thumbs in her front pockets he got a wistful look in his eye yeah just for a minute he was really thinking about her about the way it was or the way hed wanted it to be i think she was the love of his life when youve got one of those it does stuff to you define stuff it makes you think about them even when youre doing routine things it makes you want to protect them to make them happy and safe you know peabody said with some frustration youve got one one what love of your life jeez dallas but see youre the love of his right back this wasnt the same way because she threw him over for draco if you were to go insane and throw roarke over for somebody what do you think hed do before or after this somebody was no more than a smudge on the bottom of roarkes shoe see pleased peabody grinned if youve got a love of your life you know she paused sniffed something smells really good just keep going feeney ordered quickly if the theory is that stiles was stuck on this carvell woman how does that change the picture because you never get over the love of your life thats the whole definition isnt it you only get one so that bit about him losing touch with her was bull i like it if we find that stiles had some contact with the woman weve got a motive that spans a quarter century the setup suits him in both murders he had opportunity its all circumstantial feeney reminded her yeah but we pile on enough we might finesse a confession out of him find the woman peabody if you run into snags hook up with mcnab on it feeney how do you feel about going to a splashy memorial service my wife loves it when i rub elbows with celebrities peabody were in the field yes sir she watched them head off and had a sudden craving for a big chunky salad o o feeneys wife was going to be delirious performers from every medium were in attendance the service was held at radio city though draco had never performed there its art deco glamour had just the right ambiance word was dracos agent had hired the top mourners association company to arrange the affair and as it was technically dracos last performance hed skimmed off percent of the gross enormous screens flickered with draco in dozens of images there was a holoperformance running on a side stage with draco in full costume defending country and womankind with sword and fancy footwork for two hundred and fifty dollars a pop a thousand lucky fans could attend the rest were invited guests there were seas of flowers islands of people in sophisticated black streams of gawkers who despite the posted request were busy immortalizing the event on disc on the main stage atop a white pedestal was draco himself resting in a coffin of pale blue glass hell of a show eve just shook her head theyre selling souvenirs did you see little draco dolls tshirts theres nothing like free enterprise roarke said from behind her she turned eyed him up and down why are you here lieutenant have you forgotten the deceased met his end while starring in a play in my theater how could i stay away besides he patted the pocket of his elegant suit i got an invitation i thought you had meetings all day the advantage of being in charge is being in charge i took an hour with his hand lightly on her shoulder he scanned the crowd the lights the screens appalling isnt it and then some feeney lets split up see what we see ill meet you at the main entrance one hour you got it he spotted several faces he knew from onscreen and a banquet table no reason he couldnt see what he saw with his mouth full roarke if i ditched you twentyfive years ago would you still be hung up about it he smiled caressed her hair difficult to say as id have spent that time hounding you and making your life a living hell no seriously who said i wasnt he took her arm led her through the crowd lets pretend youre someone less annoying ah all right if youd broken my heart id attempt to pick up the shattered pieces and rebuild my life but id never forget you what have you got peabodys got a theory about love the love of your life im playing with it i can tell you youre mine no kissing she hissed seeing the intent in his eyes im on duty here theres michael proctor smiling i went over his financials and he paid over ten k for that dental work while he lives in a sty hes chatting with that slicklooking woman over there he doesnt look so shook up or bumbling now hes talking with marcina one of the top screen producers in the business could be your boy is hoping for a career shift less than a week ago the stage was his life interesting lets see how he holds up she worked her way over noted the instant proctor saw her his eyes widened his head drooped and his shoulders hunched in prestochango eve thought from debonair leading man to fumbling second lead in a blink the magic of theater proctor ah ah lieutenant dallas i didnt realize youd be attending i get around deliberately she scanned the theater i guess quim cant expect this kind of sendoff quim oh he had the grace or the skill to flush no no i suppose not richard was he was known and respected by so many people a lot of them sure are toasting him she leaned over studied the pretty bubbles in the glass he held with premium champagne he would have expected no less this from the woman roarke had identified as marcina this event suits him perfectly she shifted her gaze over eves shoulder then beamed roarke i wondered if id see you here marcina he stepped up lightly kissed her cheek youre looking well im very well dallas she said after a moment and pinned eve with her sharp gaze of course this must be your wife ive heard a great deal about you lieutenant if youll excuse me proctor said dont run off on my account eve told proctor but he was already edging away i see a friend he dived into the crowd like a man leaping overboard i assume youre on duty marcina skimmed a glance over eves trousers and serviceable jacket youre investigating richards death thats right would you mind telling me what you and proctor were talking about is he a suspect lips pursed marcina looked over to where proctor had disappeared fascinating actually it was shop talk michael has the right look for a screen project im putting together we were discussing the possibility of him coming out to new la for a few days and is he perhaps but hes committed to his current play hes quite looking forward to taking richards place onstage not that he put it quite so tactlessly my people will be talking to his people as it were over the next week or two to see if we can work something out he hoped that the theater will reopen very soon o o the minute eve stepped outside she took a deep gulp of air thick with the stink of smoke from glidecarts screaming with the noise of street and air traffic she preferred it over the sweetly perfumed air inside proctor isnt letting draco get cold before he steps into his shoes he sees an opportunity roarke commented yeah so did the killer point taken he traced a fingertip over the dent in her chin i might be a little late tonight i should be home by eight okay i have something for you oh come on when he reached in his pocket she stuffed her hands in hers this isnt the time or place for presents i see then i guess ill just keep this for myself instead of the jewelry case shed expected he pulled out a jumbo chocolate bar her hand whipped out of her pocket snatched it then again roarke murmured you bought me a candy bar i know the way to your heart lieutenant she tore off the wrapping bit in i guess you do thanks its not dinner he said with a narrowed eye but if you can hold off well have some together when i get home sure you got transpo ill walk its a nice day he caught her face kissed her before she could tell him not to chewing her candy she watched him walk away and thought she understood exactly what peabody meant by the love of a lifetime chapter fourteen mira studied the record of the interview with kenneth stiles she sipped her tea while eve paced in another five minutes she would have been on her way home eve had caught her as shed been locking up now she would be late that thought shifted through the back of her mind as she focused on the interview her husband would understand particularly if she made a quick detour on the way and picked up a carton of his favorite ice cream shed learned long ago the tricks and balances of blending a demanding career and a successful marriage you and feeney are an excellent interview team she commented you read each other well weve been doing it awhile eve wanted to hurry mira along but knew better i think hes been practicing that hardass look in the mirror that brought out a smile i imagine so given his comfortable face its surprisingly effective am i correct in assuming you dont believe stiles told the whole truth are you ever wrong now and again youre looking for this anja carvell peabodys tracking her he had and has strong feelings for her id say she was a turning point for him if it had been a storybook the woman would have come to him after he defended her happily ever after but she didnt want him or didnt love him enough felt unworthy humiliated scarred mira lifted a hand there are countless reasons why she and stiles didnt match without observing her i couldnt say still its stiless emotional and mental state that interests you peabodys idea is that this woman was the love of his life and because of that hed never have completely lost touch with her i think peabody has good instincts he protected her defended her a man with his sense of theater or drama would tend to put himself in the role of hero and she his damsel in distress he may very well still be doing so shes key eve murmured maybe not the key but a key with her hands in her pockets she wandered to miras window she was feeling closed in today and couldnt say why i dont get it she said at length the woman shrugs him off sleeps with another guy folds herself into this other guy so completely that when he tosses her away she tries to selfterminate and still stiles is hung up on her he beats hell out of draco gets himself arrested gets skinned in a civil suit and when he talks about her twentyfive years later he goes soft why isnt he bitter why isnt he pissed is he jamming me here i cant say with absolute certainty hes a talented actor but my evaluation at this point is no as far as his feelings for the woman hes not jamming you eve the human heart is a mystery well never completely solve youre putting yourself in this mans place thats one of the skills you have what makes you so good at what you do but you cant quite get into his heart you would look at this woman and see weakness mira sipped more tea as eve turned she was weak weak and careless and quite young i imagine but thats beside the point you look at love differently because youre strong and because of where and in whom you found it the love of your life eve would never betray you or hurt you or where it matters most ever let you down he accepts who you are absolutely as much as you love him i dont think you fully understand how rare and how precious that is stiles loved and perhaps still loves a fantasy you have the reality people kill for both yes mira ejected the disc held it out to eve they do o o all the talk about love and lifetimes got under eves skin and made her feel uncomfortably guilty she played back what others had said and realized everyone who had mentioned her relationship with roarke as an example had spoken of what he would do for her or wouldnt do to her it wasnt she decided a very pretty picture of her participation in the whole love and marriage deal she never really did anything she thought she still had a miserable time finding the right words the right gesture the right moment roarke seemed to pluck them out of the air as easily as smoothly as he plucked his fortune so shed make an effort shed push the case onto the back burner okay the side burner she admitted and do something jesus romantic in her current state of mind she wanted to avoid summerset at all costs so she actually put her car in the garage then like a thief she snuck in the house through one of the side doors she was about to plan her first intimate dinner how hard could it be she asked herself as she jumped into the shower shed led tactical teams in hostage situations tracked psychopaths outwitted the deranged she was smart enough to put a fancy meal on a fancy table probably she zipped out of the shower and into the drying tube not in the bedroom she decided because that was well obvious and she thought most likely romance should be subtle shed use one of the lounging rooms as the hot air whirled around her she began to plot thirty minutes later she was feeling both satisfied and frazzled there were so many damn rooms in the house she still didnt believe shed been in all of them and all the damn rooms had stuff enormous amounts of stuff how was she supposed to figure out what was needed candles she got that but when she ran an inventory scan she discovered a veritable forest of candles in several areas still the satisfaction came from skulking through the house evading the everwatchful summerset she decided on white because color meant shed most likely have to match it with more colors and that was just more than she could handle she spent another twenty minutes dealing with the menu then had to face the frightening ordeal of selecting plates flatware crystal it had been a shock to run an inventory on something as basic as dinner plates and find her husband had over fifty types of varying material and patterns what kind of maniac needed over five thousand plates her maniac she reminded herself then nearly choked when she ran the crystal okay thats got to be wrong she was at the point of choosing at random because her time was running short might i ask precisely what youre doing a lesser woman would have yelped eve managed just barely to bite it back get lost im busy summerset simply strode over the cat at his heels so i observe if you wish to know the contents of the house i suggest you discuss it with roarke i cant because ive killed him disposed of his body and now im going to hold the biggest auction on or off planet in the history of civilization she jabbed a finger against something called waterford dublin pattern only because she recognized it as the city where roarke had been born then she looked up with a scowl toward the hovering summerset go away but his attention had shifted from her to the table under the glass dome of the observation balcony shed used the irish linen he noted an excellent choice which was probably blind luck the georgian candlesticks white tapers there were dozens of other candles all white scattered around the lounging room as yet unlighted galahad the cat pranced over and leaped onto the satin pillows on the love seat jesus christ theyre just forks and knives the combination of horror and frustration in her tone had summersets lips twitching which china pattern have you selected i dont know will you get out of here this is a private party he tapped her hand aside before she could select scanned her other choices and ordered the proper flatware youve neglected to order napkins i was getting to them he turned a pitying eye on her she was wearing a cotton robe had yet to enhance her face her hair was standing in spikes from the constant swipe of her fingers but he gave her points for the attempt in fact he was pleasantly surprised by her taste though some of her selections were unconventional in combinations they managed to blend into a rather charming ambiance when one plans a special meal he said taking care to look down the long line of his nose at her one requires the proper accompaniments what am i doing here playing space attack now if youd just go slither under the door again i could finish up flowers are necessary flowers her stomach pitched to her feet i knew that she wasnt going to ask shed saw her tongue off with her teeth before she asked for a humming ten seconds they simply stared at each other he took pity on her though he told himself he was simply maintaining his authority as majordomo i would suggest roses the royal silver i guess weve got those yes they can be accessed youll also require music her palms started to sweat annoyed she rubbed them on the robe i was going to program something or other i assume you intend to dress for the evening shit she heaved out a breath stared hard at the cat who was staring hard back at her she suspected he was grinning its part of my duties to organize matters such as this if youll go put on something more ill arrange the rest she opened her mouth to agree already the knots in her stomach loosened then she shook her head and felt them tighten right back up again no i have to do it myself thats the point she massaged her forehead she was getting a headache perfect his face remained stern cold but inside he softened like jelly then youd better hurry roarke will be home within the hour she would summerset concluded as he left her alone need every minute of it o o his mind was on business when he got home his last meeting of the day had involved a textile conglomerate looking for a buyout he had to decide if he was looking to buy the company and most of its subsidiaries had been sloppily run roarke had no sympathy for sloppy business practices as a result his initial offer had been insultingly low the fact that their negotiator hadnt been nearly as insulted as he should have been sent up red flags he would have to do more research before he took the next step the problem would be on one of their two offplanet sites he calculated it might be worth a trip to study them firsthand there had been a time he would have simply arranged his schedule and done so but in the past year it had become increasingly less appealing to leave home even for the short term he had he thought with some amusement at himself become rooted he stopped by eves office on the way to his own was mildly surprised not to find her there neck deep in her current case curiosity had him setting his own work aside and moving to the house scanner where is eve eve is currently in lounging room four third level south wing what the hell is she doing in there would you like to engage monitor no ill go see for myself hed never known her to loiter in that area of the house the fact was hed never known her to lounge unless he nagged seduced or conned her into it it occurred to him it might be pleasant to have their meal there relax together with a bottle of wine and shake their respective days from their minds hed have to talk her into it thinking this he walked into the room if shed been looking in his direction she would have caught one of the rare moments when her husband was completely flabbergasted the room was lit with dozens of white candles and the fragrance of them waltzed with the tender perfume of dozens of silver roses crystal glinted silver gleamed and the romance of harp strings wept in the air in the midst of it eve stood in an alarmred dress that left her arms and shoulders bare as it skimmed down her long slim body like an avid lovers hungry hands her face was flushed her eyes bright with concentration as she twisted the wire on a bottle of champagne excuse me he saw her lovely shoulders jerk her only sign of surprise im looking for my wife her stomach jittered a little but she turned smiled he had a face made for candlelight she thought for slow and simmering fires looking at it never failed to start one in her blood hi hello glancing around the room he walked toward her whats all this dinner dinner he repeated and his eyes narrowed what have you done youre not hurt no im fine still smiling she popped the cork relieved when champagne didnt come spraying out he frowned as she poured champagne into crystal flutes all right what do you want what do you mean i mean i know a setup when i see one what do you want her smile wavered it took a great deal of effort to keep it from turning into a snarl sticking to the steps shed carefully outlined she handed him his wine gently tapped her glass to his what i cant put together a nice dinner without ulterior motives he thought about it no she set the bottle on the table with an ominous crack look its dinner okay you dont want to eat fine i didnt say i didnt want to eat she was wearing perfume he noted and lip dye shed fussed with her eyes he reached out to toy with the tearshaped diamond pendant hed given her what are you up to eve that tore it nothing forget it i dont know what came over me obviously i lost my mind for a minute no for two sweaty stupid hours thats what it took to put this fiasco together im going to work he caught her arm before she could march past him and wasnt the least surprised to see the quick flare of violence in her eyes but he was surprised to see hurt i dont think so you want to keep that hand pal youll move it ah there she is for a moment i thought youd been replaced by a droid it gave me a bad start i bet you think thats funny i think ive hurt your feelings and im sorry he brushed his lips over her forehead even as he flipped desperately through his mental calendar have i forgotten an occasion no no she stepped back no she said again and felt ridiculous i just wanted to do something for you to give you something and you can just stop looking at me like ive fried a few circuits you think youre the only one who can put this kind of deal together well youre right you are i nearly stunned myself with my own weapon a half a dozen times tonight just to put myself out of my misery oh fuck it she picked up her glass again stalked to the wide curved window roarke winced and began the delicate task of extracting his feet from his mouth its lovely eve and so are you oh dont start with me eve just because i dont do this kind of thing because i dont take the time hell because i dont think of it doesnt mean i dont love you i do she spun around and he wouldnt have described the look on her face as particularly loving shed gone back to fury youre the one whos always doing the things saying the words giving she fumbled a moment just giving i wanted to give something back she was beautiful hurt and angry passionate and pissed she was the most beautiful creature hed ever seen you steal my breath he murmured ive got this whole love of a lifetime thing in my head murder betrayal rage i beg your pardon never mind she paused took a deep breath the last couple of days people have said things that keep sticking in my brain would you jump in front of a maxibus for me absolutely they dont go very fast she laughed relieving him considerably thats what i said oh hell i messed this up i knew i would no i took care of that he moved to her took her hand do you love me enough to give me another chance at this maybe darling eve he lifted her hand to his lips what youve done here means a great deal to me you you mean everything to me see how you do that slick as spit he trailed his fingers over the curve of her shoulder i like the dress it was a good thing she thought he hadnt seen her frozen panic when shed opened her closet i thought it would work it does very well he picked up her glass then his own lets try this again thank you yeah well id say it was nothing but that would be a big fat lie just tell me this one thing why do you have a million plates im sure thats an exaggeration not by much well you never know who might be coming to dinner do you including the entire population of new zealand she sipped champagne now im behind schedule have we a schedule yeah you know drinks dinner conversation blah blah it all ends up with me getting you drunk and seducing you i like the end goal since i came close to spoiling things the least i can do now is cooperate he started to pick up the bottle but she laid a hand on his arm dance with me she slid her hands up his chest linked them behind his neck close and slow his arms came around her his body swayed with hers and his blood leapt with love with lust as her mouth brushed silkily over his i love the taste of you her voice was husky now soft it always makes me want more have more but when he attempted to deepen the kiss she turned her head skimmed those heated lips along his jaw slow she said again the way im going to make love with you she nibbled her way to his ear so that its almost torture she threaded her fingers through his hair all that gorgeous black fisted them drew his head back until their eyes met his were deep and blue and already hot i want you to say my name when i take you she teased his mouth with hers again retreated felt his body tighten like a bow against hers say it so that i know nothing exists for you but me at that moment nothing exists for me but you youre all there is her mouth took his now a frantic mating of lips teeth tongues she felt his moan start low start deep then merge with her own she let herself tremble let herself ache then pulled back pulled away a breath before surrender eve she heard the strain in his voice enjoyed it as she picked up their glasses again thirsty no he started to reach for her but she shifted away thrust out his glass i am have a drink i want to go to your head you do let me have you i will after ive had you she picked up a small remote pressed a series of buttons on the side wall panels opened the bed that had been tucked behind them was heaped with pillows thats where i want you eventually she took a long sip of champagne watching him over the rim youre not drinking youre killing me delighted she laughed and the sound was like smoke its going to get worse now he did drink then set his glass aside praise god she walked back to him slipped his jacket from his shoulders i love your body she murmured slowly working open the buttons of his shirt im going to spend a lot of time enjoying it tonight it was a powerful rush she thought to make a strong man quiver she felt that dance of muscles as she traced a fingertip down his chest to the hook of his trousers instead of releasing them she smiled youd better sit down there was a throbbing in his blood primal edging toward violent it took a great deal of effort not to yield to it to drag her to the floor and answer that urgent beat no not here she said and lifting his hand nipped lightly at his knuckles i dont think youll be able to manage to cross the room when im done it wasnt the wine making his head swim she guided him across the room a kind of lazy circling dance with her in the lead when she eased him down to sit on the side of the bed she knelt at his feet brushed her hands slowly intimately down his legs and took off his shoes she rose ill just go get the wine im not interested in wine she walked away tossed a glance over her shoulder you will be when i start licking it off you she topped off the glasses brought them back to set them on the small carved table by the bed then watching him her eyes gold and full of the light from the candles she began to peel the dress down her body he wondered that his system didnt simply implode christ christ jesus the irish had leaped back into his voice as she knew it did when he was distracted angry aroused the simple sign made her glad shed taken the time and trouble to well dress for the evening the sirenred lingerie was an erotic contrast against her skin the silk and lace body skimmer rode low over her breasts so they all but spilled out of the top then it cinched in sheer and seductive slicked over her hips her hose was sheer and shimmering and braked to a teasing halt at midthigh she stepped out of the dress kicked it aside with the toe of one spiked heel i thought wed have dinner first he managed to lift his gaze to her face even as his mouth fell open but i guess itll keep she stepped forward planted herself between his legs i want you to touch me his hands burned to take but he skimmed them lightly over her following angle curve im lost in you already stay there she bent down took his mouth she knew he held back let her hold the reins and because she knew it she gave him everything she had the candlelight glimmered warming the scent of the roses as she slid onto the bed with him as she took her hands her mouth over him erotic and tender passionate and loving she wanted to show him all everything and as she did he gave back long drugging kisses that weighed the limbs lazy lingering caresses that thrilled the blood the bed with its thick mattress of gel undulated beneath them she rolled leaned away so he contented himself with the flavor just above the silk hose on the back of her thigh then she straddled him drank from the glass of champagne upending it she began to drink him his vision blurred the breath clogging in his lungs to burning she tormented him pleasured him her agile body slid and slithered over his while her mouth drove him to the verge of madness his control snapped steel rending steel the sound of silk tearing inflamed him as he ripped at it and with a sound of greed he filled his hands his mouth with her she came a wild shock slap to her system her head fell back as she gulped for air her body shuddered as he feasted on it he said something she couldnt understand in the language of his homeland that so rarely passed his lips then his face was pressed against her his breath hot on her skin i need you eve i need you i know tenderness washed into her balm over a burn she cupped his face lifted it her lips met his soft as a whisper dont ever stop there were tears in her eyes the shifting light caught the glint of them he drew her closer kissed them away eve no let me say it first this time let me remember to say it first i love you i always will be with me she murmured as she took him inside her oh stay with me she wrapped herself around him rose to him matching stroke to stroke beat to beat then his hands clasped hers locked tight their eyes held in a bond just as fierce when she saw his that wild blue go blind when she heard him say her name her lips curved into a smile and she surrendered chapter fifteen she was sprawled across the bed facedown in a position roarke knew she assumed when her system had finally shut down he stretched out beside her sipping what champagne was left and trailing a fingertip absently up and down her spine ill give you an hour and a half to stop that ah she lives she stirred herself enough to turn her head and look at him you look pretty smug as it happens darling eve im feeling pretty smug it was all my idea and a fine one it was too would i be risking my skin if i asked just what inspired you well she curved her back into the brush of his finger you bought me a candy bar remind me to arrange for a truckload tomorrow a truckload would kill us she pushed to her knees shoved back her hair she looked soft and used and content ill risk it with a laugh she leaned over to rest her forehead to his one last mushy thing before it becomes a habit you make me happy im starting to get used to it thats a very nice way to end the mush i guess we should eat id hate to think of you slaving over a hot stove and not have the results appreciated her eyes slitted is that a dig no indeed whats for dinner lots of stuff with weird fancy names yum i figured if you didnt like it it wouldnt be programmed she scooted off the bed stood naked glancing around i dont guess theres a robe in here afraid not he dug through the tangle of sheets and pillows and came up with the now tattered body skimmer you could wear whats left of this never mind she picked up her discarded dress shimmied into it well now that stirs the appetite considerably even you couldnt go another round after that last one when he grinned she thought it wise to move out of reach o o she couldnt pronounce half the food she put in her mouth but it was damn tasty what is this called again fruit de le mer a la parisienne i guess if they called it a bunch of fish in a fancy sauce it wouldnt have the same ring a rose by any other name he refilled her water glass lieutenant huh youre trying not to think about your day why dont you just tell me about it instead she stabbed another scallop ive got a lead on she cut herself off sucked it in no you tell me about your day my day he asked in surprise yeah what did you do today howd it go that sort of thing youre in a mood he murmured then shrugged i dealt with some financial reorganization what does that mean i bought some stock on its way down sold some that i believe had topped off studied the daily analysis of several companies and adjusted accordingly i guess that kept you busy enough until about noon when i went into the office he wondered how long it would take until her eyes glazed over i had a holoconference regarding the olympus resort cost overruns remain under the acceptable five percent however on a pointbypoint project analysis i find indications of a downturn in resource productivity that warrants closer study and a correction ninety seconds he calculated watching her eyes hed figured shed drop off at sixty then i bought you a candy bar i liked that part he broke off a chunk of his roll buttered it eve did you marry me for my money you bet your ass and youd better hold on to it or im history its very sweet of you to say so that made her grin i guess were finished talking about your day i thought we were whats your lead love at least thats where all the arrows are pointing right now she filled him in while she polished off her meal kenneth stiles attacked draco and beat him badly enough for medical intervention roarke cocked his head interesting isnt it when you compare the two men draco was taller considerably heftier and certainly on the surface a great deal tougher no indication that stiles was injured none i thought about that too it comes down to the pussy and the pissed draco being the pussy stiles the pissed and being the pissed cost stiles several million dollars and he didnt even end up with the girl anja peabody found a handful of carvells in the city wrong age span so were widening the scan my gut tells me she has some of the answers cherchez la femme what find the woman he translated she lifted her glass in a quick toast you can count on it o o anja he said the name softly a bare whisper of sound and heard the gasp of surprise and recognition that followed it dont say anything please just listen i have to speak with you its important not over the link will you meet me this is about richard its about everything o o it took time he was certain he was being watched and feared his own shadow stiles sat at the mirror in his dressing area and skillfully painstakingly altered his appearance he changed the color of his eyes the shape of his nose his jaw the color of his skin he covered his hair with a wig a thick mane of deep brown he supposed it was vanity that prevented him from using the more ordinary gray one he couldnt bear to look old in her eyes he added a slim mustache a slender brush of beard in the center of his chin all of this came naturally despite the anxiety he had donned a hundred characters in his life sliding into them as smoothly as a man slips into favorite slippers after a long day he added girth to his small frame shoulders chest then covered the padding with a simple dark suit the lifts in his shoes would give him another inch of height he took his time studying the results in the long triple mirror searching for any sign of kenneth stiles for the first time in over an hour he allowed himself a small smile he could walk right up to lieutenant eve dallas and kiss her on the mouth hed be damned if shed recognize him empowered as he always was by a new role stiles swirled on a cape and went out to meet the woman hed loved all his life o o she kept him waiting she always had hed chosen a small nostalgia club that had fallen out of fashion but the music was low and bluesy the patrons minded their own and the drinks came quickly he sipped at gin and paged through the battered volume of shakespeares sonnets it was their signal she had given him the book all those years ago he had taken it for a token of love instead of the friendship shed intended even when hed realized his mistake hed treasured it as much as hed treasured her hed lied to the police of course hed never broken contact with her had known where she was what she was doing he had simply assumed another role with her that of confidant and friend and after a time living the part for so many years he grew comfortable with it yet when she slid into the booth across from him held out a hand for his his heart leapt shed changed her hair it was a glorious tangle of smoky red her skin was a pale pale gold he knew it was soft to the touch her eyes were deep tawny and concerned but she smiled at him a hesitant curve of a lush mouth so you still read it her voice was soft and lightly french yes often anja his fingers flexed on hers then deliberately relaxed let me order you a drink she sat back watching him waiting as he signaled a waiter and ordered her a glass of sauvignon blanc you never forget why would i oh kenneth she closed her eyes a moment i wish things had been different could have been dont he spoke more sharply than hed intended it could still sting were beyond regrets i dont think we ever get beyond them she let out a small sigh ive spent more than half my life regretting richard he said nothing until her drink was served and shed taken the first sip the police think i killed him her eyes went wide and wine sloshed toward the rim of her glass as her hand jerked but no no thats impossible ridiculous they know what happened twentyfour years ago what do you mean her hand darted out for his squeezed like a vise what do they know steady now they know about the assault my arrest the suit but how is that possible it was so long ago and all the details were put away eve dallas lieutenant dallas he said with some bitterness as he lifted his own drink shes relentless she managed to break the seal they took me in put me in a room hammered at me oh kenneth kenneth man cher im so sorry it must have been hideous they think ive harbored a grudge against richard all this time he laughed a little drank i suppose theyre right but you didnt kill him no but theyll continue to dig into the past you need to be prepared i had to tell them why i attacked richard i had to give them your name when the blood drained from her face he leaned over clasped both of her hands anja he said deliberately i told them id lost track of you that weve had no contact in all these years that i didnt know how to find you i told them richard had seduced you then when he was certain you were in love with him he cast you off i told them about the attempt to take your own life thats all i told them she made a small sound of despair and lowered her head it still shames me you were young brokenhearted you survived anja im sorry i panicked but the fact is i had to give them something i thought it would be enough but i realize now she wont stop dallas will keep searching keep digging until she finds you finds the rest she steadied nodded anja carvell has disappeared before i could make it impossible for her to find me but that wont do ill go to see her you cant for gods sake i can i must would you still protect me she said quietly kenneth i dont deserve you i never did ill speak with her explain how it was how you are she added i dont want you involved my dearest you cant stop what richard started a lifetime ago youre my friend and i intend to protect whats mine whatever the risk she added and her eyes hardened whatever the consequences o o there has to be more roarke ran his hand over eves naked ass well if you insist she lifted her head i wasnt talking about sex oh pity hed managed to peel the red dress off her again and then it had been a simple matter of one thing leading to another now she was sprawled over him all warm and loose but apparently she didnt intend to stay that way they all hated him she scooted up to straddle him and gave roarke a very pleasant view of slender torso and firm breasts or at least actively disliked him maybe feared him she considered nobody in that cast is particularly sorry to see him dead several of the actors had worked with each other before had histories links connections to draco to each other maybe it was more than one of them murder on the orient express whats that an asian transpo system no darling its yet another play by dame christie she seems to be popping up a man is murdered in his bed in the sleeping car of a train stabbed repeatedly among the passengers is a very clever detective not nearly as attractive as my cop he added what does a makebelieve dead guy on a train have to do with my case just enhancing your theory in this fictional murder there were a number of varied and seemingly unconnected passengers however our dogged detective refused to take such matters at face value poked around and discovered links connections histories disguises and deceptions he added when he did he discovered they all had motives for murder interesting who did it all of them when her eyes narrowed he sat up wrapped his arms around her each of them took a turn with the knife plunging it into his unconscious body in return for the wrong hed done to them pretty gruesome and pretty cagey no one could betray anyone else without betraying themselves they back up each others alibis play the role she murmured very nearly a perfect murder there are no perfect murders there are always mistakes with the murder itself the biggest of them spoken like a cop i am a cop and im going back to work she wiggled away slid off the bed and once again reached down for the dress you put that red number back on baby i wont be responsible for my actions simmer down im not strolling around naked you never know where summersets skulking she began pulling the dress up and glanced around the room i guess we should clean up some why because it looks like weve had a very enjoyable evening roarke finished this may shock you but summerset knows we have sex dont mention his name and sex in the same sentence gives me the creeps im going to grab a shower then work awhile all right ill join you uhuh im not showering with you ace i know your games i wont lay a hand on you he didnt say anything about his mouth o o what do you do take a pill limber refreshed and utterly satisfied roarke buttoned his shirt youre stimulation enough apparently he took her hand led her to the elevator requested her office the cat was stretched across her sleep chair and gave a twitch of his tail when they walked in coffee roarke asked yeah thanks the minute he turned toward the kitchen galahad leaped down and bolted into the room ahead of him eve heard the single demanding meow she sat at her desk stared at her computer tapped her fingers computer draco case file crossreference task find and list any and all connections professional personal medical financial criminal civil between cast members working i assumed you ran that already she glanced over as roarke came back with coffee im running it again with a few added details computer highlight any name with sealed files all areas that information requires authorization please submit same would you like me to get around that little hitch for you she made a low sound a definite warning roarke merely shrugged and sipped his coffee authorization code yellow slash dallas slash fiveohsix request from dallas lieutenant eve regarding double homicide you are authorized to flag sealeds authorization correct sealeds will be flagged data contained in sealed files requires warrant signed and dated for access did i ask you to access the data just flag the damned sealeds working multitask process will require approximately eight minutes thirty seconds then get started and no she said to roarke were not opening the sealeds my goodness lieutenant i dont believe i suggested anything of the kind you think you and mcnab scammed me on that warrant today i have no idea what youre talking about he eased a hip onto the desk i did give ian some advice but it was of a personal nature man talk yeah right she tipped back in her chair eyed him over her coffee cup you and mcnab sat around talking about women and sports i dont believe we got to sports he had a woman on his mind eves sneer vanished you talked to him about peabody damn it roarke i could hardly slap him back hes so pitifully smitten oh she winced dont use that word it fits in fact if he took my advice he turned his wrist glanced at the unit fastened there they should be well into their first date by now date date why did you do that why did you go and do something like that couldnt you leave it alone theyd have had sex until they burned out on it and everything would go back to normal he angled his head that didnt work for us did it we dont work together then when his eyes brightened with pure amusement she showed her teeth officially you start mixing cops and romance and case files and gooey looks at briefings youve got nothing but a mess next thing you know peabody will be wearing lip dye and smelly girl stuff and dragging body skimmers under her uniform she dropped her head in her hands then theyll have tiffs and misunderstandings that have nothing whatsoever to do with the job theyll come at me from both sides and before you know it theyll be telling me things i absolutely do not want to know and when they break it off and decide they hate each other down to the guts ill have to hear about that too and why they cant possibly work together or breathe the same air until i have no choice absolutely no choice but to kick both of their asses eve your sunny view on life never fails to lift my spirits and she poked him in the chest its all your fault he grabbed her finger nipped it not so gently if thats the case im going to insist they name their first child after me are you trying to make me crazy well darling its so easy i find it difficult to resist why dont you put the entire matter out of your mind before it gives you a headache your datas coming up she shot him one fierce look then turned to the screen connections within connections she thought as she scanned lives bumping up against lives and every time they did they left a little mark sometimes the mark was a bruise that never fully healed well well this didnt come up before michael proctors mother was an actress she had a small part in a play twentyfour years ago eve sat back and just look who was onstage with her draco stiles mansfield rothchild that correlates to the trouble between draco and stiles wheres anja carvell she murmured perhaps she had or has a stage name maybe no sealeds on proctors mother she ordered the computer to do a run on one natalie brooks interesting this was her last performance retired returned to place of birth omaha nebraska married the following year looks squeaky clean attractive she added when she ordered the computer to show her id picture from twentyfour years before young got a fresh sort of look right up dracos alley you think she might be anja maybe either way i cant see draco passing her up that adds another layer to michael proctor he didnt mention his mother knew draco he might not have been aware of it unlikely lets take a look at the flags hmm dracos got a few sealeds of his own money prominence connections roarke said it buys silence you ought to know she said it with a smirk then jerked up in her chair wait a minute wait a minute whats this carly landsdownes got a sealed more secrets more silence not this time i know this code its an old one it was in use when i went into the system a lot of the kids in state homes wanted that code more than they wanted to eat their next meal its the code for adoption sealed she added with the birth mothers data inside look at the date eight months after stiless assault on draco it wont be a coincidence this plays for me draco got anja carvell pregnant she tells him he dumps her dumps her hard she falls apart tries selftermination but stiles gets to her before shes finished she has a change of heart and decides to complete the pregnancy gives the kid away and pays a hefty fee for a seal it wouldnt have been easy eves eyes went flat its plenty easy for some kids are tossed aside every day to comfort her he put his hands on her shoulders rubbed by stiless account she was in love with the babys father and nearly destroyed by him yet she didnt terminate the pregnancy she gave the child up which is different eve than giving the child away she paid for the seal to protect the child it protects her too yes but there are other ways she could have sold the baby on the black market no questions asked she chose legal channels stiles knew shed have spilled it were going to have to have another chat now lets see which judge should i wake up for the warrant and authorization to crack the seal she looked up at roarke any suggestions lieutenant im sure you know best chapter sixteen before she roused a judge out of bed and risked irritating him she tried to tag peabody through her communicator off duty sheer shock glazed eves eyes at the blinking red light on her pocket unit what the hell does that mean why the nerve roarke clucked his tongue i bet shes got some insane idea that shes entitled to a life its your fault its your fault its your fault eve chanted under her breath while she sent the transmission to peabodys palm link after six beeps eve was up and pacing if she doesnt answer im going to abruptly eves desk link exploded with noise her angry yelp had the cat racing back into the kitchen peabody for gods sake where are you sir sir is that you i cant really hear over the music the audio might have been chaos but the video shimmered clear and gave eve a closeup view of her aide complete with fussy hair lip dye and slumberous eyes i knew it was all eve could think i just knew it youve been drinking i have the vague eyes blinked at the information then eve heard what could only be described as a giggle well maybe a couple im in a club and they have drinking here really rocking screamers is it morning already hey dallas mcnabs face pushed against peabodys so the two of them equally plowed by the look of things shared the screen this band is ice why dont you get your main squeeze and come on down peabody where are you im in new york city i live here drunk eve thought in frustration drunk as a station caspian colonist never mind take this outside before i go deaf what i cant hear you ignoring roarkes amused chuckle eve leaned into her link officer peabody go outside keep the transmission open i need to talk to you youre outside well hell come on in eve sucked in a breath go out side oh okay sure thing there was a great deal of fumbling more giggling bumpy views of a crowd of what eve decided were maniacs leaping and spinning as the band crashed out noise to her great pain she heard very clearly mcnabs hissed suggestion of what would be fun to do in one of the clubs privacy rooms you have to give him points for imagination roarke pointed out i hate you for this patience straining eve held the transmission while peabody and mcnab stumbled out of the club the noise level dropped but not by much apparently mcnabs choice of club was in the core of broadways neverending party district dallas dallas where are you your link peabody im on your link oh she lifted it again peered at the screen what are you doing in there have you got any soberup in your bag betcha you gotta be prepared right take some now aw peabodys cheerfully colored lips moved into a pout i dont wanna hey thats roarke i heard roarke hi roarke he couldnt resist and moved into view hello peabody youre looking particularly delicious tonight golly youre pretty i could just look at you and look at you and soberup peabody now thats an order damn peabody rummaged through her bag came up with the little tin if i gotta you gotta she said plucking out two pills before shoving the tin at mcnab why because oh peabody i need all current data on anja carvell all search and scan results kay shoot them to my car unit then i want you to meet me in uniform at kenneth stiless address thirty minutes understood yeah sort of could you repeat the question its not a question its an order eve corrected and repeated it got that now yeah um yes sir and leave your trained monkey at home sir mcnab eve snapped and cut transmission party pooper roarke murmured dont give me any lip she rose pulled her shoulder harness out of the desk drawer strapped it on go do some financial adjustments and point by point analyses darling you were listening im not laughing she told him and was annoyed because she wanted to stay out of trouble he only smiled waiting until he heard her jog down the stairs she was going to ease her way around the seal instead of breaking through it he thought there was no reason he should have the same limitations he strolled down the corridor to a private room his voice and palm prints were checked and verified the locks disengaged lights on he ordered full the room streamed with light blocked from the outside by the secured privacy screens on the bank of windows he crossed the wide squares of tile while the door behind him closed resecured only three people had entry to this room three people he trusted without reservation eve summerset and himself the slick black control panel formed a wide u the equipment unregistered and illegal hummed softly in sleep mode the wide eye of compuguard couldnt restrict what it couldnt see hed restructured most of his questionable holdings over the years after eve hed disposed of or legitimized the rest but he thought as he helped himself to a brandy a man had to have some small reminders of the past that made him and in his rebels heart the idea of a system like compuguard that monitored all computer business was an annoying pebble in his shoe he was honor bound to shake it out he stepped to the control swirled his brandy system up he ordered and a rainbow of lights bloomed over black now lets have a look o o eve left her vehicle in a secondlevel parking slot a half a block from stiless apartment shed walked half that distance when she spotted the figure trying to blend with the trees at the edge of the facing park trueheart sir she heard the squeak of surprise in his voice but hed schooled his face into calm lines by the time he stepped out of the shadows lieutenant report sir ive had the subjects building under surveillance since his return at eighteentwentythree my counterpart is surveilling the rear exit we have maintained regular communications at intervals of thirty minutes when she made no comment he cleared his throat subject lowered privacy screens on all windows at eighteenthirtyeight they have remained engaged since that time thats good trueheart gives me a really clear picture now tell me if hes in there lieutenant subject has not left the surveilled premises fine she watched a rapid cab swing toward the opposing curb peabody looking considerably more official in full uniform with her hair straight under her cap climbed out stand by officer trueheart yes sir sir id like to take this opportunity to thank you for this assignment eve looked up into his very young very earnest face you want to thank me for duty that has you standing out in the dark in the cold for she glanced at her wrist unit for approximately five and a half hours its a homicide investigation he said with such reverence she nearly patted his cheek glad youre enjoying it she headed across the street where peabody waited look me in the eye eve demanded im sober sir stick out your tongue why because you want to now stop sulking with this eve walked toward the building and no rolling your eyes at the back of my head peabodys eyes stopped in midroll am i to be informed of the reason ive been called back on duty youll be informed if all your surviving brain cells are in working order youll get the drift when i corner stiles ill fill in the blanks when were done she gave her badge and palm print to the night guard for verification got clearance eve ran it through quickly on the way up wow its like one of those daytime serials not that i watch them peabody said quickly when eves eyes slid coolly in her direction one of my sisters is addicted though shes totally hooked on the heart of desire see desires this small and charming seaside town but under the surface theres all this intrigue and dont really she hurried out of the elevator to prevent any possibility of a rundown of anything called the heart of desire she pressed the buzzer at stiless apartment held her badge up toward the security peep maybe hes asleep peabody said a few moments later hes got a house droid eve pressed the buzzer again and felt the ache of tension squeeze in her gut shed assigned a rookie a rookie for christs sake to surveillance on a lead suspect in two homicides because shed wanted to give the kid a break if stiles had slipped past him she had no one to blame but herself were going in she reached for her master code a warrant we dont need one subject is suspect dual homicide also potential victim theres reason to believe subject has fled or is inside unable to respond she bypassed the locks with her master draw your weapon peabody she ordered as she reached for her own go in high to the right ready peabody nodded her mouth might have been brightly painted but it was firm at eves signal they went through the door sweeping opposite directions eve ordered lights narrowed her eyes against the sudden flash of them scanned sweeping as she angled herself to guard peabodys back police kenneth stiles this is lieutenant dallas nypsd i am armed youre ordered to step out into the living area immediately she moved toward the bedroom as she spoke ears cocked for any sound hes not here every instinct told her the place was empty but she gestured peabody to the far side of the room check that area watch your back she booted open the door led with her weapon she saw a neatly made bed a tidy sitting area and the dark pool of the suit stiles had worn to the memorial service on the floor the droids here dallas peabody called out deactivated no sign of stiles hes gone rabbit goddamn it still she kept her weapon out and ready as she moved into the bath through the adjoining door one look at the dressing room had her bolstering it again i guess that lets trueheart off the hook she said to peabody when her aide joined her eve fingered a pot of skin toner then lifted a wig stiles is probably damn good with this stuff call it in peabody suspect in flight o o sir trueheart stood stiff as a petrified redwood in the entry to stiless dressing room his face was white but for the high color skimming along his cheekbones i take full responsibility for the failure of the assignment given to me i will accept without qualification any reprimand you deem appropriate first stop talking like that droid peabodys reactivating second youre not responsible for the flight of this suspect thats on me lieutenant i appreciate you taking my inexperience into consideration in my failure to perform my duty and complete this assignment in a satisfactory manner shut up trueheart jesus god spare her from rookies peabody come in here ive nearly got the droid up and running dallas peabody tell officer trueheart here how i deal with cops who botch assignments or fail to complete same in what i deem a satisfactory manner sir you bust their balls mercilessly it can be very entertaining to watch from a discreet and safe distance thank you peabody you make me proud trueheart am i busting your balls his flush spread ah no sir lieutenant then it follows that in my opinion you didnt botch this assignment if my opinion was otherwise youd be curled on the floor clutching said balls and begging for mercy which officer peabody has succinctly pointed out i do not have are we clear he hesitated yes sir thats the right answer she turned away from him studied the dressing area the forest of clothes in different styles and sizes the long wide counter covered with bottles and tubes and sprays cubbyholes loaded with hairpieces wigs drawers ruthlessly organized with other tools of the trade he can make himself into anyone i shouldve factored that in tell me who you did see leaving the building between eighteenthirty and when i arrived onscene well verify with the security discs from the exits but be thorough he nodded and his eyes unfocused with concentration a couple man and woman white and white thirtyfive to forty they hailed a rapid and headed east a single woman mixed race late twenties she left on foot in a westerly direction two men black and white early thirties they returned within thirty minutes carrying what appeared to be a twelvepack of beer and a large pizza a single man mixed race late forties some facial hair he stopped when eve held up a hand she lifted a small bag to show him a few strands of hair shed already sealed for evidence is this a color match he opened his mouth then closed it again to press his lips together its difficult to say with certainty lieutenant as the light was going but the subject in question appeared to have dark hair very similar in shade to the bagged evidence give me details height weight style of dress appearance she listened trying to paint a picture of the transformation from truehearts report okay anyone else he ran through the few people whod left the building but no one rang bells like the single mixedrace male was he carrying anything a bag a box a parcel no sir he didnt have anything with him okay then hes likely still running with the same look call it in sir call in your description trueheart add it to the allpoints his face lit up like a birthday candle yes sir o o it was blind luck that he was spotted eve would think about that later and for a long time after blind luck it was a twist of fate that the express running to and from toronto experienced a malfunction on its way into grand central the delay would make all the difference but when the break came eve jammed her communicator back in her pocket grand central lets move she was halfway to the apartment door when she shot a glance over her shoulder trueheart is there a reason youre not one step behind me sir when the officer in command says to move you get your bony butt in gear and move he blinked rapidly then appeared to process the information that she wanted him on the team a goofy smile spread over his face as he rushed to the door yes sir transit cops are blocking exits spreading to all gates backups on the way eve relayed the information as they headed down to street level suspects bought a oneway express to toronto its cold up there peabody flipped up the collar of her coat as they ran down the block to eves vehicle if i were fleeing the country id head south ive never been to the caribbean you can point that out to him when hes in lockup strap in she suggested when they dived inside she shot down the parking ramp like a rocket hit the sirens and did a screaming twowheel around the corner flopping in the backseat stomach at knee level trueheart was in heaven he was in pursuit not of a scrounging street thief not of a whiny traffic violation but of a murder suspect he gripped the chicken stick to keep his balance as eve wove fast and nervelessly through traffic he wanted to imprint every detail on his mind the wild speed the flash of lights the sudden jolt and jerk as his lieutenant god wasnt she amazing shot the vehicle into a fast vertical lift to bypass a jam on lexington he listened to peabodys clear practical voice as she coordinated with the backup on her communicator to eves low careless cursing as she was forced to swerve sharply to avoid a pair of fucking braindead morons on a scooter she squealed to a halt on the west side of the transpo center peabody trueheart with me lets see what the transit boys have for us there were two transit cops sealing the exit both came to attention when eve held up her badge status your suspects inside lieutenant level two area c there are a number of passengers in that area the express for toronto was sold out there are several shops eateries and rest room facilities men are posted at all lifts glides and walkways leading in or out of the area hes in there stand by she walked into the great sea of noise and movement lieutenant feeney and mcnab approaching south side of the building give them the target location we dont have data on weapons but we go in assuming hes armed she crossed the wide expanse of floor while people rushing home or away streamed past her alert the commanding officer were heading down captain stuart sir channel b on your communicator shes standing by captain stuart lieutenant dallas lieutenant we have our net in place traffic control center will continue to announce delays for the twelveohfive to toronto wheres my suspect stuarts face stayed blank and hard but her voice tightened weve lost direct visual of the subject he has not i repeat has not exited the patrolled area our security cameras are executing a full sweep well pick him up contact me this channel when you spot him eve said briefly inform your men that nypsd is now onscene and taking charge their full cooperation and assistance is appreciated this is my turf lieutenant my command target is suspected of two homicides on my turf captain thats an override and we both know it lets get the job done we can have a pissing contest later eve waited a beat were approaching level two please inform your men weapons are to be programmed to lowest setting and to be deployed only in extreme circumstances and for the protection of bystanders i want a clean snatch im fully aware how to perform an operation of this nature i was informed the target may be armed we cant confirm use caution and minimal force minimal force captain thats priority the area is packed with civilians ill maintain this channel for further communications eve tucked the communicator back in her pocket hear that peabody yes sir she wants the collar this evening the new york city transit authority led by captain stuart captured the primary suspect in richard dracos murder in flight pictures at eleven and what is our objective to identify restrain and incarcerate target in one piece and with no civilian injuries you following that trueheart yes sir eve noted the transit officers holding the perimeter of area c and the flood of people who milled loitered or rushed over the wide platform and through the snaking corridors that opened into shops and eateries she smelled the greasy aroma of fast food the hot scent of humanity babies were crying the latest urban rock was pumping out of someones tune box in direct violation of the noise pollution code a small band of sidewalk singers was struggling to compete she saw weariness excitement boredom on the sea of faces and with mild annoyance she saw a strolling pocketdipper snag a wallet trueheart youre the only one who got a look at him keep your eyes open we want to take this down smooth but we dont want to waste time the longer that express is delayed the more nervous stiles is going to get dallas feeney and mcnab at nine oclock yeah i see them she saw them the surging tide of civilians the dozens of byways this place is like an insect hive were going to spread out peabody troll the right trueheart take the left maintain visual contact she took the center cutting through the crowd eyes scanning across the tracks a southbound train shot down the tunnel with a hot whoosh of air a panhandler his beggars license smeared with something indefinable worked the passengers waiting for the delayed toronto express she was about to overlap with feeney shifted her gaze to lock peabodys position turned her head to lock truehearts she heard the shout a series of screams an explosion of glass as the panel on one of the busy storefronts shattered even as she spun she saw stiles shove his way through the panicked crowd pursued by a transit cop hold your fire she shouted it grabbing both weapon and communicator stuart order your man to cease fire target is cornered do not deploy weapons she was using elbows boots knees to fight her way through the surge of people fleeing the area someone fell against her all wild eyes and grabbing hands gritting her teeth she shoved him away bulled through an opening the next wave of people swarmed like bees screaming as windows on the storefronts spat glass she felt heat on her face something wet ran down her neck she saw stiles leap over the fallen and the cowering then she saw trueheart he had long legs and they moved fast eve used her own burst free out of the corner of her eye she saw a jerk of movement no hold your fire her shouted order was drowned out in the chaos even as she jumped toward the transit cop he shifted to shooting position and took aim at the same instant trueheart bunched for a leap and tackle the shock of the beam hit him midair turned his body into a missile that rammed hard against stiless retreating back the forward force sent them both tumbling off the platform onto the tracks below no goddamn it no she shoved the transit cop spun to the side and rushed to the edge of the platform hold all northbound trains there are injured on the track hold all trains oh jesus oh christ a tangle of bodies a splatter of blood she jumped down to the tracks feeling the shock sing up her legs her breath panted out as she searched for the pulse in truehearts throat goddamn it goddamn it officer down her voice cracked out of a dry throat and into her communicator officer down require immediate medical assistance grand central level two area c as in charlie deploy medivac units officer and suspect down hold on trueheart she yanked off her jacket spread it over his chest then used her hands to press down on the long gash running down his thigh feeney out of breath and sweating landed beside her ah christ how bad bad he took a hit jumped right into the fucking beam shed been a step too late one step too late then the fall we cant risk moving him without stabilizers where are the mts where are the fucking mts on the way here he unfastened his belt nudged her to the side and fastened a tourniquet stiles she ordered herself to maintain crabwalked to where stiles lay facedown checked for a pulse alive he didnt catch the hit and the way they went down it looked like the kid broke the worst of his fall your face is bleeding dallas i caught some glass thats all she swiped at the trickle with the back of her hand mixing her blood with truehearts when i get done with stuart and her hotshots she broke off looked back down at truehearts young pale face jesus feeney hes just a kid chapter seventeen eve burst through the emergency room doors in the wake of the gurney and fasttalking mts the words were like slaps hard and ringing under the barrage of them she heard something about spinal injuries internal bleeding when they hit the doors of an examining room an enormous nurse her skin a gleaming ebony against the pale blue of her tunic blocked eves path step aside sister thats my man down in there no you step aside sister the nurse laid a bouldersized hand on eves shoulder medical personnel only beyond this point youve got some pretty good facial lacerations there take exam four someone will be along to clean you up i can clean myself up that boy in there belongs to me im his lieutenant well lieutenant youre just going to have to let the doctors do what they do she pulled out a memo board you want to help give me his personal data eve elbowed the nurse aside moved to the observation glass but didnt attempt to push through again god she hated hospitals hated them all she could see was a flurry of movement green scrubs for the doctors blue for the nursing staff and trueheart unconscious on the table under harsh lights while they worked on him lieutenant the nurses voice softened lets help each other out here we both want the same thing give me what you can on the patient trueheart christ whats his first name peabody troy peabody said from behind her its troy hes twentytwo eve simply laid her brow against the glass shut her eyes and relayed the cause of injuries well take care of him the nurse told her now get yourself into four she swung through the doors became part of the blue and green wall peabody find his family have a couple of counselors contact them yes sir feeney and mcnab are monitoring stiles hes in the next room more gurneys were streaming in the injured at grand central were going to keep the er busy for the rest of the night with cuts bruises and broken bones ill inform the commander of the current status she stepped back from the glass so that she could give her report without wavering when she was done she took her position by the doors and called home roarke youre bleeding i im at the hospital where which one roosevelt listen im on my way no wait im okay ive got a man down a boy she said and nearly broke hes a goddamn boy theyre working on him i need to stay until i need to stay im on my way he said again she started to protest then simply nodded yeah thanks the nurse pushed back through the doors sent eve one smoking look why arent you in room four whats truehearts condition theyre stabilizing him hell be heading up to surgery shortly opsix ill get you to a waiting area after youre treated i want a full report on his condition you want it youll get it after youre treated o o the waiting was the worst it gave her too much time to think to replay to secondguess to spot every small misstep she couldnt sit she paced drank vile coffee and stared out the window at the wall of the next wing hes young healthy peabody said because she could no longer stand saying nothing that weighs on his side i shouldve sent him home i shouldve relieved him i had no business taking a rookie on this kind of operation you wanted to give him a break a break she spun around and her eyes were fierce brilliant with emotion i put his life on the line into a situation he wasnt prepared for he went down im responsible for that the hell you are peabodys chin lifted mutinously hes a cop when you put on the uniform you take on the risk hes on the job and that means facing the potential of taking a hit in the line of duty every day if id taken the left instead of the right id have done exactly what trueheart did and id be in surgery and it would seriously piss me off to know youre standing out here taking away from actions i took to do my job peabody eve broke off shook her head and walked back to the overburdened coffee machine well done roarke moved over rubbed a hand on peabodys shoulder youre a jewel peabody it wasnt her fault i cant stand seeing her take it on if she didnt she wouldnt be who she is yeah i guess im going to see if i can tag mcnab and get an update on stiless condition maybe you can talk her into taking a walk getting some air ill see what i can do he crossed to eve you keep drinking that coffee youll have holes in your stomach lining i could put my fist through youre tired lieutenant sit down i cant she turned saw the room was momentarily empty let herself crumple oh god she murmured with her face pressed to his shoulder he got this stupid grin on his face when i told him i was pulling him with me i thought i had him covered then everything went wrong people trampling people screaming i couldnt get through fast enough i didnt get to him in time he knew her well enough to say nothing just to hold on until she steadied herself i need to know something youve got strings here she said easing back pull a few would you and find out whats happening in surgery all right he took the recycled cup out of her hand set it aside sit down for a few minutes ill go pull those strings she tried to sit managed to for nearly a full minute before she was up and after the coffee again as she drew another cup a woman stepped into the room she was tall slim and had truehearts guileless eyes excuse me she looked around the room back at eve im looking for a lieutenant dallas im dallas oh yes i should have known troys told me so much about you im pauline trueheart troys mother eve expected panic grief anger demands and instead stared blankly as pauline walked to her held out a hand ms trueheart i very much regret that your son was injured in the line of duty id like you to know that he performed that duty in an exemplary fashion hed be so pleased to hear you say so he admires you a great deal in fact i hope it wont embarrass you but i think troy has a little crush on you instead of drinking the coffee eve set it down ms trueheart your son was under my hand when he was injured yes i know the counselors explained what happened ive already spoken with the patient liaison theyre doing everything they can to help him hell be fine she smiled and still holding eves hand drew her toward the seats in my heart id know if it was otherwise hes all i have you see eve sat on the table facing pauline as the woman lowered into a chair hes young and strong oh yes and a fighter hes wanted to be a policeman as long as i can remember it means so much to him that uniform hes a wonderful young man lieutenant has never been anything but a joy to me she glanced toward the doorway i hate thinking about him in pain ms trueheart eve fumbled tried again i dont believe he was in pain at least he was unconscious when i reached him thats good that helps thank you how can you thank me i put him in this position of course you didnt she took eves hand again you must be an excellent commanding officer to care so much my son wants to serve serve and protect isnt that right yes i worry its very difficult for those of us who love the ones who serve and protect but i believe in troy absolutely im sure your mother would say the same about you eve jerked back bore down on the ache that centered in her gut i dont have a mother oh im sorry well she touched eves wedding ring someone who loves you then he believes in you yeah eve looked over met roarkes eyes as he came in i guess he does ms trueheart roarke crossed to her ive just been informed that your son will be out of surgery shortly eve felt the quick light tremble of paulines fingers are you a doctor no im lieutenant dallass husband oh did they tell you how what troys condition is hes stabilized theyre very hopeful one of the surgical team will speak with you in a little while thank you they said there was a chapel on this floor i think ill sit there until theyre ready for me you look so tired lieutenant troy wouldnt mind if you went home and got some rest when she was alone with roarke again eve simply braced her elbows on her thighs and pressed the heels of her hands to her eyes tell me what you didnt tell her give it to me straight the spinal injury is giving them some concern is he paralyzed theyre hopeful its temporary due to swelling if it proves to be more serious there are treatments with high success rates he needs to be a cop can you get a specialist ive taken care of it she stayed in the same position rocked a little i owe you dont insult me eve did you see his mother see how she was how can anyone be that strong that brave roarke cuffed her wrists drew her hands down look in the mirror she shook her head its love with her shell will him to be safe and whole and happy because she loves him i think shell pull it off too mother love is a fierce and powerful force steadier she rolled her aching shoulders do you ever think of yours your mother he didnt answer immediately and the hesitation had her frowning at him i was going to say no he explained but that was kneejerk yes i suppose i do occasionally i wonder now and then what became of her and why she left you i know why she left me the steel was back in his voice in his eyes cold steel i held no particular interest for her i dont know why mine left me thats the worst of it i think the not knowing why the not remembering she hissed out a breath annoyed with herself and thats useless speculation i guess ive got mothers on the brain i need to talk to carly about hers she got to her feet shoved back the fatigue i want to check on stiless condition interview him if hes conscious im going to have to go into central file my report i have a meet with the commander first thing in the morning he rose as well her face was pale her eyes bruised the nicks and scratches on her face stood out like badges of honor you need to sleep ill catch some at central anyway as things stand it should be wrapped up in a few hours ill take some personal time when it is when it is lets take a few days you could use some sun ill think about it because they were alone she leaned forward to kiss him o o at oh seven ten eve stood in whitneys office he had her written report on disc and hard copy was listening to her oral followup the doctor over stiles estimates midday before he can be questioned at this point hes sedated his condition is stable officer trueheart remains in serious condition his lower extremities are not yet responding to stimuli and he has not at this point regained full consciousness i would like to recommend officer trueheart for a citation for his conduct his quick actions and disregard for personal safety were directly responsible for the apprehension of the suspect the injuries sustained by him during the operation were not due to any negligence on his part but on mine so you state in your written report i disagree with your analysis sir officer trueheart displayed courage and clear thinking under difficult and dangerous circumstances i dont doubt that lieutenant he leaned back youre admirably controlled in both your written and oral reports are you considering discussing the problems with the operation personally with captain stuart because if you are i will have to issue a direct order that you make no contact with captain stuart she is at this moment being reprimanded by her superiors you dont think thats enough he asked after a moment of thrumming silence its not for me to say admirably controlled he repeated she fucked it up through her disregard for your authority your orders the chain of command and all reasonable common sense she botched the entire situation is responsible for dozens of civilian injuries thousands in property damage offered the suspect the opportunity to flee and put one of my men in the hospital he leaned forward spoke through his teeth do you think i am not pissed you are admirably controlled sir he let out a short blast of sound that might have been a laugh did you advise captain stuart that you were in command that you were on the scene and had said scene under control that all weapons were to be set to low stun and there was to be no discharging of same without extreme circumstance yes sir i did captain stuart will be dealt with i promise you shell be lucky to work system control when the internal investigation is complete be satisfied with that truehearts twentytwo years old and it weighed on her like a stone on the heart im aware of that im aware of how it feels to have a man go down under your hand suck it in lieutenant and do the job sit down when she obeyed he set her written report aside whens the last time you got any sleep im all right when were done here youll take two hours thats an order anja carvell he began do you consider her an essential element in this case shes a loose thread any thread that isnt knotted off is an essential element and her alleged relationships to kenneth stiles and richard draco the number of connections crossed in this case result in too many triangles to be ignored it appears that stiles arranged for dracos murder and as a result linus quims however there are a number of others with motive and opportunity it isnt absolute that stiles acted more that he acted alone before i moved on him i was on the point of requesting a warrant to break the seal on carly landsdownes adoption take your two hours then try judge levinsky most judges are reluctant to open seals on private adoptions he may be your best bet particularly if you catch him after hes had breakfast o o she intended to follow orders finding a flat surface and sprawling over it would help clear her mind she closed the door to her office locked it then simply stretched out on the floor before she could close her eyes her palm link beeped yeah what good morning lieutenant no nagging she muttered and pillowed her cheek on her hand im lying down right now good roarke studied her face though youd be better off in a bed than on your office floor do you know everything i know you which is why i decided to contact you i neglected to pass on some information last night the name of the birth mother in carly landsdownes file whatre you talking about i told you to leave that alone i disobeyed ill look forward to you punishing me later its listed as anja carvell she gave birth at a private womans clinic in switzerland the adoption was preset and legal she was given the mandatory twentyfourhour period to withdraw her decision stuck with it and signed the final papers she listed the father as richard draco and included per law a sworn document that he had been informed of the pregnancy her decision to complete it and the adoption the document was verified by voluntary truth testing was he notified of the live birth yes the files complete and as efficient as one expects from the swiss he was aware he had a child a daughter mandatory dna testing verified he was the father he made no objections to the adoption she shifted to her back let the information slide into her brain the adoptive parents are entitled to all this information except for the names theyre given medical histories of the birth parents their cultural and ethnic backgrounds intellectual artistic technical skills all that can paint a pretty clear picture the adoptee is also entitled to all this data upon request including the legal names of the birth parents i didnt find any request for that data from the adoptee roarke told her there are ways around it carly could have known she could have put it together and suspected draco was her father theres physical resemblance if you know to look for it how much did she know youll find out get some sleep right remind me to slap you around later for electronic trespass im excited already she drifted off thinking of fathers and daughters of deceit and murder and woke with the old nightmare screaming in her throat her skin bathed with the sweat of it and a violent pounding in her head she rolled over pushed up to her hands and knees to struggle against the nausea it took her several trembling seconds to realize not all the pounding was in her head some of it was at her door yeah hold on damn it she rocked back to her heels forced herself to breathe she pushed to her feet braced a hand on the desk until her legs were steady again after flipping the locks she yanked open the door what you didnt answer the link peabody said in a rush her face was still flushed from the morning chill i was are you all right you look haunted she thought but followed instinct and amended the word out of it i was sleeping oh sorry peabody unbuttoned her coat in her latest attempt to lose weight shed taken to getting off the subway five blocks from central winter had decided to come back for another kick that morning i just got in and ran into the commander on his way out hes heading to the hospital trueheart she gripped peabodys arm did we lose him no hes conscious the commander said he surfaced about twenty minutes ago and heres the best part hes responding to stimuli theres no paralysis and theyve upgraded him to guarded condition okay the relief shuddered through her on bat wings okay good well stop by and see him when we go in to interview stiles the squads chipping in for a flower arrangement everybody likes trueheart all right put me down she sat behind her desk get me some coffee will you im punchy you didnt go home at all did you you said when you sent me off that you were going home i lied coffee ive got some information from an anonymous source were going over to reinterview carly landsdowne peabody sniffed and stalked over to the autochef i guess your aides not supposed to ask the name of the source my aides supposed to get me coffee before i bite her throat im getting it peabody muttered why carly at this stage of the investigation ive just verified richard draco was her father but they were a dozen emotions flew across peabodys face oh yuck in words of one syllable eve grabbed the coffee i want a formal request put in to judge levinsky to break adoption seal we have to make it official meanwhile she broke off when her desk link signaled an incoming homicide dallas lieutenant eve dallas eve studied the woman thats right lieutenant dallas my name is anja carvell id like to speak with you on a very important matter as soon as possible ive been looking for you ms carvell i thought you might be would it be possible for you to meet me at my hotel im staying at the palace popular spot ill be there twenty minutes thank you i think i can help you clear up a number of matters jeez peabody snagged her own coffee when eve broke transmission we look for her all over hell and back and here she just drops into our laps yeah nice coincidence eve shoved away from the desk i dont like coincidence o o to be opened in the event of my death yes that had a nice ring a dramatic touch one never wants to lose ones sense of style even under pressure particularly under pressure the pills are where they can be easily reached should they be needed a last resort of course but theyll be quick they ll be gentle do not go gentle into that good night well what the hell did he know if it comes down to death or prison death is preferable life is a series of choices one twists into the next and the path shifts it never really rides straight unless there are no joys no sorrows i would always prefer the road that wanders i made my choices for better or worse they were mine to make i take full responsibility for the results of those choices even richard draco no especially richard draco his life was not a series of choices but a compilation of cruel acts small and large everyone he touched was damaged somehow his death does not weigh on my conscience what he did knowingly deliberately viciously deserved extermination i only wish there had been pain great waves of pain huge sweeps of knowledge of fear of grief in that instant before the knife pierced his heart but in planning his execution i had selfpreservation in mind as well i suppose i still do should i be given the opportunity to do it over again i would change nothing i will not feign remorse for disposing of a leech i have some regret for luring linus quim to his death it was necessary and god knows he was an ugly coldhearted little man my choice could have been to pay him off but blackmail is a kind of disease isnt it once the body is infected by it it spreads and returns at inopportune moments why risk it still it brought me no pleasure to arrange his death in fact it was necessary to sedate my nerves and anxiety i made certain he felt no pain no fear but died with the illusion of pleasure but that i suppose doesnt negate the act of ending yet another life i thought i was so clever staging richards murder in front of so many knowing that all those surrounding him had reason to wish him harm there was such a whippy thrill at the idea of having the knife christine vole would plunge into the black miserable heart of leonard vole be a real one it was so beautifully apt i regret and apologize for causing my friends and associates any distress putting them even for the short term under any suspicion foolish of me foolish to have believed it would never go this far no one i told myself cared about richard his death would be mourned by no one who knew him except with crocodile tears turned to glimmer on pale cheeks for the audience but i miscalculated lieutenant dallas cares oh not about richard perhaps she has certainly unearthed enough truth about him by this time to stir her disgust but she cares about the law i believe its her religion this standing for the murdered dead i realized that very soon after looking into her eyes after all ive spent my life studying people measuring them mimicking them in the end ive done what i set out to do what i believe with all my heart and soul i had to do i have ruthlessly perhaps righted incalculable wrongs isnt that justice chapter eighteen anja carvell was beautiful with the curvy body style women sweat or pay for and men fall for her mouth was full sensuous and painted with the gleam of polished copper her skin had the delicate sheen of gold dust so that with the smoked red of her hair the tawny eyes she resembled a flame barely banked to simmer she sent eve a long level look shifted her gaze briefly to peabody then stepped back widening the door into her modest suite thank you for coming so quickly i realized after we spoke that i should have offered to come to you its no problem well youll forgive me i trust for not knowing the proper procedure in such matters as this my experience with people in your profession is severely limited ive ordered a pot of chocolate she gestured to the living area where a white pot and two matching cups sat on a low table would you care to join me its so cold and gloomy out ill just get another cup for your assistant dont bother eve heard and ignored peabodys soft windy sigh at her back you go ahead in that case shall we sit down anja led the way to the sofa smoothed her long bronze colored skirts then lifted the pot there was quiet music playing something with a bird trill of piano a squat vase of cabbage roses stood beside the lamp their fragrance and the womans perfumed the room it was eve thought a pretty and civilized scene i came to new york only last night anja began id forgotten how much i enjoy the city the rush and energy of it the heat of it even in this endless winter you americans fill all the spaces and still find more where did you come in from montreal she sipped her chocolate balanced the cup with the same female delicacy eve had often admired in mira lieutenant im afraid kenneth wasnt completely truthful with you during your discussion with him i hope you wont blame him for it he was thinking of me ms carvell i need your permission to record this conversation oh after one disconcerted blink anja nodded yes of course i suppose it must be done officially record on peabody as eve recited the standard rights and obligations anjas eyes widened with surprise then warmed again with what might have been amusement am i a suspect then its procedure for your protection do you understand the rights and obligations ive outlined for you yes you were quite clear ms carvell why did you come to new york from montreal yesterday kenneth kenneth stiles contacted me he needed to see me he was quite distraught and anxious he believes you think he killed richard draco lieutenant dallas such a thing is not possible and why is that kenneth is a kind and gentle man the kind and gentle man put richard draco in the hospital twentyfour years ago after a violent assault anja made an impatient sound and her cup clicked into her saucer the rashness of youth must a man be hounded by a single foolish act committed so long ago an act committed out of love and concern whatever we do follows us ms carvell i dont believe that im proof a life can be changed through will her hand curled tight a moment as if making a fist of that will lieutenant dallas when i saw kenneth last night he was frightened and upset i can swear to you he would never have called me if he had indeed done what you suspect he has done when did you see him last about eight oclock we met in a little club i believe it was called alley cat yes i know it we spoke over drinks it was then he told me hes given you my name that you would look for me in regard to my onetime relationship with richard her smile bloomed as beautifully as the roses beside her he wanted to warn me you see so that i could hide myself spare myself the discomfort of a meeting such as this i calmed him as best i could and told him i would speak with you he hasnt contacted you again no i hope to speak with him after were done here hope to be able to reassure him that you no longer believe he could have done this thing kenneth stiles attempted to leave the city last night eve watched anja carefully as she spoke when an attempt was made to detain him he fled and was injured during apprehension no no no anjas hand shot out gripped eve by the wrist injured how badly where have you taken him hes in the hospital his condition is stable his doctors expect a full recovery why ms carvell does an innocent man attempt to flee she released eves wrist rose to walk to the shielded window her hand pressed against her lips as if to hold words back then dropped to twist around the top button of her dress when she spoke again her voice wasnt so cool wasnt so steady oh kenneth perhaps youre right lieutenant perhaps what we do echoes back to us the whole of our lives he did it for me you see just as before she turned back stood framed by the gray sky there were tears glimmering in her eyes but they did not spill onto her cheeks will i be allowed to see him possibly ms carvell was kenneth stiles aware that you carried and gave birth to richard dracos child anjas head snapped back as if struck by eves fist rather than her words she gave a shaky laugh then composing herself she walked back to sit i see youre very thorough yes kenneth knew he helped me through a very difficult situation is he aware carly landsdowne is that child he would not have the name the childs parents gave her the files were sealed i told no one but the attorney who drew up the documents where the child was placed and with whom that is the point of sealed files lieutenant what does this child no she would be a young woman now have to do with this matter youve had no contact with carly landsdowne why would i ah you think im a liar or coldblooded anja topped off her cup of chocolate but she didnt drink her only outward sign of distress was the restless fingers at her throat i think im neither she said after a moment i discovered myself pregnant i was very young very much in love or what i perceived as love i gave myself to richard draco he was my first he enjoyed being the first i was not as careful with conception control as i should have been she gave a little shrug of the shoulder settled back being young and in love when i learned i carried richards child i was thrilled swept away with the romantic notion that we would marry he soon turned that thrill into despair there was no anger no passionate quarrel and certainly there were none of the tender words and promises i had so happily scripted for him to say to me instead he looked at me with disinterest a faint annoyance her eyes hardened her hand dropped once more into her lap i will never forget how he looked at me he told me it was my problem and that if i expected him to pay for a termination of the pregnancy i should think again i wept of course and pleaded he called me a few vile names claimed that my sexual skills had been mediocre at best and that he was bored with me he left me where i was on my knees weeping she sipped her chocolate again with no apparent distress you can understand i hope why i dont mourn his death he was quite the most detestable man ive ever known unfortunately at that point in my life i didnt see that so clearly i knew he was flawed she continued but with that blind and beautiful optimism of youth id believed until that moment when he turned from me that i could change him then you stopped believing it oh yes i stopped believing i could change richard draco but i thought i couldnt possibly live without him i was also very frightened barely eighteen pregnant alone i had dreams of becoming a great actress and these were dashed how could i go on she paused for a moment as if looking back were so dramatic at eighteen do you remember when you were eighteen lieutenant dallas how you believed somehow everything was acute vital and the world of course revolved around you ah well she shrugged again i tried to end my life i fumbled that thank god though i might have gotten it right if kenneth hadnt come if he hadnt stopped me gotten me help yet you didnt terminate the pregnancy no i had time to think to calm i hadnt thought of the child when i took the razor to my wrists only of myself it seemed to me that id been given another chance and the only way to survive now was to do what was right for the life id started inside me i might not have gotten through that without kenneth she shifted her eyes eloquent eyes to eves he saved my life and the life of the child he helped me find the clinic in switzerland and the child placement attorney he lent me money and a supporting arm hes in love with you yes her agreement was simple and sad my deepest regret is that i couldnt and cant love him back in the way he deserves his attack on richard all those years ago was an aberration and one that cost kenneth dearly and after you placed the child i got back to my life i never picked up that dream of becoming an actress again i didnt have the heart for it any longer as birth mother you have the right to make regular inquiries about the child you placed i never executed them i had done what was best for her best for myself she was no longer mine what interest could we have in each other she had an interest in richard draco carly landsdowne was onstage the night he was killed yes surprise consideration flashed over her face she is an actress here in new york well how many circles run within the circle of one life and she was in the play with richard and kenneth how strange and how apt eve waited watched you dont ask any questions about her lieutenant you want me to pretend some connection some spiritual bond your carly landsdowne is a stranger to me i wish her well of course but the link between us a tenuous and temporary one was broken years ago my only connection with those days is kenneth were you acquainted with areena mansfield slightly yes she was very promising even so long ago shes done quite well for herself hasnt she i believe richard toyed with her as well at some point why do you ask she was also in the cast natalie brooks natalie brooks a little smile curved her mouth there is a name i havent heard in many years yes i remember she had a small part in the play richard was in when he and i were lovers she was very young too pretty fresh in a country girl sort of way and of course easy prey he seduced her when he turned from me perhaps even before its difficult to know was she too in this play no but her son was dracos understudy fascinating her eyes danced with amusement please you must tell me who else eliza rothchild but yes a delightful woman so dignified and acerbic she had no tolerance for richard of course she was hardly his type and he took no pains to disguise that yes this is fascinating so many ghosts of the past moving like shadows on the stage and richard in the center where he liked it best i no longer follow theater but if id known i might have bought a ticket yes i might very well have paid to see that final performance youve had no contact with any of these people in the last twentyfour years but for kenneth no as ive already said i realize kenneth told you that he hadnt seen or spoken to me over the years didnt know where i was the lie was not for himself but for me and now that youve told me all who are involved it comes even more clear why he did so he would have worried that these ghosts would haunt me i assure you and will assure him they dont did he tell you that richard draco and carly landsdowne had been lovers the cup jerked to a halt before it reached her lips with her eyes on eves she lowered it slowly to the table what are you saying that your former lover and the child you made together were intimate they had a sexual affair that ended shortly before his death mother of god anja squeezed her eyes shut is this the payment for a small sin committed so many years ago youve disturbed me lieutenant she opened her eyes again and they were hard glinting if that was your purpose youve succeeded surely neither of them knew she rose prowled the room shes young attractive she asked with a glance back at eve yes very attractive he would find her hard to resist would see no reason to resist and he has always been able to lure women into bed she might have lured him knowing what woman chooses to sleep with her own father anja shot back her hands fisted her body trembled once as she spun around why would she have known the files were sealed seals crack eve said mildly any and all of the parties involved can request the file perhaps she was curious about who made her i would have been informed if a request was made and granted it is the law laws are broken thats why i have a job draco might have opened the file himself at this anja merely laughed a cold and brittle sound for what purpose he had no interest whatsoever at the time its unlikely he remembered a child existed after all these years there was a resemblance ms carvell she has his coloring the shape of his eyes his jaw so she drew a breath nodded ordered herself to sit again he might have looked at her and seen himself might have she murmured toying with her button again might have then taken her to his bed for some narcissistic thrill i cant say i cant tell you richard has become as much of a stranger to me as the young woman you speak of i dont know them kenneth stiles did eve watched the realization and the horror bloom on anjas face color rushed into her cheeks and just as quickly drained away again no whatever he knew or suspected he wouldnt have turned to murder i tell you the violence of twentyfour years ago was an impulse a rage of the moment you said that the affair had ended before richard was killed kenneth wouldnt have harbored violence he couldnt have maintained it maybe not maybe not without help where were you on the night of march twentyfifth ah i see i see she repeated softly and folded her hands i would have been at home and quite alone you saw no one spoke to no one during that evening not that i recall i have no proof that comes to mind that i was where i say i was your family ms carvell i have no one i can only swear to you that i did not travel from montreal to new york and conspire to cause richard dracos death she rose lieutenant i believe at this point i would like to consult an attorney i have nothing more to say on any of these matters until i have done so thats your right thank you for your cooperation record off peabody would you be so kind as to tell me which hospital is caring for kenneth id like to contact them and inquire about his condition hes at roosevelt eve got to her feet your attorney when you engage one can reach me at cop central very well anja walked to the door opened it good day lieutenant she said it quietly closed the door engaged the locks then covering her face with her hands she let herself weep o o impressions peabody shes cool sophisticated sure of herself she either believes stiles is innocent or is determined to protect him her concern about him came off as genuine to me she doesnt have a lot of concern left over to spare for carly eve frowned through the windscreen as she slipped behind the wheel of her vehicle should she well it just seems to me there should be some you know emotional connection why she conceived gestated delivered thats nine months out of her life wheres the emotional connection in that because the baby grew inside her she felt it kick and move around and i dont know dallas ive never conceived gestated and delivered im giving you my take thats all peabody shifted uneasily feeling out of her depth there was a darkness in the air swirling around eve she didnt know what to make of it she cut her eyes toward eve then away again eve was still staring out of the glass brooding if shes giving it to us straight peabody ventured she placed the baby then walked away i just dont buy it could be as cut and dried as easy as that i thought you were leading toward her being in on the murder i havent discounted it but shed let something slip because her own emotions had been rattled go back in find out when carvell registered if she prebooked and when shes scheduled to leave right with some relief peabody scurried out into the fresh air what sort of woman chooses to sleep with her own father eves stomach had been in knots since that question had been tossed at her what if there is no choice what then she let her head fall back there was another question what sort of man chooses to sleep with his own daughter that was one she had the answer to she knew that kind of man and he still whispered his candy breath in her ear what are you doing little girl the breath exploded out of her lungs she sucked it greedily back in what about the mother she asked herself and wiped her damp palms on the thighs of her trousers what made a mother she didnt believe it was the bulk of life stirring in the belly eve angled her head looked up toward the windows where anja carvell sat with her pot of chocolate and her ghosts no she didnt believe it was as simple as that there was more there had to be more most rational decent human beings would instinctively protect an infant a helpless child but the need to protect another adult stemmed from duty or love she straightened in her seat as peabody climbed back in she checks out called in yesterday after six requested a reservation she got into the hotel some time just before eight shes scheduled to leave tomorrow but arranged for an option to extend mother father devoted friend eve murmured lets move on to child carly were going to go right by a couple s crossing town maybe we could stop and get some hot chocolate that stuff they sell in those places is swill yeah but its chocolate swill peabody tried a pitiful pleading look you wouldnt let her give us any of the good stuff maybe youd like some cookies too or little frosted cakes that would be nice thanks for asking that was sarcasm peabody yes sir i know responded in kind the easy laugh had the black cloud lifting because it did eve pulled over at a crossstreet and waited while peabody ran in and loaded up you know im really trying to cut down on this stuff but peabody ripped into the pack of cookies thing is weird mcnab doesnt think im chubby and when a guy sees you naked he knows where the extra layers are peabody do you have some delusion that i want to hear how mcnab sees you naked she crunched into a cookie im just saying anyway you know we have sex so youve probably reached the conclusion were naked when were having it you being an ace detective and all peabody in the chain of command you may on rare occasions and due to my astonishing good nature respond to sarcasm with sarcasm you are not permitted to lead with it give me a damn cookie theyre coconut crunchies you hate coconut then why did you buy coconut to piss you off grinning now peabody pulled another pack of cookies from her bag then i bought chocolate chip just for you well hand them over then okay so peabody ripped open the second pack offered eve a cookie anyway mcnabs got a little bitty butt and hardly any shoulders still stop stop right there if i get an image of a naked mcnab in my head youre going back to traffic detail peabody munched hummed waited damn it there he is hooting with laughter peabody polished off the last cookie sorry dallas im sorry i couldnt help it kinda cute isnt he and she thought it had bumped whatever had been troubling her lieutenant out of the way button it up eve warned but she had to swallow a chuckle along with her cookie brush the crumbs off your shirt and try to find your dignity somewhere she pulled to the curb in front of carlys building the highend neighborhood the exclusive building the plush lobby sent a different signal to eve now anja carvell had selected wealthy parents for the child the kind of parents who could assure the child would grow up with privilege security luxuries had she taken as much care in researching the kind of people they were stable loving wise supporting peabody we did the run on carly landsdownes educational history it was private schools right yes sir i believe so to verify peabody pulled out her ppc as they entered the lobby elevator private and top rated preschool through college they sprang for a bunch of extras including drama dance music voice all private tutors what do the parents do fathers a doctor microsurgeon mothers a travel agent her own company but she filed as professional mother from until the full twenty years allotted per child no siblings none she picked winners she was careful it mattered she said to herself as she stepped out and walked to carlys door it took two long buzzes before the door opened heavyeyed her hair sleeptumbled carly gave a careless yawn what now a moment of your time at dawn its after nine i repeat at dawn then she shrugged stepped back dont ask me anything until i get a cup of coffee that should be added to those rights and obligations youre so fond of spouting cranky peabody whispered as carly strode away eve scanned the room listened to the beep of the autochef then tried not to let her mouth water when she caught the scent of rich and real coffee i saw you at richards memorial yesterday carly said as she breezed back in her robe slipped silkily off one shoulder as she sat crossed long bare legs you do get around some of the matters im here to discuss with you are of a personal nature you might want to ask your companion to leave my companion two wineglasses eve pointed out with a nod at the low table crushed pillows on the end of the sofa she reached under one tugged out one sheer leg of black hose undergarments in unusual places so your clever deductive powers lead you to the correct conclusion that i had sex last night she shrugged and her robe slid down a little lower why do you think hes still here because you were having sex this morning before i so rudely interrupted that little mating bite on your necks very fresh ah she sighed with a sound of amusement i suppose he was feeling a little frisky why dont you come on out sweetheart she lifted her voice and kept her eyes on eve lieutenant dallas has spoiled the moment anyway a door creaked open there was the hesitant pad of bare feet on the floor rumpled and flushing michael proctor stepped into the room chapter nineteen ah he cleared his throat tried to find something to do with his hands and ended up letting them dangle from his arms at his sides he was rumpled wrinkled and had misbuttoned his shirt good morning lieutenant carlys long delighted roll of laughter filled the room oh michael do better at least try to look satisfied and defiant instead of embarrassed and guilty shes not the morals police carly her name was a vocal wince she waved a hand go get yourself some coffee youll feel better um can i get anyone anything isnt he sweet carly beamed like a proud mother over a wellmannered child go on darling she turned back to eve as michael shuffled from the room her expression transformed like a mask removed from silk to steel i believe sex between consenting adults is legal in this state so shall we move on how long have you and michael been lovers carly examined her nails picked idly at a minute chip in the polish since you tell me its after nine for about twelve hours im afraid i cant give you the exact time the act was consummated i wasnt wearing my wrist unit you want points for attitude eve said evenly fine with me we can take this down to central and see whos the biggest hardass or you can give me straight answers on how michael proctor ended up sharing your bed this morning carlys lips twisted but the idea of a session at cop central had her reaching for control we ran into each other at the memorial ended up going out for a drink came back here one thing led very enjoyably to another is there a problem with that bury one lover pick up a fresh one that might be a problem for some people temper flashed into carlys eyes but she kept her voice level save your narrowminded view for someone whos interested it happens that michael and i have a great deal in common some chemistry stirred and we acted on it above that i like him very much one of the things you have in common is richard draco true enough but richards dead were not michael walked slowly back in carly would you like me to go not on my account she patted the cushion beside her sit down it was as much a challenge as a request when he sat she gave a pleased smile hooked her arm through his so lieutenant you were saying michael you didnt mention your mother knew richard draco the cup jumped in his hand sloshed coffee on his slacks my mother what does she have to do with it she worked in a play with draco your mothers an actress carly angled her head she was she retired years ago before i was born he set his cup down rubbed ineffectually at his slacks leave my mother alone she hasnt done anything did i say she had nerves eve thought he couldnt keep his hands still for them you know then that she had been intimate with draco at one time it was nothing it was years ago your mother and richard carly drew back to study his face oh sticky and there was sympathy in her eyes dont let it rattle you sweetie but it had obviously look she had a bit part thats all she wasnt a serious actress she told me she and my father have been together ever since she wouldnt have told me except she knew i admired him that i was going to audition for his standin he used her he liked using women he looked steadily at carly now she got over him smart women do his mother eve decided or maybe women in general was his weak spot yeah he liked using women young pretty women they were toys to him and he got bored with his toys fairly quickly your mother gave up her career her hopes for it because of him maybe michael blew out a breath maybe that was part of it but she made a new life shes happy in it he hurt her yeah his gaze flashed up ripe with bitterness yeah he hurt her you want me to say i hated him for it maybe i did on some level michael dont say any more carly warned the hell with that his voice took on conviction as well as anger shes talking about my mother she wasnt some cheap tramp some toy he picked up then tossed aside she was a nice naive girl he took advantage of that of her did he give her illegals michael eve asked did he give her a taste for them no he tried the son of a bitch michael you dont have to answer her questions im going to straighten this out right now heat rolled off him in violent waves she told me that she came into the room and he was putting drops of something in her drink she asked him what it was and he just laughed he said my mother doesnt use hard language but she told me exactly what he said it would make her fuck like a rabbit muscles quivered in his jaw as he stared at eve she didnt even know what it meant but i knew when she told me i knew the bastard tried to slip her wild rabbit but she didnt drink it no it scared her she told him she didnt want anything to drink and thats when he got mad he called her names tried to make her drink it she realized then what kind of man he was and she ran she was crushed disillusioned she went back home she told me that was the best thing that ever happened to her going home he didnt even remember her michael added he didnt even have the decency to remember her name you spoke to him about her i wanted to see how hed react he didnt even pretend to remember she meant nothing to him no one did did you tell him remind him no he deflated the heat evaporating no i didnt see the point and if id pushed it id have lost the job dont dont let it hurt you eves eyes narrowed in speculation as carly slipped her arms around him soothed they stayed narrowed and cool when carly shot her a burning glare leave him alone do you get your kicks picking on people weaker than you its what gets me through the day youre not weak eve thought did the people who made you form you she wondered or the people who raised you it must have been hard on you michael knowing all that and seeing draco day after day i had to put it out of my mind i couldnt change what had happened could i he gave a shrug that tried to be defiant and nothing i could do would make any difference and one day id step out onstage in his place and id be better that would be enough youve got that chance now dont you a chance to stand in his light a chance to be with one of his lovers his tightly compressed lips trembled apart carly it wasnt like that i dont want you to think of course it wasnt she put a hand over his the lieutenant has a foul mind ms landsdowne carly ignored eve for a moment and laid gentle kisses on both of michaels cheeks youve spilled your coffee why dont you go back and get us both a fresh cup yeah all right he got to his feet my mother is a wonderful woman of course she is carly replied when he went back into the kitchen she turned to face eve fully i dont like seeing michaels vulnerabilities exploited lieutenant the strong are supposed to protect the weak not kick them in the face maybe youre not giving him enough credit for spine eve moved over eased down on the arm of a chair he defended his mother very well for some family ties are the strongest you didnt mention you were adopted ms landsdowne what confusion clouded her eyes for heavens sakes why should i have i dont remember it half the time what business is that of yours it was a private adoption at birth yes my parents never hid it from me neither was it made a particular issue in our home did they give you the details of your heritage details medical history ethnicity of course i was told my birth mother arranged for my placement because she wanted the best for me and so on and so forth whether that was true or not never mattered i had my mother she paused then asked are you speculating that my mother had a relationship with richard at one time she let out a rolling laugh and shook back her cloud of tousled hair i can assure you she didnt my mother never met richard draco she and my father have been happily married for nearly thirty years before i was born she was a travel agent not an actress you were never curious about the woman who gave you up not particularly i have wonderful parents whom i love and who love me why should i wonder about a woman whos nothing but a stranger to me like mother like daughter eve thought many adoptees want contact want answers even a relationship with their birth parents i didnt dont there was no hole in my life to fill im sure my parents would have helped me find her if id asked if id needed that i didnt and it would have hurt them she said quietly i would never hurt them how is this relevant do you recognize the name anja carvell no she stiffened slightly are you telling me thats the name of the woman who placed me i didnt ask for a name i didnt want a name you have no knowledge have had no contact with a woman by that name no and i dont want any carly got to her feet youve no right to do this to play with my life this way you never asked about your birth father goddamn it if shes nothing to me hes less than nothing a lucky sperm you wanted a rise out of me you got one now what does this have to do with richard dracos death eve said nothing and in the silence she watched denial disbelief then horror flash into carlys eyes no thats a lie a revolting vicious lie you hideous bitch she grabbed the little pot of violets on the table heaved them to shower glass and petals down the wall its not true its documented eve said flatly richard draco was your birth father no no carly sprang at eve shoved her roughly against a table and upended a lamp the china exploded like a bomb before peabody could intervene eve signaled her back and took the hard slap to the face without attempting to block take it back take it back she shouted it tears spurting out of her eyes her beauty was stark now white face dark eyes she grabbed eves shirt shook then with a moan collapsed on her oh god oh my god carly michael bolted in from the kitchen one look at his face told eve hed listened hed heard when he rushed to carly tried to turn her into his own arms she shoved away crossed her arms defensively over her breasts dont touch me dont touch me like a candle burned to wax she slid to the floor in a shuddering puddle peabody take michael back into the kitchen he stepped back stared at eve it was cruel what you did cruel he walked toward the kitchen with peabody behind him eve crouched she could still feel the heat from the crack of carlys hand across her face but her gut was iced over im sorry are you yes carly lifted her face and her eyes were ravaged i dont know who i loathe more at this moment myself or you if you were unaware of your blood tie to him you have nothing to loathe yourself for i had sex with him i put my hands on him allowed him to put his on me can you conceive how that makes me feel how dirty that makes me feel oh god yes she was suddenly and brutally tired she fought off her own demons and stared into carlys eyes he was a stranger to you carlys breath hitched he knew didnt he it all makes such horrible sense the way he pursued me the way he looked at me the things he said were two of a kind he told me and he laughed she gripped eves shirt again did he know i cant tell you im glad hes dead i wish id killed him myself i wish to god almighty it had been my hand on the knife ill never stop wishing that o o no comments peabody no sir they rode down in the elevator with peabody looking straight ahead there was an ache churning pulsing swelling in every part of her body you didnt like the way i handled that its not for me to say lieutenant fuck that all right i dont understand why you had to tell her its relevant eve snapped every connection matters you punched her in the gut with it so now its my method that doesnt meet your standards you asked peabody shot back if she had to be told i dont see why you shoved it in her face the way you did why you couldnt have found a way to soften it soften it her father was fucking her you tell me how you soften that you tell me how you put that in a pretty box with a bow on it she turned on peabody and like carrys eves eyes were ravaged what the hell do you know what do you know about it with your big sprawling happy freeager family where everybody gathers around the dinner table with clean faces and chirpy news of the day she couldnt breathe couldnt draw in enough air she was strangling but she couldnt stop the words when daddy came in to kiss you good night he didnt crawl into bed with you did he and put his sweaty hands all over you fathers dont jam themselves into their little girls in your tidy world she strode off the elevator through the lobby and out to the street while peabody stood stiff with shock eve paced the sidewalk barely restrained herself from kicking the duet of white poodles and the droid that walked them a headache was raging a rocket blast that screamed inside her skull she could feel her hands tremble even though they were balled into tight fists in her pockets dallas dont she warned peabody keep back a minute she could walk it off she promised herself she could walk off the leading edge of the fury that made her want to scream and pound and rip and when she had all that was left was the headache and the sick misery deep in her gut her face was pale but composed when she walked up to peabody my personal remarks were over the line i apologize for them its not necessary it is in my opinion it was also necessary to be cruel up there it doesnt make me feel any better about it but youre not here to be a punching bag for my foul moods thats okay im kind of used to it peabody tried a smile then gaped with horror when eves eyes filled oh jeez dallas dont shit i need some time she bore down stared hard at the face of the building im taking a couple of hours personal time grab some public transpo back to central her chest wanted to heave to throw the tears up and out ill meet you at roosevelt in two hours all right but two hours eve repeated and all but launched herself into the car she needed to go home she needed to hold on and to go home not trusting herself she set the car on auto and rode with her head back and her hands balled in her lap from the age of eight shed built a wall or her subconscious had mercifully built one for her to block out the ugliness that had happened to her it left a blank and on that blank shed created herself piece by painful piece she knew what it was to feel that wall crumble to have the cracks form so the ugliness oozed in she knew what carly faced and what she would go through to live with it the headache kicked like a tornado inside her skull by the time she drove through the gates her eyes were glazed with it with the greasy churn of nausea in her belly she ordered herself to hold on to hold it in and staggered up the steps lieutenant summerset began when she stumbled inside dont mess with me she tried to snap it out but her voice wavered even as she bolted upstairs he moved to the house intercom she wanted to lie down shed be all right if she could just lie down for an hour but the churning defeated her she turned into the bathroom went down on her knees and was vilely ill when she was empty too weak to stand she simply curled on the tiles she felt a hand on her brow cool blessedly cool and opened her eyes roarke leave me alone not in this lifetime she tried to turn away from him but he slipped his arms under her sick yes baby i know she felt fragile as glass when he lifted her carried her to bed she began to shiver as he drew off her boots covered her with a blanket i wanted to come home he said nothing only got a damp cloth and bathed her face she was too pale the shadows under her eyes too deep when he held a glass to her lips she turned her face away no no soothers no tranqs its for the nausea here now he brushed her damp hair back and hoped he wouldnt be forced to pour it down her throat thats all i promise she drank because her stomach was quivering again and her throat felt as if it had been raked by claws i didnt know you were here she opened her eyes again and the tears that burned in her chest flooded into her eyes roarke oh god she pressed herself against him burrowed as her body shook he tightened his arms around her get rid of it he murmured whatever it is let it go i hate what i did i hate myself for doing it ssh whatever it was you wouldnt have had a choice i should have found one she turned her head so that her cheek rested against his shoulder and with her eyes closed she told him everything i know what went through her she was better now the worst of the sickness eased i know what she felt and i saw myself in her when she looked at me eve no one knows better than you or i what vileness there is in the world you did what you had to do i couldve no he leaned back cupped her face so that their eyes met there wasnt pity in his which she would have hated there wasnt sympathy which would have scraped her raw there was simply understanding you couldnt have not you you had to know didnt you you had to be sure if shed known who he was to her now you do yeah now i do no ones that good an actress shell see herself again and again together with him over and over stop you couldnt have changed that no matter how she found out maybe not she closed her eyes again sighed i swiped at peabody shell get over it i came close to losing it right out on the street i nearly but you didnt he gave her a little shake before she could speak again you irritate me eve why must you beat yourself up like this you havent slept in over thirty hours youve entered into a phase of this investigation that hits so close to a personal horror most people would run away or shatter youve done neither i broke no eve you chipped he pressed his lips to her forehead then you came home lie down for a bit close your eyes turn it off i shouldnt have told you to leave me alone i didnt mean it it hardly matters the innate arrogance in his voice nearly made her smile i wouldnt have i wont i know i wanted you to be here she slid into him before he could nudge her back i needed you to be and you were her mouth turned to his seeking roarke you need to sleep im empty and it hurts her hands roamed up his back kneading fill me with something please love filled the voids and hollows no matter how deep no matter how wide he would give it to her take it for himself with patience with tenderness his lips brushed hers settled sank until he felt hers warm and yield gathering her he trailed kisses over her face her hair her throat first to comfort she turned into him offering more but his hands were light as wings floating over her slipping under her shirt to her flesh with long slow strokes then to soothe and when she sighed when her body melted back against the pillows he undressed her his lips followed the trace of his fingers gently stirring pulses now to arouse she opened for him as she never had for anyone else for him she could lay herself bare body heart and mind and know and trust he would do the same without heat or demands or urgency he nudged her up let her linger on the crest slide over until her system glowed with the pleasure of belonging her heart swelled matched its beat to his and her arms wrapped around him like ribbons to draw him close i love you he watched her face as he slipped inside her completely endlessly her breath caught sighed out again she closed her eyes to hold on to the beauty of the moment and let him bring her home o o she held him close needing for just a bit longer to have his body pressed so intimately to hers thanks i hate to state the obvious but it was my pleasure better now a lot roarke no just stay like this a minute she kept her face turned into his shoulder when were together like this its not like its ever been with anyone else its like there never was anyone else for me either she laughed relieved that she could youve had a lot more anyones whos counting he shifted rolling over so that she ranged over him the fragility was gone he noted there was the smooth and agile flow to her movements that characterized her her cheeks were no longer pale but her eyes were heavy bruised exhausted it made him regret not pouring a tranq into her after all cut it out she scooped her hair back and nearly managed a scowl cut what out thinking about fussing over me you dont have to take care of me she didnt need the amused glint in his eyes to tell her how ridiculous that sounded under the circumstances all the time she amended lets take a nap i cant i dont imagine you can either ive already messed up your day you were probably buying a solar system or something only a small largely uninhabited planet its not going anywhere i can use a break and you need to sleep yeah i do but i cant eve look ill catch some downtime soon youre one to talk you havent had much more than me lately our engines dont run at the same speed that stopped her from her slide off the bed what the hell does that mean just that she frowned considered it sounds like something that ought to piss me off but i cant figure out exactly why when i do i might have to pop you one ill look forward to it if you wont sleep eat you need something in your stomach and what are you grinning at you youre such a wife she said as she headed toward the shower he sat for a minute stunned now im pissed off see now you know how it feels well order me something to eat she called out water on one hundred and two degrees bite me he muttered and ordered her some soup with a highprotein additive o o she ate every drop as much to please him as to kill the hunger her mind clear again she dressed strapped on her weapon i have to go by the hospital see what i can get out of stiles why youve already figured it out when she just stared at him he shrugged i know you lieutenant you let it churn around while you were eating settle into place now youre revving up to finish it i havent filled all the gaps yet i want to cover a few more bases and i need to run something by whitney it sort of involves you and what might that be she shook her head if he doesnt clear it it wont matter ill be able to reach you right if i need to talk to you before i get back ill be available i thought id bake some cookies the dry tone had her snorting as she picked up her jacket you do that honey she turned to kiss him then yelped when he twisted her earlobe hey dont work too hard darling man pouting she rubbed her ear as she walked to the door if i did that every time you used the w word you wouldnt have any ears left she stopped at the door looked back but youre beautiful when youre angry she said and fled o o peabody stood outside the hospitals main doors shoulders hunched against the brisk wind nose red from it why the hell didnt you wait inside eve demanded its freezing out here i wanted to catch you before you went in can we take a minute eve studied peabodys set and serious face personal business she decided not official well she deserved it all right lets walk keep the blood moving she headed away from the ramps and glides as sirens announced another unlucky resident of new york was about to enjoy the buildings facilities about before peabody began look i was out of line and you were the closest target im sorry about it no thats not what i mean i figured it out took me a while she added what you did telling her cold like that was because you had to see how shed react if she knew draco was her father well it bumped up her motive either way if she knew it before they you know or if she knew it after they got going it went to her frame of mind eve watched a medivan whip past she didnt know i dont think so either if youd eased her into it it wouldve given her time to think to figure out how best to react what to say i shouldve known that right off instead of working around to it an hour later i could have clued you in before we got there with a shake of her head she turned around started back i hadnt settled myself into it yet it was a hard thing to do i dont think idve had the guts for it it has nothing to do with guts yeah it does peabody stopped waited for eve to turn to face her if you didnt have feelings it wouldnt have been hard but you do guts can be the same thing as mean without compassion it was hard but you did it anyway a better cop would have realized that quicker i didnt give you much of a chance since i was busy jumping down your throat you worked it out came around to it on your own i must be doing something right with you so are we square now yeah all four corners good lets get inside im freezing my ass off chapter twenty they went by to see trueheart first at peabodys insistence they stopped off in the shopping mall for a getwell gift itll take five minutes weve chipped in on the flowers already the forest of goods the wide and winding trails that led to them and the chirpy voices announcing the sales and specials caused eves already abused stomach to execute a slow anxious roll shed rather have gone handtohand with a threehundredpound violent tendency than be swallowed up in a consumer sea thats from everyone peabody explained patiently thisll be from us despite herself eve stopped at a display of dull green surgical scrubs brightly emblazoned with the hospitals logo for ten bucks extra you could have one splattered with what appeared to be arterial blood its a sick world just sick were not going for the souvenirs though she thought the oversized anal probes were kind of a hoot when a guys in the hospital he wants toys when a guy gets a splinter in his toe he wants toys eve complained but followed peabody into a game shop and resigned herself to having her senses battered by the beeps crashes roars and blasts here according to the flashing signs you could choose from over ten thousand selections for your entertainment leisure or educational desires from sports to quantum physics programs and everything in between you had only to key in the topic of your interest and the animated map or one of the fully trained and friendly game partners would direct you to the correct area the store menu pumped out screaming yellow light eve felt her eyes cross the clear tubes of the sample booths were all loaded with people trying out demos others trolled the store proper their faces bright with avarice or blank from sensory overload dont these people have jobs eve wondered we hit lunch hour well lucky us peabody made a beeline for the combat section handtohand she decided itll make him feel in control wow look its the new super street fighter its supposed to be majorly mag she flipped the antitheft box over winced a little at the price then noted the manufacturer roarke industries we oughta get a discount or something oh well its not so bad when you split it she headed toward the autoexpress checkout glanced back at eve i guess roarkes got a whole factory full of these huh probably eve pulled out her credit card swiped it through the scanner pressed her thumb to the identiplate thank you for your purchase eve dallas one moment please while your credit is verified ill give you my half on payday okay yeah whatever why do these things take so long thank you for waiting eve dallas the cost of your selection super street fighter ppc version comes to one hundred and sixteen dollars and fiftyeight cents including all applicable taxes due to authorization one your account will not be debited for this selection please enjoy your day what the hell are you talking about whats authorization one authorization one roarke industries this level entitles you to select any items under this manufacturers brand at no cost wow we can clean house peabody turned her dazzled eyes to the shelves crammed with delights can i get one of these shut up peabody look im paying for this she told the machine so just bypass authorization one and debit my account unable to comply would you care to make another selection damn it she shoved the game at peabody hes not getting away with this peabody had the wit to run the box through security release then jogged to catch up with eve listen since were here anyway couldnt i just have one no but no eve gave the glide one quick badtempered kick then got on to ride to medical level most women would be happy if their husbands gave them blank shopping credit im not most women peabody rolled her eyes youre telling me peabody might have sulked over the loss of her own imaginary game collection but truehearts pleasure in the gift outweighed greed this is great it just came out he turned the box over in his good hand his other arm was cased in a plasticast to knit the bone that had snapped in his fall there was a collar of the same material around his neck an iv drip in his wrist and a brutal bruise that crept over his shoulder and showed purple and black against the sagging neck of his hospital shift his left leg was slightly elevated and eve remembered how his blood had pumped out of the gash there and onto her hands machines hummed around him all eve could think was if she were in his place she wouldnt be so damn cheerful she left the small talk and conversation to peabody she never knew what to say to hospital patients i dont remember much after i took the hit he shifted his eyes to eve commander whitney said we got him yeah this at least was her element you got him hes down on the next patient level well be questioning him after we leave here you did the job trueheart he might have gotten by us if you hadnt reacted fast and taken him down the commander said you put me up for a commendation like i said you did the job i didnt do much he shifted trying to find a more comfortable position i would have taken him down clean if that triggerhappy asshole transit jerk hadnt blasted off thats the spirit the triggerhappy asshole and his moronic superior are going to get kicked around plenty wouldnt have happened if theyd listened to you you had it under control if id had it under control you wouldnt be here you took a mean hit and a bad fall if youre feeling shaky over it you should see the department counselor im feeling okay about it i want to get back in uniform back on the job i was hoping when you close the case youd let me know the details sure ah lieutenant i know youve got to get going but i just wanted to say i know you saw my mother the other night yeah we ran into each other shes a nice woman isnt she great his face lit up shes the best my old man ditched us when i was a kid so weve always you know taken care of each other anyway she told me how you hung around waited until i was out of surgery and all you went down under my watch your blood was on my hands she thought well it meant a lot to her that you were here i just wanted to tell you that so thanks just stay out of laser streams she advised o o down on the next level kenneth stiles stirred in his bed glanced toward the nurse who checked his monitors i want to confess she turned to him smile bright and professional so youre awake mr stiles you should take some nutrition now hed been awake for a considerable amount of time and thinking i want to confess he repeated she walked to the side of the bed to pat his hand do you want a priest no he turned his hand over gripped hers with a strength she wasnt expecting dallas lieutenant dallas tell her i confess you dont want to get overexcited find lieutenant dallas and tell her all right dont worry but in the meantime you should rest you took a nasty fall she smoothed his sheets satisfied when he settled closed his eyes ill go see about your nutrition requirements she notated his chart and slipped out she paused by the uniformed guard at the door hes awake from her uniform pocket she took out her memo pad and informed nutrition that patient k stiles room required his midday meal when the guard started to speak the nurse held up a hand just a minute i want to get this in so they get it up here before midnight nutritions been running behind all week since the patient had neglected to fill in his lunch choices from the authorized menu she ordered him a grilled chicken breast mixed rice with steamed broccoli a whole wheat roll with one pat of butter substitute skim milk and blueberry jello that should be up within the hour whoever brings it has to be cleared the guard told her she gave a little huff of annoyance took the memo out again and made the necessary notation oh patient stiles was asking for someone named dallas does that mean anything the guard nodded pulled out his communicator hes got cop juice for blood peabody commented as they walked down the corridor the juice is still green but itll ripen when her communicator beeped she dug it out of her pocket dallas lieutenant officer clark on guard duty kenneth stiles the suspect is awake and asking for you im one level up and on my way thats good timing peabody punched for the elevator then sighed and followed eve to the exit door i guess were walking its one patient level one level equals three flights youll work off the cookies theyre only a fond memory you figure stiles is ready to give us some straight talk i figure hes ready for something she pushed through the doors to the next level headed left he doesnt know we found carvell or that weve identified draco as carlys father well see how he plays it before we clue him in she stopped at the door clark yes sir he have any visitors not a soul he was sleeping it off until a few minutes ago the nurse reported he was awake and asking for you okay take a fifteenminute break thanks i can use it eve reached for the door pushed it open then with a curse leaped inside she grabbed stiless legs hauled up and took his weight get him down peabody was already scrambling onto the bed fighting with the knot clark pounded in behind her ive got him lieutenant he moved in with his wide shoulders and took stiless dangling body up another three inches hed hanged himself with a noose fashioned from his own bedsheets hes not breathing clark announced when the body collapsed on him i dont think hes breathing get a doctor face fierce eve straddled stiles pressed the heels of her hands to his heart and began to pump come on you son of a bitch you will breathe she lowered her mouth to his forced in air pumped oh my god oh my god kenneth at the doorway areena mansfield scattered the armload of flowers she carried at her feet keep back come on come on sweat began to pour down eves face she heard the sound of running feet of alarms shrilling move aside move aside please she slid away pushed to her feet and watched the medical team work on him no pulse flat line come back eve ordered goddamn you come back she watched the slim pressure hypo of adrenaline jab against his chest no response small disks were slicked with gel there were orders to set to clear then stiless body bucked when the discs shocked his system the heart line on the monitor stayed blue and blank for a second time the disks slapped against him a second time his body jerked fell and now a low beep sounded and the blue line wavered and went red sinus rhythm we have a pulse at the door areena covered her face with her hands o o give me his condition hes alive the doctor a cooleyed man with saffron skin continued to make notes there was oxygen deprivation and some minimal brain damage as a result if we keep him alive its correctable are you going to keep him alive thats why were here he slipped his memo pad back into the pocket of his lab coat his chances are good another few minutes dangling there he wouldnt have had any chance weve come a long way in medical science but bringing the dead back to life still eludes us when can i talk to him i cant say hazard a guess he may be functional by tomorrow but until we complete the tests i cant gauge the exact extent of the brain damage it may be several days or weeks before hes capable of answering any but the most basic of questions the brain finds ways to bypass damage to reroute if you will and we can help that process along but it takes time i want to know the minute he can talk ill make sure youre informed now i have patients to see lieutenant clark stepped up this is the nurse you wanted to see ormand eve said reading the id badge talk to me i had no idea he meant to try selftermination i wouldnt have believed he was capable of it physically i mean he was weak as a baby a man wants to do himself he finds a way nobodys blaming you she nodded relaxed her defensive stance i was in there for a routine check of his vitals he was conscious and he told me he wanted to confess i thought he meant to a priest we get a lot of that even from patients who arent catholic or egatarian but he became agitated and asked for you by name said i was to tell you he wanted to confess to what he didnt say i thought he killed that other actor richard draco when eve didnt respond the nurse shrugged i calmed him down promised to find you then i told the guard after i arranged for the patients afternoon nutrition i dont know anything else all right she dismissed the nurse turned back to clark i need you to stand by up in the icu ill arrange for a relief in an hour if theres any change in stiless condition before that i want to know yes sir his own sheets clark murmured that takes balls it takes something eve turned on her heel and strode to the waiting area where peabody had taken areena kenneth areena got shakily to her feet theyre moving him to intensive care i thought he was when i saw him i thought she sank to her chair again oh how much more can happen eliza rothchild said tragedies happen in threes superstition ive never been overly superstitious but now hell be all right the doctor seemed optimistic how did you know kenneth stiles was here how why i heard it on the news just this morning theyre saying he was injured while trying to leave the city that hes the prime suspect in richards death i dont believe that not for a moment i wanted to see him to tell him that why dont you believe it because kenneths not capable of murder its coldblooded and calculating hes neither sometimes murders hotblooded and impulsive youd know more about that than i but i know kenneth he killed no one do you know a woman named anja carvell carvell i dont think so should i will they let me see kenneth i dont know i should try eve got to her feet as areena rose you realize dont you that if kenneth stiles did plan the murder of richard draco hes the one who put the knife in your hand areena shivered and the faint color in her cheeks faded thats only one more reason i know it couldnt have been kenneth why is that hes too much of a gentleman may i go lieutenant yeah you can go areena paused at the doorway you fought to save his life i watched you you believe hes a murderer yet you fought to save his life why maybe i didnt want him to escape justice i think its more than that but im not sure what hell of a day so far peabody said when they were alone were just getting started up and at em peabody weve got places to go she turned out of the room and nearly walked into nadine ambulance chasing eve said mildly i thought you were too important for that routine youre never too important for that routine whats the status on kenneth stiles no comment come on dallas i have a source in the hospital i heard he tried to hang himself did he kill richard draco which part didnt you get the no or the comment nadines fashionable heels made the rapid stride down the corridor tricky but she managed to keep up with eve are you charging him with murder are there any other suspects will you confirm stiles was injured during flight the medias already broadcasting that one sure with allegedly and believed to be sprinkled all through the reports i need confirmation i need a vacation neither of us look to be getting our wish anytime soon dallas giving up nadine took eves arm tugged her aside out of the way of peabody and her own longsuffering camera operator i have to know something i cant sleep give me something make it off the record i need to close this circle before i can move on you shouldnt be on this story i know it and if it comes out that richard and i were involved ill take a lot of heat for that personally and professionally but if i just sit around and wait ill go crazy with those options ill risk the heat how much did he mean to you entirely too much thats been dead a lot longer than he has that doesnt mean i dont need to close the circle meet me at central an hour ill give you what i can thanks if you could just tell me if kenneth an hour nadine eve skirted around her dont push your luck in twenty minutes they were inside anja carvells suite there wasnt a trace of her she jumped peabody hissed at the empty closet then she frowned and turned to stare at eve you knew she wouldnt be here i didnt expect to find her shes smart smart enough to know id be back she killed draco shes part of it eve wandered into the bath anjas scent was still there coolly female should i contact the authorities in montreal start arranging for extradition dont bother shed be expecting that if she ever lived in montreal she wouldnt go back there now shes gone under eve murmured but she wont go far so we play it out call for the sweepers no warrant my husband owns the joint take care of it im going down to security o o by the time eve had finished at the palace hotel returned to central and made her case to whitney she was late for her appointment with nadine it irritated her as it always did to find nadine already in her office why do they let you in here because i bring donuts cops have been weak for them for generations wheres mine sorry the squad descended on them like rats i think baxter licked up the crumbs he would she settled at her desk wheres your camera shes outside well get her in here i havent got all damn day but i thought look do you want a oneonone or not you bet i do she grabbed her palmlink and called her camera you could use a few layers of concealer on those tote bags under your eyes she dug into the hefty and wellpacked makeup kit in her purse try this keep that crap away from me suit yourself but you look like you havent slept in days nadine flipped open a mirror began to enhance her own face still it makes you look fierce and dedicated i am fierce and dedicated and it never fails to look good onscreen great sweater by the way cashmere baffled eve looked down at her navy turtleneck i dont know its blue will this air tonight bet your ass good someone eve thought wasnt going to get a good nights sleep and this time it wouldnt be her o o nadine fussed with the camera angles looked in the monitor and ordered a light adjustment its not a damn beauty contest nadine shows what you know about onair reporting there that looks good can you cut out some of that air traffic lucy its like sitting in a transpo center im filtering out most of it the operator fiddled another moment then nodded ready when you are well do the bumper back at the shop start record this is nadine furst for channel she began her eyes on the pinpoint lens reporting from cop central and the office of lieutenant eve dallas the primary investigator in the murder of actor richard draco lieutenant nadine shifted faced eve can you give us an update on your investigation the investigation is ongoing the department is following a number of leads mr draco was killed onstage in front of a packed house you yourself were a witness thats correct the nature of the crime its location and execution have resulted in literally thousands of interviews and witness statements and because it was always best to pay your debts eve tagged on an addendum detective baxter of this division has reviewed the bulk of those statements and taken on the arduous task of elimination and corroboration its true isnt it that people often see the same event but see it differently its often true of civilians police officers are trained to see does that make you your own best witness in a manner of speaking is it true that kenneth stiles a colleague and acquaintance of dracos who was in the cast of the play is your lead suspect that individual has been questioned as have all members of the cast as i stated we are following a number of leads and as the focus of the investigation has narrowed we expect to make an arrest within twentyfour hours an arrest it threw nadine off stride but only for one beat can you give us the name of your primary suspect im not free to give that information at this time i can tell you that the person who killed richard draco who killed linus quim will be in custody within twentyfour hours who thats all you get nadine shut it down nadine might have argued but eve was already getting to her feet shut it down lucy that was a hell of a bombshell dallas if youd given me a heads up we couldve gone live tonights soon enough you got your story nadine youll hit with it first cant argue with that can you give me any more just some filler for the followup procedural details some of the hard data the exact number of interviews number of manhours that kind of thing you can get that from media relations eve glanced at the camera operator pointed a finger then jerked a thumb at the door with a look at nadine for confirmation lucy hauled the equipment out off the record dallas youll know everything you need to know tomorrow i have a question for you you didnt mention roarke in your report his connection to the theater to the play to me why its been done overdone i want the meat doesnt fly nadine roarkes name boosts ratings okay consider it payback she shrugged and hauled up her purse for the girl night okay eve reached into her back pocket drew out a sealed disc here whats this but the minute it was in her hand nadine understood her fingers closed tightly around it its the recording richard did of me its been removed from the evidence log its the only copy i figure it should close that circle as her throat filled with conflicting emotions nadine stared down at the disc yes yes it does better it breaks it using both hands she snapped the disc in two eve nodded with approval some women wouldnt have been able to resist watching it i figured you were smarter than that i am now thanks dallas i dont know how to eve took a deliberate step back dont even think about kissing me with a shaky laugh nadine stuffed the broken disc in her bag it would go into the first recyler she came across okay no sloppy stuff but i owe you dallas damn right you do so next time save me a donut chapter twentyone she slept for ten hours pretty much where she had fallen after giving roarke the briefest of updates she woke recharged clearheaded and alone since he wasnt around to nag her she had an ice cream bar for breakfast washed it down with coffee while she watched the morning news reports onscreen she caught a replay of her oneonone with nadine and satisfied with it considered herself set for the day she dressed dragging on dung brown trousers and a white shirt that had narrow brown stripes she had no idea how long the shirt had been there but since roarke had started filling her closet shed stopped paying attention he bought her a ridiculous amount of clothes but it saved her from the torture of shopping since it was there and the weather promised to remain cool she buttoned on a waistlength vest that appeared to go with the rest of the deal she strapped on her weapon then she set off to find roarke he was already in his office the morning stock reports on one screen offplanet trading on another and what seemed to be a serious math problem on the third how can you deal with numbers first thing in the morning i live for numbers he tapped his keyboard and the math problem shifted into tidy columns he had no doubt added up to the smallest decimal point and as it happens ive been up for some time you look rested he said after a moments study of her face and very welltailored as well youre a resilient creature eve i slept like a slug she came around the counter leaned down and kissed him youve been putting in some long days yourself she patted his shoulder in a way that made his antenna quiver maybe we need a little vacation he sent the figures onscreen to his broker for immediate application then swiveled around in his chair what do you want just some quiet time somewhere you and me we could take a long weekend i repeat he picked up his coffee sipped what do you want irritation gleamed in her eyes didnt i just say dont pull that crap on me again you had to grovel the last time i wont this time around do i look stupid he said in a conversational tone im not above a bribe lieutenant but i like to know the deal why am i being softened up i couldnt soften you up with a vat of skin regenerator anyway its not a bribe im a damn city official and they are as we know complete strangers to bribes watch it ace who says i cant want a break if i want a favor it doesnt have to connect i see well then heres what ill bring to the table ill give you your favor whatever it may be in exchange for a week of your time anywhere i want to go a weeks out ive got court dates paperwork three days negotiations he thought were his favorite hobby five days now five days next month thats ten days not a week even i can do the math on that three days now two days next month four now three next month all right all right her head was starting to spin ill work it out then we have a deal he offered his hand clasped hers so are we going to the beach we can do that the olympus resort has a stunning manmade beach olympus she blanched off planet im not going off planet thats got to be a deal breaker deals done buck up now whats the favor she sulked it was a rare attitude for her but she was damn good at it its not even a big favor you shouldve thought of that before you tried to scam me you might have if youd had a decent breakfast instead of ice cream how did you she broke off and the single word was a vicious hiss summerset now when a woman asks her husband for a favor its a lovely touch if she sits on his lap he patted his knee you wont have much of a lap if i break both your legs seriously annoyed she sat on the counter look its police business and you always want to stick your nose in anyway im giving you a chance now there you are enjoying himself he lifted a hand palm up if youd presented it that way initially put me in the position of being given a favor rather than giving one you wouldnt have made what you consider a poor deal and you wouldnt be cross im not cross you know i hate when you say im cross and before i forget whats the deal with this authorization one shit did you buy something he handed her the rest of his coffee i must make a celebrational note on my calendar eve dallas went shopping strike up the band she scowled off into space i was in a pretty good mood before i came in here see youre cross as to authorization one what sense does it make for you to pay for products manufactured by one of my companies next time im going to a competitor if i can find one she huffed out a breath brought herself back on track im going to close the case today ive worked it how to smoke out the killer get a confession its roundabout she murmured i have reasons not to take the straight line i had to do a tap dance for whitney to clear it if it doesnt work she trailed off what do you need to start i need your theater and i need you to help me script and produce a little performance o o an hour later eve was on her way to central and roarke was making the first phone call in her office eve loaded the disc recording of the play in her computer with her mind elsewhere she barely noted how smoothly the disc was accepted how clear the audio and video when she ordered it to fastforward to the final scene it did so without a single bump there they were she thought draco as vole blithely confessing to a murder he could no longer be charged with his face handsome smug as he drew carlys hand dianas hand through his arm and she stood by him pretty and charming with a loving smile kenneth stiles the cantankerous and sly sir wilfred stunned fury on his face as the realization struck that hed been used exploited manipulated elizas fussy miss plimsoll standing beside him outraged her hands gripping the back of kenneths chair and white to the knuckles areena the beautiful and multifaceted christine who had sacrificed everything risked prison to save the one she loved michael proctor merely a shadow watching from the wings wondering when he would step into the spotlight and into the role of murderer and hovering over all was the ghost of anja carvell eve didnt flinch as she watched murder done as the knife that should have been harmless plunged deep into the heart there she thought and froze the screen there it is ten thousand witnesses would have missed it hadnt she the performance of a lifetime she realized in death end program she ordered eject disc she bagged it gathered others she engaged her office link for interdepartmental transmission peabody alert feeney and mcnab were moving out with a final check of her weapon she prepared to begin a performance of her own o o eves driving mira observed from the backseat was a mirror reflection of her personality competent direct focused and fierce as the car whipped through traffic bulling into gaps challenging other charging bumpers mira quietly checked the tension on her safety harness youre taking a risk eve gave a quick glance in the rearview met miras eyes a calculated one i believe mira trailed off found herself falling back into childhood prayers as eve shot into sharp vertical swung hard to the right and skimmed crossways over jammed traffic i believe she continued when she had her breath back youve assessed the situation correctly still theres a wide margin for error which you could eradicate by adhering to strict procedure if im wrong its on me either way the person who killed draco and quim will be in custody by the end of day the car dove into an underground parking tunnel barely slacking speed it winged like an arrow from a bow toward a reserved slot miras mouth came open she made some small sound as they roared toward the security barricade eve flipped down her visor to display her id pass mira would have sworn the barricade emitted a terrified squeal as it leaped clear they nipped under it tucked into the narrow slot well mira managed well that was exciting huh it occurs to me eve ive never done a ridealong with you i begin to see why peabody snorted shoved open her door take my word dr mira that was a leisurely drive around the park something wrong with my driving not that a case of zoner wouldnt cure peabody said under her breath in any case mira stepped out of the car drew eves attention away from her aide im pleased you asked me to be here not only because i might be useful but it gives me an opportunity to observe how you work in the field youre going to have to stay out of the thick eve left her car in the secured slot roarke had arranged started out to the street and the theater yes but ill be monitoring weve got a little while before the show starts at the stage door eve punched in the code shed been given youll likely get bored oh i sincerely doubt that they walked out on the stage where preparations were already under way hey lieutenant heads up shebody twenty feet overhead mcnab swung by in a safety harness he gave a kick of his shiny green boots and sailed in a very graceful arc stop that horsing around feeney squinted up wincing when his detective pretended to swim through the air whats he doing up there eve demanded besides making an ass of himself overhead cams you gotta be young to enjoy that kind of duty most of the equipment was already in place roarke didnt miss a trick but he wasnt setting up for a police op were adjusting well be able to monitor the action from all angles is roarke onscene yet yeah hes in control showing a couple of my techs more than theyd ever hoped to know the mans a genius with electronics what i couldnt do with him in edd do me a favor and dont mention it hes hard enough to deal with autolocks set on all exits yep once everybodys in nobody gets out weve got three uniforms two techs you me and peabody and flyboy up there mcnab get the hell down from there now you sure you dont want a bigger team eve did a slow turn scanned the theater we wont need it feeney roarke stepped from the shadows onto the stage your control appears to be set ill go look it over mcnab dont make me come up there christ how many times did i say that to my kids with a shake of his head he walked offstage hes going to hurt himself torn between amusement and concern peabody nudged eves shoulder tell him to come down dallas why me because he fears you because the idea of that was pleasing eve set her hands on her hips scowled up and shouted mcnab stop screwing around and get your ass down here yes sir he came down in a whoosh cheeks flushed with the thrill man you gotta try that what a rush im happy we could provide you with some entertainment detective why shouldnt we have a little fun and frivolity during the course of an elaborate and expensive police operation particularly when were employing multimillion dollar civilian equipment and facilities um was the best he could do before he cleared his throat the grin had already been wiped off his face the overhead cams are set and operational lieutenant sir then maybe you can make yourself useful elsewhere if its not too much trouble no sir ill just go somewhere he thought and escaped that ought to keep him straight for the next five minutes she turned to roarke i dont fear you he told her but i brought you a present he handed her a miniremote you can signal control he explained for lights sound set change you can direct from any location in the theater the plays in your hands opening acts up to you its already in place he checked his wrist unit you have just over an hour before curtain i need to check all ops peabody do a round confirm that all egresses leading below back or above stage are secure then take and maintain your assigned position until further orders yes sir roarke would you show dr mira her observation area of course great she flipped out her communicator feeney i want those what are they houselights on for a minute when they flashed on illuminating the theater she switched the communicator to blanket transmission this is lieutenant dallas in thirty minutes i want all operation personnel at their assigned stations if i so much as smell a cop he or she is on report civilian protection is first priority i repeat that is priority weapons are to remain harnessed and on low stun i will not have a repeat of grand central she pocketed the communicator roarke contact me when dr mira is settled of course break a leg lieutenant what oh right she was born for this mira said as eve strode off not just for command which fits her like skin but for balancing the wrongs with the rights someone else perhaps anyone else would have finished this another way she couldnt no its already cost her shell need you when this is done were going away for a few days mira angled her head how did you manage to persuade her the art of the deal he offered his arm may i escort you to your seat doctor o o lieutenant mcnab position four first subject approaching theater stage door entrance copy eve turned from the backstage monitor to roarke thats your cue try not to deviate from the outline okay i believe physical risk is minimal but trust me i just want to go over lieutenant does it occur to you that i might know what im doing it occurs to me that you always know what youre doing well then i repeat trust me with that he left to take his mark on the monitor she watched him walk out on the bare stage stand under the lights she wondered if hed ever considered acting of course he hadnt she thought deals shady and otherwise had been his passion but he had the face for it and the build the presence the grace and she mused he had an innate skill with a believable lie wasnt that acting michael roarke offered a hand as proctor entered youre prompt i didnt want to keep everyone waiting with an easy laugh michael glanced around the trouble with being prompt is you always wait for everyone else i was really glad to get your call i wasnt sure the cops would ever let the theater open again at least not in time for you to put witness back into production they appear to have everything they need from the scene i want to thank you for giving me the chance to play vole i realize you could call in another name actor to fill the part no qualms no roarke thought he didnt see qualms but ambition considering what happened to draco i wondered if you might be somewhat anxious about stepping into the role no im fine with it i dont mean fine he corrected and had the grace to flush its terrible what happened to richard just terrible but the show must go on roarke said smoothly then glanced over ah eliza and areena ladies thank you for coming your call saved me from boredom and brooding eliza stepped up brushed her cheek to roarkes the boredom of being between acts and brooding over kenneth i still cant believe what im hearing on the news dont areena said theres a mistake there must be she rubbed her chilly arms its so odd to be here again i havent been back since since opening night will you be all right with this roarke took her hand warmed it in his own yes yes i must be mustnt i none of us have any choice but to go on why shouldnt we carly made an entrance a deliberate one shed applied dramatic makeup to go with an electric blue dress that scooped low at the breasts stopped short at the thighs for power shed told herself she was damn well going to be powerful none of us gave a damn about the late unlamented richard draco carly areena murmured it a quiet censure oh save the fragile sensibilities for the audience he fucked us all over at one time or another some of us literally she added with a tight fierce smile were not here to dedicate our next performance to his memory were here because we want to get back to work he may have been a bastard dear eliza said mildly but dead is dead and now kenneths in the hospital and under guard kenneth ought to be given a medal for ridding the world of richard draco they havent charged him yet areena twisted her fingers together cant we just discuss the play and get away from the ugliness for a little while is this a full cast call roarke she brushed a hand over her hair looked around i was sure the director would be here by now difficult to arrange a full cast call at the moment roarke let the implications of that hang the part of sir wilfred will need to be recast couldnt we rehearse with a standin michael asked ive never run through an entire act with the first cast it would be helpful for me to do that as soon as possible there you go michael carly laughed no moss growing on you you just said we were here to work he shot back theres no reason to snipe at me maybe im feeling snipey youre just sulking because i kicked you out of my apartment instead of crying on your shoulder i wouldve helped he said quietly i would have tried i dont need your help i dont need anyone her eyes glinted with an inner fury that burned into her voice i slept with you big deal dont think you mean anything to me no man is ever going to mean anything to me once more sex rears its ugly head eliza muttered must we forever have glands interfering with art eliza areena stepped forward laid a hand on carlys arm carly please we need to get along we need to stick together she tried a bolstering smile what must roarke think of us bickering this way id say youre all under considerable strain he paused skimming his eyes over the faces turned toward him and that if any or all of you feel unable to continue with the run of the play id prefer to know sooner than later carly threw back her head and laughed oh please each and every one of us would claw through broken glass for a chance to perform in this one the publicity will pack this house for weeks when we open again and every one of us knows it nothing as irksome as murder will get in our way she tossed her hair back stretching out her arms as she crossed the stage so bring on a standin for the inestimable sir wilfred cast a goddamn droid in the role itll still be standing room only she whirled back arms still lifted go ahead roarke throw open the doors let the play begin as cues went eve figured it was near to perfect it never stopped she said and moved from the wings shadows to the lights chapter twentytwo lieutenant dallas carly lowered her arms slowly let one hand rest on her cocked hip what an irritating surprise to see you again oh carly do stop playing the diva eliza said irritably youre not nearly old enough to pull it off lieutenant i hope youre here to tell us youve made the arrest you promised you seemed very confident in your interview on channel an arrest is imminent not kenneth areena pressed a hand to her heart if it was kenneth eliza put in i hope we can all be counted on to behave decently and stand behind him i intend to she brought her shoulders back spoke grandly i dont desert my friends thats admirable ms rothchild eve slipped her hands in her pocket fingered the remote but kenneth stiles is no longer the primary suspect in this investigation richard dracos killer is on this stage even as she spoke the houselights dimmed the stage lights glowed and the courtroom set slid into view a longbladed knife lay on the evidence table eve crossed to it picked it up to weigh it in her hand the murder took place on this stage and so will the arrest well well have to give you points for the dramatic twist lieutenant carly breezed forward arranged herself languidly in the witness chair please go on were all riveted cut it out carly it had to be kenneth michael sent areena an apologetic look im sorry areena but it had to be he tried to run and then he tried to well escape permanently if he wasnt guilty why would he have done all that to protect someone eve said its a recurring theme here she touched the tip of the knife with her finger then set it down again miss plimsoll fussing over sir wilfred to protect his health no matter how many different ways he insults or evades her really lieutenant thats a character eliza puffed up like a bird whod just had its tail feathers plucked surely youre not suggesting that i had anything to do with this its all about character eve studied elizas outraged face sir wilfred protecting his client risking his health only to learn in the end hes freed a murderer leonard vole pretending to defend his beloved wife helping her to escape a crumbling germany years before only to use her again and again to protect himself and christine eve shifted her gaze to areena risking her reputation sacrificing her freedom to cover for him out of love that was thrown back in her face in the crudest and most careless of ways when she had served her purpose we know the play carly said with a dainty yawn i suppose youll say that while only the understudy michael was ranged with richard that is vole thats right and with draco out of the way he becomes vole what better way to right an old wrong to avenge his mothers honor just a minute thats enough ive had enough of this i dont have to take that sort of thing from you michaels fists bunched at his sides as he took one threatening step toward eve michael roarkes voice was quiet he shifted so that he blocked michaels reckless advance and the actor came facetoface with iced violence i could hurt you in ways you cant possibly imagine roarke eve would have cursed him for the interference but it would have changed the mood step back michael carly advised and only the grip of her hand on the chair indicated her concern youll only embarrass yourself youre running through our happy troupe rather quickly lieutenant carly crossed her legs all but purring to shift the attention to herself but you havent touched on me or my character counterpart i dont believe diana was protecting anyone she would have eve turned walked slowly to the witness chair wouldnt she have seen that after it all came tumbling down that she would have followed after christine being used being exploited then being cast off when he looked for fresher prey i think she would have hated him for that hated him eve repeated resting her hands on the arms of the chair leaning down for spoiling her party her pretty dreams for making her see what a fool shed been to fall for something despicable disgusting the pulse began to hammer in carlys throat youre giving the character more depth than she deserves i dont think so i think vole underestimated her people particularly men often underestimate beautiful women they dont look past the surface he didnt know you did he didnt know what kind of strength and passion and purpose lives inside you a spotlight flashed on bathed carly in a cool white glow you dont frighten me lieutenant no you dont scare easy and when someone bruises you you hit back harder i have to respect that he thought he could toss you aside like an lc after the hours up he thought he could humiliate you in public right here on this stage in front of the cast and crew so theyd look at you with scorn or pity you wouldnt couldnt swallow that he had to pay for that stop hounding her michael gripped the edge of the evidence table leave her alone you know what shes been through shes just grasping at straws her mouth was dust dry but carly managed to keep her voice level men dont toss you aside do they carly eve glanced back at michael thats not allowed not tolerated it was easy to plan it really just step by step and it was so beautifully tailored to suit he would die right here almost at your feet i want a lawyer you can have a team of them eve stepped back wandered to the evidence table tapped a finger on the handle of the knife it was easy to get the knife out of the kitchen who notices a missing knife where there are so many you knew the pace of the play how much time between a change of sets even if someone saw you it wouldnt matter you belonged here like part of the scenery or an important prop slip the dummy knife up your sleeve set the murder weapon down and walk away was it hard to wait she turned the knife in her hand so that it caught the lights shot glints to say your lines to listen to others while in your head you could see that last scene play the way the knife would drive into him the shock on his face when he was finally punished for what he did to you its ridiculous and you know it you cant prove any of it because its not true youre just going to end up looking like a fool ill risk it carly landsdowne youre under arrest for the murders of richard draco and linus quim you have the right to remain silent she continued as peabody came out moving toward carly you have the right to an attorney and or the representative of your choice you have get away from her the shout came as peabody prepared to snap restraints over carlys wrist dont you dare touch her shes done nothing areena shoved michael aside rushed to the evidence table her face was wild with fury as she grabbed up the knife you wont touch her you wont do this damn you to hell she whirled on eve she didnt kill richard i did i only wish id done it years ago before he ever laid his filthy hands on her i know eve walked to her eyes locked and took the harmless knife out of areenas hand i know it anja anja oh god my god carly crossed her arms over her breasts rocked peabody move these people out of here carly sit down theres a story you need to hear let her go areenas voice was frantic as she ranged herself between eve and carly ill tell you everything havent you put her through enough i waive my rights i understand them and i waive them now let her go you carlys eyes seemed to burn in her face you and richard im sorry so sorry you knew bracing herself carly got to her feet you knew all along and did nothing when he no oh carly you cant think that id have stood aside yes i knew when i saw you when you were cast and i realized you were who you were i went to him youre so much what he coveted young and beautiful and fresh i told him who you were so that he wouldnt touch you in that way that was my mistake she closed her eyes took the weight ill never know if he would have looked elsewhere for his pleasure i thought i was protecting you and instead instead he seduced you knowing it knowing it you werent to blame you were never to blame he knew carly pressed a hand to her midriff you both knew when i found out what hed done what he was doing i confronted him we argued bitterly i threatened him threatened to expose him to go to the press with the story i couldnt have of course i couldnt have because of what it would do to you he believed me at least initially and broke it off with you he was cruel to you because he knew it would hurt me how did you know me carly i areena trailed off shook her head i never interfered with your life i had no right to but i was kept informed why did you care carly demanded i was nothing but your mistake no no you were a gift one i couldnt keep i gave that gift to your parents because i knew they would cherish you they would protect you as i tried to she said wearily i would never have told you carly never if thered been a choice but i cant let them accuse you cant let them blame you for what i did she turned back to eve you had no right to put her through this weve all got a job to do is that what you call this carly gasped to find out which one of us exterminated a roach and why well youve done it i wonder how you sleep at night i want to go she began to weep i dont want to be here anymore i want to go dr mira yes mira walked onto the set slipped an arm around carly come now carly come with me im dead inside no only numb you need to rest a little mira sent eve a long quiet look then guided carly away look what youve done to her youre no better than richard abusing her exploiting her do you know the nightmares that will haunt her scream through her head eyes grim areena faced eve i would have spared her from that i could have spared her from that you killed him after hed stopped abusing her why did you wait until it was over because it wasnt over areena sighed gave into her trembling legs and sat he came to see me a few days before we opened hed been using he was always more vile when he was using he threatened to take her back if i wanted him to keep his distance id have to take her place so i did it was only sex it meant nothing nothing but her hand shook as she dug into her purse found a cigarette i should have pretended to be hurt outraged terrified those emotions would have stimulated him satisfied him i could have made him believe it instead i showed disgust and disinterest he retaliated by suggesting a threesome himself me and carly after opening night he reveled in telling me everything hed done to her with her how hed enjoyed it how exciting it had been for him to pound himself into her knowing she was his blood his daughter he was a monster and i executed him she got to her feet i have no remorse i have no regret i could have killed him that night when he stood in my rooms bragging about being man enough to take on both mother and daughter at once there was a skim of sickness coating eves throat why didnt you i wanted to be sure and i wanted somehow for it to be just and for the first time she smiled i wanted to get away with it i thought i would i thought i had when she began to fight with her lighter roarke crossed to her took it from her chilly hands her eyes met his over the flame thank you he laid the lighter back in her palm gently closed her fingers around it youre welcome with her eyes closed areena took her first deep drag of all my addictions this is the one ive never been able to beat she let out a sigh ive done many unattractive things in my life lieutenant ive had my bouts of selfishness of selfpity but i dont use people i care about i wouldnt have let kenneth be arrested i wouldve found a way around that but who would suspect quiet obliging areena of coldblooded murder such a public one that was your cover doing it right here onstage yes surely i wouldnt commit murder in front of thousands of witnesses i saw myself being eliminated as a suspect right away and naively i believed none of the others being innocent would face more than the inconvenience of questioning she managed a little laugh and knowing them i was certain theyd find the process diverting frankly lieutenant i didnt think any investigator looking into richards life to solve his death would work overly hard on the case once they discovered the kind of man he was i underestimated you even as richard underestimated me until the moment you put the knife in him then he stopped underestimating you thats right the look in his eyes the dawning of understanding was worth every moment of planning of fear it happened very much as youd said before only with me in the role youd cast carly in she could replay it in her head scene by scene move by move her own intimate play i simply took a knife from the kitchen one day when eliza and i went down to ask for sandwiches i kept it in my dressing room until opening night until the change of scene there were several of us moving from point to point backstage cast and crew i exchanged the knives and added the touch of planting the prop in my own dressing room when my dressers back was turned i planted it right under her very loyal nose another clever twist i thought at the time it might have worked it nearly did nearly why nearly lieutenant anja carvell ah a name from the past do you know where it comes from no ive wondered a small insignificant role in a small insignificant play that opened and closed on the same night in a backwater town in canada it was never put on my credits nor on kenneths but its where we met and i realized some years later it was where he fell in love with me i only wish id been wise enough to love him back he would call me anja from time to time a kind of private connection between that very young girl and that very young man who both wanted to be great actors you used it when you placed her yes for sentiment and to protect her i thought should she ever try to find her birth mother i had given her to good people the landsdownes are very good people kind loving i wanted what was best for her i made certain she got it yes eve thought you made certain dead certain you could have let go then why didnt you let go do you think because i only saw her once because i only held her once that i dont love her areenas voice rose rang im not her mother im fully aware of that but there hasnt been a day in twentyfour years that i havent thought of her she stopped herself seemed to draw in but im circling the point i was persuasive as anja i know it yes very i didnt recognize you not physically emotions areena who had the strongest motive not only to kill him but to make him pay in front of an audience to end his life just as voles was ended who had been the most betrayed the most used once i eliminated carly there was one answer anja carvell if youd eliminated carly why did you put her through that horror anja carvell eve went on ignoring the question she struck me as a strong selfpossessed and very direct woman but how did she switch the knives i imagine shed have found a way and still it didnt quite work for one simple reason she would have needed to hold the knife herself to strike the blow for the child shed given up to protect yes youre right i would have left it to no one else when i thought of you and her i saw it you changed your look your voice your attitude but there are things you didnt change or couldnt there eve said gesturing you reach up as youre doing now toying with a necklace or as anja with the top button of your dress when youre formulating what youre going to say and how best to say it such a small thing there are others they add up you can change the color even the shape of your eyes but not the look in them when your temper spikes or grief grabs you you couldnt hide the purpose in them for that one moment when you locked eyes with richard onstage that instant before you killed him i only had to think of anja and you to realize you were one person so you outwitted me areena got to her feet youve solved the puzzle and upheld what you see as justice brava lieutenant i imagine youll sleep the sleep of the righteous tonight eve kept her eyes locked on areenas peabody escort ms mansfield to the blackandwhite unit waiting outside yes sir ms mansfield eve roarke murmured it as their footsteps echoed offstage she shook her head knowing she had to hold him off hold herself together feeney do we have the full record clear as a bell dallas and fully admissible she waived her rights were done here close it up will do meet you at central good job damn good job yeah she squeezed her eyes shut as roarke laid a hand on her shoulder thanks for the help we got through it no muss no fuss she resisted when he tried to turn her to face him he simply stepped around her dont do this im fine i have to go in deal with this ill go with you he tightened his grip when she started to shake her head eve do you think i would leave you alone at such a time i said im fine liar she gave up gave in let him hold her i looked at her i looked in her eyes and i wondered how i would have felt what it would have been like to have someone care so much about me someone whod have done anything to save me from him and then looking at her i trapped her using the thing she loved most no you saved the thing she loved most we both know that did i no thats miras job she drew a deep breath i want to close this thing i need to make it over o o paperwork could be a soothing routine she used it writing her report with the dispassionate and brutal efficiency required she filed it adding all the evidence gathered lieutenant shifts nearly over peabody go home i will i wanted you to know mansfields finished in booking shes asked to see you all right set it up interview one if available then take off happy to eve turned in her chair to where roarke stood looking at her miserable view sorry i have to do this why dont you go home ill wait she said nothing only rose and made her way down to interview areena was already there sitting quietly at the small table she quirked her lips in a sneer i cant say i think much of the wardrobe choices in this place she fingered the collarless top of the dull gray state issue weve got to get a new designer record on is that necessary yes im required to put any conversations with you on record for your protection and mine dallas lieutenant eve in interview one with mansfield areena at her request ms mansfield youve been given your rights do you choose to implement any or all of them at this time no i have something to say to you you knew it was me she said leaning forward you were perfectly aware it was me before we came into the theater today weve been over this ground im asking you if you had any proof before my confession what difference does it make i have your confession for my own curiosity the attorney i intend to hire will be entitled to that information which will be relayed to me save us the middleman all right acting on my suppositions as regarded anja carvell i ordered voice print analyses between your statements and hers though you had altered your tone your rhythm effectively disguising your voice to the naked ear the voice prints were an exact match as fingerprints are several of yours were found in the room registered to carvell strands of hair both from a synthetic wig matching the shade worn by carvell and those of your shade and your dna were found in the aforementioned suite both were also found on a warranted sweep of your penthouse in the same hotel i see i should have researched police procedure i was careless no you werent you were human which makes it impossible to think of everything you managed it areena leaned back now a considering look in her eye as she studied eve you had enough evidence to bring me in here for questioning to throw my deception in my face use my relationship with richard with carly to break me instead you chose to do so at the theater in front of carly you might not have broken here i banked on it working the other way no youd have broken me we both know it i couldnt stand against you you did it in front of carly for a very specific reason you did it for her i dont know what youre talking about and im off shift before she could rise areena gripped her hand you did it for her she has to live with knowing what the father who made her was capable of what he did to her knowing what he was and that what he was runs inside her could twist her scar her shell live with it every day eve thought every night yes she will but you made sure she saw more than that you showed her that the other part who made her would protect her at all costs would sacrifice her own freedom to insure hers could love her that much you showed her that theres decency loyalty and strength of purpose in her blood one day when shes settled when she heals shell realize that she may think of me kindly when she realizes that lieutenant dallas i hope she has the courage to thank you as im thanking you now she closed her eyes tightly inhaled deeply can i have some water please eve walked over drew a cup youll both pay for what he did theres no way to stop that i know areena sipped cooled her throat but shes young and strong shell find a way to beat it back shell have help dr mira will counsel her shes the best i appreciate knowing that i was so proud of the way she faced you down today shes tough and shes lovely isnt she yes very i couldnt bear what he did to her couldnt bear thinking he might do so again tears rose were battled back fragile eve thought not in this lifetime with quim areena continued it was difficult for me i was afraid but he was an ugly little man and id had my fill of ugly little men lieutenant yes will you when im in prison will it be possible to get an update on carlys state of mind on how she is nothing intrusive just if theres a way i could be told shes all right ill see what i can do eve hesitated swore record off she ordered and blanked out the sound and visual to observation get a lawyer who knows how to spin the media not just one whos tough in court better get one of each you want to sway public opinion you want people to hear the story all of it and feel sympathy for you disgust for draco stop waiving your damn rights and dont talk to me again or any other cop without your attorney present amused areena lifted her eyebrows do you save everyone lieutenant shut up and listen go for diminished capacity and extreme emotional distress even with the premeditation its not much of a stretch you killed the man abusing your daughter and a blackmailer if its played that way its going to generate a lot of media in your favor and she could tap nadine to see that it swung that way the das not going to want the mess of a long public trial with mothers picketing outside the courthouse and city hall and they will hell offer you a deal you may spend time in a cage but if youre lucky youll get a hefty stretch of home incarceration with a bracelet and another chunk of severe parole why are you doing this for me isnt there some saying about looking gift horses in the mouth yes very true areena got to her feet i wish well obviously i wish wed met under different circumstances she held out her hand goodbye lieutenant eve clasped her hand let the grip hold o o when she walked back into her office roarke was there she picked up her jacket her bag what do you say we get the hell out of here i like the idea but he caught her hand ran his gaze over her face you look lighter lieutenant i am considerably and areena shes a hell of a woman its weird as she puzzled it she sat on the edge of the desk its the first time in eleven years on the job ive ever come across a killer i admire and a victim i couldnt care about roarke finished im not supposed to care one way or the other im just supposed to do the job but you do care lieutenant brutally you care and this time you ran up against someone you were obliged to stand for who deserved exactly what he got murders never deserved she said then made a small sound of impatience hell with it justice was served in a courtroom it might have been onstage but it wasnt makebelieve there was no pretense when areena mansfield picked up that knife and rammed it into the heart richard draco didnt have and when she took that step that stand justice was served shell have the jury eating out of her hand before its over theyll canonize her rather than convicting her you know that yeah hell im counting on that you know what i figured out pal tell me you cant go back cant fix what broke but you can go forward and every step matters every one makes a difference she pushed away from the desk cupped his face in her hands from where im standing youre the best step i ever took then lets take the next and go home she walked out with him and because it fit the mood took his hand in hers she would sleep that night she would sleep clean
