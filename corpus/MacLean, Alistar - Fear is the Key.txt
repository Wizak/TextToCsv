trailer an office then i was sitting in my office id been sitting there for four hours the earphones were beginning to hurt and the darkness was coming in from the swamps and the sea but if i had to sit there all night then i was going to do just that those earphones were the most important thing in the world they were the only remaining contact between me and all the world held for me peter should have been within radio range three hours ago it was a long haul north from barranquilla but wed made that haul a score of times before our three dcs were old but as mechanically perfect as unceasing care and meticulous attention could make them pete was a fine pilot barry a crack navigator the west caribbean forecast had been good and it was far too early in the season for hurricanes there was no conceivable reason why they shouldnt have been on the air hours ago as it was they must have already passed the point of nearest approach and be drawing away to the north towards tampa their destination could they have disobeyed my instructions to make the long dogleg by the yucatan strait and flown the direct route over cuba instead all sorts of unpleasant things could happen to planes flying over wartorn cuba those days it seemed unlikely and when i thought of the cargo they were carrying it seemed impossible where any element of risk was concerned pete was even more cautious and farseeing than myself over in the corner of my office on which a radio was playing softly it was tuned in to some englishspeaking station and for the second time that evening some hillbilly guitarplayer was singing softly of the death of mother or wife or sweetheart i wasnt sure which my red rose has turned to white it was called red for life and white for death red and white the colours of the three planes of our transcarib air charter service i was glad when the song stopped there was nothing much else in the office a desk two chairs a filing cabinet and the big rca receivertransmitter powered by a heavy trs cable that ran through the hole in the door and snaked across the grass and mud and one corner of the tarmac to the main terminal buildings and there was a mirror elizabeth had put that up the only time shed ever been here and id never got around to taking it down i looked in the mirror and that was a mistake black hair black brows dark blue eyes and a white strained haggard face to remind me how desperately worried i was as if i needed reminding i looked away and stared out of the window that was hardly any better the only advantage was that i could no longer see myself i certainly couldnt see anything else even at the best of times there was little enough to see through that window just the ten empty desolate miles of flat swampland stretching from the stanley field airport to belize but now that the honduras rainy season had begun only that morning the tiny tidal waves of water rolling endlessly down the single sheet of glass and the torn and lowering and ragged hurrying clouds driving their slanting rain into the parched and steaming earth turned the world beyond the window into a grey and misty nothingness i tapped out our call sign the same result as the last five hundred times id tapped it silence i altered the waveband to check that reception was still ok heard a swift succession of voices static singing music and homed back on our own frequency again the most important flight the transcarib air charter co had ever made and i had to be stuck here in our tiny suboffice waiting endlessly for the spare carburettor that never came and until i got it that red and white dc parked not fifty yards away on the apron was about as useful to me right then as a pair of sunglasses theyd have got off from barranquilla i was certain of that id had the first news three days ago the day id arrived here and the coded cable had made no mention of any possible trouble everything highly secret only three permanent civil servants knew anything about it lloyds willing to carry the risk even although at one of the highest premiums ever even the news received in a radio report of an attempted coup detat yesterday by prodictatorship elements to try to prevent the election of the liberal lleras hadnt concerned me too much for although all military planes and internal services had been grounded foreign airlines had been excluded with the state of colombias economy they couldnt afford to offend even the poorest foreigners and we just about qualified for that title but id taken no chances id cabled pete to take elizabeth and john with him if the wrong elements did get in on may th that was tomorrow and found out what wed done the transcarib air charter co would be for the high jump but fast besides on the fabulous fee that was being offered for this one freight haul to tampa the phones crackled in my ears static weak but bang on frequency as if someone was trying to tune in i fumbled for the volume switch turned it to maximum adjusted the bandswitch a hairline on either side and listened as id never listened before but nothing no voices no morse call sign just nothing i eased off one of the earphones and reached for a packet of cigarettes the radio was still on for the third time that evening and less than fifteen minutes since id heard it last someone was again singing my red rose has turned to white i couldnt stand it any longer i tore off the phones crossed to the radio switched it off with a jerk that almost broke the knob and reached for the bottle under my desk i poured myself a stiff one then replaced the headphones cqr calling cqs cqr calling cqs can you hear me can you hear me over the whisky splashed across the desk the glass fell and broke with a tinkling crash on the wooden floor as i grabbed for the transmitter switch and mouthpiece cqs here cqs here i shouted pete is that you pete over me on course on time sorry for the delay the voice was faint and faraway but even the flat metallic tone of the speaker couldnt rob it of its tightness its anger ive been sitting here for hours my own anger sounded through my relief and i was no sooner conscious of it than ashamed of it whats gone wrong pete this has gone wrong some joker knew what we had aboard or maybe he just didnt like us he put a squib behind the radio the detonator went off the primer went off but the charge gelignite or tnt or whatever failed to explode almost wrecked the radio luckily barry was carrying a full box of spares hes only just managed to fix it my face was wet and my hands were shaking so when i spoke again was my voice you mean someone planted a bomb someone tried to blow the crate apart just that anyone anyone hurt i dreaded the answer relax brother only the radio thank god for that lets hope thats the end of it not to worry besides we have a watchdog now a us army air force plane has been with us for the past thirty minutes barranquilla must have radioed for an escort to see us in peter laughed dryly after all the americans have a fair interest in this cargo we have aboard what kind of plane i was puzzled it took a pretty good flier to move two or three hundred miles out into the gulf of mexico and pick up an incoming plane without any radio directional bearing were you warned of this no but not to worry hes genuine all right weve just been talking to him knows all about us and our cargo its an old mustang fitted with longrange tanks a jet fighter couldnt stay up all this time i see that was me worrying about nothing as usual whats your course dead position he said something which i couldnt catch reception was deteriorating static increasing repeat please barrys just working it out hes been too busy repairing the radio to navigate a pause he says two minutes let me talk to elizabeth wilco another pause then the voice that was more to me than all the world hallo darling sorry weve given you such a fright that was elizabeth sorry shed given me a fright never a word of herself are you all right i mean are you sure youre of course her voice too was faint and faraway but the gaiety and the courage and the laughter would have come through to me had she been ten thousand miles away and were almost there i can see the lights of land ahead a moments silence then very softly the faintest whisper of sound i love you darling truly always always always i leaned back happily in my chair relaxed and at ease at last then jerked forward on my feet halfcrouched over the transmitter as there came a sudden exclamation from elizabeth and then the harsh urgent shout from pete hes diving on us the bastards diving on us and hes opened fire all his guns hes coming straight the voice choked off in a bubbling choking moan a moan pierced and shattered by a highpitched feminine cry of agony and in the same instant of time there came to me the staccato thunderous crash of exploding cannonshells that jarred the earphones on my head two seconds it lasted if that then there was no more sound of gunfire no more moaning no more crying nothing two seconds only two seconds two seconds to take from me all this life held dear for me two seconds to leave me alone in an empty and desolate and meaningless world my red rose had turned to white may rd chapter i i dont quite know what i had expected the man behind the raised polished mahogany desk to look like subconsciously i suppose id looked for him to match up with those misconceptions formed by reading and filmgoing in the faroff days when i had had time for such things that had been as extensive as they had been hopelessly unselective the only permissible variation in the appearances of county court judges in the southeastern united states i had come to believe was in weight some were driedup lean and stringy others triplejowled and built to match but beyond that any departure from the norm was unthinkable the judge was invariably an elderly man his uniform was a crumpled white suit offwhite shirt bootlace necktie and on the back of his head a panama with coloured band the face was usually red the nose purplish the drooping tips of the silverwhite mark twain moustache stained with bourbon or mint juleps or whatever it was they drank in those parts the expression was usually aloof the bearing aristocratic the moral principles high and the intelligence only moderate judge mollison was a big disappointment he didnt match up with any of the specifications except perhaps the moral principles and those werent visible he was young cleanshaven impeccably dressed in a wellcut light grey tropical worsted suit and ultraconservative tie and as for the mintjuleps i doubt if hed ever as much as looked at a bar except to wonder how he might close it he looked benign and wasnt he looked intelligent and was he was highly intelligent and sharp as a needle and hed pinned me now with this sharp needle of his intelligence and was watching me wriggle with a disinterested expression that i didnt much care for come come he murmured gently we are waiting for an answer mr ah chrysler he didnt actually say that he didnt believe that my name was chrysler but if any of the spectators on the benches missed his meaning they should have stayed at home certainly the bunch of roundeyed schoolgirls courageously collecting credit marks for their civics course by venturing into this atmosphere of sin and vice and iniquity didnt miss it neither did the sadeyed darkblonde girl sitting quietly on the front bench and even the big black apelike character sitting three benches behind her seemed to get it at least the broken nose beneath the negligible clearance between eyebrows and hairline seemed to twitch maybe it was just the flies the courtroom was full of them i thought sourly that if appearances were in any way a reflection of character he ought to be in the box while i was below watching him i turned back to the judge thats the third time youve had trouble in remembering my name judge i said reproachfully by and by some of the more intelligent citizens listening here are going to catch on you want to be more careful my friend i am not your friend judge mollisons voice was precise and legal and he sounded as if he meant it and this is not a trial there are no jurors to influence this is only a hearing mr ah chrysler chrysler not ahchrysler but youre going to make damned certain that there will be a trial wont you judge you would be advised to mind both your language and your manners the judge said sharply dont forget i have the power to remand you in gaol indefinitely once again your passport where is it i dont know lost i suppose where if i knew that it wouldnt be lost we are aware of that the judge said dryly but if we could localise the area we could notify the appropriate police stations where it might have been handed in when did you first notice you no longer had your passport and where were you at the time three days ago and you know as well as i do where i was at the time sitting in the diningroom of the la contessa motel eating my dinner and minding my own business when wild bill hickok here and his posse jumped me i gestured at the diminutive alpacacoated sheriff sitting in a canebottomed chair in front of the judges bench and thought that there could be no height barriers for the law enforcement officers of marble springs the sheriff and his elevator shoes together couldnt have topped five feet four like the judge the sheriff was a big disappointment to me while i had hardly expected a wild west lawman complete with frontier colt i had looked for something like either badge or gun but no badge no gun none that i could see the only gun in sight in the courthouse was a shortbarrelled colt revolver stuck in the holster of the police officer who stood behind and a couple of feet to the right of me they didnt jump you judge mollison was saying patiently they were looking for a prisoner who had escaped from the nearby camp of one of our state convict road forces marble springs is a small town and strangers easily identifiable you are a stranger it was natural natural i interruped look judge ive been talking to the gaoler he says the convict escaped at six oclock in the afternoon the lone ranger here picks me up at eight was i supposed to have escaped sawed off my irons had a bath shampoo manicure and shave had a tailor measure and fit a suit for me bought underclothes shirt and shoes such things have happened before the judge interrupted a desperate man with a gun or club and grown my hair three inches longer all in the space of two hours i finished it was dark in there judge the sheriff began but moilison waved him to silence you objected to being questioned and searched why as i said i was minding my own business i was in a respectable restaurant giving offence to no one and where i come from a man doesnt require a state permit to enable him to breathe and walk around he doesnt here either the judge said patiently all they wanted was a drivers licence insurance card socialsecurity card old letters any means of identification you could have complied with their request i was willing to then why this the judge nodded down at the sheriff i followed his glance even when id first seen him in the la contessa the sheriff had struck me as being something less than goodlooking and i had to admit that the large plasters on his forehead and across the chin and the comer of the mouth did nothing to improve him what else do you expect i shrugged when big boys start playing games little boys should stay home with mother the sheriff was halfway out of his seat eyes narrowed and ivoryknuckled fists gripping the cane arms of his chair but the judge waved him back impatiently the two gorillas he had with him started roughing me up it was selfdefence if they assaulted you the judge asked acidly how do you account for the fact that one of the officers is still in hospital with damaged knee ligaments and the other has a fractured cheekbone while you are still unmarked out of training judge the state of florida should spend more money on teaching its law officers to look after themselves maybe if they ate fewer hamburgers and drank less beer be silent there was a brief interval while the judge seemed to be regaining control of himself and i looked round the court again the schoolgirls were still goggleeyed this beat anything theyd ever had in their civics classes before the darkblonde in the front seat was looking at me with a curious halfpuzzled expression on her face as if she were trying to work out something behind her his gaze lost in infinity the man with the broken nose chewed on the stump of a dead cigar with machinelike regularity the court reporter seemed asleep the attendant at the door surveyed the scene with an olympian detachment beyond him through the open door i could see the harsh glare of the late afternoon sun on the dusty white street and beyond that again glimpsed through a straggling grove of palmettos the twinkling ripple of sunlight reflecting off the green water of the gulf of mexico the judge seemed to have recovered his composure we have established he said heavily that you are truculent intransigent insolent and a man of violence you also carry a gun a smallbore liliiput i believe it is called i could already commit you for contempt of court for assaulting and obstructing constables of the law in the course of the performance of their duties and for being in illegal possession of a lethal weapon but i wont he paused for a moment then went on we will have much more serious charges to prefer against you the court reporter opened one eye for a moment thought better of it and appeared to go to sleep again the man with the broken nose removed his cigar examined it replaced it and resumed his methodical champing i said nothing where were you before you came here the judge asked abruptly st catherine i didnt mean that but well how did you arrive here from st catherine by car describe it and the driver green saloon sedan youd call it middleaged businessman and his wife he was grey she was blonde thats all you can remember mollison asked politely thats all i suppose you realise that description would fit a million couples and their cars you know how it is i shrugged when youre not expecting to be questioned on what youve seen you dont bother quite quite he could be very acid this judge out of state car of course yes but not of course newly arrived in our country and already you know how to identify licence plates of he said he came from philadelphia i believe thats out of state the court reporter cleared his throat the judge quelled him with a cold stare then turned back to me and you came to st catherine from miami same car of course no bus the judge looked at the clerk of the court who shook his head slightly then turned back to me his expression was less than friendly youre not only a fluent and barefaced liar chrysler hed dropped the mister so i assumed the time for courtesies was past but a careless one theres no bus service from miami to st catherine you stayed the previous night in miami i nodded in a hotel he went on but of course you will have forgotten the name of that hotel well as a matter of fact spare us the judge held up his hand your effrontery passes all limits and this court will no longer be trifled with we have heard enough cars buses st catherine hotels miami lies all lies youve never been in miami in your life why do you think we kept you on remand for three days you tell me i encouraged him i shall to make extensive inquiries weve checked with the immigration authorities and every airline flying into miami your name wasnt on any passenger or aliens list and no one answering to your description was seen that day you would not be easily overlooked i knew what he meant all right i had the reddest hair and the blackest eyebrows id ever seen on anyone and the combination was rather startling id got used to it myself but i had to admit it took a bit of getting used to and when you added to that a permanent limp and a scar that ran from the comer of my right brow to the lobe of my right ear well when it came to identification i was the answer to the policemans prayer as far as we can discover the judge went on coldly youve spoken the truth once only once he broke off to look at the youth who had just opened the door leading to some chambers in the rear and lifted his eyebrows in fractional interrogation no impatience no irritation all very calm judge mollison was no pushover this just came for you sir the boy said nervously he showed an envelope radio message i thought bring it here the judge glanced at the envelope nodded at no one in particular then turned back to me as i say you told the truth just once you said you had come here from havana you did indeed you left this behind you there in the police station where you were being held for interrogation and trial he reached into a drawer and held up a small book blue and gold and white recognise it a british passport i said calmly i havent got telescopic eyes but i assume that it must be mine otherwise you wouldnt be making such a song and dance about it if you had it all the time then why we were merely trying to discover the degree of your mendacity which is pretty well complete and your trustworthiness which does not appear to exist he looked at me curiously surely you must know what this means if we have the passport we have much else besides you appear unmoved youre a very cool customer chrysler or very dangerous or can it be that you are just very stupid what do you want me to do i asked faint our police and immigration authorities happen for the moment at least to be on very good terms with their cuban colleagues he might never have heard my interjection our cables to havana have produced much more than this passport they have produced much interesting information your name is not chrysler its ford you have spent two and a half years in the west indies and are well known to the authorities in all of the principal islands fame judge when youve as many friends notoriety served three minor prison sentences in two years judge mollison was skimming through a paper he had in his hand no known means of support except three months working as consultant to a havana salvage and diving firm he looked up at me and in what ah capacity did you serve this firm i told em how deep the water was he regarded me thoughtfully then returned to his paper associate of criminals and smugglers he went on chiefly of criminals known to be engaged in the stealing and smuggling of precious stones and metal known to have fomented or attempted to foment labour troubles in nassau and manzanillo for ends suspected to be other than political deported from san juan haiti and venezuela declared persona non grata in jamaica and refused landing permit in nassau bahamas he broke off and looked at me a british subject and not even welcome in british territories sheer prejudice judge you have of course made an illegal entry into the united states judge mollison was a difficult man to knock off his stride how i dont pretend to know it happens constantly in those parts probably by key west and a landing at night somewhere between port charlotte and here it doesnt matter and so now in addition to assaulting officers of the law and carrying a gun without declaring it or possessing a licence for it you can be charged with illegal entry a man with your record could collect a stiff sentence for those ford however you wont not here at least i have consulted with the state immigration authorities and they agree with me that what best meets the case is deportation we wish no part of any person like you we understand from the cuban authorities that you broke custody while being held on a charge of inciting violence among dockworkers and on a further alleged charge of attempted shooting of the policeman who arrested you such offences carry heavy penalties in cuba the first charge is not an extraditable offence and on the second we have had no demand from the competent authorities however as i say we intend to work not under extradition laws but deportation laws and were deporting you to havana the proper authorities will be there to meet your plane when it lands tomorrow morning i stood still and said nothing the courtroom was very quiet presently i cleared my throat and said judge i think thats downright unkind of you it depends on the point of view he said indifferently he rose to go caught sight of the envelope the youth had brought in and said no wait a moment and sat down again slitting open the envelope he smiled bleakly at me as he extracted the flimsy sheets of paper we thought we would ask interpol to find out what was known about you in your own country although i hardly think now there will be any further useful information we have all we want no no i thought not nothing fresh here not known no longer listed wait a minute though the calm leisured voice rose to a sudden shout that brought the somnolent reporter jackinthebox bolt upright and sent him scurrying after notebook and pen that had spilled over the floor wait a minute he turned back to the first page of the cable b rue paulvalery paris he read rapidly your request received etc etc regret inform you no criminal listed in rotary card index under name of john chrysler could be any of four others under alias but unlikely identification impossible without cephalic index and fingerprints remarkable resemblance from your description to the late john montague talbot reasons for your request and demand for urgency unknown but enclosed please find summarised copy of salient features of talbots life regret unable help you further etc john montague talbot height feet inches weight lb deep red hair parted far over on left side deep blue eyes heavy black brows knife scar above right eye aquiline nose exceptionally even teeth carries left shoulder perceptibly higher than right owing to fairly severe limp the judge looked at me and i looked out the door i had to admit the description was not at all bad date of birth unknown probably early s place of birth unknown no record of war career graduated manchester university with bsc inengineering employed for three years by siebe gorman co he broke off looked sharply at me who are siebe gorman co never heard of them of course not but i have very wellknown european engineering firm specialising among other things in all types of diving equipment ties in rather neatly with your employment with a salvage and diving firm in havana doesnt it he obviously didnt expect an answer for he carried on reading at once specialised in salvage and deepwater recovery left siebe gorman joined dutch salvage firm from which dismissed after eighteen months following inquiries into whereabouts of two missing lb ingots worth dollars salvaged by firm in bombay harbour from the wreck of the ammunition and treasure ship fort

which sank off the lizard june carrying valuable cargo diamonds from amsterdam to new york salvaged jewels to the value of dollars were found to be missing talbot and moran traced to london arrested escaped from police wagon when talbot shot police officer with small concealed automatic police officer subsequently died i was leaning far forward now my hands gripped tightly on the edge of the box every eye was on me but i had eyes only for the judge there wasnt a sound to be heard in that stuffy courtroom except the drowsy murmur of flies high up near the ceiling and the soft sighing of a big overhead fan talbot and moran finally traced to riverside rubber warehouse judge mollison was reading slowly now almost haltingly as if he had to take time to appreciate the significance of what he was saying surrounded ignored order to surrender for two hours resisted all attempts by police armed with guns and teargas bombs to overcome them following explosion entire warehouse swept by uncontrollable fire of great intensity all exits guarded but no attempt at escape both men perished in fire twentyfour hours later firemen found no trace of moran believed to have been almost completely incinerated talbots charred remains positively identified by ruby ring worn on left hand brass buckles of shoes and german automatic which he was known to carry habitually the judges voice trailed off and he sat in silence several moments he looked at me wonderingly as if unable to credit what he saw blinked then slowly swivelled his gaze until he was looking at the little man in the cane chair a mm gun sheriff have you any idea i do the sheriffs face was cold and mean and hard and his voice exactly matched his expression what we call a automatic and as far as i know theres only one of that kind made a german lilliput which was what the prisoner was carrying when you arrested him it was a statement not a question and hes wearing a ruby ring on his left hand the judge shook his head again then looked at me for a long long moment you could see that disbelief was slowly giving way to inescapable conviction the leopard the criminal leopard never changes his spots wanted for murder perhaps two murders who knows what you did to your accomplice in that warehouse it was his body they found not yours the court was hushed and shocked and still a falling pin would have had the lot airborne a copkiller the sheriff licked his lips looked up at mollison and repeated the words in a whisper a copkiller hell swing for that in england wont he judge the judge was on balance again its not within the jurisdiction of this court to water the voice was mine and even to my own ears it sounded no more than a croak i was bent far over the side of the box swaying slightly propped up by one hand while i mopped my face with a handkerchief held in the other id had plenty of time to figure it out and i think i looked the way i think i ought to have looked at least i hoped i did i i think im going to pass out is there is there no water water the judge sounded halfimpatient halfsympathetic im afraid theres no over there i gasped i waved weakly to a spot on the other side of the officer who was guarding me please the policeman turned away id have been astonished if he hadnt and as he turned i pivoted on both toes and brought my left arm whipping across just below waist level three inches higher and that studded and heavily brassbuckled belt he wore around his middle would have left me needing a new pair of knuckles his explosive grunt of agony was still echoing through the shocked stillness of the courtroom when i spun him round as he started to fall snatched the heavy colt from his holster and was waving it gently around the room even before the policeman had struck the side of the box and slid coughing and gasping painfully for air to the wooden floor i took in the whole scene with one swift sweeping glance the man with the broken nose was staring at me with an expression as near amazement as his primitive features could register his mouth fallen open the mangled stub of his cigar clinging impossibly to the corner of his lower lip the girl with the darkblonde hair was bent forward wideeyed her hand to her face her thumb under her chin and her forefinger crooked across her mouth the judge was no longer a judge he was a waxen effigy of himself as motionless in his chair as if he had just come from the sculptors hands the clerk the reporter the door attendant were as rigid as the judge while the group of schoolgirls and the elderly spinster in charge were as goggleeyed as ever but the curiosity had gone from their faces and fear stepped in to take its place the teenager nearest me had her eyebrows arched high up into her forehead and her lips were trembling she looked as if she were going to start weeping or screaming any moment i hoped vaguely that it wasnt going to be screaming then an instant later i realised that it didnt matter for there was likely going to be a great deal of noise in the very near future indeed the sheriff hadnt been so unarmed as i had supposed he was reaching for his gun his draw was not quite the clean swift blurring action to which the cinema of my youth had accustomed me the long flapping tails of ms alpaca coat impeded his hand and he was further hindered by the arm of his cane chair fully four seconds elapsed before he reached the butt of his gun dont do it sheriff i said quickly this cannon in my hand is pointing right at you but the little mans courage or foolhardiness seemed to be an inverse proportion to his size you could tell by his eyes by the lips ever so slightly drawn back over the tightly clamped tobaccostained teeth that there was going to be no stopping him except in the only possible way at the full stretch of my arm i raised the revolver until the barrel was level with my eyes this business of deadeye dan snapshooting from the hip is strictly for the birds and as the sheriffs hand came clear of the folds of his jacket i squeezed the trigger the reverberating boom of that heavy colt magnified many times by the confining walls of that small courthouse quite obliterated any other sound whether the sheriff cried out or the bullet struck his hand or the gun in his hand no one could say all we could be sure of was what we saw and that was the sheriffs right arm and whole right side jerking convulsively and the gun spinning backwards to land on a table inches from the notebook of the startled reporter already my colt was lined up on the man at the door come and join us friend i invited you look as if you might be having ideas about fetching help i waited till he was halfway down the aisle then whirled round quickly as i heard a scuffling noise behind me there had been no need for haste the policeman was on his feet but that was all that could be said for him he was bent almost double one hand clutching his midriff the knuckles of the other all but brushing the floor he was whooping violently gasping for the breath to ease the pain in his body then he slowly straightened to a crouched stooping position and there was no fear in his face only hurt and anger and shame and a doordie determination call off your watchdog sheriff i said curtly hes liable to get hurt real bad next time the sheriff glared at me venomously and spat out one single unprintable word he was hunched in his chair left hand tightly gripping his right wrist he gave every impression of a man too preoccupied with his own hurt to worry about any damage to others give me that gun the policeman demanded hoarsely his throat seemed to be constricted he had difficulty in forcing out even those few words he had taken one lurching step forward and was no more than six feet away he was only a kid hardly a day over twentyone judge i said urgently dont do it donnelly judge mollison had shaken off the first numbing shock dont da it that mans a killer hes got nothing to lose by killing again stay where you are give me that gun judge mollison might have been talking to himself for all the effect his words had had donnellys voice was wooden unemotional the voice of a man whose decision lies so far behind him that it is no longer a decision but the sole obsessive reason for his existence stay where you are sonny i said quietly like the judge said i have nothing to lose take another step forward and im going to shoot you in the thigh have you any idea what a softnosed lowvelocity lead bullet does donnelly if it gets your thighbone itll smash it so badly that youll be like me and walk with a limp for the rest of your life if it gets the femoral artery youll like as not bleed to death before you fool for the second time the courtroom shook to the sharp crack and the hollow reverberations of the colt donnelly was on the floor both hands gripped round his lower thigh staring up at me with an expression compounded of incomprehension and dazed disbelief weve all got to learn sometime i said flatly i glanced at the doorway the shots were bound to have attracted attention but there was no one there not that i was anxious on this point apart from the two constables both of them temporarily unfit for duty who had jumped me at the la contessa the sheriff and donnelly constituted the entire police force of marble springs but even so delay was as foolish as it was dangerous you wont get far talbot the sheriffs thinlipped mouth twisted itself into exaggerated movements as he spoke through tightly clenched teeth within five minutes of you leaving every law officer in the county will be looking for you within fifteen minutes the call will be statewide he broke off wincing as a spasm of pain twisted his face and when he looked at me again his expression wasnt pretty the calls going out for a murderer talbot an armed murderer theyll have orders to shoot on sight and shoot to kill look now sheriff the judge began but got no further sorry judge hes mine the sheriff looked down at the policeman lying groaning on the floor the moment he took that gun he stopped being your business you better get going talbot you wont have far to run shoot to kill eh i said thoughtfully i looked round the court no no not the gentlemen they might start getting death or glory ideas about having medals pinned on them what the hell you talking about the sheriff demanded nor the young ladies of the high school hysteria i murmured i shook my head then looked at the girl with the darkblonde hair sorry miss itll have to be you what what do you mean maybe she was scared maybe she was just acting scared what do you want you you heard what the lone ranger said as soon as the cops see me theyre going to start shooting at everything in sight but they wouldnt shoot at a girl especially not at one as good looking as you im in a jam miss and i need an insurance policy youre it come on damn it talbot you cant do that judge mollison sounded hoarse frightened an innocent girl youd put her life in danger not me i pointed out if anybodys going to put her life in danger itll be the friends of the sheriff here but but miss ruthven is my guest i i invited her here this afternoon to contravention of the rules of the old southern hospitality i know emily post would have something to say about this i caught her by the arm pulled her none too gently to her feet and outside into the aisle hurry up miss we havent i dropped her arm and took one long step up the aisle clubbed pistol already reversed and swinging for some time now id had my eye on the brokennosed character three seats behind the girl and the play and shift of expression across the broken landscape of his neanderthalic features as he struggled to arrive at and finally make a decision couldnt have been more clearly indicated by ringing bells and coloured lights he was almost vertical and halfway out into the aisle with his right hand reaching deep under the lapel of his coat when the butt end of my colt caught his right elbow the impact jarred even my arm so i could only guess what it did to his quite a lot if his anguished howl and sudden collapse back into the bench were any criterion maybe id misjudged the man maybe hed only been reaching for another cigar that would teach him not to carry a cigarcase under his left armpit he was still making a great deal of noise when i hobbled my way swiftly up the aisle pulled the girl out into the porch slammed the door and locked it that would only give me ten seconds fifteen at the most but it was all i needed i grabbed the girls hand and ran down the path to the street there were two cars parked by the kerb one an open chevrolet without any official markings was the police car in which the sheriff donnelly and i had arrived at the court the other presumably judge mollisons a lowbuilt studebaker hawk the judges looked to be the faster car of the two but most of these american cars had automatic drive controls with which i was quite unfamiliar i didnt know how to drive a studebaker and the time it would take me to find out could b fatal on the other hand i did know how to operate the automatic drive on a chevrolet on the way up to the courthouse id sat up front beside the sheriff who drove and i hadnt missed a move he made get in i nodded my head in the direction of the police car fast i saw her open the door out of a corner of an eye while i spared a few moments for the studebaker the quickest and most effective way of immobilising any car is by smashing its distributor i spent three or four seconds hunting for the bonnet catch before i gave it up and turned my attention to the front tyre nearest me had it been a tubeless tyre and had i been carrying my usual automatic the smallcalibre steeljacketed bullet might have failed to make more than a tiny hole no sooner made than sealed as it was the mushrooming colt bullet split the sidewall wide open and the studebaker settled with a heavy bump the girl was already seated in the chevrolet without bothering to open the door i vaulted over the side into the drivingseat took one swift glance at the dashboard grabbed the white plastic handbag the girl held in her lap broke the catch and ripped the material in my hurry to open it and emptied the contents on the seat beside me the car keys were on the top of the pile which meant shed shoved them right to the bottom of her bag id have taken long odds that she was good and scared but longer odds still that she wasnt terrified i suppose you thought that was clever i switched on the motor pressed the automatic drive button released the handbrake and gunned the motor so savagely that the rear tyres spun and whined furiously on the loose gravel before getting traction try anything like that again and youll be sorry regard that as a promise i am a fairly experienced driver and where roadholding and handling are concerned i am no admirer of american cars but when it came to straightforward acceleration those big v engines could make the average british and european sports models look silly the chevrolet leapt forward as if it had been fitted with a rocketassisted takeoff i suspected that being a police car it might have had a hottedup engine and when id straightened it up and had time for a fast look in the mirror we were a hundred yards away from the courthouse i had time only for a glimpse of the judge and the sheriff running out on to the road staring after the chevrolet before a sharp rightangle bend came sweeping towards us a quick twist of the wheel to the right a fourwheel drift the back end breaking away another twist of the wheel to the left and then still accelerating we were clear of the town limits and heading into the open country chapter ii we were heading almost due north along the highway a white and dusty ribbon of road built up several feet above the level of the surrounding land away to our left the gulf of mexico glittered and twinkled like an opalescent emerald under the broiling sun between the road and the sea was a flat uninteresting belt of low mangrove coast to our right swampy forests not of palms or palmettos as i would have expected to find in those parts but pine and disheartenedlooking scrub pine at that i wasnt enjoying the ride i was pushing the chev along as fast as i dared and the soft swinging suspension gave me no feeling of security at all i had no sunglasses and even though the sun was not directly in my face the savage glare of subtropical light off that road was harsh and hurtful to the eyes it was an open car but the windscreen was so big and deeply curved that we got almost no cooling benefit at all from the wind whistling by our ears at over eighty miles an hour back in the courtroom the shade temperature had been close on a hundred what it was out here in the open i couldnt even begin to guess but it was hot furnace hot i wasnt enjoying the ride neither was the girl beside me she hadnt even bothered to replace the stuff id emptied out of her bag just sat there with her hands clasped tightly together now and again as we took a fast corner she reached out to grab the upper edge of the door but otherwise shed made no movement since wed left marble springs except to tie a white bandanna over her fair hair she didnt once look at me i didnt even know what colour her eyes were and she certainly didnt once speak to me once or twice i glanced at her and each time she was staring straight ahead lips compressed face pale a faint red patch burning high up in her left cheek she was still scared maybe more scared than ever maybe she was wondering what was going to happen to her i was wondering about that myself eight miles and eight minutes out of marble springs the expected happened somebody certainly seemed to have thought and moved even faster the expected was a roadblock it came at a point where some enterprising firm had built up the land to the right of the road with crashed stone and coral asphalted it and built a filling station and drivers pullup right across the road a car had been drawn up a big black police car if the two pivoting searchlights and the big red stop light were not enough the eightinch whitelettered police sign would have removed a doubt to the left just beyond the nose of the police car the land dropped sharply four or five feet into a ditch that lifted only slowly to the mangrove coast beyond there was no escape that way to the right where the road widened and angled into the courtyard of the filling station a vertically upright line of black corrugated fiftygallon oil drums completely blocked the space between the police car and the first of the line of petrol pumps that paralleled the road all this i saw in the four or five seconds it took me to bring the shuddering skidding chevrolet down from to mph the highpitched scream in our ears token of the black smoking trail of melted rubber that we were leaving on the white road behind us i saw too the policemen one crouched behind the bonnet of the police car a second with his head and right arm just visible above the boot both of them carried revolvers a third policeman was standing upright and almost completely hidden behind the nearest petrol pump but there was nothing hidden about his gun that most lethal of all closequarters weapons a whipper a sawnoff handgrip shotgun firing gauge mediumlead shot i was down to mph now not more than forty yards distant from the block the policemen guns levelled on my head were rising up and moving out into the open when out of the corner of my eye i caught a glimpse of the girl reaching for the handle of the door and halfturning away from me as she gathered herself for the leap out of the car i said nothing just leaned across grabbed her arm jerked her towards me with a savage force that made her gasp with pain and in the same instant that i transferred my grip to her shoulders and held her half against half in front of me so that the police dared not shoot jammed my foot flat down on the accelerator you madman youll kill us for a split second of time she stared at the row of fiftygallon drums rushing up to meet us the terror in her face accurately reflecting the terror in her voice then turned away with a cry and buried her face in my coat the nails of her hands digging into my upper arms we hit the second drum from the left fair and square with the centre of our fender subconsciously i tightened my grip on the girl and the steering wheel and braced myself for the numbing shattering shock the stunning impact that would crash me against the steeringwheel or pitch me through the windscreen as the lb dead weight of that drum sheared the chassis retaining bolts and smashed the engine back into the driving compartment but there was no such convulsive shock just a screeching of metal and a great hollow reverberating clang as the fender lifted the dram clear off the road a moment of shock when i thought the dram would be carried over the bonnet of the car to smash the windscreen and pin us to the seat with my free hand i jerked the wheel violently to the left and the cartwheeling drum bounced across the nearside wing and vanished from sight as i regained the road jerked the wheel in the opposite direction and straightened out the oil drum had been empty and not a shot had been fired slowly the girl lifted her head stared over my shoulder at the roadblock dwindling in the distance then stared at me her hands were still gripping both my shoulders but she was completely unaware of it youre mad i could hardly catch the husky whisper through the crescendo roar of the engine youre mad you must be crazy mad maybe she hadnt been terrified earlier on but she was now move over lady i requested youre blocking my view she moved perhaps six inches but her eyes sick with fear were still on me she was trembling violently youre mad she repeated please please let me out im not mad i was paying as much attention to my rear mirror as to the road ahead i think a little miss ruthven and im observant they couldnt have had more than a couple of minutes to prepare that roadblock and it takes more than a couple of minutes to bring six full drums out of store and manhandle them into position the drum i hit had its filling hole turned towards me and there was no bung it had to be empty and as for letting you out well im afraid i cant spare the tune take a look behind you she looked they theyre coming after us what did you expect them to do go into the restaurant and have a cup of coffee the road was closer to the sea now and winding to follow the indentations of the coast traffic was fairly light but enough to hold me back from overtaking on some blind corners and the police car behind was steadily gaining on me the driver knew his car better than i did mine and the road he obviously knew like the back of his hand ten minutes from the roadblock he had crept up to within a hundred and fifty yards of us the girl had been watching the pursuing car for the past few minutes now she turned and stared at me she made an effort to keep her voice steady and almost succeeded whats whats going to happen now anything i said briefly theyll likely play rough i dont think they can be any too pleased with what happened back there even as i finished speaking there came in quick succession two or three whiplike cracks clearly audible above the whine of the tyres and the roar of the engine a glance at the girls face told me i didnt need to spell out what was happening she knew ae right get down i ordered thats it right down on the floor your head too whether its bullets or a crash your best chance is down there when she was crouched so low that all i could see was her shoulders and the back of her blonde head i eased the revolver out of my pocket abruptly removed my foot from the accelerator grabbed for the handbrake and hauled hard with no telltale warning from the footoperated braking lights the slowing down of the chevrolet was as unexpected as it was abrupt and the screech of tyres and violent slewing of the pursuing police car showed that the driver had been caught completely off balance i loosed off one quick shot and as i did the windscreen in front of me shattered and starred as a bullet went clear through the centre of it i fired a second time and the police car skidded wildly and finished up almost broadside across the road the nearside front wheel into the ditch on the righthand side of the road it was the sort of uncontrollable skid that might have come from a front tyre blowout certainly no harm had come to the policemen inside within a couple of seconds of hitting the ditch all three were out on the road squeezing off shots after us as fast as they could pull the triggers but we were already a hundred a hundred and fifty yards away and for all the value of revolvers and riot guns in distance work of this kind they might as well have been throwing stones at us in a few seconds we rounded a curve and they were lost to sight all right i said the wars over you can get up miss ruthven she straightened and pushed herself back on the seat some darkblonde hair had fallen forward over her face so she took off her bandanna fixed her hair and pulled the bandanna on again women i thought if they fell over a cliff and thought there was company waiting at the bottom theyd comb their hair on the way down when shed finished tying the knot under her chin she said in a subdued voice without looking at me thank you for making me get down i i might have been killed there you might i agreed indifferently but i was thinking about myself lady not you your continued good health is very closely bound up with mine without a real live insurance policy beside me theyd use anything from a hand grenade to a inch naval gun to stop me they were trying to hit us then they were trying to kill us the tremor was back in her voice again as she nodded at the bullet hole in the screen i was sitting in line with that so you were chance in a thousand they must have had orders not to fire indiscriminately but maybe they were so mad at what happened back at the roadblock that they forgot their orders likely that they were after one of our rear tyres hard to shoot well from a fastmoving car or maybe they just cant shoot well anyway approaching traffic was still light maybe two or three cars to the mile but even that was too much for my peace of mind most of the cars were filled with family groups out of state vacationers and like all vacationers they were not only curious about everything they saw but obviously had the time and the inclination to indulge their curiosity every other car slowed down as it approached us and in my rearview mirror i saw the stop lights of three or four of them come on as the driver tramped on the brakes and the occupants twisted round in their seats hollywood and a thousand tv films had made a bulletscarred windscreen an object readily identifiable by millions this was disturbing enough worse still was the near certainty that any minute now every local radio station within a hundred miles would be broadcasting the news of what had happened back at the marble springs courthouse together with a complete description of the chevrolet myself and the blonde girl beside me the chances were that at least half of those cars approaching me had their radios tuned in to one of those local stations with their interminable record programmes mcd by disc jockeys with fixations about guitars and hillbilly country music the inevitable news flash then all it needed was for one of those cars to be driven by a halfwit out to show ms wife and children what a hero he really was all the time although they had never suspected it i picked up the girls still empty handbag stuck my right hand inside it made a fist and smashed away the centre of the laminated safety plate glass the hole was now a hundred times bigger than before but not nearly so conspicuous in those days of stressed and curved glass mysteriously shattered windscreens were not so unknown as to give rise to much comment a flying pebble a sudden change of temperature even a loud enough sound at a critical frequency any of those could blow out a screen but it wasnt enough i knew it wasnt enough and when an excited fasttalking voice broke into the soapopera on the chevs radio and gave a concise if highlycoloured account of my escape warning all highway users to look out for and report the chev i knew that i would have to abandon the car and at once it was too hot and on this the only main northsouth route the chances of escaping detection just didnt exist i had to have a new car and had to have it fast i got one almost at once we had been passing through one of those new towns which mushroom by the score along the seaboards of florida when i heard the flash and less than two hundred yards beyond the limits we came to a layby on the shore side of the road there were three cars there and obviously they had been travelling in company for through a gap in the trees and low scrub that curved round the layby i could see a group of seven or eight people picking their way down to the shore about three hundred yards away they were carrying with them a barbecue grill a cooking stove and luncheon baskets they looked as if they intended making a stay i jumped out of the chev taking the girl with me and quickly checked all three cars two were convertibles a third a sports car and all were open there were no ignition keys in any of the locks but the sports car owner as many do had a spare set in a cubbyhole by the steering column hidden only by a folded chamois cloth i could just have driven off leaving the police car there but that would have been stupid as long as the chevs whereabouts remained unknown the search would be concentrated exclusively on it and little attention would be paid to the common car thief who had taken the other but if the chev were found in the layby then the statewide search would immediately be switched to the sports car thirty seconds later i had the chev back at the limits of the new town slowing down as i came to the first of the all but completed splitlevels on the shore side of the road there was no one around and i didnt hesitate i turned in on the concreted drive of the first house drove straight in under the open tipup door of the garage shut off the engine and quickly closed the garage door when we emerged from the garage two or three minutes later anyone looking for us would have looked a second or third time before getting suspicious by coincidence the girl had been wearing a shortsleeved green blouse of exactly the same shade of colour as my suit a fact that had been repeated twice over the radio a fast check point and a dead giveaway but now the blouse was gone and the white suntop shed on beneath it was worn by so many girls that blazing summer afternoon that shed subtly merged her identity with those of a thousand other women her blouse was tucked inside my coat my coat was inside out over my arm with only the grey lining showing and my necktie was in my pocket id taken the bandanna from her wrapped it kerchiefwise over my head the loose ends of the knot hanging down the righthand side in front all but obscuring my scar the red hair showing at the temples was still a giveaway and while by the time i had finished smearing it with her moistened mascara pencil it didnt look like any hair i had ever seen at least it didnt look red under the blouse and coat i carried the gun walking slowly so as to minimise my limp we reached the sports car in three minutes this too like the one wed just tucked away in the garage was a chevrolet with the same engine as the other but there the resemblance ended it was a plasticbodied twoseater id driven one in europe and i knew that the claims for mph were founded on fact i waited till a heavy gravel truck came grinding past from the north started the corvettes engine under the sound of its passing the group of people id seen earlier were on the shoreline now but they might just have heard the distinctive note of this cars engine and might just have been suspicious made a fast uturn and took off after the heavy truck i noticed the startled expression on the girls face as we drove off in the direction from which wed just come i know go on say it im crazy only im not crazy the next roadblock wont be so very far to the north now and itll be no hurried makeshift affair like the last time itll stop a fifty ton tank maybe theyll guess that ill guess that maybe theyll conclude that ill leave this road and make for the sideroads and dirttracks in the swamplands to the east there anyway thats what id figure in their place good country for going to ground so well just go south they wont figure on that and then well hide up for a few hours hide up where where can you hide up i didnt answer her question and she went on let me go please you youre quite safe now you must be you must be sure of yourself or you wouldnt be heading this way please dont be silly i said wearily let you go and within ten minutes every cop in the state will know what kind of car im driving and where im heading you must think im crazy but you cant trust me she persisted i hadnt shot anybody in twenty minutes she wasnt scared any longer at least not too scared to work things out how do you know i wont make signs at people or shout out when you do nothing about it like at traffic lights or or hit you when youre not looking how do you know that cop donnelly i said apropos of nothing i wonder if the doctors got to him in time she got my point the colour that had come back to her face drained out of it again but she had the best kind of courage or maybe the worst kind the kind that gets you into trouble my father is a sick man mr talbot it was the first time shed used my name and i appreciated the mister im terribly afraid of what will happen to him when he hears this he well he has a very bad heart and and i have a wife and four starving kiddies i interrupted we can wipe each others tears away be quiet she said nothing not even when i pulled up at a drugstore a few moments later went inside and made a short phone call she was with me far enough away not to hear what i was saying but near enough to see the shape of the gun under my folded coat on the way out i bought cigarettes the clerk looked at me then at the corvette roadster parked outside hot day for driving mister come far only from chilicoote lake id seen the turnoff sign three or four miles to the north my efforts at an american accent made me wince fishing fishing eh the tone was neutral enough which was more than could be said for the halfleer in his eyes as he looked over the girl by my side but my sir galahad instincts were in abeyance that afternoon so i let it pass catch anything some i had no idea what fish if any were in the local lakes and when i came to think of it it seemed unlikely that anyone should take off for those shallow swampy lakes when the whole of the gulf of mexico lay at his front door lost em though my voice sharpened in remembered anger just put the basket down on the road for a moment when some crazy idiot comes past doing eighty knocked basket and fish to hell and breakfast and so much dust on those side roads i couldnt even catch his number you get em everywhere his eyes suddenly focused on a point a hundred miles away then he said quickly what kind of car mister blue chev broken windscreen why whats the matter whats the matter he asks do you mean to tell me you havent did you see the guy drivin it no too fast just that he had a lot of red hair but red hair chilicoote lake brother he turned and ran for the phone we went out into the sunshine the girl said you dont miss much do you how how can you be so cool he might have recognised get into the car recognise me he was too busy looking at you when they made that suntop i guess they ran out of material but just decided to go ahead and finish it off anyway we got in and drove off four miles farther on we came to the place i had noticed on the way up it was a palmshaded parkinglot between the road and the shore and a big sign hung under a temporary wooden archway codell construction company it read then underneath in bigger lettering sidewalk superintendents drive right in i drove right in there were fifteen maybe twenty cars already parked inside some people sitting on the benches provided but most of them still in the seats of their cars they were all watching the construction of foundations designed to take a seaward extension of a new town four big draglines caterpillarmounted power shovels were crawling slowly ponderously around tearing up underwater coral rock from the bay bottom building up a solid wide foundation then crawling out on the pier just constructed and tearing up more coral rock one was building a wide strip straight out to sea this would be the new street of the community two others were making small piers at right angles to the main one those would be for house lots each house with its own private landingstage a fourth was making a big loop to the north curving back into land again a yacht harbour probably it was a fascinating process to watch this making of a town out of the bottom of the sea only i was in no mood to be fascinated i parked the car between a couple of empty convertibles opened the pack of cigarettes id just bought and lit one the girl had halfturned in her seat and was staring at me incredulously is this the place you meant when you said wed go somewhere to hide up this is it i assured her youre going to stay here whats it look like to you with all those people around where everyone can see you twenty yards off the road where every passing police patrol see what i mean everyone would think the same as you this is the last place any hunted man in his senses would think of coming so its the ideal place so here we stay you cant stay here for ever she said steadily no i agreed just till it gets dark move closer miss ruthven real close a man fleeing for his life miss ruthven what picture does that conjure up an exhausted wildeyed individual crashing through the high timber or plunging up to his armpits through some of the choicer florida swamps certainly not sitting hi the sunshine getting all close and confidential with a pretty girl nothing in the world less calculated to arouse suspicion is there move over lady i wish i had that gun in my hand she said quietly i dont doubt it move over she moved i felt the uncontrollable shudder of revulsion as her bare shoulder touched mine i tried to imagine how i would feel if i were a pretty young girl in the company of a murderer but it was too difficult i wasnt a girl i wasnt even particularly young or goodlooking so i gave it up showed her the gun under the coat lying over my knees and sat back to enjoy the light onshore breeze that tempered the sunlight filtering through the fronds of the rustling palm trees but it didnt look as if the sunlight would be with us too long that sea breeze being pulled in by the sunscorched land was laden with moisture and already the tiny white scraps of cloud that had been drifting across the sky were building and thickening up into grey cumulus i didnt like that much i wanted to have the excuse to keep wearing the bandanna on my head maybe ten minutes after we arrived a black police car came along the highway from the south i watched in the rearview mirror as it slowed down and two policemen put their heads out to give the parkinglot a quick onceover but their scrutiny was as cursory as it was swift you could see they didnt really expect to see anything interesting and the car pulled away before its speed had dropped to walking pace the hope in the girls eyes they were grey and cool and clear i could see now died out like a snuffed candleflame the rounding and drooping of her sunburned shoulders unmistakable half an hour later the hope was back two motorcycle cops helmeted gauntleted very tough and very competent swept in under the archway in perfect unison stopped in perfect unison and killed their motors on the same instant for a few seconds they sat there high gleaming boots astride on the ground then they dismounted kicked down the rests and started moving round the cars one of them had his revolver in his hand they started at the car nearest the entrance with only a quick glance for the car itself but a long penetrating wordless stare for the occupants they werent doing any explaining and they werent doing any apologising they looked like cops might look if they had heard that another cop had been shot and was dying or dead suddenly they skipped two or three cars and came straight at us at least that seemed to be their intention but they skirted us and headed for a ford to the left and ahead of us as they passed by i felt the girl stiffening saw her taking a quick deep breath dont do it i flung an arm around her and grabbed her tight the breath shed meant for the warning shout was expelled in a gasp of pain the policeman nearest turned round and saw the girls face buried between my shoulder and neck and looked away again having seen what he thought hed seen he made a remark to his companion that wasnt as sotto voce as it might have been and might have called for action in normal circumstances but the circumstances werent normal i let it go when i released the girl her face was red practically all the way down to the suntop pressed in against my neck she hadnt been getting much air but i think it was the policemans remark that was responsible for most of the colour her eyes were wild for the first time shed stopped being scared and was fighting mad im going to turn you in her voice was soft implacable give yourself up the policeman had checked the ford the driver had been dressed in a green jacket the same colour as mine with a panama hat jammed far down on his head id seen him as hed driven in his hair was black and his tanned face moustached and chubby but the police hadnt moved on they were no more than five yards away but the tearing and growling of the big draglines covered our soft voices dont be a fool i said quietly i have a gun and theres only one bullet in it she was right two slugs gone in the courthouse one blowing out the tyre in the judges studebaker and two when the police car was chasing us quite the little counter arent you i murmured youll have plenty of time to practice counting in hospital after the surgeons have fixed you up if they can fix you up she looked at me her lips parted and said nothing one little slug but what an awful mess it can make i brought the gun forward under the coat pressed it against her you heard me telling that fool donnelly what a soft lead slug can do this barrel is against your hipbone do you realise what that means my voice was very low now very menacing itd shatter that bone beyond repair it means youll never walk again miss ruthven youll never run or dance or swim or sit horse again all the rest of your life youll have to drag that beautiful body of yours about on a pair of crutches or in a bath chair and in pain all the time all the days of your life still going to shout to the cops she said nothing at first her face was empty of colour even her lips were pale do you believe me i asked softly i believe you so so im going to call them she said simply maybe youll cripple me but theyll surely get you and then you can never kill again i have to do it your noble sentiments do you credit miss ruthven the jeer in my voice was no reflection of the thoughts in my mind she was going to do what i wouldnt have done go and call them watch them die she stared at me what what do you mean youve only one bullet and its no longer for you first squawk out of you lady and that cop with the gun in his hand gets it he gets it right through the middle of the chest im pretty good with one of these colts you saw how i shot the gun out of the sheriffs hands but im taking no chances through the chest then i hold up the other cop therell be no trouble about that his own gun is still buttoned down he knows im a killer and he doesnt know that my gun will be empty take his gun wing him with it and go off i smiled i dont think anyone will try to stop me but but ill tell him your guns empty ill tell you come first lady an elbow in the solar plexus and you wont be able to tell anybody anything for the next five minutes there was a long silence the cops were still there then she said in a small voice youd do it wouldnt you theres only one way to find out the answer to that one i hate you there was no expression in her voice the clear grey eyes were dark with despair and defeat i never thought i could hate anyone so much it it scares me stay scared and stay alive i watched the policemen finish their tour of the parkinglot walk slowly back to their motorbikes and ride away the late afternoon wore slowly on the dragliners growled and crunched and crawled their implacable way out towards the sea the sidewalk superintendents came and went but mostly went and soon there was only a couple of cars left in the parkinglot ours and the ford belonging to the man in the green coat and then the steadily darkening cumulus sky reached its final ominous indigo colour and the rain came it came with the violence of all subtropical storms and before i could get the unaccustomed hood up my thin cotton shirt was as wet as if i had been in the sea when id wound up the sidescreens and looked in the mirror i saw that my face was streaked with black lines from temple to chin the mascara on my hair had almost washed out i scrubbed as clean as i could with my handkerchief then looked at my watch with the dark cloud obscuring the sky from horizon to horizon evening had come before its time already the cars swishing by on the highway had their sidelights on although it was still more day than night i started the engine you were going to wait until it was dark the girl sounded startled maybe shed been expecting more cops smarter cops to come along i was i admitted but by this time mr chas brooks is going to be doing a song and dance act a few miles back on the highway his language will be colourful mr chas brooks from her tone i wondered if she really thought i was crazy of pittsburg california i tapped the licence tag on the steering column a long way to come to have your car hijacked i lifted my eyes to the machinegun symphony of the heavy rain drumming on the canvas roof you dont think hell still be grilling and barbecueing down on the beach in this little lot do you i pulled out through the makeshift archway and turned right on the highway when she spoke this time i knew she really did think i was crazy marble springs a pause then youre going back there it was question and statement both right to the motel la contessa where the cops picked me up i left some stuff there and i want to collect it this time she said nothing maybe she thought crazy a completely inadequate word i pulled off the bandanna in the deepening dusk that white gleam on my head was more conspicuous than my red hair and went on last place theyll ever think to find me im going to spend the night there maybe several nights until i find me a boat out so are you i ignored the involuntary exclamation thats the phone call i made back at the drugstore i asked if room was vacant they said yes so i said id take it friends whod passed through had recommended it as having the nicest view in the motel in point of fact it has the nicest view its also the most private room at the seaward end of a long block its right beside the closet where they put my case away when the cops pinched me and it has a nice private little garage where i can stow this machine away and no one will ever ask a question a mile passed two miles three and she said nothing shed put her green blouse back on but it was a lacy scrap of nothing shed got just as wet as i had when i was trying to fix the roof and she was having repeated bouts of shivering the rain had made the air cool we were approaching the outskirts of marble springs when she spoke you cant do it how can you youve got to check in or sign a book or pick up keys or have to go to the restaurant you cant just yes i can i asked them to have the place opened up ready for us keys in the garage and room doors and that wed check in later i said wed come a long way since dawn that we were bushed and that wed appreciate room service for meals and a little privacy i cleared my throat i told the receptionist we were a honeymoon couple she seemed to understand our request for privacy we were there before she could find an answer i turned in through an ornate lilacpainted gateway and drew up near the reception hallway in the central block parking the car directly under a powerful floodlarnp which threw such black shadows that my red hair would be all but invisible under the car roof over by the entrance stood a negro dressed in a lilac blue and goldbuttoned uniform that had been designed by a colourblind man wearing smoked glasses i called him across room i asked which way please mr brooks i nodded and he went on ive left all the keys ready down this way thank you i looked at him grey and bent and thin and the faded old eyes the clouded mirrors of a thousand sorrows and defeats whats your name charles sir i want some whisky charles i passed money across scotch not bourbon and some brandy can you right away sir thanks i let in the gear drove down the block to no it was at the end of a narrow peninsula between the gulf to the left and a kidneyshaped swimming pool to the right the garage door was open and i drove straight in switched off the car lights closed the sliding door in the neardarkness then switched on the overhead light fear is the key at the inner end of the left hand wall a single door led off the garage we went through this into a kitchenette neat hygienic and superbly equipped if all you wanted was a cup of coffee and had all night to make it a door led off this into the bedsittingroom lilac carpet lilac drapes lilac bedspread lilac lampshades lilac seatcovers the same excruciating motif wherever you looked somebody had liked lilac two doors off this room to the left let into the same wall as the kitchen door the door to the bathroom at the far end the door leading into the corridor i was in this corridor within ten seconds of arriving in the room dragging the girl after me the closet was no more than six feet away unlocked and my bag still where it had been left i carried it back to the room unlocked it and was about to start throwing some stuff on the bed when a knock came to the door that will be charles i murmured open the door stand well back take the bottles tell him to keep the change dont try to whisper make signs or any clever little jumps out into the middle of the corridor ill be watching you from the crack of the bathroom door and my gun will be lined up on your back she didnt try any of those things i think she was too cold miserable and exhausted by the accumulated tension of the day to try anything the old man handed over the bottles took the change with a surprised murmur of thanks and closed the door softly behind him youre frozen and shivering i said abruptly i dont want my insurance policy to go catching pneumonia i fetched a couple of glasses some brandy miss ruthven then a hot bath maybe youll find something dry in my case youre very kind she said bitterly but ill take the brandy no bath huh no a hesitant pause a glint in her eye more imagined than seen and i knew id been mistaken in imagining her to be too worn out to try anything yes that too right i waited till shed finished her glass dumped my case on the bathroom floor and stood to let her pass dont be all night im hungry the door closed and the key clicked in the lock there came the sound of water running into the bath then all the unmistakable soaping and splashing sounds of someone having a bath all meant to lull any suspicions then came the sound of someone towelling themselves and when a minute or two later there came the furious gurgling of water running out of the waste pipe i eased myself off the door passed through the two kitchen doors and outside garage door just in time to see the bathroom window open and a little cloud of steam come gushing out i caught her arm as she lowered herself to the ground stifled the frightened gasp with my free hand and led her back inside i closed the kitchen door and looked at her she looked fresh and scrubbed and clean and had one of my white shirts tucked into the waistband of her dirndl she had tears of mortification in her eyes and defeat in her face but for all that it was a face worth looking at despite our long hours in the car together it was the first time i had really looked at it she had wonderful hair thick and gleaming and parted in the middle and of the same wheat colour and worn in the same braids as that often seen in girls from the east baltic states or what used to be the baltic states but she would never win a miss america contest she had too much character in her face for that she wouldnt even have been in the running for miss marble springs the face was slightly slavonic the cheekbones too high and wide the mouth too full the still grey eyes set too far apart and the nose definitely retrousse a mobile and intelligent face a face i guessed that could move easily into sympathy and kindness and humour and laughter when the weariness was gone and the fear taken away in the days before i had given up the dream of my own slippers and my own fireside this was the face that would have fitted the dream she was the sort of person who would wear well the sort of person who would still be part of you long after the synthetic chromium polished blondes from the production lines of the glamour factory had you climbing up the walls i was just standing there feeling a little sorry for her and feeling a little sorry for myself when i felt a cold draught on the back of my neck it came from the direction of the bathroom door and ten seconds ago that bathroom door had been closed and locked but it wasnt now chapter iii it didnt require the sudden widening of the girls eyes to tell me that i wasnt imagining that cold draught on the back of my neck a cloud of steam from the overheated bathroom drifted past my right ear a little bit too much to have escaped through the keyhole of a locked door about a thousand times too much i turned slowly keeping my hands well away from my sides maybe i would try something clever later but not now the first thing i noticed was the gun in his hand and it wasnt the sort of gun a beginner carries around with him a big dull black german mauser one of those economical guns the bullet goes clear through three people at once the second thing i noticed was that the bathroom doorway seemed to have shrunk since id seen it last his shoulders didnt quite touch both sides of the doorway but that was only because it was a wide doorway his hat certainly touched the lintel the third thing i noticed was the kind of hat he wore and the colour of the jacket a panama hat a green jacket it was our friend and neighbour from the ford that had been parked beside us earlier that afternoon he reached behind him with his left hand and softly closed the bathroom door you shouldnt leave windows open let me have your gun his voice was quiet and deep but there was nothing stagy or menacing about it you could see it was the way he normally spoke gun i tried to look baffled look talbot he said pleasantly i suspect were both what you might call professionals i suggest we cut the unnecessary dialogue gun the thing youre carrying in your right coat pocket there with the finger and thumb of the left hand so now drop it on the carpet thank you i kicked the gun across to him without being told i didnt want him to think i wasnt a professional too now sit down he said he smiled at me and i could see now that his face wasnt chubby unless you could call a lump of rock chubby it was just broad and looked as if you could bounce a two by four off it without achieving very much the narrow black moustache and the thin almost grecian nose looked out of place as incongruous almost as the laughter lines round the eyes and on either side of the mouth i didnt place much store on the laughter lines maybe he only practised smiling when he was beating someone over the head with a gun you recognised me in the parkinglot i asked no he broke open the colt with his left hand ejected the remaining shell closed the gun and with a careless flick of his wrist sent it spinning ten feet to land smack in the waste paper basket he looked at if he could do this sort of thing ten times out of ten everything this man tried would always come off if he was as good as this with his left hand what could he do with his right id never seen you before this afternoon id never even heard of you when first i saw you in the lot he continued but id seen and heard of this young lady here a hundred times youre a limey or youd have heard of her too maybe you have but dont know who you got there you wouldnt be the first person to be fooled by her no makeup no accent hair in kids plaits and you only look and behave like that either if youve given up competing or if theres no one left to compete against he looked at the girl and smiled again for mary blair ruthven theres no competition left when youre as socially acceptable as she is and your old man is who he is then you can dispense with your bryn mawr accent and the antonio hairdo thats for those who need them and her old man such ignorance blair ruthven general blair ruthven youve heard of the four hundred well hes the guy that keeps the register youve heard of the mayflower it was old ruthvens ancestors who gave the pilgrims permission to land and excepting maybe paul getty hes the richest oil man in the united states i made no comment there didnt seem to be any that would meet the case i wondered what hed say if i told him of my pipedream of slippers a fire and a multimillion heiress instead i said and you had your radio switched on in the parkinglot i hear it and then a news flash thats it he agreed cheerfully who are you it was mary blair speaking for the first time since hed entered and that was what being in the top per cent of the four hundred did for you you didnt swoon you didnt murmur thank god in a broken voice you didnt burst into tears and fling your arms round your rescuers neck you just gave him a nice friendly smile which showed he was your equal even if you know quite well he wasnt and said who are you jablonsky miss herman jablonsky i suppose you came over in the mayflower too i said sourly i looked consideringly at the girl millions and millions of dollars eh thats a lot of money to be walking around anyway that explains away valentino valentino you could see she still thought i was crazy the brokenfaced gorilla behind you in the courtroom if your old man shows as much judgment in picking oilwells as he does in picking bodyguards youre going to be on relief pretty soon hes not my usual she bit her lip and something like a shadow of pain touched those clear grey eyes mr jablonsky i owe you a great deal jablonsky smiled again and said nothing he fished out a pack of cigarettes tapped the bottom extracted one with his teeth bent back a cardboard match in a paper folder then threw cigarettes and matches across to me thats how the highclass boys operated today civilised courteous observing all the little niceties theyd have made the hoodlums of the thirties feel slightly ill which made a man like jablonsky all the more dangerous like an iceberg seveneighths of his lethal menace was out of sight the oldtime hoodlums couldnt even have begun to cope with him i take it you are prepared to use that gun mary blair went on she wasnt as cool and composed as she appeared and sounded i could see a pulse beating in her neck and it was going like a racing car i mean this man cant do anything to me now nary a thing jablonsky assured her thank you a little sigh escaped her as if it wasnt until that moment that she really believed her terror was over that there was nothing more to fear she moved across the room ill phone the police no jablonsky said quietly she broke step i beg your pardon i said no jablonsky murmured no phone no police i think well leave the law out of it what on earth do you mean again i could see a couple of red spots burning high up in her cheeks the last time id seen those it had been fear that had put them there this time it looked like the first stirrings of anger when your old man had lost count of the number of oilwells he owned people didnt cross your path very often we must have the police she went on speaking slowly and patiently like someone explaining something to a child this man is a criminal a wanted criminal and a murderer he killed a man in london and in marble springs jablonsky said quietly patrolman donnelly died at fiveforty this afternoon donnelly died her voice was a whisper are you sure six oclock newscast got it just before i tailed you out of the parkinglot surgeons transfusions the lot he died how horrible she looked at me but it was no more than a flickering glance she couldnt bear the sight of me and and you say dont bring the police what do you mean what i say the big man said equably no law mr jablonsky has ideas of his own miss ruthven i said dryly the result of your trial is a foregone conclusion jablonsky said to me tonelessly for a man with three weeks to live you take things pretty coolly dont touch that phone miss you wouldnt shoot me she was already across the room youre no murderer i wouldnt shoot you he agreed i dont have to he reached her in three long strides be could move as quickly and softly as a cat took the phone from her caught her arm and led her back to a chair beside me she tried to struggle free but jablonsky didnt even notice it you dont want law eh i asked thoughtfully kind of cramps your style a little bit friend meaning i dont want company he murmured meaning maybe i would be awful reluctant to fire this gun meaning just that i wouldnt gamble on it he smiled i gambled i had my feet gathered under me and my hands on the arms of the chair the back of my chair was solidly against the wall and i took off in a dive that was almost parallel to the floor arrowing on for a spot about six inches below his breastbone i never got there id wondered what he could do with his right hand and now i found out with his right hand he could change his gun over to his left whip a sap from his coat pocket and hit a diving man over the head faster than anyone id ever known hed been expecting something like that from me sure but it was still quite a performance by and by someone threw cold water over me and i sat up with a groan and tried to clutch the top of my head with both hands tied behind your back its impossible to clutch the top of your head so i let my head look after itself climbed shakily to my feet by pressing my bound hands against the wall at my back and staggered over to the nearest chair i looked at jablonsky and he was busy screwing a perforated black metal cylinder on to the barrel of the mauser he looked at me and smiled he was always smiling i might not be so lucky a second time he said diffidently i scowled miss ruthven he went on im going to use the phone why tell me she was picking up my manners and they didnt suit her at all because im going to phone your father i want you to tell me his number it wont be listed why should you phone him theres a reward out for our friend here jablonsky replied obliquely it was announced right after the newscast of donnellys death the state will pay dollars for any information leading to the arrest of john montague talbot he smiled at me montague eh well i believe i prefer it to cecil get on with it i said coldly they must have declared open season on mr talbot jablonsky said they want him dead or alive and dont much care which and general ruthven has offered to double that reward ten thousand dollars i asked ten thousand piker i growled at the last count old man ruthven was worth million dollars he might jablonsky agreed judiciously have offered more a total of fifteen thousand whats fifteen thousand go on said the girl there was a glint in those grey eyes now he can have his daughter back for fifty thousand bucks jablonsky said coolly fifty thousand her voice was almost a gasp if shed been as poor as me she would have gasped jablonsky nodded yes of course the fifteen thousand ill collect for turning talbot in as any good citizen should who are you the girl demanded shakily she didnt look as if she could take much more of this what are you im a guy that wants let me see yes sixtyfive thousand bucks but this is blackmail blackmail jablonsky lifted an eyebrow you want to read up some law girlie in its strict legal sense blackmail is hushmoney a tribute paid to buy immunity money extorted by the threat of telling everyone what a heel the blackmailee is has general ruthven anything to hide i doubt it or you might just say that blackmail is demanding money with menaces wheres the menace im not menacing you if your old man doesnt pay up ill just walk away and leave you to talbot here who can blame me im scared of talbot hes a dangerous man hes a killer but but then you would get nothing id get it jablonsky said comfortably i tried to imagine this character flustered or unsure of himself it was impossible only a threat your old man wouldnt dare gamble i wouldnt do it hell pay all right kidnapping is a federal offence the girl began slowly so it is jablonsky agreed cheerfully the hot chair or the gas chamber thats for talbot he kidnapped you all im doing is talking about leaving you no kidnapping there his voice hardened what hotel is your father hes not at any hotel her voice was flat and toneless and shed given up hes out on the x talk sense jablonsky said curtly x is one of his oil rigs its out in the gulf twelve maybe fifteen miles from here i dont know out in the gulf you mean one of those floating platforms for drilling for oil i thought they were all up off the bayou country off louisiana theyre all round now off mississippi alabama and florida dads got one right down near key west and they dont float they oh what does it matter hes on x no phone huh yes a submarine cable and a radio from the shore office no radio too public the phone just ask the operator for the x huh she nodded without speaking and jablonsky crossed to the phone asked the motel switchboard girl for the exchange asked for the x and stood there waiting whistling in a peculiarly tuneless fashion until a sudden thought occurred to him how does your father commute between the rig and shore boat or helicopter usually helicopter what hotel does he stay at when hes ashore not a hotel just an ordinary family house hes got a permanent lease on a place about two miles south of marble springs jablonsky nodded and resumed his whistling his eyes appeared to be gazing at a remote point in the ceiling but when i moved a foot a couple of experimental inches those eyes were on me instantly mary ruthven had seen both the movement of my foot and the immediate switch of jablonksys glance and for a fleeting moment her eye caught mine there was no sympathy in it but i stretched my imagination a little and thought i detected a flicker of fellowfeeling we were in the same boat and it was sinking fast the whistling stopped i could hear an indistinguishable crackle of sound then jablonsky said i want to speak to general ruthven urgently its about say that again i see i see he depressed the receiver and looked at mary ruthven your father left the x at pm and hasnt returned they say he wont be back until theyve found you blood it would appear is thicker than oil makes things all the easier for me he got through to the new number hed been given from the oil rig and asked for the general again he got him almost at once and didnt waste a word general blair ruthven ive got news for you general good news and bad ive got your daughter here thats the good news the bad news is that itll cost you fifty thousand bucks to get her back jablonsky broke off and listened spinning the mauser gently round his forefinger smiling as always no general i am not john talbot but talbots with me right now ive persuaded him that keeping father and daughter apart any longer is downright inhuman you know talbot general or you know of him it took a lot of persuading fifty thousand bucks worth of persuading the smile suddenly vanished from jablonskys face leaving it bleak and cold and hard the real jablonsky his voice when he spoke was softer and deeper than ever and gently reproving as to an erring child general do you know what i just heard a funny little click the sort of funny little click you hear on a line when some smartalec nosey picks up an extension and starts flapping his ears or when somebody cuts in a tape recorder i dont want any eavesdroppers no records of private conversations neither do you not it you ever want to see your daughter again ah thats better and general dont get any funny ideas about telling someone to get through to the cops on another line to ask them to trace this call well be gone from wherever we are in exactly two minutes from now whats your answer make it quickly now another brief pause then jablonsky laughed pleasantly threatening you general blackmail general kidnapping general dont be so silly general theres no law that says that a man cant run away from a vicious killer is there even if that vicious killer happens to have a kidnappee with him ill just walk out and leave them together tell me are you bargaining for your daughters life general is she worth no more to you than less than onefiftieth of one per cent of all you own is that all her value to a doting father shes listening in to all this general i wonder what she must think of you eh willing to sacrifice her life for an old shoebutton for thats all fifty thousand bucks is to you sure sure you can speak to her he beckoned to the girl who ran across the room and snatched the phone from his hand daddy daddy yes yes its me of course its me oh daddy i never thought right thatll do jablonsky laid his big square brown hand across the mouthpiece and took the phone from her satisfied general blair the genuine article huh there was a short silence then jablonsky smiled broadly thank you general blair im not worrying about any guarantee the word of general ruthven has always been guarantee enough he listened a moment and when he spoke again the sardonic glint in his eye as he looked at mary ruthven gave the lie to the sincerity in his voice besides you know quite well that if you welshed on that money and had a house full of cops your daughter would never speak to you again no need to worry about my not coming theres every reason why i should fifty thousand to be exact he hung up on your feet talbot we have an appointment with high society yes i sat where i was and then you turn me over to the law and collect your fifteen thousand sure why not i could give you twenty thousand reasons yeah he looked at me speculatively got em on you dont be stupid give me a week or perhaps birdinthehand jablonsky pal thats me get going looks like being a nice nights work he cut my bonds and we went out through the garage jablonsky had a hand on the girls wrist and a gun about thirty inches from my back i couldnt see it but i didnt have to i knew it was there night had come the wind was rising from the northwest and it carried with it the wild harsh smell of the sea and a cold slanting rain that spattered loudly against the rustling dripping fronds of the palms and bounced at an angle off the asphalt pavement at our feet it was less than a hundred yards to where jablonsky had left his ford outside the central block of the motel but that hundred yards made us good and wet the parkinglot in that rain was deserted but even so jablonsky had backed his car into the darkest corner he would he opened both offside doors of the ford then went and stood by the rear door you first lady other side youre driving talbot he banged my door shut as i got in behind the wheel slid into the back seat and closed his own door he let me feel the mauser hard against the back of my neck in case my memory was failing me turn south on the highway i managed to press the proper buttons eased through the deserted motel courtyard and turned right jablonsky said to the girl your old mans place is just off the main highway right yes any other way of getting there back streets side roads yes you can go round the town and so well go straight through im figuring the same way as talbot figured when he came to the la contessa no one will be looking for him within fifty miles of marble springs we drove through the town in silence the roads were almost deserted and there werent half a dozen pedestrians to be seen i caught the red both times at the only two sets of traffic lights in marble springs and both times the mauser came to rest on the back of my head by and by we were clear of the town and the rain sheeting down in a torrential cascade that drummed thunderously on the roof and hood of the car it was like driving under a waterfall and the windscreenwipers werent built for driving under waterfalls i had to slow down to twenty and even so i was all but blind whenever the headlights of an approaching car spread their whitelydiffused glare over the streaming glass of the windscreen a blindness which became complete with the spraying wall of water that thudded solidly against screen and offside of the body as the approaching cars swept by with the sibilant whisper of wet rubber on wet roads and a bowwave that a destroyer captain would have been proud to own mary ruthven peered into the alternating glare and gloom with her forehead pressed against the windscreen she probably knew the road well but she didnt know it tonight a northbound track rolled by at the wrong moment and she almost missed the turnoff there it is she grabbed my forearm so hard that the ford skidded for a moment on to the shoulder of the road before i could bring it under control i caught a glimpse through the rain of a dimly phosphorescent glow on the left and was fifty yards beyond before i stopped the road was too narrow for a uturn so i backed and filled until we were heading the other way crawled up to the illuminated opening in first and turned in slowly i should have hated to turn in there quickly as it was i managed to pull up a few feet short of a sixbarred whitepainted metal gate that would have stopped a bulldozer the gate appeared to be at the end of an almost flatroofed tunnel on the left was a sevenfoot high white limestone wall maybe twenty feet long on the right was a white lodge with an oak door and chintzcovered windows looking out on to the tunnel lodge and wall were joined by a shallowly curved roof i couldnt see what the roof was made of i wasnt interested in it anyway i was too busy looking at the man who had come through the lodge door even before i had braked to a stop he was the dowagers dream of a chauffeur he was perfect he was immaculate he was a poem in maroon even his gleaming riding boots looked maroon the flaring bedford cord breeches the bigbuttoned tunic the gloves perfectly folded under one epaulette even the peak of the cap were all of the same perfect shade he took his cap off his hair wasnt maroon it was thick and black and gleaming and parted on the right he had a smooth brown face and dark eyes set well apart just like his shoulders a poem but no pansy he was as big as i was and a whole lot better looking mary ruthven had the window wound down and the chauffeur bent to look at her one sinewy brown hand resting on the edge of the door when he saw who it was the brown face broke into a wide white smile and if the relief and gladness in his eyes werent genuine he was the best actorchauffeur id ever known it is you miss mary the voice was deep educated and unmistakably english when youd two hundred and eightyfive million bucks it didnt cost but pennies extra to hire a homegrown shepherd to look after your flock of imported rollsroyce english chauffeurs were class im delighted to see you back maam are you all right im delighted to be back simon for a brief moment her hand lay over his and squeezed it she let her breath go in what was halfsigh halfshudder and added im all right how is daddy the general has been worried stiff miss mary but hell be all right now they told me to expect you ill let them know right away he halfturned wheeled craned forward and peered into the back of the car his body perceptibly stiffened yeah its a gun jablonsky said comfortably from the rear seat just holding it sonny gets kinda uncomfortable sitting down with a gun in your hip pocket havent you found that yourself i looked and sure enough i could see the slight bulge on the chauffeurs right hip spoils the cut of the little lord fauntelroy suit dont it though jablonsky went on and dont get any funny ideas about using yours the time for thats past besides you might hit talbot thats him behind the wheel fifteen thousand dollars on the hoof and i want to deliver him in prime condition i dont know what youre talking about sir the chauffeurs face had darkened his voice was barely civil ring the house he turned away went into the small lobby behind the door lifted a phone and pressed a button and as he did so the heavy gate swung open silently smoothly of its own accord all we need now is a moat and a portcullis jablonsky murmured as we began to move forward looks after his millions does the old general electrified fences patrols dogs the lot eh lady she didnt answer we were moving past a big fourcar garage attached to the lodge it was a carport type garage without doors and i could see i had been right about the rollsroyces there were two of them one sandbrown and beige the other gunmetal blue there was also a cadillac that would be for the groceries jablonsky was speaking again old fancypants back there the limey whered you pick that sissy up id like to see you say that to him without that gun in your hand the girl said quietly hes been with us for three years now nine months ago three masked men crashed our car with only kennedy and myself in it they all carried guns ones dead the other two are still in prison a lucky sissy jablonsky grunted and relapsed into silence the asphalt driveway up to the house was narrow long winding and thickly wooded on both sides the small evergreen leaves of live oak and long dripping grey festoons of spanish moss reached out and brushed the roof and sidescreens of the car suddenly the trees receded on both sides from the beams of the headlamps giving way to strategically placed clumps of palms and palmettos and there behind a stepped granite balustrade wall and a gravel terrace lay the generals house built as an ordinary family house the girl had said built for a family of about fifty it was enormous it was an old white antebellum type house so colonial that it creaked with a huge pillared twostory porch a curiously doubleangled roof of a type id never seen before and enough glass to keep an active windowcleaner in yearround employment over the entrance of the lower porch were two more lights big oldfashioned coach lamps each with a powerful electric bulb inside below the lamps stood the reception committee i hadnt expected the reception committee subconsciously i suppose i had expected the old highclass routine of being welcomed by the butler and deferentially and ceremoniously conducted to the library where the general would be sipping his scotch before a crackling pine fire which was pretty silly when you came to think of it when youre expecting a daughter back from the dead and the doorbell rings you dont just keep on sipping whisky not if youre halfway human the chauffeur had warned them hence the committee the butler was there too he came down the steps of the porch carrying a huge golf umbrella out into the heavy rain he didnt look like any butler id ever seen his coat was far too tight round his upper arms shoulders and chest in a fashion that used to be popular among prohibition gangsters and ms face did nothing to dispel the impression he looked first cousin to valentino the bodyguard back in the courtroom or maybe even more closely related he even had the same broken nose the general had a weird taste in butlers especially when you considered his choice of chauffeur but the butler seemed courteous enough at least i thought he was until he saw who it was behind the drivingwheel and then he made a smart about turn went round the front of the car and escorted mary ruthven to the shelter of the porch where she ran forward and threw her arms round her fathers neck jablonsky and i had to make it alone we got wet but no one seemed worried by this time the girl had become disentangled from her father i had a good look at him he was an immensely tall old coot thin but not too thin in a silverwhite linen suit the colour of the suit was a perfect match for the hair he had a long lean craggy lincolnesque face but just how craggy it was impossible to say for almost half of it was hidden behind a luxuriant white moustache and beard he didnt look like any big business magnate id ever come across but with million dollars he didnt have to he looked like the way id expected a southern judge to look and didnt come in gentlemen he said courteously i wondered if he included me among the three other men standing in the shadows in the porch it seemed unlikely but i went in al the same i hadnt much option not only was jablonskys mauser jammed into the small of my back but another man whod just stepped out of the shadows also carried a gun we trooped across a huge wide chandelierlit tessellatedtile floored hall down a broad passage and into a large room id been right about the room anyway it was a library it did have a blazing pine fire and the slightly oily smell of fine leatherbound books mingled very pleasantly with the aroma of expensive coronas and a highclass scotch i noticed there was nobody there smoking cigars the walls that werent covered with bookshelves were panelled in polished elm chairs and settees were in dark gold leather and moquette and the curtains of shot gold a bronzecoloured carpet flowed over the floor from wall to wall and with a strong enough draught the nap on it would have waved and undulated like a windrippled field of summer corn as it was the chair castors were so deeply sunk in it as to be almost invisible scotch mr ah the general asked jablonsky jablonsky i dont mind general while im standing and while im waiting waiting for what mr jablonsky general ruthven had a quiet pleasant voice with very little inflection in it with bucks you dont have to shout to make yourself heard aint you the little kidder now jablonsky was as quiet as unruffled as the general for the little paper general with your name signed at the bottom for the fifty thousand iron men of course the general seemed faintly surprised that jablonsky should think it necessary to remind him of the agreement he crossed to the dressedstone mantelpiece pulled a yellow bank slip from under a paperweight i have it here just the payees name to be filled in i thought a slight smile touched his mouth but under all that foliage it was difficult to be sure and you neednt worry about my phoning the bank with instructions not to honour this cheque such is not rny way of doing business i know its not general and my daughter is worth infinitely more to me than this i must thank you sir for bringing her back yeah jablonsky took the cheque glanced casually at it then looked at the general a speculative glint in his eye your pen slipped general he drawled i asked for fifty thousand you got seventy thousand here correct ruthven inclined his head and glanced at me i had offered ten thousand dollars for information about this man here i also feel that im morally bound to make good the five thousand offered by the authorities its so much easier to make out one lumpsum cheque to one person dont you agree and the extra five thousand for your trouble and the pleasure it will give me to hand this man over to the authorities personally again i couldnt be sure whether or not he smiled i can afford to indulge those whims you know your pleasure is my pleasure general ill be on my way then sure you can handle this fellow hes tough fast tricky as they come i have people who can handle him it was plain that the general wasnt referring to the butler and another uniformed servant hovering in the background he pressed a bell and when some sort of footman came to the door said ask mr vyland and mr royale to come in will you fletcher why dont you ask them yourself general to my way of thinking i was the central figure in that little group but they hadnt even asked me to speak so i thought it was time to say something i bent down to the bowl of artificial flowers on the table by the fire and pulled up a finemeshed microphone this rooms bugged a hundred gets one your friends have heard every word thats been said for a millionaire and high society flier ruthven you have some strange habits i broke off and looked at the trio who had just come through the doorway and even stranger friends which wasnt quite an accurate statement the first man in looked perfectly at home in that luxurious setting he was of medium height medium build dressed in a perfectly cut dinner suit and smoking a cigar as long as your arm that was the expensive smell id picked up as soon as i had come into the library he was in his early fifties with black hair touched by grey at the temples his neat clipped moustache was jet black his face was smooth and unlined and deeply sunburnt he was hollywoods ideal of a man to play the part of a top executive smooth urbane and competent to a degree it was only when he came closer and you saw the eyes and the set of the planes of his face that you realised that here was a toughness both physical and mental and a hardness that you would never see around a movie set a man to watch the second man was more offbeat it was hard to put a finger on the quality that made him so he was dressed in a soft grey flannel suit white shirt and grey tie of the same shade as the suit he was slightly below medium height broadly built with a pale face and smooth slicked hair almost the same colour as mary ruthvens it wasnt until you looked again and again that you saw what made him offbeat it wasnt anything he had it was something he didnt have he had the most expressionless face the emptiest eyes i had ever seen in any man offbeat was no description for the man who brought up the rear he belonged in that library the way mozart would have belonged in a rock and roll club he was only twentyone or two tall skinny with a deadwhite face and coalblack eyes the eyes were never still they moved restlessly from side to side as if it hurt them to be still flickering from one face to another like a willothewisp on an autumn evening i didnt notice what he wore all i saw was his face the face of a hophead a junky an advanced dope addict take away his white powder for even twentyfour hours and hed be screaming his head off as all the devils in hell closed in on him come in mr vyland the general was speaking to the man with the cigar and i wished for the tenth time that old ruthvens expression wasnt so hard to read he nodded in my direction this is talbot the wanted man and this is mr jablonsky the man who brought him back glad to meet you mr jablonsky vyland smiled in a friendly fashion and put his hand out im the generals chief production engineer sure he was the generals chief production engineer that made me president of the united states vyland nodded at the man in the grey suit this is mr royale mr jablonsky mr jablonsky mr jablonsky the words werent spoken they were hissed by the tall thin boy with the staring eyes his hand dived under the lapel of his jacket and i had to admit he was fast the gun trembled in his hand he swore three unprintable words in succession and the eyes were glazed and mad ive waited two long years for this you damn you royale why did theres a young lady here larry i could have sworn that royales hand hadnt reached under his coat or for his hip pocket but there had been no mistaking the flash of dulled metal in his hand the sharp crack of the barrel on larrys wrist and the clatter of the boys gun bouncing off a brasstopped table as an example of sleightofhand conjuring id never seen anything to beat it we know mr jablonsky royale was continuing his voice was curiously musical and soothing and soft at least larry and i know dont we larry larry did six months once on a narcotics charge it was jablonsky that sent him up jablonsky sent the general began jablonsky royale smiled and nodded at the big man detectivelieutenant herman jablonsky of new york homicide chapter iv it was one of those silences it went on and on and on pregnant they call it it didnt worry me much i was for the high jump anyway it was the general who spoke first and his voice and face were stiff and cold as he looked at the man in the dinner suit what is the explanation of this outrageous conduct vyland he demanded you bring into this house a man who is apparently not only a narcotics addict and carries a gun but who has also served a prison sentence as for the presence of a police officer someone might care to inform relax general you can drop the front it was royale who spoke his voice quiet and soothing as before and curiously devoid of any trace of insolence i wasnt quite accurate exdetectivelieutenant i should have said brightest boy in the bureau in his day first narcotics then homicide more arrests and more convictions for arrests than any other police officer in the eastern states but your foot slipped didnt it jablonsky jablonsky said nothing and his face showed nothing but it didnt mean he wasnt thinking plenty my face showed nothing but i was thinking plenty i was thinking how i could try to get away the servants had vanished at a wave of the hand from the general and for the moment everyone seemed to have lost interest in me i turned my head casually i was wrong there was someone who hadnt lost interest in me valentino my courtroom acquaintance was standing in the passageway just outside the open door and the interest he was taking in me more than made up for the lack of interest in the library i was pleased to see that he was carrying his right arm in a sling his left thumb was hooked in the side pocket of his coat and although he might have had a big thumb it wasnt big enough to make all that bulge in his pocket he would just love to see me trying to get away jablonsky here was the central figure in the biggest police scandal to hit new york since the war royale was saying all of a sudden there were a lot of murders important murders in his parish and jablonsky boobed on the lot everyone knew a protection gang was behind the killings everybody except jablonsky all jablonsky knew was that he was getting ten grand a stiff to look in every direction but the right one but he had even more enemies inside the force than outside and they nailed him eighteen months ago it was and he had the headlines to himself for an entire week dont you remember mr vyland now i do vyland nodded sixty thousand tucked away and they never laid a finger on a cent three years he got wasnt it and out in eighteen months royale finished jumped the wall jablonsky good conduct remission jablonsky said calmly a respectable citizen again which is more than could be said for you royale you employing this man general i fail to see because if you are itll cost you a hundred bucks more than you think a hundred bucks is the price royale usually charges his employers for a wreath for his victims a very fancy wreath or has the price gone up royale and who are you putting the ringer on this time nobody said anything jablonsky had the floor royale here is listed in the police files of half the states in the union general nobodys ever pinned anything on him yet but they know all about him no remover in the united states not furniture but people he charges high but hes good and theres never any comeback a freelance and his services are in terrific demand by all sorts of people youd never dream of not only because he never fails to give satisfaction but also because of the fact that its a point of royales code that hell never touch a man who has employed him an awful lot of people sleep an awful lot easier general just because they know theyre on royales list of untouchables jablonsky rubbed a bristly chin with a hand the size of a shovel i wonder who he could be after this time general could it even be yourself do you think for the first time the general registered emotion not even the beard and moustache could hide a narrowing of the eyes a tightening of the lips and a slight but perceptible draining of colour from the cheeks he wet his lips slowly and looked at vyland did you know anything of this what truth is there jablonskys just shooting off the top of his mouth vyland interjected smoothly lets get them into another room general we must talk ruthven nodded his face still pale and vyland glanced at royale royale smiled and said without inflection all right you two out leave that gun there jablonsky and if i dont you havent cashed that cheque yet royale said obliquely theyd been listening all right jablonsky put his gun on the table royale himself didnt have a gun in his hand with the speed he could move at it would have been quite superfluous anyway the hophead larry came up behind me and dug his pistol barrel in my kidney with a force that made me grunt in pain nobody said anything so i said do that again hophead and itll take a dentist a whole day to repair your face so he did it again twice as painfully as before and when i swung round he was too quick for me and caught me with the barrel of his gun high up on the face and raked the sight down my cheek then he stood off four feet away gun pointed at my lower stomach and those crazy eyes jumping all over the place a wicked smile on his face inviting me to jump him i mopped some of the blood off my face and turned and went out the door valentino was waiting for me gun in hand and heavy boots on his feet and by the time royale came leisurely out of the library closed the door behind him and stopped valentino with a single word i couldnt walk theres nothing wrong with my thigh its carried me around for years but its not made of oak and valentino wore toeplates on his boots it just wasnt my lucky night jablonsky helped me off the floor into an adjacent room i stopped at the doorway looked back at the grinning valentino and then at larry and i wrote them both down in my little black book we spent perhaps ten minutes in that room jablonsky and i sitting the hophead pacing up and down with the gun in his hand and hoping i would twitch an eyebrow royale leaning negligently against a table nobody saying anything until by and by the butler came in and said the general wanted to see us we all trooped out again valentino was still there but i made it safely to the library maybe hed hurt his toe but i knew it wasnt that royale had told him once to lay off and just once would be all that royale would have to tell anybody anything a far from subtle change had taken place in the atmosphere since wed left the girl was still sitting on a stool by the fire head bent and the flickering light gleaming off her wheatcoloured braids but vylaud and the general seemed easy and relaxed and confident and the latter was even smiling a couple of newspapers were lying on the library table and i wondered sourly if those with their big black banner headlines wanted killer slays constable wounds sheriff and the far from flattering pictures of myself had anything to do with their confidence to emphasise the change in atmosphere a footman came in with a tray of glasses decanter and soda siphon he was a young man but moved with a peculiarly stiff leadenfooted gait and he laid the tray down on the table with so laborious a difficulty that you could almost hear his joints creak his colour didnt look too good either i looked away glanced at him again and then indifferently away once more hoping that the knowledge of what i suddenly knew didnt show in my face theyd read all the right books on etiquette the footman and the butler knew exactly what to do the footman brought in the drinks the butler carried them around he gave a sherry to the girl whisky to each of the four men hophead was pointedly bypassed and planted himself in front of me my gaze travelled from his hairy wrists to his broken nose to the general in the background the general nodded so i looked back at the silver tray again pride said no the magnificent aroma of the amber liquid that had been poured from that triangular dimpled bottle said yes but pride carried the heavy handicap of my hunger soaked clothes and the beating id just had and the aroma won looking round i took the glass and eyed the general over the rim a last drink for the condemned man eh general not condemned yet he lifted his glass your health talbot very witty i sneered what do they do in the state of florida general strap you over a cyanide bucket or just fry you in the hot seat your health he repeated youre not condemned maybe youll never be condemned i have a proposition to put before you talbot i lowered myself carefully into a chair valentinos boot must have mangled up one of the nerves in my leg a thigh muscle was jumping uncontrollably i waved at the papers lying on the library table i take it youve read those general i take it you know all about what happened today all about my record what kind of proposition can a man like you possibly have to put to a man like me a very attractive one i imagined i saw a touch of red touch the high cheekbones but he spoke steadily enough in exchange for a little service i wish you to perform for me i offer you your life a fair offer and the nature of this little service general i am not at liberty to tell you at present in about perhaps thirtysix hours you would say vyland we should hear by then vyland agreed he was less and less like an engineer every time i looked at him he took a puff at his corona and looked at me you agree to the generals proposition then dont be silly what else can i do and after the job whatever it is you will be provided with papers and passport and sent to a certain south american country where you will have nothing to fear the general answered i have the connections like hell i would be given papers and a trip to south america i would be given a pair of concrete socks and a vertical trip to the bottom of the gulf of mexico and if i dont agree then of course if you dont agree then they will all be overcome by a high sense of civic responsibility and turn you over to the cops jablonsky interrupted sardonically the whole setup stinks to high heaven why should the general want you he can hire practically any man in the nation why especially should he hire a killer on the lam what earthly use can you be to him why should he help a wanted murderer to evade justice he sipped his drink thoughtfully general blair ruthven the moral pillar of new england society bestknown and highestminded dogooder after the rockefellers it stinks youre paddling in some dark and dirty water general very dark very dirty and paddling right up to your neck lord knows what stakes you must be playing for they must be fantastic he shook ms head this i would never have believed i have never willingly or knowingly done a dishonest thing in my life the general said steadily jeez jablonsky ejaculated for a few seconds he was silent then said suddenly well thanks for the drink general dont forget to sup with a long spoon ill take my hat and my cheque and be on my way the jablonsky retirement fund is in your debt i didnt see who made the signal probably it came from vyland again i didnt see how the gun got into royales hand but i saw it there so did jablonsky it was a tiny gun a very flat automatic with a snub barrel even smaller than the liliput the sheriff had taken from me but royale probably had the eye and the aim of a squirrelhunter and it was all he needed a great big hole in the heart from a heavy colt makes you no deader than a tiny little hole from a jablonsky looked thoughtfully at the gun you would rather i stayed general put that damn gun away the general snapped jablonksys on our side at least i hope hes going to be yes id rather you stayed but no ones going to make you if you dont want to and whats going to make me want to jablonsky inquired of the company at large could it be that the general who has never willingly done a dishonest thing in his life as planning to hold up payment on that cheque or maybe just planning to tear it up altogether it didnt need the generals suddenly averted eyes to confirm jablonskys guess vyland cut in smoothly itll only be for two days jablonsky three at the most after all you are getting a great deal of money for very little all were asking you to do is to ride herd on talbot here until hes done what we want him to do jablonsky nodded slowly i see royale here wouldnt stoop to bodyguarding he takes care of people in a rather more permanent way the thug out in the passage there the butler our little friend larry here talbot could eat em all before breakfast you must need talbot pretty badly eh we require him vyland said smoothly and from what weve learnt from miss ruthven and from what royale knows of you you can hold him and your moneys safe uhhuh and tell me am i a prisoner looking after a prisoner or am i free to come and go you heard what the general said vyland answered youre a free agent but if you do go out make sure hes locked up or tied so that he cant break for it seventy thousand bucks worth of guarding eh jablonksy said grimly hes safe as the gold in fort knox i caught royale and vyland exchanging a brief flicker of a glance as jablonsky went on but im kind of worried about that seventy thousand i mean if someone finds out talbot is here i wont get the seventy thousand all ill get with my record is ten years for obstructing the course of justice and giving aid and comfort to a wanted murderer he looked speculatively at vyland and the general and went on softly what guarantee have i that no one in this house will talk no one will talk vyland said flatly the chauffeur lives in the lodge doesnt he jablonsky said obliquely yes he does vyland spoke softly thoughtfully it might be a good idea to get rid of no the girl interrupted violently shed jumped to her feet fists clenched by her sides under no circumstances general ruthven said quietly kennedy remains we are too much in his debt vylands dark eyes narrowed for a moment and he looked at the general but it was the girl who answered the unspoken query simon wont talk she said tonelessly she moved towards the door ill go to see him simon eh vyland scraped a thumbnail against the corner of his moustache and looked at her appraisingly simon kennedy chauffeur and general handyman she retraced a few steps stopped in front of vyland and looked at him steadily tiredly you could just see the fifteen generations stretching back to the mayflower and every one of the million bucks was showing she said distinctly i think you are the most utterly hateful man i have ever known and walked out closing the door behind her my daughter is overwrought the general said hastily forget it general vylands voice was as urbane as ever but he looked a bit overwrought himself royale you might show jablonsky and talbot their quarters for tonight east end of the new wing the rooms are being fixed now royale nodded but jablonsky held up his hand this job talbot is going to do for you is it in this house genedal ruthven glanced at vyland then shook his head then where jablonsky demanded if this guy is taken out of here and anybody within a hundred miles spots him weve had it particularly it would be goodbye to my money i think im entitled to a little reassurance on this point general again the swift interchange of looks between the general and vyland again the latters all but imperceptible nod i think we can tell you that the general said the jobs on the x my oil rig out in the gulf he smiled faintly fifteen miles from here and well out in the gulf no passersby to see him there mr jablonsky jablonsky nodded as though for the moment satisfied and said no more i stared at the ground i didnt dare to look up royale said softly lets be on our way i finished my drink and got up the heavy library door opened outwards into the passage and royale gun in hand stood to one side to let me pass through first he should have known better or maybe my limp deceived him people thought my limp slowed me up but people were wrong valentino had disappeared i went through the doorway slowed up and moved to one side round the edge of the door as if i were waiting for royale to catch up and show me where to go then whirled round and smashed the sole of my right foot against the door with all the speed and power i could muster royale got nailed neatly between door and jamb had it been his head that was caught it would have been curtains as it was it caught his shoulders but even so it was enough to make him grunt in agony and send the gun spinning out of his hand to fall a couple of yards down the passage i dived for it i scooped it up by the barrel swung round still crouched as i heard the quick step behind me the butt of the automatic caught the diving royale somewhere on the face i couldnt be sure where but it sounded like a fourpound axe sinking into the bole of a pine he was unconscious before he hit me but he did hit me an axe wont stop a falling pine it took only a couple of seconds to push him off and change my grip to the butt of the pistol but two seconds would always be enough and more than enough for a man like jablonsky his foot caught my gunhand and the gun landed twenty feet away i launched myself for his legs but he moved to one side with the speed of a flyweight lifted his knee and sent me crashing against the open door and then it was too late for he had the mauser in his hand and it was pointing between my eyes i climbed slowly to my feet not trying anything the general and vyland the latter with a gun in his hand came crowding through the open door then relaxed when they saw jablonsky with the gun on me vyland bent down and helped a now moaning royale to a sitting position royale had a long heavily bleeding cut above his left eye and tomorrow hed have a ducks egg bruise there after maybe half a minute he shook his head to clear it wiped blood away with the back of his hand and looked slowly round till his eyes found mine id been mistaken id thought his the emptiest the most expressionless eyes id ever seen but id been mistaken i looked in them and i could almost smell the moist freshlyturned earth of an open grave i can see that you gents really do need me around jablonsky said jovially i never thought anyone would try that stuff with royale and live to talk about it but we learn he dug into a side pocket and brought out a set of very slender bluedsteel cuffs and slipped them expertly on my wrists a souvenir of the bad old days he explained apologetically would there happen to be another pair and some wire or chain round the house it might be arranged vyland said almost mechanically he still couldnt credit what had happened to his infallible hatchetman fine jablonsky grinned down at royale you dont need to lock your door tonight ill keep talbot out of your hair royale transferred his sombre evil stare from my face to jablonskys and his expression didnt alter any that i could see i fancied perhaps royale was beginning to have ideas about a double grave the butler took us upstairs and along a narrow passage to the back of the big house took a key from his pocket unlocked a door and ushered us in it was just another bedroom sparsely but expensively furnished with a washbasin in one corner and a modern mahogany bed in the middle of the right wall to the left was a communicating door to another bedroom the butler took a second key from his pocket and unlocked this door also it gave on to another room the mirror image of the first except for the bed which was an oldfashioned ironrailed effort it looked as if it had been made with girders left over from the key west bridge it looked solid it looked as if it was going to be my bed we went back into the other room jablonsky stretched out his hand the keys please the butler hesitated peered uncertainly at him then shrugged handed over the keys and turned to leave jablonsky said pleasantly this mauser im holding here friend want that i should bounce it off your head two three times im afraid i dont understand sir sir hey thats good i wouldnt have expected them to have books on bulling in alcatraz the other key my friend the one leading to the passage from talbots room the butler scowled handed over a third key and left whatever buttling book hed read hed skipped the section on closing doors but it was a stout door and it stood up to it jablonsky grinned locked the door with an ostentatious click pulled the curtains checked rapidly that there were no peepholes in the walls and crossed back to where i stood five or six times he smacked a massive fist into a massive palm kicked the wall and knocked over an armchair with a thud that shook the room then he said not too softly not too loudly get up when youre ready friend thats just a little warning shall we say not to try any further tricks like you tried on royale just move one finger and youll think the chrysler building fell on top of you i didnt move a finger neither did jablonsky there was a complete silence inside the room we listened hard the silence in the passageway outside was not complete with his flat feet and adenoidal brokennosed breathing the butler was completely miscast as the last of the mohicans and he was a good twenty feet away by the time the thick carpet absorbed the last of his creaking footfalls jablonsky took out a key softly opened the handcuffs pocketed them and shook my hand as if he meant to break every finger i had i felt like it too but for all that my grin was as big as delighted as his own we lit cigarettes and started on the two rooms with toothpicks looking for bugs and listening devices the place was loaded with them exactly twentyfour hours later i climbed into the sports car that had been left empty but with the ignition key in the lock four hundred yards away from the entrance lodge to the generals house it was a chevrolet corvette the same car that id stolen the previous afternoon when id been holding mary ruthven hostage the rain of yesterday had vanished completely the sky had been blue and cloudless all day long and for me it had been a very long day indeed lying fully dressed and handcuffed to the rails of an iron bed for twelve hours while the temperature in a closedwindow southfacing room rises to a hundred in the shad well the heat and the somnolent inactivity would have been just right for a galapagos tortoise it left me as limp as a shot rabbit theyd kept me there all day jablonsky bringing me food and parading me shortly after dinner before the general vyland and royale to let them see how good a watchdog he was and that i was still relatively intact relatively was the word to increase the effect id redoubled my limp and had sticking plaster crossed over cheek and chin royale needed no such adventitious aids to advertise the fact that he had been in the wars i doubt if they made sticking plaster wide enough to cover the enormous bruise he had on his forehead his right eye was the same bluishpurple as the bruise and completely shut id done a good job on royale and i knew for all the empty remote expression that was back in his face and one good eye that hed never rest until hed done a better job on me a permanent job the night air was cool and sweet and full of the smell of the salt sea i had the hood down and as i travelled south i leaned far back and to one side to let the freshness drive away the last of the cobwebs from my dopy mind it wasnt just the heat that had made my mind sluggish i had slept so long during that sticky afternoon that i was overslept and paying for it but then i wasnt going to get much sleep that coming night once or twice i thought of jablonsky that big black smiling man with the tanned face and the engaging grin sitting back in his upstairs room diligently and solemnly guarding my empty bedroom with all three keys in his pocket i felt in my own pocket and they were still there the duplicates that jablonsky had had cut that morning when be had taken the air in the direction of marble springs jablonsky had been busy that morning i forgot about jablonsky he could take better care of himself that any man id ever known i had enough troubles of my own coming up that night the last traces of the brilliant red sunset had just vanished over the winedark gulf to the west and the stars were standing clear in the high and windless sky when i saw a green shaded lantern on the right of the road i passed it then a second then at the third i turned sharp right and ran the corvette down on to a little stone jetty switching off my headlights even before i coasted to a standstill beside a tall bulky man with a tiny pencil flash in his hand he took my arm he had to i was blind from staring into the glaring white pool of light cast by the corvettes headlamps and led me wordlessly down a flight of wooden steps to a floating landing jetty and across this to a long dark shape that lay rocking gently by the side of the jetty i was seeing better already and i managed to grab a stay and jump down into the boat without a helping hand a squat short man rose to greet me mr talbot yes captain zaimis isnt it john the little man chuckled and explained in his lilting accent my boys would laugh at me captain zaimis they would say and how is the queen mary or the united states today they would say and so on the children of today the little man sighed in mock sorrow ah well i suppose john is good enough for the captain of the little matapan i glanced over his shoulder and had a look at the children they were as yet no more than dark blurs against a slightly less dark skyline but there was light enough to let me see that they averaged about six feet and were built in proportion nor was the matapan so little she was at least forty feet long twinmasted with curious athwartships and foreandaft rails just above the height of a tall mans head both men and vessel were greek the crew were greeks to a man and if the matapan wasnt entirely grecian she had at least been built by greek shipwrights who had come to and settled down in florida just for the express purpose of building those sponge ships with its slender graceful curves and upswept bows homer would have had no trouble in identifying it as a direct lineal descendant of the galleys that had roamed the sunlit aegean and the levant countless centuries ago i felt a sudden sense of gratitude and security that i was aboard such a vessel accompanied by such men a fine night for the job in band i said perhaps perhaps not the humour had left his voice i dont think so it is not the night that john zaimis would have chosen i didnt point out that choice didnt enter into the matter i said too clear is that it not that he turned away for a moment gave some orders in what could only have been greek and men started moving about the deck unhitching ropes from the bollards on the landing stage he turned back to me excuse me if i speak to them in our old tongue those three boys are not yet six months in this country my own boys they will not dive a hard life they say too hard a life so we have to bring the young men from greece i dont like the weather mr talbot it is too fine a night thats what i said no he shook his head vigorously too fine the air is too still and the little breeze it comes from the northwest that is bad tonight the sun was a flame in the sky that is bad you feel the little waves that are rocking the matapan when the weather is good the little waves they slap against the hull every three seconds maybe every four tonight he shrugged twelve seconds maybe every fifteen for forty years i have sailed out of tarpon springs i know the waters here mr talbot i would be lying if i say any man knows them better a big storm comes a big storm eh when it came to big storms i didnt fancy myself very much hurricane warning out no do you always get those signs before a hurricane captain zaimis wasnt going to cheer me up somebody had to try not always mr talbot once maybe fifteen years ago there was a storm warning but none of the signs not one the fishermen from the south caicos went out fifty drowned but when it is september and the signs are there then the big storm comes every time it comes nobody was going to cheer me up tonight when will it come i asked eight hours fortyeight hours i do not know he pointed due west the source of the long slow oily swell but it comes from there you will find your rubber suit below mr talbot two hours and thirteen miles later we were uncomfortably nearer that still distant storm we had travelled at full speed but full speed on the matapan was nothing to write home about almost a month ago two civilian engineers sworn to secrecy had bypassed the exhaust of the matapans engine to an underwater cylinder with a curiously arranged system of baffle plates theyd done a fine job the exhaust level of the matapan was no more than a throaty whisper but back pressure had cut the thrust output in half but it was fast enough it got there it got there too fast for me and the farther out we went into the starlit gulf the longer and deeper became the troughs between the swells the more convinced i was of the hopelessness of what i had set out to do but someone had to do it and i was the man who had picked the joker there was no moon that night by and by even the stars began to go out cirrus clouds in long grey sheets began to fill the sky then the rain came not heavy but cold and penetrating and john zaimis gave me a tarpaulin for shelter there was a cabin on the matapan but i had no wish to go below i must have dozed off lulled by the motion of the boat for the next i knew the rain had stopped spattering on the tarpaulin and someone was shaking my shoulder it was the skipper and he was saying softly there she is mr talbot the x i stood up using a mast to support myself the swell was becoming really unpleasant now and followed the direction of his pointing hand not that he needed to point even at the distance of a mile the x seemed to fill the entire sky i looked at it looked away then looked back again it was still there id lost more than most i didnt have a great deal to live for but i did have a little so i stood there and wished myself ten thousand miles away i was scared if this was the end of the road i wished to god id never set foot on it chapter v id heard of those offshore rigs before id even had one of them described to me by a man who designed them but id never seen one before and now that i did i realised that the description id had had been on the same level as my imaginative capacity to clothe with flesh the bare bones of facts and statistics i looked at the x and i just didnt believe it it was enormous it was angular and ungainly as was no other structure id ever seen before and above all it was unreal a weird combination of jules verne and some of the fancier flights of spacefiction at first glance in the fleeting patches of dim starlight it looked like a forest of huge factory chimneys sticking up out of the sea halfway up their height those chimneys were all joined by a deep and massive platform through the sides of which those chimneys penetrated and at the very right hand side built on the platform itself and reaching up into the sky mysterious and fragile in the spiderlike tracery of its slenderly interwoven girders twice the height of the chimneys and outlined against the night sky in its fairylike festoon of white and coloured operating and aircraft warning lights was the oildrilling derrick itself im not one of those characters who go about pinching themselves to convince themselves that things are real but if i were i would never have had a better opportunity or reason to pinch than right then to see that weird martian structure suddenly thrusting itself up out of the sea would have had the most hardened topers in the country screaming to climb aboard the water wagon the chimneys i knew were massive tubular metal legs of almost unbelievable strength each one capable of supporting a weight of several hundred tons and on this rig i could count no less than fourteen of hose legs seven on each side and there must have been a stretch of four hundred feet between the outer ones at the ends and the astonishing thing was that this huge platform was mobile it had been towed there with the platform deepsunk in the sea and the legs thrusting high up almost to the level of the top of the derrick arrived at the right spot those legs had dropped right down to the floor of the sea and then the whole huge platform and derrick maybe four or five thousand tons in all and powered by huge engines had risen dripping from the sea till it was safe beyond the reach of even the highest of the hurricanelashed waves of the gulf of mexico all this i had known but knowing and seeing werent the same things at all a hand touched my arm and i jumped i had quite forgotten where i was what do you think of him mr talbot it was the skipper you like eh yes its nice how much did this little toy cost any idea four million dollars zaimis shrugged maybe four and a half a fair investment i conceded four million dollars eight zaimis corrected a man cannot just come and start drilling mr talbot first he buy the land under the sea five thousand acres three million dollars then to drill a well just one well maybe two miles deep it cost perhaps threequarters of a million if hes lucky eight million dollars and not an investment either a gamble geologists could be wrong they were more often wrong than right general blair ruthven a man with eight million dollars to throw away what colossal prize could a man like that with a reputation like his be working for if he was prepared as he so obviously was prepared to step outside the law there was only one way of finding out i shivered and turned to zaimis you can get in close real close i mean all the way he pointed to the near side of the vast structure you have seen the ship tied up alongside i hadnt but i could see her now a lean dark shape maybe two hundred and fifty feet long completely dwarfed by the massive rig the tips of her masts reaching no more than halfway up to the platform deck of the oil rig i looked back at zaimis is that going to queer our pitch john get in our way you mean no we make a wide curve and approach from the south he touched the rudder and the matapan swung away to port heading to bypass the x to the south to have gone to the north the right would have brought the matapan under the glare of the arc and floodlights that illuminated the big working platform round the derrick even at a mile we could clearly see men moving around the derrick and the subdued hum of powerful machinery like that of diesel compressors came at us clearly over the darkened waters so much at least was in our favour it had not occurred to me that work on those mobile rigs would go on twentyfour hours a day but at least the clamour of their operations would drown out the throaty whisper of the matapans engines the boat had begun to corkscrew violently we were quartering to the southwest taking that long deepening swell on our starboard bow and water was beginning to break over the sides of the boat and i was getting wet i crouched under a tarpaulin near the rudder lit a last cigarette under cover and looked at the skipper that ship out there john what chances of it moving away i dont know not much i think it is a supply and power ship it brings out food and drink and mud for the drills and thousands of gallons of oil look closely mr talbot it is a kind of small tanker now it brings oil for the big machines and perhaps electricity from its dynamos later when the strike comes it takes oil away i peered out under a corner of the tarpaulin it did look as john said a kind of small tanker i had seen the same type of ship years ago in the war the high raised bare centredeck and after accommodation and engineroom of the inshore fleet oiler but what interested me more right then was johns statement that it was there most of the time i want to go aboard that ship john can do i didnt want to go aboard but i knew i had to the idea of a vessel more or hess permanently moored there had never occurred to me now that i knew it to be a fact it was suddenly the most important factor in my considerations but but i was told you wanted to go aboard the rig itself mr talbot yes perhaps but later can you manage the ship i can try captain zaimis sounded grim it is a bad night mr talbot he was telling me i thought it was a terrible night but i said nothing still angling southwest we were passing directly opposite the middle of one of the long sides of the rig and i could see that the massive steel columns supporting the derrick platform were not so symmetrically arranged as i had imagined between the fourth and fifth of the huge legs on either side was a gap of perhaps a hundred and fifty feet and here the platform was scooped out to a much lower level than the main deck on this lower level the thin spindly cigarshaped outline of a crane reached up as high as the topmost level of the columns the ship was moored directly below this cutout welldeck spanning the gap and a couple of steel pillars on either side of the gap five minutes later the skipper changed course until we were heading due west again in a direction that would have taken us clear to the south of the rig but we had hardly time to get accustomed to the comparative comfort of heading straight into the swell when he put the helm over again and headed northwest we steered straight in as it seemed for the most southerly leg on the landward side of the rig passing within forty feet of the bow of the ship moored alongside scraped by the leg with only feet to spare and so found ourselves directly under the massive platform of the oilrig one of the young greeks a blackhaired bronzed boy by the name of andrew was busy in the bows and as we passed right under the platform and came abreast of the second pillar from the south on the seaward side he called softly to john and at the same time threw a lifebelt attached to a coil of light rope as far as he could to one side as he did so john cut the engine to the merest whisper and the matapan urged by the swell drifted slowly back past one side of the pillar while the lifebelt came back on the other so passing the light line completely round the pillar andrew picked up the lifebelt with a boathook and started pulling in the grass line which bad been bent on to a heavier manila within a minute the matapan was securely moored to the pillar with the engine just ticking over sufficiently to give her enough way to take the strain of the rope so that she wouldnt snag too heavily in the steadily deepening swell nobody had heard us nobody had seen us not at least as far as we could tell you will be very quick john said softly anxiously i do not know how long we shall be able to wait i smell the storm he was anxious i was anxious we were all anxious but all he had to do was to sit in that boat nobody was going to beat his head in or tie rocks to him and throw him into the gulf of mexico youve got nothing to worry about i said reassuringly nor had he compared to me half an hour i stripped off my overcoat snapped the vulcanised neck and wrist cuffs of the tanned twill and rubber suit i was wearing beneath it slipped an oxygen apparatus over my shoulders tightened the straps took the nose and eye piece in one hand and coat pants and hat under the other arm and stepped gingerly over the side into the rubber raft the crew had already slipped over the side andrew sat at the after end of this flimsy contraption holding a line in his hand and as soon as id settled let go his grip on the gunwale of the matapan the drift of the swel carried us quickly under the gloomy mass of the platform andrew paying out the line as we went paddling a rubber dinghy in a swell is difficult enough paddling it in a specific direction against such a swell all but impossible it would be a hundred times easier to regain the matapan by hauling ourselves back hand over hand at a whispered word from me andrew checked the rope and took aturn we were now close up to the side of the ship but still in deep shadow the ship lay close in to the massive legs but the platform overhung those legs and so ourselves by a good dozen feet so that the angled light from the floodlights by the crane on the welldeck above barely succeeded in touching the faraway side the port side of the upper deck of the ship all the rest of the vessel lay shrouded in deep darkness except for a patch of light that fell on the focsle from a rectangular gap high up in the overhang of the platform through this hole was suspended the vertical gangway a zigzag set of cagedin metal steps like a fireescape which i supposed could be raised or lowered with the ebb and flow of the tide the conditions might have been made for me the ship was low in the water the ribbed oil tanks standing high but the gunwale only at waist level i took a pencil light from my coat and went aboard i moved right forard in the darkness apart from a glimmer from the accommodation aft there was no light at all on board not even navigation or riding lights the christmas tree illuminations of the oil derrick made those superfluous there were deep sliding vertical doors giving to the raised focsle i pulled the head and foot bolts on one of these waited for a slight roll of the ship to help and eased the door back a crack enough for my head arm and light barrels paint drums ropes wood heavy chains it was some sort of bosuns store there was nothing there for me i eased the door back slid in the bolts and left i made my way aft over the tanks there were raised trapdoors with large clips which stuck out at all angles there were foreandaft and athwartships pipes of every conceivable size and at every conceivable height there were valves big wheels for turning those valves and nasty knobbly ventilators and i dont think i missed one of all of those with my head kneecaps or shins on the way aft it was like hacking your way through a virgin jungle a metal virgin jungle but i made it and i made it with the sure knowledge that there wasnt a trap or hatch on that deck able to take anything larger than a human being there was nothing for me in the stern either most of the deck space and superstructure there was given over to cabins the one big coachtype hatch was glassed in and had a couple of skylights open i used the flash engines that ruled that hatch out and the whole of the upper deck andrew was waiting patiently in the dinghy i felt rather than saw his inquiring look and shook my head not that i had to shake my head when he saw me clamping on my rubber skullcap and oxygen mask that was all the answer he needed he helped me make fast a lifeline round the waist and it took the two of us a whole minute the rubber raft was pitching and bouncing about so much that we had one hand for ourselves and only one for the job with the closed oxygen circuit the safe maximum depth i could get was about twentyfive feet the oiler drew perhaps fifteen so i had plenty in hand the underwater search for a wire or for something suspended from a wire proved far easier than i had anticipated for even at fifteen feet the effect of the surface swell motion was almost negligible andrew paid out slackened and tightened the lifeline to adjust to my every underwater movement as if he had been doing this sort of thing all his working life which indeed he had i covered the entire submerged length of the oiler twice keeping close to the bilge keels on either side examining every foot of the way with a powerful underwater flash halfway along the second sweep i saw a huge moray eel which writhed out of the darkness beyond the beam of the torch and thrust its head with its evil unwinking eyes and vicious poisonous teeth right up against the glass of the flashlight i clicked the beam on and off a couple of times and he was gone but that was all i saw i felt tired when i got back to the rubber dinghy and hauled myself aboard i felt tired because fifteen minutes hard swimming in an oxygen outfit would make anybody tired but i knew too wee that if id found what id been looking for tiredness would never have touched me id banked heavily on finding what id been looking for in or under that ship i felt let down i felt tired and low and dispirited and cold i wished i could smoke i thought of a crackling wood fire of steaming coffee and long long nightcap i thought of herman jablonksy sleeping peacefully in his big mahogany bed back in the generals house i stripped off mask and cylinder kicked the flippers off my feet pulled on a pair of shoes with numbed and fumbling fingers flung my pants coat and hat up on the deck of the oiler and dragged myself up after them three minutes later dressed in my outer clothes and dripping like a blanket thats just been hauled from a washboiler i was on my way up the enclosed gangway to the welldeck of the oilrig a hundred feet above my head drifting grey cloud had washed the last of the starlight out of the sky but that didnt help me any id thought the overhead lamp illuminating the gangway had been weak but it hadnt it had only been distant by the time i was ten feet from the underside of the platform it was a searchlight and if they kept a gangway watch did i tell them i was the second engineer from the oiler and was suffering from insomnia did i stand there and spin a plausible story while the moisture dripping down under my pants from the divingsuit formed a pool of water under my feet and my visavis examined with interest the scrunched highnecked glistening rubber where my collar and tie ought to have been i had no gun and i was prepared to believe that anyone in any way associated with general ruthven and vyland pulled on his shoulder holster before his socks when he got up in the morning certainly everyone id met so far had been a walking armoury and if a gun were pulled on me did i start running down a hundred and thirty steps while someone picked me off at their leisure of course i didnt have to run the fireescape gangway was only enclosed on three sides but the fourth opened seawards and i wouldnt bounce far off that maze of valves and pipes on the oiler below i concluded that any halfway intelligent man would have gone straight back down i went right on up there was no one there the gangway emerged in an alcove closed off on three sides by the railed platform edge on one side by high steel walls on the other two the fourth side gave directly on to the welldeck where the crane was what little i could see of this well was brightly illuminated and i could hear the clank of machinery and the voices of men not thirty feet away it didnt seem like a good idea to wander straight out into their midst so i looked for another way out i found it at once a set of steel rungs built into one of the twelvefoot high steel bulkheads by my side i went up those flattening myself out as i went over the top crawled a few yards then stood up behind the shelter of one of the huge pillars i could see the whole panorama of the oilrig now a hundred yards away on the larger raised platform to the north was the derrick itself looking more massive than ever with control cabins at its base and men moving around under the surface of that platform i supposed would be the powergenerating machinery the living accommodation the smaller platform to the south the one on which i stood was almost completely bare with a semicircular extension reaching out over the sea to the south the purpose of this large cleared space baffled me for a moment and then something clicked in my memory mary ruthven had said that the general normally commuted between oilrig and shore in his helicopter the helicopter would need a landingground this was it on the welldeck between the two platforms almost at my feet men were moving large barrels with the aid of a tracked crane trundling them into a brightlylit opening halfway along the high bulkhead on the northern platform oil would be piped aboard so those barrels could only be mud a chemical mixture of barites used for forcing down under pressure the cement that formed the outer casing of the drill hole there was a whole series of those big storage sheds most of them open extending right across the width of the rig there if anywhere would be what i was looking for i crossed to the far side of the south platform found another set of rungs and dropped down to the welldeck there was nothing to be gained by caution or stealth now apart from the fact that they would only excite suspicion the time factor was becoming allimportant with the weather steadily worsening the wind now seemed twice as strong as it had been half an hour previously and it wasnt just a factor of the height captain zaimis would be climbing up the mast perhaps he might even be forced to take off without me but there was no future in that thought and certainly none for me i put it out of my mind and crossed to the first of the storage bays the door was held on a heavy steel latch unlocked i opened the latch pushed back the door and passed inside it was pitch dark but my torch found the light switch right away i pressed it and looked around the bay was perhaps a hundred feet long stacked in nearly empty racks on both sides were three or four dozen screwed pipes almost as long as the bay itself round each pipe near the end were deep gouge marks as if some heavy metal claws had bitten into it sections of the drill pipe and nothing else i switched off the light went out pulled shut the door and felt a heavy hand on my shoulder would you be looking for something my friend it was a deep rough nononsense voice as irish as a sprig of shamrock i turned slowly but not too slowly pulling the lapels of my coat together with both hands as if to ward off the wind and the thin cold rain that was beginning to sift across the deck glittering palely through the beams of the arclamps then vanishing into the darkness again he was a short stocky man middleaged with a battered face that could be kindly or truculent as the needs of the moment demanded at that moment the balance of expression was tipped on the side of truculence but not much i decided to risk it as a matter of fact i am far from trying to conceal my british accent i exaggerated it a marked highclass english accent in the states excites no suspicion other than the charitaible one that you may be slightly wrong in the head the field foreman told me to inquire for the ah roustabout foreman are you he golly he said i felt that it should have been begorrah but the grammatical masterpiece had floored him you could see his mind clambering on to its feet again mr jerrold sent you to look for me eh yes indeed miserable night isnt it i pulled my hatbrim lower i certainly dont envy you fellows if you was looking for me he interrupted why were you poking about in there ah yes well i could see you were busy and as he thought he had lost it in there i thought perhaps i who had lost what where he breathed deeply patience on a monument the general general ruthven his briefcase with very important private papers and very urgent hed been making a tour of inspection yesterday let me see now it would have been early afternoon when he received the dastardly news he what when he heard his daughter had been kidnapped he went straight for his helicopter forgetting all about the briefcase and i get you important huh very general ruthven says hed put it down just inside some doorway its big morocco marked c c f in gold letters ccf i thought you said it was the generals the generals papers hed borrowed my case im farnborough his private confidential secretary it was very long odds indeed against one of the scores of roustabout foremen employed by the general knowing the real name of his secretary c c farnborough c c eh all suspicion and truculence now vanished he grinned hugely not claude cecil by any chance one of my names does happen to be claude i said quietly i dont think its funny i had read the irishman rightly he was instantly contrite sorry mr farnborough talkin outa turn no offence want that me and my boys help you look id be awfully obliged if its there well have it in five minutes he walked away issued orders to his gang of men but i had no interest in the result of the search my sole remaining interest lay in getting off that platform with all speed there would be no briefcase there and there would be nothing else there the foremans gang were sliding doors open with the abandon of men who have nothing to conceal i didnt even bother glancing inside any of the bays the fact that doors could be opened without unlocking and were being opened indiscriminately in the presence of a total stranger was proof enough for me that there was nothing to be concealed and apart from the fact that there were far too many men there to swear to secrecy it stood out a mile that that genial irishman was not the type to get mixed up in any criminal activities some people are like that you know it the moment you see and speak to them the roustabout foreman was one of those i could have slipped away and down the gangway while the search was still going on but that would have been stupid the search for the missing briefcase would be nothing compared to the allout search that would then start for c c farnborough they might assume i had fallen over the side powerful searchlights could pick up the matapan in a matter of minutes and even were i aboard the matapan i didnt want to leave the vicinity of the rig not yet and above all i didnt want the news to get back ashore that an intruder disguised as or at least claiming to be the generals secretary had been prowling around the x what to do when the search was over the foreman would expect me to go backto the derrick side where the accommodation and offices were presumably to report failure of a mission to mr jerrold once i left for there my retreat to the gangway would be cut off and so far it hadnt occurred to the foreman to ask how i had arrived aboard the rig he was bound to know that there had been no helicopter or boat out to the rig in hours which argued the fact that i must have been aboard for hours and if i had been aboard for hours why had i delayed so long in starting this so very urgent search for the missing briefcase the search as far as i could see was over doors were being banged shut and the foreman was starting back towards me when a bulkhead phone rang he moved towards it i moved into the darkest patch of shadow i could see and buttoned my coat right up to the neck that at least wouldnt excite suspicion the wind was strong now the cold rain driving across the welldeck at an angle of almost fortyfive degrees the foreman hung up and crossed over to where i was standing sorry mr farnborough no luck you sure he left it here certain mr ah curran joe curran well its not there now and we cant look any more he hunched deeper into his black glistening oilskin gotta go and start yoyoing that damned pipe oh yes i said politely he grinned and explained the drill gotta haul it up and change it on a night like this and in a wind like this and it must take some time it takes some time six hours if were lucky that damned drills buried two and a half miles straight down mr farnborough i made the proper noises of astonishment instead of the noises of relief i felt like making mr curran working on the derrick for the next six hours in this weather would have more to worry about than stray secretaries he made to go already his men had filed past and climbed up a companionway to the north platform com ing mr farnborough not yet i smiled wanly i think ill go and sit in the shelter of the gangway for a few minutes and work out what im going to tell the general i had an inspiration you see he only phoned up about five minutes ago you know what hes like lord knows what im going to tell him yeah its tough the words meant nothing already his mind was on the recovery of the drill be seein you yes thank you i watched him out of sight and two minutes later i was back aboard the rubber dinghy another two minutes and we had been hauled back to the matapan you have been far too long mr talbot captain zaimis scolded his small agitated figure gave the impression of hopping around in the darkness although it would have taken a monkey to hop around that pitching heaving spongeboat without falling overboard with the first hop the engine note was much louder now not only had the skipper been forced to increase engine revolutions to keep a certain amount of slack on the rope tying the matapan to the pillar but the vessel was now pitching so wildly that almost every time the bows plunged deep into the sea the underwater exhaust beneath the stern came clear in a brief but carrying crackle of sound you have been successful no captain zaimis called in my ear no so it is sad but no matter we must leave at once ten minutes john just another ten minutes its terribly important no we must leave at once he started to call the order to cast off to the young greek sitting in the bows when i caught his arm are you afraid captain zaimis despicable but i was desperate i am beginning to be afraid he said with dignity all wise men know when it is time to be afraid and i hope i am not a fool mr talbot there are times when a man is selfish if he is not afraid i have six children mr talbot and i have three i hadnt even one not any more i wasnt even married not any more for a long moment we stood there clinging on to the mast while the matapan pitched and corkscrewed wickedly in that almost impenetrable darkness under the cavernous shadow of the oilrig but apart from the thin whistling of the rainladen wind in the rigging it was a long silent moment i changed my tactics the lives of men depend upon this captain zaimis do not ask me how i know but i know would you have it said that men died because captain zaimis would not wait ten minutes there was a long pause the rain hissed whitely into the heaving blackness of the sea beneath us then he said ten minutes no more i slipped off shoes and outer clothing made sure the lifeline was securely tied to my waist just above the weights slipped on the oxygen mask and stumbled forward to the bows again thinking for no reason at all of big herman jablonsky sleeping the sleep of the just in his mahogany bed i watched until a particularly big swell came along waited until it had passed under and the bows were deep in the water stepped off into the sea and grabbed for the rope that moored the matapan to the pillar i went out towards the pillar hand over hand it couldnt have been more than twenty feet away but even with the rope to help me i got a pretty severe hammering and without the oxygen mask i dont know how much water i would have swallowed i collided with the pillar before i realised i was near it let go the rope and tried to grab the pillar why i dont know i might as well have tried to put my arms round a railway petrol tanker for the diameter was about the same i grabbed the rope again before i was swept away and worked my way round to the left towards the seaward side of the massive steel leg it wasnt easy every time the matapans bows rose with the swell the rope tightened and jammed my clutching hand immovably against the metal but just so long as i didnt lose any fingers i was beyond caring when my back was squarely to the swell i released the rope spread out my arms and legs thrust myself below water and started to descend that pillar something in the fashion of a sinhalese boy descending an enormous palm tree andrew paying out the line as skilfully as before ten feet twenty nothing thirty nothing thirtyfive nothing my heart was starting to pound irregularly and my head beginning to swim i was well below the safe operating limit of that closed oxygen mask quickly i halfswam halfclawed my way up and came to rest about fifteen feet below the surface clinging to that enormous pillar like a cat halfway up a tree and unable to get down five of captain zaimiss ten minutes were gone my time was almost run out and yet it had to be that oilrig it simply had to be the general himself had said so and there had been no need to tell anything but the truth to a man with no chance of escape and if that werent enough the memory of that stiff creaking leadenfooted man whod brought the tray of drinks into the generals room carried with it complete conviction but there was nothing on the ship alongside nor was there anything under it i would have sworn to that there was nothing on the oilrig itself i would have sworn to that too and if it wasnt on the platform then it was under the platform and if it was under the platform it was attached to a wire or chain and that wire or chain must be attached underwater to one of those supporting legs i tried to think as quickly and clearly as i could which of those fourteen legs would they use almost certainly i could eliminate right away the eight legs that supported the derrick platform too much activity there too many lights too many eyes too many dangling lines to catch the hundreds of fish attracted by the powerful overhead lights too much danger altogether so it had to be the helicopter platform under which the matapan was rolling and plunging at the end of her mooring rope to narrow it still farther had to narrow it to localise the search by gambling on the probable and ignoring the possible and almost equally probable there were only minutes left it was more likely that what i sought was on the seaward side where i was now than on the landward side where there was always danger from ships mooring there the middle pillar of the seaward three the one to which the matapan was moored i had already investigated which of the remaining two to try was settled at once by the fact that my lifeline was passed round the lefthand side of the pillar to have worked my way round threequarters of the circumference would have taken too long i rose to the surface gave two tugs to indicate that i would want more slack placed both feet against the metal pushed off hard and struck out for the corner pillar i almost didnt make it i saw now why captain zaimis was so worried and hed a fortyfoot boat and forty horsepower to cope with the power of the wind and the sea and that steadily growing deepening swell that was already breaking white on the tops all i had was myself and i could have done with more the heavy weights round my waist didnt help me any it took me a hundred yards of frantic thrashing and gasping to cover the fifteen yards that lay between the two pillars and closed oxygen sets arent designed for the kind of gasping i was doing but i made it just once more on the seaward side and pinned against the pillar by the pressure of the swell i started crabbing my way down below the surface this time it was easy for right away by chance my hand found a broad deeply and sharplycut series of slightly curved grooves in the metal extending vertically downwards i am no engineer but i knew this must be the worm that engaged against the big motordriven pinion which would be required to raise and lower those pillars there must have been one on the last pillar also but id missed it it was like going down a cliff with a series of rungs cut in the rockface i paused every other foot or so reaching out on both sides but there was nothing no projection no wire just the smooth rather slimy surface steadily painstakingly i forced myself downwards increasingly more conscious of the gripping pressure of the water the difficulty of breathing somewhere close on forty feet i called it a day damaging my eardrums or lungs or getting nitrogen into the bloodstream wasnt going to help anyone i gave up i went up just below the surface i stopped to have a rest and clear my head i felt bitterly disappointed i had banked more heavily than i knew on this last chance wearily i laid my head against the pillar and thought with a bleak hopelessness that i would have to start all over again and i had no idea in the world where to start i felt tired dead tired and then in a moment the tiredness left me as if it had never been that great steel pillar was alive with sound there could be no doubt about it instead of being silent and dead and full of water it was alive with sound i ripped off my rubber helmet coughed and gagged and spluttered as some water found its way in under the oxygen mask then pressed my ear hard against the cold steel the pillar reverberated with a deep resonant vibration that jarred the side of my head waterfilled pillars dont reverberate with sound not with sound of any kind but this one did beyond all question it wasnt water that was in that pillar it was air air all at once i identified that peculiar sound i was hearing i should have identified it immediately that rhythmical rising and falling of sound as a motor accelerated and slowed accelerated and slowed was a sound that had for many years been part and parcel of my professional me it was an air compressor and a big one at that hard at work inside that pillar an air compressor deep down below water level inside one of the support legs of a mobile rig standing far out in the gulf of mexico it didnt make sense it didnt make any kind of sense at all i leant my forehead against the metal and it seemed as if the shuddering jarring vibration was an insistent clamorous voice trying to tell me something something of urgency and vital importance if only i would listen i listened for half a minute perhaps a minute i listened and all of a sudden it made the very best kind of sense there was it was the answer i would never have dreamed of it was the answer to many things it took me time to guess this might be the answer it took me time to realise this must be the answer but when i did realise it i was left with no doubts in the world i gave three sharp tugs on the rope and within a minute was back aboard the matapan i was hauled aboard as quickly and with as little ceremony as if i had been a sack of coals and i was still stripping off oxygen cylinder and mask when captain zaimis barked for the mooring rope to be slipped gunned the engine scraped by the mooring pillar and put the rudder hard over the matapan yawed and rolled wickedly as she came broadside on to the troughs shipping solid seas and flying clouds of spray over the starboard side and then stern to the wind and steady on course headed for shore ten minutes later when id peeled off the divingsuit dried off dressed in shore clothes and was just finishing my second glass of brandy captain zaimis came down to the cabin he was smiling whether with satisfaction or relief i couldnt guess and seemed to regard all danger as being past and true enough riding before the seas the matapan was now almost rocksteady he poured himself a thimble of brandy and spoke for the first time since id been dragged aboard you were successful no yes i thought the curt affirmative a bit ungracious thanks to you captain zaimis he beamed you are kind mr talbot and i am delighted but not thanks to me but to our good friend here who watches over us over all those who gather sponges over all who go to sea he struck a match and put a light to a wick in an oilfilled boatshaped pottery dish which stood in front of a glassedin portrait of st nicholas i looked sourly at him i respected his piety and appreciated his sentiments but i thought he was a bit late in striking the matches chapter vi it was exactly two oclock in the morning when captain zaimis skilfully eased the matapan alongside the wooden jetty from which we had left the sky was black now the night so dark that it was scarcely possible to distinguish land from sea and the rain was a drumfire of sound on the roof of the cabin but i had to go and go at once i had to get back inside the house without being observed i had to have a long conference with jablonsky and i had to get my clothes dry my luggage was still in la contessa id only the one suit and i had to have it dry before morning i couldnt bank on not seeing anyone until evening as id done the previous day the general had said that hed let me know what job it was he had in mind inside thirtysix hours the thirtysix hours would be up at eight oclock this morning i borrowed a long oilskin to keep off the worst of the rain put it on over my own raincoat the oilskin was a couple of sizes too small it felt as if i were wearing a straitjacket shook hands all round thanked them for what they had done for me and left at a quarter past two after making a brief stop at a callbox i parked the corvette in the side turning where id found it and squelched along the road in the direction of the drive leading up to the generals house there were no sidewalks on the road the kind of people who lived on this exclusive stretch of sea frontage didnt have any need of sidewalks and the gutters were swollen little rivers with the muddy water spilling over the uppers of my shoes i wondered how i was going to get my shoes dry in time for the morning i passed the lodge where the chauffeur lived or where i presumed he lived and passed by the driveway also the enclosed tunnel was brightly lit and clambering over the top of that sixbarred gate in that blaze of light wouldnt have been a very clever thing to do and for all i knew the top bar might be set to work some electrically operated warning bell if sufficient weight were brought to bear i wouldnt have put anything beyond the lot who lived in that house thirty yards beyond the drive i squeezed through an all but imperceptible gap in the magnificent eightfoot hedge that fronted the generals estate less than two yards behind the edge was an equally magnificent eightfoot wall hospitably topped with huge chunks of broken glass set in cement neither the hedge concealing the wall nor the wall designed to discourage those too shy to enter by the main driveway was i had learnt from jablonsky peculiar to the generals estate all the neighbours had money enough and importance enough to make the protection of their privacy a matter of considerable consequence and this setup was common to most of them the rope dangling from the gnarled branch of the big live oak on the other side of the wall was where i had left it badly hampered by the binding constriction of the oilskin i waddled rather than walked up that wall swung to earth on the other side clambered up the oak unfastened the rope and thrust it under an exposed root i didnt expect to have to use that rope again but one never knew what i did know was that i didnt want any of vylands playmates finding it what was peculiar to the generals estate was the fence about twenty feet beyond the wall it was a fivestranded affair and the top three were barbed the sensible person obviously pushed up the second lowest plain wire pushed down the bottom one stooped and passed through but what i knew thanks to jablonsky and what the sensible person didnt was that pressure on either of the two lower wires operated a warning bell so i climbed laboriously over the top three wires to the sound of much ripping and tearing and lowered myself down on the other side andrew wasnt going to have much farther use for his oilskin by the time he got it back if he ever got it back under the closely packed trees the darkness was almost absolute i had a pencil flash but i didnt dare use it i had to trust to luck and instinct to circle the big kitchen garden that lay to the left of the house and so reach the fireescape at the back i had about two hundred yards to go and i didnt expect to make it in under a quarter of an hour i walked as old brokennose the butler had fancied he walked when he crept away from our bedroom door after leaving jabkmsky and myself there i had the advantages of normal arches to my feet and no adenoids worth talking about i walked with both arms outstretched before me and it wasnt until my face collided with a tree trunk that i learned not to walk with my arms outspread as well as outstretched i couldnt do anything about the dripping clammy spanish moss that kept wrapping itself about my face but i could do something about the hundreds of twigs and broken branches that littered the ground i didnt walk i shuffled i didnt lift my feet i slid each one forward slowly and carefully brushing aside whatever lay in my path and not allowing any weight to come on the leading foot until i had made good and certain that there was nothing under that foot that would snap or creak when my weight was transferred to it although i do say it i was pretty silent it was as well that i was ten minutes after leaving the fence when i was seriously beginning to wonder whether i had angled off in the wrong direction suddenly through the trees and the curtain of rain dripping steadily from the oaks i thought i saw a tiny glimmer of light a flicker then gone i might have imagined it but i dont have that kind of imagination i knew i didnt so i slowed down still more pulling my hatbrim down and coat collar up so that no faintest sheen of paleness might betray my face you couldnt have heard the rustle of my heavy oilskin three feet away i cursed the spanish moss it wrapped its long clammy tendrils round my face it made me blink and shut my eyes at the very moments when shutting my eyes might have been the last thing i ever did and it obscured my vision to a degree where i felt like dropping to my hands and knees and crawling forward on all fours i might even have done that but i knew the crackling of the oilskin would give me away then i saw the glimmer of light again it was thirty feet away no more and it wasnt pointing in my direction it was illuminating something on the ground i took a couple of quick smooth steps forward wanting to pinpoint the light source and see the reason for its use and then i discovered that my navigational sense in the darkness had been completely accurate the kitchen garden was surrounded by a wirenetted wooden fence and halfway through my second step i walked right into it the top rail creaked like the door to an abandoned dungeon there came a sudden exclamation the dousing of the light a brief silence and then the torch flicked on again the beam no longer pointing at the ground but reaching out for and searching the perimeter of the kitchen garden whoever held the torch was as nervous as a kitten because whoever held the torch had more than a vague idea where the sound had come from and a steady careful sweep would have picked me up in three seconds as it was the search consisted of a series of jittery probings and jerkings of the beam and id time to take a long smooth step backwards just one there was no time for more as far as it is possible to melt into a neighbouring oak tree i melted into a neighbouring oak tree i pressed against it as if i were trying to push it over and wished as i had never wished before i wished i had a gun give me that flash the cold quiet voice was unmistakably royales the torch beam wavered steadied then shone down on the ground again get on with it now but i heard something mr royale it was larry his voice a highpitched jittery whisper over there i know i did yeah me too its all right with a voice like royales with a voice with as much warmth in it as a champagne bucket it was difficult to sound soothing but he was doing his best woods are full of those noises in the dark hot day cold rain at night contraction then all sorts of noises now hurry it up want to stay out in this damned rain all night look mr royale the whisper was more than earnest now it was desperate i didnt make a mistake honest i didnt i heard missed out on your shot of the white stuff tonight royale interrupted cruelly the strain of even a moments kindness had been too much for him god why did i have to be saddled with a junky like you shut up and work larry shut up i wondered about what royale had said because id been wondering about it ever since i saw larry his behaviour the fact that he was allowed to associate with vyland and the general the liberties he was permitted above all his very presence there big criminal organisations working for big stakes and if this bunch werent working for big stakes i couldnt imagine who were usually picked the members of their organisation with as much care and forethought as a big corporation picks its top executives more a careless slipup a moments indiscretion on the part of an executive wont ruin a big corporation but it can destroy a criminal setup big crime is big business and big criminals are big businessmen running their illegal activities with all the meticulous care and administrative precision of their more lawabiding colleagues if most reluctantly it was found necessary to remove rivals or such as offered menace to their security the removal was entrusted to quiet polite people like royale but larry was about as much use to them as a match in a powder magazine there were three of them in that corner of the kitchen garden royale larry and the butler whose range of duties appeared to be wider than that normally expected of his profession in the better class english country houses larry and the butler were busy with spades digging i thought at first because royale had the light hooded and even at ten yards in that rain it was difficult to see anything but by and by judging more by ear than by eye i knew that they were filling in a hole in the ground i grinned to myself in the darkness i would have taken long odds that they were burying something very valuable indeed something that would not be remaining there very long a kitchen garden was hardly the ideal permanent hiding place for treasure trove three minutes later they were finished someone drew a rake to and fro across the filledin hole i assumed that they must have been digging in a freshly turned vegetable patch and wanted to conceal the signs of their work and then they all went off together to the gardening shed a few yards away and left their spades and rake there they came out again talking softly royale in the lead with the torch in his hand they passed through a wicker gate not fifteen feet from me but by this time id withdrawn some yards into the wood and had the thick bole of an oak for cover they went off together up the path that led to the front of the house and by and by the low murmur of voices faded and vanished a bar of light fell across the porch as the front door opened then there came the solid click of a heavy door closing on its latch then silence i didnt move i stayed exactly where i was breathing lightly and shallowly not stirring an inch the rain redoubled in violence the thick foliage of the oak might have been a wisp of gauze for all the protection it afforded but i didnt move the rain trickled down inside oilskin and overcoat and ran down my back and legs but i didnt move it trickled down my front and into my shoes but i didnt move i could feel the tide rising up to my ankles but i didnt move i just stayed where i was a human figure carved from ice but colder my hands were numb my feet frozen and uncontrollable shivers shook my entire body every few seconds i would have given the earth to move but i didnt only my eyes moved hearing was of little value to me now with the high moan of the steadily increasing wind through the topmost swaying branches of the trees and the loud frenetic rustling of the rain driving through the leaves you couldnt have heard a careless footfall ten feet away but after threequarters of an hour standing there motionless eyes became perfectly accustomed to the dark and you could have spotted a careless movement ten yards away and i spotted it a movement that is but not careless deliberate i think it must have been a sudden furious flurry of wind and rain that finally broke the patience of the shadow that now detached itself from the shelter of a nearby tree and moved away silently up towards the house if i hadnt been watching staring into the darkness with eyes sore and strained from staring i would have missed it for i certainly would have heard nothing but i didnt miss it a shadow moving with the soundlessness of a shadow a quiet deadly man royale his words to larry had been so much bluff for the benefit of any listener royale had heard a noise al right and the noise must have been just sufficiently offbeat to make him wonder if someone were there only enough to make him wonder if royale had been certain hed have remained there all night waiting to strike the strike of a ferdelance i thought of myself going into that kitchen garden immediately after the three had left getting a spade and starting to investigate and i felt colder than ever i could see myself bending over the hole the unseen unheard approach of royale and then the bullet just one a cupronickel jacketed at the base of the skull but i had to go to get a spade and start investigating some time and no better time than now the rain was torrential the night as dark as the tomb in those conditions it was unlikely that royale would return though i would have put nothing past that cunning and devious mind but even if he did he would have been exposed to the bright lights inside and it would take him ten minutes at least to readapt his eyes to that almost total darkness before he would dare move around again that he wouldnt move around with a torch was certain if he thought there was still an intruder in the grounds then he thought that intruder had seen the digging operations but had still made no move and if he thought there was such a man then he would assume him to be a careful and dangerous man to move in search of whom with a lighted torch in hand would be to ask for a bullet in the back for royale was not to know that the intruder had no gun i thought ten minutes would be enough to find out what i wanted both because any burial of anything in a garden was bound to be temporary and because neither larry nor the butler had struck me as people who would derive any pleasure from using a spade or who would dig an inch deeper than was absolutely necessary i was right i found a spade in the tool shed located the freshlyraked earth with a pinpoint of light from my pencil flash and from the time i had passed through the wicker gate till i had cleared off the two or three inches of earth that covered some kind of white pine packing case no more than five minutes had elapsed the packing case was lying at a slight angle in the ground and so heavy was the rain drumming down on my bent back and on top of the case that within a minute the lid of the case had been washed white and clean and free from the last stain of earth the muddy water draining off to one side i flashed the torch cautiously no name no marks nothing to give any indication of the contents the case had a wood and rope handle at each end i grabbed one of those got both hands round it and heaved but the case was over five feet long and seemed to be filled with bricks even so i might have managed to move it but the earth around the hole was so waterlogged and soft that my heels just gouged through it and into the hole itself i took my torch again hooded it till the light it cast was smaller than a penny and started quartering the surface of the packing case no metal clasps no heavy screws as far as i could see the only fastenings holding down the lid were a couple of nails at either end i lifted the spade dug a corner under one end of the lid the nails creaked and squealed in protest as i forced them out of the wood but i went on anyway and sprung the end of the lid clear i lifted it a couple of feet and shone my flash inside even in death jablonsky was still smiling the grin was lopsided and crooked the way they had had to make jablonsky himself lopsided and crooked in order to force him inside the narrow confines of that case but it was still a smile his face was calm and peaceful and with the end of a pencil you could have covered that tiny hole between his eyes it was the kind of hole that would have been made by the cupronickel jacketed bullet from a automatic twice that night out on the gulf i had thought of jablonsky sleeping peacefully hed been asleep all right hed been asleep for hours his skin was cold as marble i didnt bother going through the pockets of the dead man royale and vyland would have done that already besides i knew that jablonsky had carried nothing incriminating on his person nothing that could have pointed to the true reason for his presence there nothing that could have put the finger on me i wiped the rain off the dead face lowered the lid and hammered the nails softly home with the handle of the spade id opened a hole in the ground and now i closed a grave it was well for royale that i did not meet him then i returned spade and rake to the tool shed and left the kitchen garden there were no lights at the back of the entrance lodge i found one door and two groundlevel windows it was a singlestory building and they were all locked they would be in that place everything would be locked always but the garage wasnt nobody was going to be so crazy as to make off with a couple of rollsroyces even if they could have got past the electrically operated gate which they couldnt the garage was fit match for the cars the tool bench and equipment were the doityourself devotees dream i ruined a couple of perfectly good wood chisels but i had the catch slipped on one of the windows in a minute flat it didnt seem likely that they had burglar alarms fitted to a lodge especially as there hadnt even been an attempt made to fit halfcircle thiefproof sash latches but i took no chances pulled the top window down and climbed in over it when wiring a window the usual idea is to assume that the sneakthief who breaks and enters is a slave to habit who pushes up the lower sash and crawls in under apart from which the average electrician finds it much kinder on the shoulder muscles to wire at waist level instead of above the head and in this case i found an average electrician had indeed been at work the lodge was wired i didnt drop down on top of any startled sleeper in a bedroom or knock over a row of pots and pans in the kitchen for the sufficient reason that id picked a room with frosted windows and it seemed a fair bet that that might be the bathroom and so it was out in the passageway i flicked my pencil light up and down the lodge had been designed if that was the word with simplicity the passage directly joined the back and front doors two small rooms opened off either side of the passage that was all the room at the back opposite the bathroom proved to be the kitchen nothing there i moved up the small passageway as softly as the squelching of my shoes would permit picked the door on the left turned the handle with millimetric caution and moved soundlessly inside this was it i closed the door behind me and moved softly in the direction of the deep regular breathing by the left hand wall when i was about four feet away i switched on my pencil flash and shone it straight on the sleepers closed eyes he didnt remain sleeping long not with that concentrated beam on him he woke as at the touch of a switch and half sat up in bed propped on an elbow while a free hand tried to shade his dazzled eyes i noticed that even when woken in the middle of the night he looked as if hed just brushed that gleaming black hair ten seconds previously i always woke up with mine looking like a halfdried mop a replica of the current feminine urchin cut the one achieved by a shortsighted lunatic armed with garden shears he didnt try anything he looked a tough capable sensible fellow who knew when and when not to try anything and he knew that now was not the time not when he was almost blind theres a behind this flash kennedy i said wheres your gun what gun he didnt sound scared because he wasnt get up i ordered the pyjamas i was glad to see werent maroon i might have picked them myself move over to the door he moved i reached under his pillow this gun i said a small grey automatic i didnt know the make back to your bed and sit on it torch transferred to my left hand and the gun in the right i made a quick sweep of the room only one window with deep velvet wine curtains closed right across i went to the door switched on the overhead light glanced down at the gun and slipped off the safety catch the click was loud precise and sounded as if it meant business kennedy said so you hadnt a gun ive got one now its not loaded friend dont tell me i said wearily you keep it under your pillow just so you can get oil stains all over the sheets if this gun was empty youd be at me like the chatanooga express whatever that is i looked over the room a friendly masculine place bare but comfortable with a good carpet not in the cornbelt class of the one in the generals library a couple of armchairs a damaskcovered table small settee and glassedin wall cupboard i crossed over to the cupboard opened it and took out a bottle of whisky and a couple of glasses i looked at kennedy with your permission of course funny man he said coldly i went ahead and poured myself a drink anyway a big one i needed it it tasted just the way it ought to taste and all too seldom does i watched kennedy and he watched me who are you friend he asked id forgotten that only about two inches of my face was visible i turned down the collars of my oilskin and overcoat and took off my hat my hat had become no better than a sponge my hair was wet and plastered all over my head but for all that i dont suppose it was any less red than normal the tightening of kennedys mouth the suddenly still expressionless eyes told their own story talbot he said slowly john talbot the killer thats me i agreed the killer he sat very still watching me i suppose a dozen different thoughts must have been running through his mind but none of them showed he had as much expression in his face as a wooden indian but the brown intelligent eyes gave him away he could not quite mask the hostility the cold anger that showed in their depths what do you want talbot what are you doing here you mean why am i not hightailing it for the tall timber why have you come back theyve had you locked up in the house god knows why since tuesday evening youve escaped but you didnt have to mow anyone down to escape or i would have heard of it they probably dont even know youve been away or id have heard of that too but youve been away youve been out in a boat i can smell the sea off you and thats a seamans oilskin youve got on youve been out for a long time you couldnt be any wetter if youd stood under a waterfall for half an hour and then you come back a killer a wanted man the whole setup is screwy as hell screwy as hell i agreed the whisky was good i was beginning to feel halfhuman for the first time in hours a smart boy this chauffeur a boy who thought on his feet and thought fast i went on almost as screwy a setup as this weird bunch youre working for in this place he said nothing and i didnt see why he should in his place i dont think i would have passed the time of day by discussing my employers with a passing murderer i tried again the generals daughter miss mary shes pretty much of a tramp isnt she that got him he was off the bed eyes mad fists balled into hard knots and was halfway towards me before he remembered the gun pointing straight at his chest he said softly id love you to say that again talbot without that gun in your hand thats better i said approvingly signs of life at last committing yourself to a definite opinion you know the old saw about actions speaking louder than words if id just asked you what mary ruthven was like youd just have clammed up or told me go jump in the lake i dont think shes a tramp either i know shes not i think shes a nice kid a very fine girl indeed sure you do his voice was bitter but i could see the first shadows of puzzlement touching his eyes thats why you scared the me out of her that afternoon im sorry about that sincerely sorry but i had to do it kennedy although not for the reasons that you or any of that murderous bunch up at the big house think i downed what was left of my whisky looked at him for a long speculative moment then tossed the gun across to him suppose we talk it took him by surprise but he was quick very quick he fielded the gun neatly looked at it looked at me hesitated shrugged then smiled faintly i dont suppose another couple of oil stains will do those sheets any harm he thrust the gun under the pillow crossed to the table poured himself a drink filled up my glass and stood there waiting im not taking the chance you might think i am i began i heard vyland trying to persuade the general and mary to get rid of you i gathered you were a potential danger to vyland and the general and others i may not know of from that i gathered youre not on the inside of whats going on and youre bound to know theres something very strange indeed going on he nodded im only the chauffeur and what did they say to vyland from the way he spoke the name i gathered he regarded vyland with something less than affection they stuck in their heels and refused pointblank he was pleased at that he tried not to show it but he was it seems you did the ruthven family a great service not so long ago i went on shot up a couple of thugs who tried to kidnap mary i was lucky where speed and violence were concerned i guess hed always be lucky im primarily a bodyguard not a chauffeur miss marys a tempting bait for every hoodlum in the country who fancies a quick million but im not the bodyguard any longer he ended abruptly ive met your successor i nodded valentino he couldnt guard an empty nursery valentino he grinned al grunther but valentino suits him better you damaged his arm so i heard he damaged my leg its black and blue and purple all over i eyed him speculatively forgotten that youre talking to a murderer kennedy youre no murderer he said flatly there was a long pause then he broke his gaze from me and stared down at the floor patrolman donnelly eh i asked he nodded without speaking donnelly is as fit as you are i said might take him some little time to wash the powderstains out of his pants but thats all the damage he suffered rigged eh he asked softly youve read about me in the papers i waved a hand at the magazine stand in the corner i was still front page news and the photograph was even worse than the previous one the rest youll have heard from mary some of what youve heard and read is true some of it just couldnt be less true my name is john talbot and i am as they said in court a salvage expert i have been in all the places they mention except bombay and for approximately the periods they mention but i have never been engaged in any criminal activities of any kind however either vyland or the general or both are very cagey birds indeed theyve sent cables to contacts in holland england and venezuela the general of course has oil interests in all three places to check on my bona fides theyll be satisfied weve spent a long time preparing the groundwork for this how do you know they sent those cables every overseas cable out of marble springs in the past two months has been vetted the general all cables are in his name uses code of course perfectly legal to do so theres a little old man from washington living a block away from the post office hes a genius with codes he says the generals is childish from his point of view i got up and started to walk around the effects of the whisky were vanishing i felt like a cold wet flounder i had to get in on the inside up till now weve been working very much in the dark but for reasons which would take too long to explain at present we knew that the general would jump at the chance of getting hold of a salvage expert he did we kennedy still had his reservations about me friends of mine dont worry kennedy ive got all the law in the world behind me im not in this for myself to make the general take the bait we had to use the generals daughter she knows nothing of what actually went on judge mollisons pretty friendly with the family so i got him to invite mary along for a meal suggesting that she drop in at the courthouse first while she was waiting for him to clear up the last cases judge mollisons in on this he is youve a phone there and a phone book want to ring him he shook his head mollison knows i continued and about a dozen cops all sworn to secrecy and they know that a word the wrong way and theyre looking for a job the only person outside the law who knows anything about it is the surgeon who is supposed to have operated on donnelly and then signed his death certificate hed a kind of troublesome conscience but i finally talked him into it all a phoney he murmured heres one that fell for it everybody did they were meant to phoney reports from interpol and cuba with the full backing of the police concerned blank rounds in the first two chambers of donnellys colt phoney road blocks phoney chases by the cops phoney but but the bullet in the windscreen i told her to duck i put it there myself car and empty garage all laid on and jablonsky laid on too mary was telling me about jablonsky he said slowly mary i noticed not miss mary maybe it meant nothing maybe it showed the way he habitually thought of her a crooked cop she said just another plant just another plant weve been working on this for over two years earlier on we wanted a man who knew the caribbean backwards jablonsky was the man born and brought up in cuba two years ago he was a cop in new york homicide it was jablonsky who thought up the idea of rigging false charges against himself it was smart it not only accounted for the sudden disappearance of one of the best cops in the country but it gave him the entree into the wrong kind of society when the need arose hes been working with me in the caribbean for the past eighteen months taking a chance wasnt he i mean cuba is home from home for half the crooks in the states and the chances he was disguised i said patiently beard moustache both homegrown all his hair dyed glasses even his own mother wouldnt have known him there was a long silence then kennedy put down his glass and looked steadily at me what goes on talbot sorry youll have to trust me the less anyone knows the better mollison doesnt know none of the lawmen know theyve had their orders its that big he asked slowly big enough look kennedy no questions im asking you to help me if youre not frightened for marys health its time you started to be i dont think she knows a thing more about what goes on between vyland and the general than you do but im convinced shes in danger great danger of her life im up against big boys playing for big stakes to win those stakes theyve already killed eight times eight times to my certain knowledge if you get mixed up in this business id say the chances are more than even that youll end up with a bullet in your back and im asking you to get mixed up in it ive no right to but im doing it whats it to be some of the colour had gone out of his brown face but not much he didnt like what id just said but if his hands were trembling i couldnt notice youre a clever man talbot he said slowly maybe too clever i dont know but youre clever enough not to have told me ae this unless you were pretty certain id do it playing for big stakes you said i think id like to sit in i didnt waste any time in thanking him or congratulating him sticking your neck in a running noose isnt a matter for congratulation instead i said i want you to go with mary no matter where she goes i want you to go also im almost certain that tomorrow morning this coming morning that is well all be going out to the oilrig mary will almost certainly go along too shell have no option you will go with her he made to interrupt but i held up my hand i know youve been taken off the job make some excuse to go up to the house tomorrow morning early see mary tell her that valentino is going to have a slight accident in the course of the morning and she what do you mean hell have an accident dont worry i said grimly hell have his accident all right he wont be able to look after himself far less anybody else for some time to come tell her that she is to insist on having you back if she sticks out her neck and makes an issue of it shell win the general wont object and im pretty sure vyland wont either its only for a day and after tomorrow the question of who looks after her wont worry him very much dont ask me how i know because i dont but im banking on it i paused anyway vyland will just think shes insisting on having you because he thinks she has shall we say a soft spot for you he kept his wooden indian expression in place so i went on i dont know whether its so and i dont care im just telling you what i think vyland thinks and why that should make him accept her suggestion that and the fact that he doesnt trust you and would rather have you out on the rig and under his eye anyway very well i might have been suggesting that he come for a stroll he was a cool customer all right tell her and play it the way you want he thought a moment then continued you tell me im sticking my neck out maybe i am maybe im doing it of my own free will at the same time i think that the fact that im doing it at all entitles me to a little more honesty on your part have i been dishonest i wasnt annoyed i was just beginning to feel very tired indeed only in what you dont say you tell me you want me so that ill look after the generals daughter compared to what youre after talbot marys safety doesnt matter a tuppenny damn to you if it did you could have hidden her away when you had her the day before yesterday but you didnt you brought her back you say shes in great danger it was you talbot who brought her back to this danger ok so you want me to keep an eye on her but you want me for something else too i nodded i do im going into this with my hands tied literally im going into this as a prisoner i must have someone i can trust im trusting you you can trust jablonsky he said quietly jablonskys dead he stared at me without speaking after a few moments he reached out for the bottle and splashed whisky into both our glasses his mouth was a thin white line in the brown face see that i pointed to my sodden shoes thats the earth from jablonskys grave i filled it in just before i came here not fifteen minutes ago they got him through the head with a small bore automatic they got him between the eyes he was smiling kennedy you dont smile when you see death coming to you jablonsky never saw it coming he was murdered in his sleep i gave him a brief account of what had happened since id left the house including the trip in the tarpon springs sponge boat out to the x up to the moment i had come here when i was finished he said royale royale youll never be able to prove it i wont have to i said it almost without realising what i was saying royale may never stand trial jablonsky was my best friend he knew what i was saying all right he said softly id just as soon you never came after me talbot i drained my whisky it was having no effect now i felt old and tired and empty and dead then kennedy spoke again what are you going to do now do im going to borrow some dry shoes and socks and underwear from you then im going to go back up to the house go to my room dry my clothes off handcuff myself to the bed and throw the keys away theyll come for me in the morning youre crazy he whispered why do you think they killed jablonsky i dont know i said wearily you must know he said urgently why else should they kill him if they hadnt found out who he really was what he was really doing they killed him because they found out the doublecross and if they found that out about him they must have found it out about you theyll be waiting for you up there in your room talbot theyll know youll be coming back for they wont know you found jablonsky youll get it through the head as you step over the threshold cant you see that talbot for gods sake man cant you see it i saw it a long time ago maybe they know all about me maybe they dont theres so much i dont know kennedy but maybe they wont kill me maybe not yet i got to my feet im going back on up for a moment i thought he was going to use physical force to try to stop me tat there must have been something in my face that made him change his mind he put his hand on my arm how much are they paying you for this talbot pennies reward none then what in the name of god is the compulsion that will drive a man like you to crazy lengths like those his goodlooking brown face was twisted in anxiety and perplexity he couldnt understand me i couldnt understand myself either i said i dont know yes i do ill tell you someday youll never live to tell anybody anything he said sombrely i picked up dry shoes and clothes told him good night and left chapter vii there was nobody waiting for me in my room up in the generals house i unlocked the corridor door with the duplicate key jablonsky had given me eased it open with only a whisper of sound and passed inside nobody blasted my head off the room was empty the heavy curtains were still drawn shut as i had left them but i let the light switch be there was a chance that they didnt know that id left the room that night but if anyone saw a light come on in the room of a man handcuffed to his bed theyd be up to investigate in nothing flat only jablonsky could have switched it on and jablonsky was dead i went over every square foot of floor and walls with my pencil flash nothing missing nothing changed if anyone had been here hed left no trace of his visit but then if anyone had been here i would have expected him to leave no trace there was a big wall heater near the communicating door to jablonskys room i switched this on to full undressed by its ruddy glow towelled myself dry and hung trousers and coat over the back of a chair to dry off i pulled on the underwear and socks id borrowed from kennedy stuffed my own rainsoaked underwear and socks into my sodden shoes opened the curtains and windows and hurled them as far as i could into the dense undergrowth behind the house where id already concealed oilskin and overcoat before climbing the fireescape i strained my ears but i couldnt even hear the sound the shoes made on landing i felt pretty sure no one else could have heard anything either the high moan of the wind the drumming of that torrential rain smothered all sound at its source i took keys from the pocket of my already steaming jacket and crossed to the communicating door to jablonskys room maybe the reception committee was waiting there i didnt much care there was no committee the room was as empty as my own i crossed to the corridor door and tried the handle the door was locked the bed as i expected had been slept in sheets and blankets had been pulled back so far that most of them were on the floor there were no signs of a struggle there were no signs even of violence not until i turned the pillow upside down the pillow was a mess but nothing to what it would have been if death hadnt been instantaneous the bullet must have passed clean through the skull not what you would have expected from a but then mr royale used very fancy ammunition i found the shell in the down of the pillow cupronickel it wasnt like royale to be so careless i was going to look after that little piece of metal was going to treasure it like the cullinan diamond i found some adhesive in a drawer pulled off a sock taped the spent bullet under the second and third toes where there would be no direct pressure on it and where it wouldnt interfere with my walking it would be safe there the most thorough and conscientious search should there be one would miss it houdini went around for years with tiny steel instruments taped to the soles of his feet and no one ever thought to look down on my hands and knees i levelled the torch along the nap of the carpet and squinted down the beam it wasnt much of a carpet but it was enough the two parallel indentations where jablonskys heels had dragged across it were unmistakable i rose to my feet examined the bed again picked up a cushion that lay on the armchair and examined that i couldnt see anything but when i bent my head and sniffed there could be no doubt about it the acrid odour of burnt powder clings to fabrics for days i crossed to the small table in the corner poured three fingers of whisky into a glass and sat down to try to figure it all out the setup just didnt begin to make any sense at all nothing jibed nothing fitted how had royale and whoever had been with him for no one man could have carried jablonsky out of that room by himself managed to get in in the first place jablonsky had felt as secure in that house as a stray lamb in a starving wolf pack and i knew he would have locked the door somebody else could have had a key of course but the point was that jablonsky invariably left his key in the lock and jammed it so that it couldnt be pushed out or turned from the other side not unless enough force were used and noise made to wake him up a dozen times over jablonsky had been shot when sleeping in bed jablonsky i knew had pyjamas and used them but when i found him in the kitchen garden hed been completely clothed why dress him it didnt make sense especially trying to dress a dead man weighing ib didnt make sense and why had there been no silencer fitted to the gun i knew there hadnt been with the pressure absorption of a silencer not even those special bullets would travel through a skullbone twice and besides hed used a cushion to muffle the shot understandable enough in a way those rooms were in a remote wing of the house and with the help of a cushion and the background noise of the growing storm the chances were that the shot would not be heard in the other parts of the house but the point was that i had been right next door and was bound to have heard it unless i were deaf or dead and as far as royale had known or as far as i thought he had known i had been asleep in the next room or had royale known i was not in that room had he come to make a quick check found i was gone knew that it must have been jablonsky that had let me go and killed jablonsky there and then it fitted with the facts but it didnt fit with the smile on the dead mans face i went back into my own room rearranged my steaming clothes on the back of the chair before the electric fire then returned to jablonskys room i took up my glass again and glanced at the whisky bottle it was a fivegill flask still three parts full that was no help what was missing wouldnt even have begun to affect jablonskys razoredged vigilance id seen jablonsky dispose of an entire bottle of rum he wasnt a whisky man in an evening and the only apparent effect it had had on him was that he smiled even more than usual but jablonsky would never smile again sitting there alone in the near darkness the only illumination the glow from the electric fire in the next room i lifted my glass a toast a farewell i dont know what youd call it it was for jablonsky i sipped it slowly rolling the whisky over my tongue to savour to the full the rich bouquet and taste of a fine old scotch for the space of two or three seconds i sat very still indeed then i put the glass down rose crossed quickly to the corner of the room spat the scotch into the washbasin and rinsed my mouth out very carefully indeed it was vyland who had provided the whisky after jablonsky had paraded me downstairs last night vyland had given him a sealed whisky bottle and glasses to take back to his room jablonsky had poured out a couple of drinks soon after we had gone upstairs and id actually had my glass in my hand when i remembered that drinking alcohol before breathing oxygen on a deep dive wasnt a very clever thing to do jablonsky had drained them both then had maybe a couple more after i had left royale and his friends didnt have to batter jablonskys door in with foreaxes they had a key for the job but even if they had used axes jablonsky would never have heard them there had been enough knockout drops in that bottle of whisky to put an elephant out for the count he must have been just able to stagger as far as his bed before collapsing i knew it was stupid but i stood there in the silent dark reproaching myself bitterly for not having accepted that drink it was a fairly subtle blending of a mickey finn and scotch but i think i would have got on to it straight away but jablonsky wasnt a whisky man maybe he thought that was the way scotch ought to taste and royale of course had found two glasses with whisky dregs in them that made me as unconscious as jablonsky but it hadnt been any part of their plan to kill me too i understood it all now everything except the answer to the one question that really mattered why had they killed jablonsky i couldnt even begin to guess and had they bothered looking in to check on me i didnt think so but i wouldnt have bet a pair of old bootlaces on it there was nothing to be gained by sitting and thinking about it so i sat and thought about it for a couple of hours by that time my clothes were dry or as near dry as made no difference the trousers especially were lined and wrinkled like a pair of elephants legs but then you couldnt expect an immaculate crease in the clothes of a man who is compelled to sleep in them i dressed all except for coat and tie opened the window and was just on the point of throwing out the three duplicate keys for the room doors and the handcuff key to join the other stuff in the shrubbery below when i heard a soft tapping on the door of jablonskys room i only jumped about a foot then i froze i suppose i should have stood there with my mind racing but the truth was that with what i had been through that night and with all the inconclusive and futile thinking id been doing in the past two hours my mind was in no condition to walk far less race i just stood there lots wife had nothing on me for a lifetime of ten seconds not a single intelligent thought came just an impulse one single overpowering impulse to run but i had no place to run to it was royale that quiet cold deadly man with the little gun it was royale he was waiting outside that door and the little gun would be in his hand he knew i was out all right hed checked he knew id be back because he knew that jablonsky and i were in cahoots and that i hadnt gone to such extreme lengths to get myself into that household just to light out at the first opportunity that offered and hed guessed that i should have been back by this time maybe hed even seen me coming back then why had he waited so long i could guess the answer to that one too he knew i would have been expecting jablonsky to be there when i returned he would think that i would have figured that jablonsky must have gone off on some private expedition of his own and that as id locked the door when i came back and left the key there jablonsky wouldnt be able to use his own to get in so he would knock softly and after having waited two hours for my partners return i would be so worried stiff by his continuing absence that i would rush to the door when the knock came and then royale would let me have one of those cupronickel bullets between the eyes because if they knew beyond doubt that jablonsky and i were working together they would also know that i would never do for them what they wanted me to do and so i would be of no further use to them so a bullet between the eyes just the same way jablonsky had got his and then i thought of jablonsky i thought of him lying out there jammed up in that cheap packing case and i wasnt afraid any more i didnt see that id much chance but i wasnt afraid i catfooted through to jablonskys room closed my hand round the neck of the whisky bottle went as silently back into my own room and slid a key into the lock of the door opening on to the passage outside the bolt slid back without even the whisper of a click and just at that moment the knocking came again slightly louder this time and more sustained under cover of the sound i slid the door open a crack raised the bottle over my head ready for throwing and stuck my head round the corner of the door the passage was only dimly lit by a single weak nightlight at the other end of a long corridor but it was enough enough to let me see that the figure in the passage had no gun in its hand enough to let me see that it wasnt royale it was mary ruthven i lowered the whisky bottle and stepped back softly into my room five seconds later i was at the door of jablonskys room i said in my best imitation of jablonskys deep husky voice whos there mary ruthven let me ia quickly please i let her in quickly i had no more desire than she had that she should be seen out in that passage i kept behind the door as she came through then closed it swiftly before the pale glimmer of light from outside gave her time to identify me mr jablonsky her voice was a quick urgent breathless frightened whisper i had to come to see you i simply had i thought i could never get away but gunther dropped off to sleep and he may wake up any moment and find that im easy easy i said id lowered my voice to a whisper it was easier to imitate jablonsky that way but even so it was one of the worst imitations i had ever heard why come to see me because there was no one else i could turn to youre not a killer youre not even a crook i dont care what they say youve done youre not bad she was a sharp one all right her womans insight or intuition or whatever had taken her far beyond what either vyland or the general could see you must help me us you simply must we we are in great trouble we daddy and i a pause i honestly dont know about my father i honestly dont perhaps hes not in trouble maybe hes working with those those evil men because he wants to he comes and goes as he pleases but but its so unlike him maybe he has to work with them oh i dont know i dont know perhaps they have power over him some terrible hold perhaps i caught the glint of fair hair as she shook her head he well he was always so good and honourable and straight and and everything but now easy i interrupted again i couldnt keep this deception up much longer if she hadnt been so scared so worried shed have caught on right away facts miss if you please id left the electric fire burning in my room the communicating door was open and i was pretty sure it was only a matter of time till she could see enough of my features to see that i wasnt jablonsky and that red thatch of mine was a dead giveaway i turned my back to the glow of the fire how can i begin she said we seem to have lost all our freedom or daddy has not in moving around hes not a prisoner but we never make decisions for ourselves or rather daddy makes mine for me and i think he has his made for him too were never allowed to be apart for any time daddy says im to write no letters unless he sees them make no phone calls never go anywhere except when that horrible man gunther is with me even when i go to a friends house like judge mollisons that creature is there all the time daddy says hes had kidnap threats about me recently i dont believe it and if it were true simon kennedy the chauffeur is far better than gunther i never have a private moment to myself when im out on the rig the x im no prisoner i just cant get off but here my room windows are screwed into the wall and gunther spends the night in the anteroom watching to see the last three words took a long long time to come out and trailed off into a shocked silence in her excitement her eagerness to unburden herself of ae those things that had been worrying her for weeks she had come close to me and now her eyes were adjusted to the darkness she started to shake her right hand began to move up slowly towards her mouth the arm trembling all the time and jerking like the arm of a marionette her mouth opened and her eyes widened and kept on widening until i could see white all the way round the pupils and then she drew a long quavering breath prelude to a scream but the prelude was all that there was to it in my business you dont telegraph your signals id one hand over her mouth and an arm round her before shed even made up her mind what key to sing in for several seconds with surprising strength or in the circumstances perhaps not so surprising she struggled furiously then sagged against me limp as a shot rabbit it took me by surprise id thought the day when young ladies had passed out in moments of stress had vanished with the edwardians but perhaps i was underestimating the fearsome reputation i appeared to have built up for myself perhaps i was underestimating the cumulative effect of the shock after a long night of nerving herself to take this last desperate chance after weeks of endless strain whatever the reasons she wasnt faking she was out cold i lifted her across to the bed then for some obscure reason i had a revulsion of feeling i couldnt bear to have her lie on that bed where jablonsky had so recently been murdered so i carried her through to the bed in my own room ive had a fairly extensive practical firstaid education but i didnt know the first thing about bringing young ladies out of swoons i had a vague feeling that to do anything might be dangerous a feeling that accorded well enough with my ignorance of what to do so i came to the conclusion that not only the best thing but the only thing to do was to let her come out of it by herself but i didnt want her to come out of it unknown to me and start bringing the house down so i sat on the edge of the bed and kept the flash on her face the beam just below the eyes so as not to dazzle her she wore a blue quilted silk dressinggown over blue silk pyjamas her highheeled slippers were blue even the nightribbon for holding those thick shining braids in place was of exactly the same colour her face just then was as pale as old ivory nothing would ever make it a beautiful face but then i suppose that if it had been beautiful my heart wouldnt have chosen that moment to start doing handsprings the first time it had shown any life at all far less such extravagant activity in three long and empty years her face seemed to fade and again i could see the fire and the slippers that id seen two nights ago and all that stood between us was million dollars and the fact that i was the only man in the world the very sight of whom could make her collapse in terror i put my dreams away she stirred and opened her eyes i felt that the technique id used with kennedy telling him that there was a gun behind my torch might have unfortunate results in this case so i caught one of the hands that were lying limply on the coverlet bent forward and said softly reprovingly you silly young muggins why did you go and do a daft thing like that luck or instinct or both had put me on the right track her eyes were wide but not staring wide and the fear that still showed there was touched with puzzlement murderers of a certain category dont hold your hand and speak reassuringly poisoners yes knifeplungers in the back possibly but not murderers with my reputation for pure violence youre not going to try to scream again are you i asked no her voice was husky i im sorry i was so stupid right i said briskly if youre feeling fit for it well talk we have to and theres little time cant you put the light on she begged no light shines through curtains we dont want any callers at this time there are shutters she interrupted wooden shutters on every window in the house hawkeye talbot that was me id spent a whole day doing nothing but staring out the window and id never even seen them i rose closed and fastened the shutters closed the communicating door to jablonskys room and switched on the light she was sitting on the side of the bed now hugging her arms as if she were cold im hurt i announced you can take one look at jablonsky and tell right away or so you think that hes not a crook but the longer you look at me the more convinced you are that im a murderer i held up a hand as she was about to speak sure you got reasons excellent reasons but theyre wrong i hitched up a trouser leg and offered for her inspection a foot elegantly covered in a maroon sock and completely plain black shoe ever seen those before she looked at them just for a second then switched her gaze to my face simons she whispered those are simons your chauffeur i didnt care much for this simon business he gave them to me a couple of hours ago of his own free will it took me five minutes flat to convince him that i am not a murderer and far from what i appear to be are you willing to give me the same time she nodded slowly without speaking it didnt even take three minutes the fact that kennedy had given me the ok was the battle more than half won as far as she was concerned but i skipped the bit about finding jablonsky she wasnt ready for any shocks of that nature not yet when i was finished she said almost unbelievingly so you knew about us all the time about daddy and me and our troubles and weve known about you for several months not specifically about your trouble though nor your fathers whatever that may be all we knew was that general blair ruthven was mixed up in something that general blair ruthven had no right to be mixed up in and dont ask me who we are or who i am because i dont like refusing to answer questions and its for your own sake anyway whats your father scared of mary i i dont know i know hes frightened of royale but hes frightened of royale im frightened of royale were all frightened of royale ill take long odds that vyland feeds him plenty of stories about royale to keep him good and scared but its not that not primarily hes frightened for your sake too but my guess is that those fears have only grown since he found out the kind of company hes keeping what theyre really like i mean i think he went into this with his eyes open and for his own ends even if he didnt know what he was letting himself in for just how long have vyland and your father been shall we say business associates she thought a bit and she said i can tell you that exactly it started when we were on holiday with our yacht the temptress in the west indies late last april wed been in kingston jamaica when daddy got word from mummys lawyers that she wanted a legal separation you may have heard about it she went on miserably i dont think there was a paper in north america that missed out on the story and some of them were pretty vicious about it you mean the general had been so long held up as the model citizen of the country and their marriage as the ideal family marriage yes something like that they made a lovely target for all the yellow press she said bitterly i dont know what came over mummy we had all always got on so well together but it just shows that children never know exactly how things were or are between their parents children i was just speaking generally she sounded tired and dispirited and beaten and she looked that way and she was or she would never have talked to a stranger of such things as it happens theres another girl jean my young sister shes ten years younger than i am daddy married late in life jeans with my mother it looks as if shes going to stay with my mother too the lawyers are still working things out therell be no divorce of course she smiled emptily you dont know the new england ruthvens mr talbot but if you did youd know that there are certain words missing from their vocabulary divorce is one of them and your father has never made any attempts at reconciliation he went up to see her twice it was no good she doesnt she doesnt even want to see me shes gone away somewhere and apart from daddy nobody quite knows where when you have money those things arent too difficult to arrange it must have been the mention of the money that sent her thoughts off on a new tack for when she spoke again i could hear those million dollars back in her voice and see the mayflower in her face i dont quite see how all our private family business concerns you mr talbot neither do i i agreed it was as near as i came to an apology maybe i read the yellow press too im only interested in it as far as the vyland tieup is concerned it was at this moment that he stepped in about then a week or two later daddy was pretty low i suppose he was willing to listen to any proposal that would take his mind off his troubles and and and of course his business judgment was below par although it wouldnt have to be more than a fraction below to allow friend vyland to get ms foot stuck in the front door from the cut of his moustache to the way he arranges his display handkerchief vyland is everything a topflight industrialist ought to be hes read all the books about wall street he hasnt missed his saturday night at the cinema for years hes got every last littlest trick off to perfection i dont suppose royale appeared on the scene until later she nodded dumbly she looked to me to be pretty close to tears tears can touch me but not when im pushed for time and i was desperately short of time now i switched off the light went to the window pulled back one of the shutters and stared out the wind was stronger than ever the rain lashed against the glass and sent the water streaming down the pane in little hurrying rivers but more important still the darkness in the east was lightening into grey the dawn was in the sky i turned away closed the shutter switched on the light and looked down at the weary girl think theyll be able to fly the helicopter out to the x today i asked choppers can fly in practically any weather she stirred who says anybodys flying out there today i do i didnt elaborate now perhaps youll tell me the truth of why you came here to see jablonsky tell you the truth you said he had a kind face maybe he has maybe he hasnt but as a reason its rubbish i see im not holding anything back honestly im not its just that im so so worried i overheard something about him that made me think get to the point i said roughly you know the librarys wired i mean theyve got listening devices plugged in ive heard of them i said patiently i dont need a diagram colour touched the pale cheeks im sorry well i was next door in the office where the earphones are and i dont know why i just put them on i grinned the idea of the biter bit appealed vyland and royale were in the library they were talking about jablonsky i wasnt grinning any more they had him tailed this morning when he went into marble springs it seems he went into a hardware store why they dont know i could have filled that part in hed gone to buy a rope have duplicate keys cut and do quite a bit of telephoning it seems he was there half an hour without coming out then the tail went in after him jablonsky came out but his shadower didnt hed disappeared she smiled faintly it seems that jablonsky must have attended to him i didnt smile i said quietly how do they know this the tail hasnt turned up has he they had three tails on jablonsky he didnt catch on to the other two i nodded wearily and then jablonsky went to the post office i saw him going in myself when we daddy and i were on our way to tell the police the story daddy insisted i tell about how youd dumped me and id thumbed a lift home well it seems jablonsky picked up a pad of telegraph forms went into the booth wrote out and sent off a message one of vylands men waited till hed left then got the pad and took off the top message sheet the one under the sheet jablonsky had written on and brought it back here from what i could hear vyland seemed to be working on this with some powder and lamps so even jablonsky could slip up but in his place i would have done the same exactly the same i would have assumed that if id disposed of a shadower that would be the lot vyland was clever maybe he was going to be too clever for me i said to the girl hear anything more a little not much i gather they made out most of what was written on the form but they couldnt understand it i think it must have been in code she broke off wet her lips then went on gravely but the address was in plain language of course of course i crossed the room and stared down at her i knew the answer to my next question but i had to ask her and the address a mr j c curtin federal bureau of investigation that that was really why i came i knew i had to warn mr jablonsky i didnt hear any more somebody came along the passage and i slipped out a side door but i think hes in danger i think hes in great danger mr talbot for the past fifteen minutes id been looking for a way to break the news to her but now i gave up youre too late i hadnt meant my voice to sound harsh and cold but thats the way it sounded jablonskys dead murdered they came for me at eight oclock next morning royale and valentino i was fully dressed except for my coat and i was fastened to the bedhead by a single set of handcuffs id thrown the key away together with jablonskys three duplicate keys after id locked all the doors there was no reason why they should search me and i hoped as i never hoped before that they wouldnt after mary had left tearstained forlorn and having unwillingly promised me that no word of what had passed should be repeated to anyone not even her father id sat down and thought all my thinking so far had been in a neverending circle and id got so deep in the rut that i could hardly see daylight any more and just when my mental processes had been about to vanish completely into the darkness id had the first illuminating flash in the dark gloom of my thinking a blindingly bright sash of intuition or common sense that id had since id come to that house id thought about it for another halfhour then id got a sheet of thin paper and written a long message on one side folded it twice until it was only a couple of inches wide sealed it with tape and addressed it to judge mollison at his home address then id folded it in half lengthwise slid it over the neckband of my tie and turned my collar down over it until it was completely hidden when they came for me id had less than an hour in bed and i hadnt slept at all but i pretended to be sound asleep when they came in somebody shook me roughly by the shoulder i ignored it he shook me again i stirred he gave up the shaking as unprofitable and used the back of his hand across my face not lightly enough was enough i groaned blinked my eyes painfully and propped myself up in bed rubbing my forehead with my free hand on your feet talbot apart from the upper lefthand side of his face a miniature sunset viewed through an indigo haze royale looked calm and smooth as ever and fully rested another dead man on his conscience wasnt going to rob him of much sleep valentinos arm i was glad to see was still in a sling that was going to make my task of turning him into an exbodyguard all the easier on your feet royale repeated how come only one handcuff eh i shook my head from side to side and made a great play of being dazed and halfdoped what in hells name did i have for dinner last night dinner royale smiled his pale quiet smile you and your gaoler emptied that bottle between you thats what you had for dinner i nodded slowly he was on safe ground as far as he knew his ground if id been doped id have only the haziest recollection of what had happened immediately before id passed out i scowled at him and nodded at the handcuffs unlock this damn thing will you why only one cuff royale repeated gently what does it matter if its one cuff or twenty i said irritably i cant remember i seem to think jablonsky shoved me in here in a great hurry and could only find one i think perhaps he didnt feel too good either i buried my face in my hands and drew them down hard as if to clear my head and eyes between my fingers i glimpsed royales slow nod of understanding and i knew i had it made it was exactly what jablonsky would have done hed have felt something coming over him and rushed in to secure me before he collapsed the cuff was unlocked and on the way through jablonskys room i glanced casually at the table the whisky bottle was still there empty royale or vyland didnt miss much we went out into the passage with royale leading and valentino bringing up the rear i shortened my step abruptly and valentino dug his gun into the small of my back nothing valentino would do would ever be gently but for him it was a comparatively gentle prod and my sharp exclamation of pain might have been justified if it had been about ten times as hard i stopped in my tracks valentino bumped into me and royale swung round hed done his conjuring act again and his deadly little toy gun was sitting snugly in the palm of his hand what gives he asked coldly no inflection not the slightest raising of the pitch of voice i hoped i lived to see the day when royale was good and worried this gives i said tightly keep your trained ape out of my hair royale or ill take him apart gun or no guns lay off him gunther royale said quietly jeez boss i didnt hardly touch him discounting the anthropoid brow broken nose pockmarks and scars there wasnt much room left on valentinos face for the shift and play of expression but what little area remained appeared to indicate astonishment and a sharp sense of injustice i just gave him a little tap sure i know royale had already turned and was on his way just lay off him royale reached the head of the stairs first and was half a dozen steps down by the time i got there again i slowed abruptly again valentino bumped into me i swung round chopped the side of my hand against his gunwrist and knocked the automatic to the ground valentino dived to pick it up with his left hand then roared in anguish as the heel of my right shoe stamped down and crushed his fingers between leather and metal i didnt hear any bones break but nothing so drastic was necessary with both his hands out of commission mary ruthven was going to need a new bodyguard i made no attempt to stoop and pick up the gun i made no attempt to move i could hear royale coming slowly up the stairs move well back from that gun he ordered both of you we moved royale picked up the gun stood to one side and waved me down the stairs in front of him i couldnt tell what he was thinking for all the expression on his face he might just as well have been watching a leaf falling he said nothing more he didnt even bother to glance at valentinos hand they were waiting for us in the library the general vyland and larry the junky the generals expression as usual was hidden behind moustache and beard but there was a tinge of blood to his eyes and he seemed greyer than thirtysix hours ago maybe it was just my imagination everything looked bad to me that morning vyland was urbane and polished and smiling and tough as ever freshly shaven eyes clear dressed in a beautifully cut charcoalgrey suit white soft shirt and red tie he was a dream larry was just larry whitefaced with the junkys staring eyes pacing up and down behind the desk but he didnt look quite so jerky as usual he too was smiling so i concluded that hed had a good breakfast chiefly of heroin morning talbot it was vyland speaking the bigtime crooks today find it just as easy to be civil to you as to snarl and beat you over the head and it pays off better what was the noise royale gunther royale nodded indifferently at valentino who had just come in left hand tucked tightly under his disabled right arm and moaning with pain he rode talbot too hard and talbot didnt like it go off and make a noise somewhere else vyland said coldly the good samaritan touch feeling tough and tetchy this morning hey talbot there was no longer even an attempt at keeping up the pretence that the general was the boss or even had an equal say in what went on in his own house he just stood quietly in the background remote and dignified and in some way tragic but maybe the tragedy was only in my own mind i could be guessing wrongly about the general i could be terribly wrong about him fatally wrong wheres jablonsky i demanded jablonsky vyland raised a lazy eyebrow george raft couldnt have done it any better whats jablonsky to you talbot my gaoler i said briefly where is he you appear very anxious to know talbot he looked at me long and consideringly and i didnt like it at all ive seen you before talbot so has the general i wish i could remember who it is you remind me of donald duck this was perilous ground indeed where is he hes left lammed out with his seventy thousand bucks lammed out was a slip but i let it pass where is he you are becoming boringly repetitious my friend he snapped his fingers larry the cables larry picked up some papers from the desk handed them to vyland grinned at me wolfishly and resumed his pacing the general and i are very careful people talbot vyland went on some people might say highly suspicious same thing we checked up on you we checked in england holland and venezuela he waved the papers these came in this morning they say youre all you claim to be one of europes top salvage experts so now we can go ahead and use you so now we dont need jablonsky any more so we let him go this morning with his cheque he said he fancied a trip to europe vyland was quiet convincing utterly sincere and could have talked his way past st peter i looked as i thought st peter might have looked as he was in the process of being convinced then i said a lot of things st peter would never have said and finished up by snarling the dirty lying doublecrosser jablonsky again the george raft touch with the eyebrows yes jablonsky to think that i listened to that lying twotimer to think i even spent five seconds listening to him he promised me well what did he promise you vyland asked softly no harm now i scowled he reckoned i was for the high jump here and he reckoned that the charges that had had him dismissed from the new york police had been rigged he thinks or said he thought he could prove it if he was given the chance to investigate certain policemen and certain police files i swore again and to think that i believed youre wandering talbot vyland interrupted sharply he was watching me very closely indeed get on he thought he could buy this chance and at the same time have me help him while he helped me he spent a couple of hours in our room trying to remember an old federal code and then he wrote a telegram to some agency offering to supply some very interesting information about generai ruthven in exchange for a chance to examine certain files and i was mug enough to think he meant it you dont by any chance happen to remember the name of the man to whom this telegram was addressed no i forget you better remember talbot you may be buying yourself something very important to you your life i looked at him without expression then stared at the floor finally i said without looking up catin cartin curtin yes that was it curtin j c curtin and all he offered was to give information if his own conditions were met is that it thats it talbot youve just bought yourself your life sure id bought myself my life i noticed vyland didnt specify how long i would be allowed to hang on to my purchase twentyfour hours if that it all depended how the job went but i didnt care the satisfaction it had given me to stamp on valentinos hand upstairs was nothing compared to the glow i felt now theyd fallen for my story theyd fallen for it hook line and sinker in the circumstances with the cards dealt the right way it had been inevitable that they should and id dealt my cards just right judged from the standpoint of their limited awareness of the extent of my knowledge it would have been impossible for me to have concocted such a story they didnt and couldnt know that i knew jablonsky to be dead that they had him tailed yesterday and deciphered the telegrams address for they didnt know that i had been in the kitchen garden during the previous night that mary had overheard their conversation in the library and that she had been to see me had they thought i had been an accomplice of jablonskys throughout theyd have shot me out of hand as it was they wouldnt shoot me for some time yet not a long time but perhaps long enough i saw vyland and royale exchange glances a mere flicker and the faint shrug of vylands shoulders they were tough all right those two tough and cool and ruthless and calculating and dangerous for the past twelve hours they must have lived with the knowledge or the possibility that federal agents would be around their necks any moment but they had shown no awareness of pressure no signs of strain i wondered what they would have thought how they would have reacted had they known that federal agents could have been on to them all of three months ago but the time had not then been ripe nor was it yet well gentlemen is there any need for further delay it was the first time the general had spoken and for all his calmness there was a harsh burred edge of strain beneath lets get it over with the weather is deteriorating rapidly and theres a hurricane warning out we should leave as soon as possible he was right about the weather except in the tense he used it had deteriorated period the wind was no longer a moan it was a high sustained keening howl through the swaying oaks accompanied by intermittent squally showers of brief duration but extraordinary intensity there was much low cloud in the sky steadily thickening id glanced at the barometer in the hall and it was creeping down towards which promised something very unpleasant indeed whether the centre of the storm was going to bit or pass by us i didnt know but if we stood in its path wed have it in less than twelve hours probably much less were just leaving general everythings set petersen is waiting for us down in the bay petersen i guessed would be the helicopter pilot a couple of fast trips and we should all be out there in an hour or so then talbot here can get to work all asked the general who yourself myself royale talbot larry and of course your daughter mary is it necessary vyland said nothing he didnt even use the eyebrow routine again he just looked steadily at the general five seconds perhaps more then the generals hands unclenched and his shoulders drooped a fraction of an inch picture without words there came the quick light tap of feminine footsteps from the passage inside and mary ruthven walked in through the open door she was dressed in a limecoloured twopiece costume with an opennecked green blouse beneath she had shadows under her eyes she looked pale and tired and i thought she was wonderful kennedy was behind her but he remained respectfully in the passage hat in hand a rhapsody in maroon and shining high leather boots his face set in the remote unseeing unhearing expression of the perfectly trained family chauffeur i started to move aimlessly towards the door waiting for mary to do what id told her less than two hours previously just before shed gone back to her own room im going in to marble springs with kennedy father mary began without preamble it was phrased as a statement of fact but was in effect a request for permission but well were going to the rig my dear her father said unhappily you said last night im coming she said with a touch of impatience but we cant all go at once ill come on the second trip we wont be more than twenty minutes do you mind mr vylaad she asked sweetly im afraid its rather difficult miss ruthven vyland said urbanely you see gunther has hurt himself good he worked his eyebrow again not so good for you miss ruthven you know how your father likes you to have protection when kennedy used to be all the protection i ever needed she said coldly he still is what is more im not going out to the rig with you and royale and that that creature there she left no doubt but that she meant larry unless kennedy comes with me and thats final and i must go into marble springs now i wondered when anyone had last talked to vyland like that but the veneer never even cracked why must you miss ruthven there are some questions a gentleman never asks she said icily that floored him he didnt know what she meant the same as i wouldnt have known what she meant and the net result was to leave him stranded every eye in the room was on the two of them except mine mine were on kennedys and his were on mine i was near the door now with my back turned to the company it had been easy to slip out the piece of paper from under my collar and now i held it against my chest so that he could see judge mollisons name on it his expression didnt alter and it would have taken a micrometer to measure his nod but he was with me everything was fine but for the chance that royale might get me with a snapshot before i cleared the doorway and it was royale who broke the tension in the room giving vyland an easy out id like some fresh air mr vyland i could go along with them for the ride i went out through that doorway the way a torpedo leaves its tube kennedy had his arm outstretched and i caught it we crashed heavily to the floor and went rolling along the passageway together inside the first two seconds i had the letter stuck deep inside his tunic and we were still threshing about and belabouring each other on the shoulders and back and everywhere it didnt hurt very much when we heard the unmistakable flat click of a safety catch break it up you two we broke it up and i got to my feet under the steady menace of royales gun larry too was hopping around in the background waving a revolver in his hand had i been vyland i wouldnt even have let him have a catapult in his hand that was a good job of work kennedy vyland was saying warmly i wont forget it thank you sir kennedy said woodenly i dont like killers neither do i my boy neither do i vyland said approvingly he only employed them himself because he wanted to rehabilitate them very well miss ruthven mr royale will go along but be as quick as you can she swept by without a word to him or a glance at me her head was high i still thought she was wonderful chapter viii i hadnt enjoyed the helicopter trip out to the oilrig planes im used to ive flown my own i once even owned a piece in a small charter airline but helicopters are not for me not even in fine weather and the weather that morning was indescribable we swayed and rocked and plummeted and soared up again as if some drunk had us on the end of a giant yoyo and ninetenths of the time we couldnt see where we were going because the wipers couldnt cope with the deluge of water that lashed against the windscreen but petersen was a fine pilot and we made it we touched down on the landingdeck of the x shortly after ten oclock in the morning it took six men to hold the machine even reasonably steady while the general vyland larry and i shinned down the extension ladder petersen gunned his motor and took off just as the last of us reached the deck and was lost in a blinding flurry of rain inside ten seconds i wondered if i would ever see him again out there on the exposed deck the wind was far stronger and much gustier than it had been on land and it was all that we could do to keep our balance on the slippery metal underfoot not that there was much chance of me falling at least not backwards not with larrys cannon jabbing into the small of my back all the time he was wearing the bigcollared biglapelled belted epauletted and leatherbuttoned coat that hollywood had taught him was the correct rig of the day for this kind of weather and he had the gun inside one of the deep pockets i felt nervous larry didnt like me and would have counted a hole in his fine coat as a small price to pay for the privilege of pulling that trigger id got right under larrys skin like a burr under a saddle and i meant to stay there i rarely spoke to him but when i did i never failed to refer to him as hophead or junky and to hope that his supplies of snow were coming along all right on the way down to the helicopter that morning id inquired solicitously whether or not hed remembered to pack his grip and when hed asked suspiciously what the unprintable i meant by that i explained that i was concerned that he might have forgotten to pack his syringe it took vyland and the general all the strength of their combined efforts to pull him off me there is nothing more dangerous and unpredictable than a drug addict just as there is nothing more pitiable but there was no pity in my heart then larry was the weakest link in the chain and i meant to keep sawing away at him until something snapped we staggered along against the wind till we came to a raised hatchcover entrance which gave to a wide companionway leading to the deck below a group of men awaited us here and i had my collar turned up hatbrim turned down and a handkerchief in my hand busy wiping the rain off my face but i neednt have bothered joe curran the roustabout foreman id talked to ten hours previously was not there i tried to imagine what would have happened had he been there or had he asked the general whether c c farnborough his private confidential secretary had found the missing briefcase but i gave it up the strain on the imagination was too great id probably just have borrowed larrys gun and shot myself two men came forward to meet us general ruthven did the honours martin jerrold our field foreman tom harrison our petroleum engineer gentlemen this is john smith a specialist engineer flown out from england to help mr vyland in his research john smith i gathered was the inspired choice of name for myself both men made perfunctory noises of greeting larry prodded me in the back so i said i was delighted too but they obviously had no interest at all in me both men looked worried and uneasy and both men were doing their best to conceal the fact but the general didnt miss it something bothering you harrison out here on the rig it was obviously the policy for vyland to keep very much in the background very much so sir harrison a crewcut youngster with heavy hornrimmed spectacles looked to me as if he should still be in college but he must have been good to hold down the responsible job he did he produced a small chart spread it out and pointed with a carpenters pencil this charts good general ruthven it couldnt be better and pride and honeywell are the best geological team in the business but were already twelve hundred feet overdue we should have hit oil at least five hundred feet back but theres not even a smell of gas yet i cant even begin to explain it sir i could have explained it but it was hardly the time those things happen my boy the general said easily i had to admire the old coot i was beginning to have more than a fair idea of the almost inhuman strain he was labouring under but the control the selfpossession were admirable were lucky if we make it two out of five and no geologist would claim to be per cent accurate or even within shouting distance of it give it another thousand the responsibilitys mine thank you sir harrison looked relieved but there was still a certain uneasiness about him and the general was quick to get on to it still something worrying you harrison no sir of course not he was too quick too emphatic he wasnt half the actor the old boy was nothing at all hmm the general considered him thoughtfully then looked at jerrold something on your mind too the weather sir of course the general nodded understandingly latest reports are that hurricane diane is going to hit marble springs fair and square and that means the x you dont have to ask me jerrold you know that youre the captain of this ship im only a passenger i dont like losing ten thousand dollars a day but you must suspend drilling the moment you think its right to its not that sir jerrold said unhappily he jerked a thumb over his shoulder that experimental leg youre working on sir shouldnt it be lowered to give maximum stability so the drilling crew did know there was something going on in that pillar id investigated the previous night when i came to think of it although it wasnt inevitable that they should know it was advisable so much easier to give the crew a specious explanation for the activities taking place there than to cordon off a section and raise suspicion and unwanted and possibly dangerous speculation i wondered what sort of yarn had been spun to them i was to find that out right away vyland the general had turned to the man by his side and raised a questioning eyebrow ill accept full responsibility general ruthven he spoke in the quiet precise confident tones that a topflight engineer might have employed although it would have surprised me if he knew a nut from a bolt but he could use reason too for he added this storm is going to hit from the west and the maximum strain is going to be on the other the landward side the effect on this side will merely be to lift it he made a deprecating gesture it does seem rather pointless doesnt it to lower an additional leg just when the other legs on that same side will have far less strain than normal to carry besides general we are now so near the perfection of this technique which is going to revolutionise underwater drilling that it would be a crime to set it back maybe several months by lowering the leg and perhaps destroying all our delicate equipment so that was the line it was well done i had to admit the dedicated enthusiasm in his voice was so exactly right without being in any way overdone thats good enough for me jerrold said he turned back to the general coming across to your quarters sir later to eat but dont wait lunch for us order it for my stateroom will you mr smith here is keen to get to work right away like hell i was we left them and made our way down a broad passage deep inside the platform here the sound of the wind and the rising waves crashing and breaking against the pillars was completely inaudible perhaps some faint murmur of sound might have been heard if the air in that brightlylit steel passage hadnt been filled with the hum of powerful generators we appeared to be passing by some diesel engine room at the far end of the passage we turned left and walked almost to its far culdesac limits before stopping outside a door on the righthand side on this door printed in large white letters was the legend drilling research project followed in letters scarcely less large by the words private most secret positively no admittance vyland rapped on the door in a long code knock i made a mental note of it four shorts two long four shorts waited till there carne three long knocks from the inside then knocked again four times in rapid succession ten seconds later we had all passed through the door and it was double locked and bolted behind us it made all the signs about private and no admittance seem rather superfluous steel floor steel bulkheads steel ceiling it was a black cheerless box of a room at least three sides of it formed a box the bulkhead wed just passed through the blank bulkhead on the left and the one to the right with a high grilled door in its centre the fourth side was convex bulging out into the room in an almost perfect semicircle with a butterflyclamped hatchway in its middle the trunking i felt certain of the big steel pillar reaching down to the floor of the sea on either side of the hatchway hung large drums with neatly coiled rubber tubes armoured in flexible steel below each dram and bolted to the floor was a large motor the one on the right was i knew an air compressor thats what id heard when id been out there during the night and the one on the left probably a forcedsuction water pump as for the furnishings of the room even the spartans would have found it rugged a deal table two benches and a metal wallrack there were two men in the room the one who had opened the door and another sitting at the table dead cigar in his mouth and a pack of greasy cards spread out on the table in front of him and both cast in the same mould it wasnt the fact that they were both shirtsleeved and had leather holsters strapped across their chests and high up on their left sides that gave them the close similarity not even their evenlymatched height and weight and broad bulky shoulders the sameness lay in their faces hard expressionless faces with cold still watchful eyes id seen men out of the same mould before the topnotch professionals of the strongarm underworld all that larry would have given his life to be and could never hope to be they were so exactly the type of men i would have expected vyland to employ that the presence of larry was all the more mysterious indeed vyland grunted a greeting and that was all the time he wasted in the next ten minutes he walked across to the wallrack reached down a long roll of canvasbacked paper that was wrapped round a wooden stick unrolled it flat on the table and weighted the ends to keep them from curling up again it was a large and highly complicated diagram sixty inches long by about thirty in depth he stood back and looked at me ever seen that before talbot i bent over the table the diagram represented a peculiar object shaped halfway between a cylinder and a cigar about four times as long as its average width it was flat on top flat along the middle third of the bottom then tapering slightly upwards towards either end at least eighty per cent of it appeared to be given up to some kind of storage tanks i could see the fuel lines leading to the tanks from a raised bridgelike structure superimposed on the top side this same bridge housed the beginnings of a vertical cylindrical chamber which ran clear through the body of the machine passed out through the bottom angled sharply left and entered an ovalshaped chamber suspended beneath the body of the cigar on either side of this oval chamber and attached to he underside of the cigar were large rectangular containers to the left towards the narrower and more tapering end were what appeared to be searchlights and long slender remotecontrol grabs housed in spring clips along the side i took a good long look at all of this then straightened sorry i shook my head never seen it in my life i neednt have bothered straightening for next moment i was lying on the deck maybe five seconds later i had pushed myself to my knees and was shaking my head from side to side in an attempt to clear it i looked up groaned with the pain just behind my ear and tried to focus my eyes i focused one of them at any rate for i made out vyland standing above me his pistol held by the barrel i kind of thought you might say that talbot a nice quiet controlled voice we were sitting at the vicars afternoon teatable and he was asking me to pass along the muffins your memory talbot perhaps you would like to jog it again a little eh is all this really necessary general ruthven sounded distressed he looked distressed surely vyland we shut up vyland snapped we were no longer calling on the vicar he turned to me as i climbed to my feet well whats the good of beating me over the head i said savagely how will that make me remember something i never this time i saw it coming got the palm of my hand up to the side of my head and was riding the blow going fast away from it when it connected i staggered and hit the bulkhead it was nearly all show and to complete the effect i slid down to the deck nobody said anything vyland and his two hoodlums were looking at me with a detached interest the general was white and he had his lower lip caught in his teeth larrys face was a mask of unholy glee remember anything now i called him an unprintable name and rose shakily to my feet very well vyland shrugged i think larry here would like to persuade you can i can i really the eagerness on larrys face was revolting frightening want that i make him talk vyland smiled and nodded remember hes got to work for us when youre finished ill remember this was larrys big moment to be in the centre of the stage to get his own back for my sneers and gibes above all to indulge a sadistic streak wide as a bam door this was going to be one of the high spots of his existence he advanced towards me big gun wavering slightly wetting his lips continuously and giggling in a high and horrible falsetto the inside of the right thigh high up hell scream like like a pig going under the knife then the left and hell still be able to work the eyes were wide and staring and mad and for the first time in my life i was confronted by a human being drooling at the mouth vyland was a good psychologist he knew i would be ten times more scared of larrys viciousness his neurotic instability than of any coldly calculated brutality he or his two thugs would have brought to bear i was scared all right besides id put up a good enough front it would have been expected of me but there was no point in overdoing it its a development of the early french bathyscaphes i said rapidly this model is a combined british and french naval project designed to reach only about twenty per cent of the depths of its predecessors its good for about feet but its faster more manoeuvrable and its equipped for actual underwater salvage which its predecessors werent nobody ever hated anyone more than larry hated me at that moment he was a little boy i was a promised toy the most wonderful he had ever seen and he was being robbed of it just as it came within his grasp he could have wept with rage and frustration and the sheer bitterness of his disappointment he was still prancing in front of me and waving the gun around hes lying his voice was shrill almost a scream hes just trying hes not lying vyland interrupted coldly no triumph no satisfaction in his voice the end had been achieved and the past was done with put that gun away but i tell you larry broke off in an exclamation of pain as one of the two big silent men caught his wrist and forced the gun down till it was pointing at the floor put that heater away punk the man growled or take it off you vyland glanced at them then ignored the byplay and you not only know what this is talbot but youve actually worked on it the general has impeccable sources in europe and we got the word this morning he bent forward and went on softly and you also worked on it later on recently our sources in cuba are even better than those in europe i didnt work on it recently i held up my hand as vyland tightened his mouth when this bathyscaphe was brought out in a freighter to do its preliminary unmanned dives in the sheltered waters off nassau the british and french thought it would be cheaper and more sensible to hire a local vessel suitable for the job instead of bringing one out from europe i was working with a salvage firm in havana at the time and they had a ship with a heavy crane and boom right aft it was ideal for the job i was aboard it but i didnt work on the bathyscaphe itself what would be the point in denying it if it wasnt so i smiled faintly besides i was only aboard the salvage ship for a week or so they got wind that i was there i knew they were after me and i had to leave in a hurry they vylands eyebrow was still working as smoothly as ever what does it matter now even to myself i sounded tired defeated true true vyland smiled from what we know of your record it might have been any one of the police forces of half a dozen countries anyway general it explains one thing that has been worrying us where we saw talbots face before general ruthven said nothing if ever id needed conviction that he was a tool a pawn of vylands i needed it no longer he was miserable unhappy and clearly wished to have no part whatever in what was going on i said as if a great light had suddenly dawned upon me have you were you the people responsible for the loss of this bathyscaphe my god it was you how in the you didnt think we brought you here just to discuss the diagrammatic layout of this vessel vyland permitted himself a small pleased smile of course it was us it was easy the fools moored it on a wire hawser in ten fathoms of water we unhitched it substituted a frayed hawser so that they would think that it had broken its moorings and that the tide had carried it out to deep water then we towed it away we made most of the trip in darkness and the few ships we saw we just slowed down pulled the bathyscaphe up on the side remote from the approaching vessel and towed it like that he smiled again he was spoiling himself this morning it wasnt difficult people do not expect to see a bathyscaphe being towed by a private yacht a private yacht you mean the i could feel the hairs on the back of my neck prickling id almost made the blunder that would have finished everything it had been on the tip of my tongue to say the temptress but no one knew id ever heard that name except mary ruthven whod told me you mean the generals private yacht he has one larry and i certainly havent one he grinned larry and i an offbeat phrase but there was nothing in it for me so i let it pass of course its the generals yacht i nodded and equally of course you have the bathyscaphe somewhere near here would you mind telling me what in the world you want a bathyscaphe for certainly not youll have to know anyhow we are ah treasurehunting talbot dont tell me you believe this captain kidd and blackbeard nonsense i sneered recovering your courage eh talbot no its rather more recent than that and very close to here how did you find it how did we find it vyland seemed to have forgotten his urgency like every criminal who ever lived he had a streak of the ham in him and wouldnt pass up the chance of basking in the glow of his own glory we had a vague idea where it was we tried trawling for it in the days before i met the general that was but had no success then we met the general as you may not know the general provides his yacht for his geologists when they plod around setting off their little bombs on the bottom of the ocean tuning in with their seismographic instruments to find out where the oil strata are and while they were doing this we were plotting the ocean bed with an extremely sensitive depth recorder we found it all right near here very near then why havent you recovered it talbot giving his impression of a salvage specialist so engrossed in a problem that he has forgotten his own circumstances how would you recover it talbot diving for it of course should be easy in those waters after all theres a huge continental shelf here you have to go a hundred miles out from any point off the west coast of florida before you even reach five hundred feet were close inshore here hundred feet hundred fifty the x is standing in how much general onethirty feet low tide ruthven said mechanically i shrugged there you are then there we are not vyland shook his head whats the greatest depth at which you can expect divers to perform really useful work talbot perhaps three hundred feet i thought a moment the deepest i know was by us divers off honolulu two hundred and seventyfive feet us submarine f you really are a specialist arent you talbot every diver and salvage man worth his salt knows that two hundred and seventyfive feet eh unfortunately what were after is in the bottom of a big hole a deep chasm in the sea bed the generals geologists were very interested indeed when we located this hole said it was just like what was it general the kurd deep thats it the hurd deep in the english channel deep valley in the seabed where the limeys dump all their old explosives this one here is four hundred and eighty feet in depth that makes a difference i said slowly doesnt it now and how would you get at that all depends how difficult it is to reach the newest neufeldtkuhnke rigid divingsuit armourplated in cast steel could just about make it i doubt if any diver could accomplish anything at that depth hed be under a pressure of two hundred pounds to the square inch and any movement would be like in a barrel of heavy tar anything except the simplest maneuver would be beyond him the way to do it would be with observation turrets gaieazzi and my old firm siebegorman produce the best and use those they can go down about one thousand five hundred feet you get inside one of those and use a phone to guide laying of explosives or dredgers or grapnels or power grabs thats the way they took over ten million dollars worth of gold from the niagara from about the same depth off new zealand and about four million dollars worth of gold from the egypt lying in four hundred feet off ushant those are the two classic cases of modern times and thats how i would do it and of course that would require at least a couple of surface vessels and much specialised equipment vyland said softly do you think we can go around buying up observation turrets if there are any available in this country and dredgers and then sit anchored in the same spot for weeks without exciting suspicion you have a point i admitted so the bathyscaphe vyland smiled the valley in the sea floor is less than six hundred yards from here we take with us grabs and hooks attached to wires on drams fastened to the outside of the scaphe fix them on you can do some very fancy work with those extension arms and grabs fitted in front then come back here unreeling the wire as we go then we haul the wire in from the x as easy as that eh just as easy as that talbot clever you would say very i didnt think it clever at all i didnt think vyland had even begun to appreciate the difficulties involved the endless slowmotion try try try again frustration of underwater salvage the scope of the initial preparation the skill and experience of years required i tried to remember how long it had taken to salvage two and a half million dollars worth of gold and silver from the laurentic sunk in only just over a hundred feet of water something like six years if i remembered rightly and vyland spoke as if he was going to do it in an afternoon and where exactly is the scaphe i asked vyland pointed at the semicircular trunking thats one of the support legs of this rig but it happens to be raised twenty feet above the sea bed the bathyscaphe is moored below that moored below it i stared at him what do you mean its beneath the bottom of that leg how did you get it there how do you get into it how in the world simple he interrupted i am not as you may have gathered much of an engineer but i do have an ah professional friend who is he devised the simple expedient of fitting a reinforced and completely waterproof steel floor of great strength across the bottom of this leg about six feet from the bottom actually and letting into this a tapering steel cylinder about six feet long and not quite three feet in diameter projecting downwards open top and bottom but the top capable of being sealed off flush with the waterproof floor by a screwed hatch in a recession about two feet from the top of this cylinder is a reinforced rubber tube you begin to see daylight i think talbot i see daylight they were an ingenious bunch if nothing else somehow almost certainly at night you got the rigs engineers to cooperate with you in the lowering of this leg i suppose you told them the yarn about top secret research so secret that no one was allowed to see what was going on you had the bathyscaphe on the surface unbolted its bridge cover lowered the leg slowly until this cylinder fitted over the bathyscaphes entrance hatch pumped this rubber ring full of compressed air to make a perfect seal then lowered the leg into the water pushing the bathyscaphe down before it while someone inside the bathyscaphe probably your engineering friend adjusted the hydrostatic valve for one of the adjacent flooding chambers enough to let it sink easily but not so much as to rob it of its slight positive buoyancy necessary to keep the top of the entrance chamber jammed into the cylinder at the foot of the leg and when you want to take off you just climb into the bathyscaphe seal both the cylinder and bathyscaphe hatches have someone on the rig blow the air from the rubber seal gripping the entrance chamber of the bathyscaphe flood your tanks to get enough negative buoyancy to drop clear of the leg and there you are reverse process when you come back except that youll need a suction pump to clear the water thats accumulated in the cylinder right in every detail vyland permitted himself one of his rare smiles brilliant you might call it no the only brilliant thing was stealing the bathyscaphe the rest is within the scope of any moderately competent underwater operator just an application of the doublechambered submarine rescue diving bell which can fit in much the same way over the escape hatch of practically any submarine and a fairly similar principle has been used for caisson work sinking underwater piers for bridges and the like but smart enough for all that your engineer friend was no fool a pity about him wasnt it a pity vyland was no longer smiling yes hes dead isnt he the room became very still after perhaps ten seconds vyland said very quietly what did you say i said he was dead when anyone in your employ dies suddenly vyland i would say it was because he had outlived his usefulness but with your treasure unrecovered he obviously hadnt there was an accident another long pause what makes you think there was an accident and he was an elderly man wasnt he vyland what makes you think there was an accident a soft menace in every word larry was licking his lips again the waterproof floor you had put in in the bottom of the pillar was not quite as waterproof as you had thought it leaked didnt it vyland only a very small hole possibly and in the perimeter of the floor where it joined the side of the leg bad welding but you were lucky somewhere above where were standing there must be another transverse seal in the leg to give structural strength no doubt so you used this machine here i pointed to one of the generators bolted to the deck to drive in compressed air after youd sent someone inside the leg and sealed this door off when youd driven in enough compressed air the accumulated water was driven out the bottom and then the man or men inside were able to repair the hole right vyland right he was on balance again and there was no harm in admitting something to a person who would never live to repeat it to anyone how do you know all this talbot that footman up in the generals house ive seen many cases hes suffering from what used to be called caisson disease and hell never recover from it the divers bends vyland when people are working under a high ak or sea pressure and that pressure is released too quickly they get nitrogen bubbles in the blood those men in the leg were working in about four atmospheres about sixty pounds to the square inch if theyd been down there more than half an hour they should have spent at least half an hour decompressing but as it was some criminal idiot released the builtup pressure far too fast as fast as it could escape probably at the best of times caisson work or its equivalent is only for fit young men your engineer friend was no longer a fit young man and you had of course no decompressor so he died the footman may live song enough but hell never again know what a painfree existence is but i dont suppose that troubles you does it vyland were wasting time i could see the relief on vylands face for a moment there hed suspected that i and possibly others as well knew too much about the happenings on the x but he was satisfied now and very relieved but i wasnt interested in his expression only in the generals general ruthven was regarding me in a very peculiar fashion indeed there was puzzlement in his face some thought that was troubling him but worse than that there was the beginnings of the first faint incredulous stirrings of understanding i didnt like that i didnt like it at all swiftly i reviewed everything id said everything id implied and in those matters i have an almost total recall but i couldnt think of a single word that might have been responsible for that expression on his face and if hed noticed something then perhaps vyland had also but vylands face showed no sign of any knowledge or suspicion of anything untoward and it didnt necessarily follow that any offbeat word or circumstance noted by the general would also be noted by vyland the general was a very clever man indeed fools dont start from scratch and accumulate close on three hundred million dollars in a single lifetime but i wasnt going to give vyland time to look at and read the expression on the generals face he might fee smart enough for that i said so your engineer is dead and now you need a driver shall we say for your bathyscaphe wrong we know how to operate it ourselves you dont think wed be so everlastingly stupid as to steal a bathyscaphe without at the same time knowing what to do with it from an office in nassau we had obtained a complete set of maintenance and operation instructions in both french and english dont worry we know how to operate it indeed this is most interesting i sat down on a bench without as much as a byyourleave and lit a cigarette some such gesture would be expected from me then what precisely do you want with me for the first time in our brief acquaintance vyland looked embarrassed after a few seconds he scowled and said harshly we cant get the damned engines to start i took a deep draw on my cigarette and tried to blow a smokering it didnt come off with me it never came off well well well i murmured how most inconvenient for you that is for me it couldnt be more convenient all youve got to do is to start those two little engines and hey presto you pick up a fortune for the asking i assume that you arent playing for peanuts not operating on this scale and you cant start them up without me as i said how convenient for me you know how to make that machine run he asked coldly i might should be simple enough theyre just batterypowered electric motors i smiled but the electric circuits and switches and fuse boxes are pretty complicated surely theyre listed in the maintenance instructions they are the smooth polished veneer was showing a distinct crack and his voice was almost a snarl theyre coded for a key we havent got a key wonderful just wonderful i rose leisurely to my feet and stood in front of vyland without me youre lost is that it he made no answer then i have my price vyland a guarantee of my life this angle didnt worry me at all but i knew i had to make the play or hed have been as suspicious as hell what guarantee do you offer vyland good god man you dont need any guarantee the general was indignant astonished why would anyone want to kill you look general i said patiently you may be a big big tiger when youre prowling along the jungles of wall street but as far as the other side of the legal divide is concerned youre not even in the kitten class anyone not in your friend vylands employ who knows too much will always come to the same sticky end when he can no longer be of any use to him of course vyland likes his moneys worth even when it costs him nothing youre suggesting by inference that i might also come to the same end ruthven inquired not you general youre safe i dont know what the stinking tieup between you and vyland is and i dont care he may have a hold on you or you may be up to the ears in cahoots with him but either way it makes no difference youre safe the disappearance of the richest man in the country would touch off the biggest manhunt of the decade sorry to appear cynical general but there it is an awful lot of money buys an awful lot of police activity there would be an awful lot of pressure general and snowbirds like our hoppedup young friend here i jerked a finger over my shoulder in the general direction of larry are very apt indeed to talk under pressure vyland knows it youre safe and when its al over if youre not really vylands everloving partner hell find ways to ensure your silence there would be nothing you could prove against him it would only be your word against his and many others and i dont suppose even your own daughter knows whats going on and then of course theres royale the knowledge that royale is prowling around on the loose waiting for a man to make just one slip is enough to guarantee that man putting on an act that would make a clam seem positively garrulous i turned from him and smiled at vyland but im expendable am i not i snapped my fingers the guarantee vyland the guarantee ill guarantee it talbot general ruthven said quietly i know who you are i know youre a killer but i wont have even a killer murdered out of hand if anything happens to you talk regardless of the consequences vyland is first and foremost a business man killing you wouldnt even begin to be compensation for the millions hed lose you need have no fear millions it was the first time there had been any mention of the amounts involved millions and i was to get it for them thanks general that puts you on the side of the angels i murmured i stubbed out my cigarette turned and smiled at vyland bring along the bag of tools friend and well go and have a look at your new toy chapter ix it isnt the fashion to design tombs in the form of twohundredfoothigh metal cylinders but if it were that pillar on the x would have been a sensation as a tomb i mean it had everything it was cold and dank and dark the gloom not so much relieved as accentuated by three tiny glowworms of light at top middle and bottom it was eerie and sinister and terrifying and the hollow reverberating echoing boom of a voice in those black and cavernous confines held all the dark resonance the doomfilled apocalyptic finality of the dark angel calling your name on the day of judgment it should have been i thought bleakly a place you went through after you died not just before you died not that the question of precedence mattered at the end of the day as a tomb fine as a means of getting anywhere terrible the only connection between top and bottom lay in a succession of iron ladders welded on to the riveted sides of the pillar there were twelve of those ladders each with fifteen rungs not one break or resting place between top and bottom what with the weight of a heavy circuittesting bridge megger hanging down my back and the fact that the rungs were so wet and slippery that i had to grip them with considerable force to keep myself from falling off the ladder the strain on forearm and shoulder muscles was severe twice that distance and i wouldnt have made it it is customary for the host to lead the way in strange surroundings but vyland passed up his privilege maybe he was frightened that if he preceded me down the ladder id take the opportunity of kicking his head off and sending him a hundred and more feet to his death on the iron platform below however it was i went first with vyland and the two coldeyed men wed found waiting in the little steel room following close behind that left larry and the general up above and no one was under the impression that larry was fit to guard anyone the general was free to move around as he wished yet vyland appeared to have no fears that the general might use his freedom to queer his pitch this i had found inexplicable but i knew the answer to it now or i thought i knew if i were wrong innocent people would surely die i put the thought out of my mind right open it up cibatti vyland ordered the larger of the two men bent down and unscrewed the hatch swinging it up and back on its hinges to sock into a standing catch i peered down the narrow steel cylinder that led to the steel cabin beneath the bathyscaphe and said to vyland i suppose you know youll have to flood this entrance chamber when you go looking for your blackbeards treasure whats that he looked at me narrowly suspiciously why were you thinking of leaving it unflooded i asked incredulously this entrance chamber is usually flooded the minute you start descending and thats normally surface level not a hundred and thirty feet down as you are here sure sure i know it looks solid it might even hold at double this depth i dont know but what i do know is that it is completely surrounded by your gasoline buoyancy tanks about eight thousand gallons of it and those are open to the sea at the bottom the pressure inside those tanks corresponds exactly to the sea pressure outside which is why only the thinnest sheet metal is required to hold the gasoline but with only air inside your entrance chamber youre going to have at least two hundred pounds to the square inch pressing on the outside of this entrance chamber and it wont stand that itll burst inwards your gasoline will escape your positive buoyancy will be gone for ever and there you are four hundred and eighty feet below the surface of the sea and there you would remain until the end of time it was hard to be positive in that thinlylit gloom but i could have sworn that the colour had drained from vylands face bryson never told me this vylands voice was a vicious whisper and there was a shake in it bryson your engineering friend there was no answer so i went on no i dont suppose he would he was no friend was he vyland he had a gun in his back didnt he and he knew that when his usefulness was over someone was going to pull the trigger of that gun why the hell should he tell you i looked away from him and shouldered the bridge megger again no need for anyone to come down with me itll only make me nervous think im going to let you go down there on your own he asked coldly to get up to your tricks dont be stupid i said wearily i could stand there in front of an electrical switchboard or fusebox and sabotage the bathyscaphe so that it would never move again and neither you nor your friends would ever know anything about it its in my own interests to get this machine going and have the whole thing over as soon as possible the quicker the better for me i glanced at my watch twenty to eleven itll take me three hours to find out whats wrong at least ill have a break at two ill knock on the hatch so that you can let me out no need vyland wasnt happy but as long as he couldnt put his finger on any possibility of treachery he wasnt going to deny me he wasnt in any position to theres a microphone in the cabin with its extension cable wound round a drum on the outside and a lead through a gland m the side of the leg thats carried up to that room where we were theres a button callup let us know when youre ready i nodded and started down the rungs welded into the side of the cylinder unscrewed the upper hatch of the bathyscaphes flooding and entrance chamber managed to wriggle down past it the downward projecting cylinder which encompassed the top of the entrance chamber was only a few inches wider and didnt give enough room to open the hatch fully felt for the rungs below pulled down the hatch clamped it shut and then worked my way down the constricting narrowness of that chamber to the cabin below the last few feet involved an almost rightangle bend but i managed to ease myself and the megger round it i opened the heavy steel door to the cabin wriggled through the tiny entrance then closed and locked the door behind me nothing had changed it was as i had remembered it the cabin was considerably bigger than that of the earlier frns from which it had been developed and slightly oval in shape instead of round but what was lost in structural power was more than compensated for in the scope and ease of movement inside and as it was only intended for salvage operations up to about feet the relative loss in strength was unimportant there were three windows one set in the floor coneshaped inwards as was the entrance door so that sea pressure only tightened them in their seats they looked fragile those windows but i knew that the specially constructed plexiglas in the largest of them and that was no more than a foot in its external diameter could take a pressure of tons without fracturing many times the strain it would ever be required to withstand in the depths in which that bathyscaphe would operate the cabin itself was a masterpiece of design one wall if approximately onesixth on the surface area of the inside of a sphere could be called a wall was covered with instruments dial fuseboxes switchboards and a variety of scientific equipment which we would not be called upon to use set to one side were the controls for engine starting engine speed advance and reverse for the searchlights remotecontrolled grabs the dangling guiderope which could hold the bathyscaphe stable near the bottom by resting part of its length on the seabed and so relieving the scaphe of that tiny percentage of weight which was sufficient to hold it in perfect equilibrium and finally there were the fine adjustments for the device for absorbing exhaled carbon dioxide and regenerating oxygen one control there was that i hadnt seen before and it puzzled me for some time it was a rheostat with advance and retard positions graded on either side of the central knob and below this was the brass legend towrope control i had no idea what this could be for but after a couple of minutes i could make a pretty sure guess vyland or rather bryson on vylands orders must have fitted a poweroperated drum to the top and almost certainly the rear of the bathyscaphe the wire of which would have been attached before the leg had been lowered into the water to some heavy bolt or ring secured near the base of the leg the idea i now saw was not that they could thereby haul the bathyscaphe back to the rig if anything went wrong it would have required many more times the power that was available in the bathyscaphes engines to haul that big machine along the ocean bed but purely to overcome the very tricky navigational problem of finding their way back to the leg i switched on a searchlight adjusted the beam and stared down through the window at my feet the deep circular ring in the ocean floor where the leg had originally been bedded was still there a trench over a foot in depth with that to guide reengaging the top of the entrance chamber in the cylinder inside the leg shouldnt be too difficult at least i understood now why vyland hadnt objected too strongly to my being left by myself inside the scaphe by flooding the entrance chamber and rocking the scaphe to and fro if and when i got the engines started i might easily have managed to tear clear of the rubber seal and sail the bathyscaphe away to freedom and safety but i wouldnt get very far with a heavy cable attaching me to the leg of the x vyland might be a phoney in the ways of dress mannerisms and speech but that didnt alter the fact that he was a very smart boy indeed apart from the instruments on that one wall the rest of the cabin was practically bare except for three small canvas seats that hinged on the outer wall and a rack where there was stored a variety of cameras and photoflood equipment my initial comprehensive look round the interior didnt take long the first thing that called for attention was the control box of the hand microphone by one of the canvas seats vyland was just the sort of person who would want to check whether i really was working and i wouldnt have put it past him to change over wires in the control box so that when the switch was in the off position the microphone would be continuously live and so let him know that i was at least working even if he didnt know what kind of work it was but id misjudged or overrated him the wiring was as it should have been in the next five minutes or so i tested every item of equipment inside that cabin except the engine controls should i have been able to start them up anyone still waiting on the bottom floor of that leg would have been sure to feel the vibration after that i unscrewed the cover of the largest of the circuit boxes removed almost twenty coloured wires from their sockets and let them hang down in the wildest confusion and disorder i attached a lead from the megger to one of those wires opened the covers of another two circuits and fuseboxes and emptied most of my tools on to the small workbench beneath the impression of honest toil was highly convincing so small was the floor area of that steel cabin that there was no room for me to stretch out my length on the narrow mesh duckboard but i didnt care i hadnt slept at all the previous night id been through a great deal in the past twelve hours and i felt very tired indeed id sleep all right i slept my last impression before drifting off was that the wind and the seas must be really acting up at depths of a hundred feet or over wavemotion is rarely or never felt but the rocking of that bathyscaphe was unmistakable though very gentle indeed it rocked me to sleep my watch said half past two when i awoke for me this was most unusual id normally the ability to set a mental alarmclock and wake up almost to the preselected moment this time id slipped but i was hardly surprised my head ached fiercely the air in that tiny cabin was foul it was my own fault id been careless i reached for the switch controlling carbon dioxide absorption and turned it up to maximum after five minutes when my head began to clear i switched on the microphone and asked for someone to loosen the hatchcover set into the floor of the leg the man they called cibatti came down and let me out and three minutes later i was up again in that little steel room late arent you vyland snapped he and royale the helicopter must have made the double trip safely were the only people there apart from cibatti who had just closed the trunking door behind me you want the damn thing to go sometime dont you i said irritably im not in this for the fun of the thing vyland thats so the top executive criminal he wasnt going to antagonise anyone unnecessarily he peered closely at me anything the matter with you working for four hours on end in a cramped coffin is the matter with me i said sourly that and the fact that the air purifier was maladjusted but its ok now progress damn little i lifted my hand as the eyebrow went up and the face began to darken in a scowl its not for want of trying ive tested every single contact and circuit in the scaphe and its only in the past twenty minutes that i began to find out whats the matter with it well what was the matter with it your late engineer friend bryson was the matter with it thats what i looked at him speculatively had you intended taking bryson with you when you were going to recover this stuff or were you going to go it alone just royale and myself we thought yes i know not much point in taking him along with you a dead man cant accomplish much either you dropped a hint that he wouldnt be coming along and he knew why he wouldnt be coming along so hed fixed it so that hed get a nice little posthumous revenge or he hated you so much that if he had to go along he was determined that he was going to take you with him out of this world i mean your friend had made a very clever little fix indeed only he hadnt quite time to finish it before the bends knocked him off which is why the engines are still out of commission hed fixed it so that the bathyscaphe would have operated perfectly would have gone backwards and forwards up and down anything you liked until you had taken it down to a depth of just over three hundred feet then he had fixed that certain hydrostatic cutouts would come into operation a beautiful job i wasnt gambling much i knew their ignorance of those matters was profound and then what vyland asked tightly then nothing the bathyscaphe would never have been able to get above three hundred feet again when either the batteries had been exhausted or the oxygen regenerating unit had failed as it would have to in a few hours well youd have died of suffocation i looked at him consideringly after that is you had screamed your way into madness on a previous occasion i had thought i had seen vyland losing some colour from his rather ruddy cheeks but on this occasion there was no doubt he turned white and to conceal his agitation fumbled a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket and lit a cigarette with hands whose tremor he could not conceal royale sitting on the table just smiled his little secret smile and went on unconcernedly swinging his foot that didnt make royale any braver than vyland maybe it only meant he was less imaginative the last thing a professional killer could ever afford was imagination he had to live with himself and the ghosts of all his victims i looked at royale again i swore to myself that one day i would see that face the mask and mirror of fear as royale himself had seen so many other faces the masks and mirrors of fear in that last second of awareness and knowingness before he pulled the trigger of his deadly little gun neat eh vyland said harshly he had regained a measure of composure it wasnt bad i admitted at least i sympathise with his outlook the object he had in mind funny very funny indeed there were times when vyland forgot that the wellbred business tycoon never snarls he looked at me with sudden speculation in his eyes you wouldnt be thinking along the same lines yourself talbot of pulling a fast one like bryson tried to pull its an attractive idea i grinned at him but you insult my intelligence in the first place had i had any ideas along those lines do you think i would have given you any hint of them besides i intend to go along with you on this little trip at least hope to you do eh vyland was back on balance his shrewd quick self again getting suspiciously cooperative all of a sudden arent you talbot you cant win i sighed if i said i didnt want to go youd think that a damn sight more suspicious be your age vyland things arent as they were a few hours ago remember the generals speech about ensuring my continued wellbeing he meant it all right he meant every word of it try seeing me off and hell see you off and youre too much of a business man to make a bad deal like that royale here is going to be deprived of the pleasure of killing me killing gives me no pleasure royale put in softly it was a simple statement of fact and i stared at him temporarily offbalance by the preposterousness of it did i hear what i thought i heard i asked slowly ever hear of a ditchdigger digging ditches for pleasure talbot i think i see your point i stared at him for a long moment he was even more inhuman than i had ever imagined anyway vyland now that im going to live i have a different outlook on things the sooner this business is over the sooner ill be away from you and your cosy little pals and then i think i could put the touch on the general for a few thousand t hardly think he would like it known that he had been aiding and abetting criminal activities on a grand scale you mean you mean youd put the black on the man who saved your life apparently some things were still capable of astonishing vyland god youre as bad as any of us worse i never said i wasnt i said indifferently these are hard times vyland a man must live and im in a hurry thats why i suggest i come along oh i admit a child could steer and lower and raise the bathyscaphe once hed read the instructions but salvage is no job for amateurs believe me vyland i know and its not youre amateurs im an expert its the one thing im really good at so i come eh vyland looked at me long and consideringly then he said softly i just wouldnt dream of going along without you talbot he turned opened the door and gestured to me to precede him he and royale came out behind me and as we walked along the passage we could hear cibatti slamming home a heavy bolt and turning a key in the lock which made it as safe as the bank of england except for one thing in the bank of england a code knock does not automatically open the door to the vaults but it opened doors here and i had remembered it and even had i forgotten it it would have come back there and then for vyland was using it again on a door about fifteen yards along the passage the door was opened by cibattis opposite number the compartment beyond wasnt as bleakly furnished as the one we had just left but it was a near thing it had no wall coverings no floor coverings it didnt even have a table but it did have a padded bench along one wall and on this the general and mary were sitting kennedy was sitting very straight on a wooden chair in a corner and larry his big pistol out ms eyes twitching away as feverishly as ever was pacing up and down doing his big watchdog act i scowled at them all impartially the general was his usual erect impassive self ail his thoughts and emotions under the usual impeccable control but there were dark halfmoons under his eyes that hadnt been there a couple of days ago his daughters eyes too were smudged with blue her face was pale and though it was composed enough she didnt have the iron in her that her father had the droop of the slender shoulders slight though it was was there for all to see myself i didnt go much for iron women at any time there was nothing i would have liked better than to put an arm round those selfsame shoulders but the time and the place were wrong the reactions anyway unpredictable kennedy was just kennedy his goodlooking hard face a smooth brown mask and he wasnt worried about anything i noticed that his maroon uniform fitted him better than ever it wasnt that he had been to see his tailor someone had taken his gun from him and now there wasnt even the suspicion of a bulge to mar the smooth perfection of the uniform as the door closed behind us mary ruthven rose to her feet there was an angry glint in her eye maybe there was more iron to her than i had supposed she gestured towards larry without looking at him is all this really necessary mr vyland she asked coldly am i to assume that we have now arrived at the stage of being treated like criminals like criminals under an armed guard you dont want to pay any attention to our little pal here i put in soothingly the heater in his hand doesnt mean a thing hes just whistling in the dark all those snowbirds are as jittery and nervous as this just looking at the gun gives him confidence his next shots overdue but when he gets it hell be ten feet tall larry took a couple of quick steps forward and jammed the gun into my stomach he wasnt any too gentle about it his eyes were glazed there were a couple of burning spots high up in the deadwhite cheeks and his breath was a harsh and hissing halfwhistle through bared and clenched teeth i told you talbot he whispered i told you not to ride me any more thats the last time i glanced over his shoulder then smiled at him look behind you sucker i said softly as i spoke i again shifted my gaze over his shoulder and nodded slightly he was too hopped up and unbalanced not to fall for it so sure was i that he would fall for it that my right hand was reaching for his gun even as he started to turn and by the time his head was twisted all the way round i had my hand locked over his and the gun pointing sideways and downwards where it would do no harm to anybody if it went off no direct harm that was i couldnt speak for the power and direction of the ricochet off steel decks and bulkheads larry swung round his face an ugly and contorted mask of fury and hate swearing softly vilely continuously he reached down with his free hand to try to wrench the pistol clear but the hardest work larry had ever done was pushing down the plunger of a hypodermic syringe and he was just wasting his time i wrenched the gun away stepped back stiffarmed him joltingly with the heel of my palm as he tried to come after me broke open the automatic ejected the magazine and sent it clattering into one corner while the gun went into another larry halfstood halfcrouched against the far wall where my push had sent him blood trickling from his nose and tears of rage and frustration and pain running down both cheeks just to look at him made me sick and cold all right royale i said without turning my head you can put your gun away the shows over but the show wasnt over a hard voice said go pick up that gun talbot and the clip put the clip in the gun and give it back to larry i turned round slowly vyland had a gun in his hand and i didnt care very much for the whiteness of the knuckle of the trigger finger he looked his usual polished urbane self but the rigidity of his gun hand and the ever so slightly too fast rate of breathing gave him away it didnt make sense men like vyland never allowed themselves to become emotionally involved far less so concerned over what happened to a punk like larry how would you like to go up top and take a walk over the side i asked ill give you till i count five and then what then shoot you wouldnt dare i said contemptuously youre not the type to pull triggers vyland thats why you employ this big bad hatchetman here besides who would fix up the bathyscaphe then im counting talbot as far as i was concerned hed gone nuts one two ok ok i interrupted so you can count youre a swell counter i bet you can even count up to ten but i bet you cant count up to all those millions youre going to lose just because i dont feel like picking up a gun i can get other people to fix up that bathyscaphe not this side of the atlantic you wont and you havent all that much time to play around with have you vyland whats the betting a planeload of the fbi arent already on the way to marble springs to investigate that curious telegram jablonsky sent whats the betting they arent already there whats the betting they arent knocking on the door of the generals villa right now saying wheres the general and the butler saying why the generals just gone out to the rig gentlemen and then the fbi saying we must call upon the general immediately we have important things to discuss with him and they will call vyland just as soon as this storm blows over im afraid hes right mr vyland the unexpected help came from royale we havent all that much time for a long moment vyland said nothing then he lowered his gun turned and walked out of the room royale as always showed no sign of strain or emotion whatever he smiled and said mr vyland has gone to eat over on the other side lunch is ready for all of us and stood to one side to let us out through the door it had been a strange offbeat episode it didnt make sense it didnt even begin to make any kind of sense at all i pondered it i tried to find even a shadow of an explanation while larry collected his gun and ammunition clip but it was no good i couldnt find an explanation to fit the facts besides id suddenly realised that i was very hungry indeed i stood to one side to let all the others except royale precede me not so much out of courtesy as to ensure that larry didnt shoot me in the back then hurried without seeming to to catch up on mary and kennedy to get to the other side of the rig we had to cross the hundredfoot width of the welldeck where id talked to joe curran the roustabout foreman in the early hours of that morning it was by all odds the longest wettest and windiest hundred feet that id ever walked theyd rigged up a couple of wire lifelines clear across to the other side we could have done with a couple of dozen the power of that wind was fantastic it seemed to have redoubled in strength since we had arrived on the rig four hours previously and i knew now that we could expect no boat or helicopter to approach the rig until the storm had passed we were completely cut off from the outer world at half past two in the afternoon it was as dark as twilight and out of the great black wall of cumulonimbus that all but surrounded us the wind flung itself upon the x as if it were going to uproot it from its thirteenleg foundation topple it and drown it in the depths of the sea it roared and howled across the deck of the oilrig in a maniacal fury of sound and even at the distance of a couple of hundred feet we could plainly hear above the deep thunder of the storm the cacophonous obbligato the screaming satanic music as the great wind whistled and shrieked its falsetto way through the hundreds of steel girders that went to make up the towering structure of the drilling derrick we had to lean at an angle of almost fortyfive degrees against the wind to keep our balance and at the same time hang on grimly to one of the lifelines if you fell and started rolling along mat deck you wouldnt stop until the wind had pushed you clear over the side it was as strong as that it sucked the breath from your lungs and under its knifeedged hurricane lash the rain flailed and stung the exposed skin like an endless storm of tiny lead shot mary led the way across this exposed stormfilled working platform and right behind her came kennedy one hand sliding along the wire his free arm tightly round the girl in front at another time i might have been disposed to dwell on the subject of luck and how some people seemed to have all of it but i had other and much more urgent things on my mind i came close up to him actually treading on his heels put my head close to his and shouted above the storm any word come through yet he was smart all right this chauffeur he neither broke step nor turned round but merely shook his head slightly damn i said and meant it this was awkward have you phoned again the shake of the head an impatient shake this time it looked like and when i thought about it i couldnt blame him much chance hed had of either hearing or finding out anything with larry dancing around flourishing his pistol probably ever since he had come out to the rig ive got to talk to you kennedy i shouted he heard me this time too the nod was almost imperceptible but i caught it we reached the other side passed through a heavy clipped door and at once found ourselves in another world it wasnt the sudden quiet the warmth the absence of wind and rain that caused the transformation though those helped compared to the other side of the rig from which we had just come this side resembled a sumptuous hotel instead of bleak steel bulkheads there was some form of polythene or formica panelling painted in pleasing pastel shades the floor was sheathed in deep soundabsorbing rubber and a strip of carpeting covered the length of the passageway stretching in front of us instead of harsh unshaded lighting falling from occasional overhead lamps there was a warm diffused glow from concealed strip lighting doors lined the passage and the one or two that were open looked into rooms as finely furnished as the cabins you might find in the senior officers quarters aboard a battleship oil drilling might be a tough life but the drillers obviously believed in doing themselves well in their offduty hours to find this comfort luxury almost in the martian metal structure standing miles out to sea was somehow weird and altogether incongruous but what pleased me more than all those evidences of comfort was the fact that there were concealed loudspeakers at intervals along the passage those were playing music soft music but perhaps loud enough for my purpose when the last of us had passed through the doorway kennedy turned and looked at royale where are we going sir the perfect chauffeur to the end anyone who called royale sir deserved a medal the generals stateroom lead the way i usually eat in the drillers mess sir kennedy said stiffly not today hurry up now kennedy took him at his word soon he had left most of them ten feet behind all except me and i knew i had very little time i kept my voice low head bent and talked without looking at him can we put a phone call through to land no not without clearance one of vylands men is with the switchboard operator checks everything in and out see the sheriff a deputy he got the message how are they going to let us know if they had any success a message to the general saying that you or a man like you had been arrested at jacksonville travelling north i should have loved to curse out loud but i contented myself with cursing inwardly maybe it had been the best they could think up at short notice but it was weak with a big chance of failure the regular switchboard operator might indeed have passed the message on to the general and there would toe a chance that i might be in the vicinity at the time but vylands creature supervising the operator would know the message to be false and wouldnt bother passing it on except perhaps hours later by way of a joke nor was there any certainty that even then the news would reach my ears everything just everything could fail and men might die because i couldnt get the news i wanted it was galling the frustration i felt and the chagrin were as deep as the urgency was desperate the music suddenly stopped but we were rounding a comer which cut us off momentarily from the others and i took a long chance the shortwave radio operator is he on constant duty kennedy hesitated dont know callup bell i think i knew what he meant where for various reasons a radio post cant be continuously manned there is a device that triggers a distant alarm bell when a call comes through on the posts listening frequency c n you operate a shortwave transmitter i murmured he shook his head youve got to help me its essential that talbot it was royales voice hed heard me i was sure hed heard me and this was it if hed the slightest suspicion then i knew kennedy and i had exchanged our last words and that i was through but i passed up the guilty starts and breaking of steps in midstride instead i slowed down gradually looked round mildly and inquiringly royale was about eight feet behind and there were no signs of suspicion or hostility in his face but then there never were royale had given up using expressions years ago wait here he said curtly he moved ahead of us opened a door peered in had a good look round then beckoned all right in we went in the room was big over twenty feet long and luxuriously furnished red carpet from wall to wall red drapes framing square rainblurred windows green and red chintz covered armchairs a cocktail bar lined with red leather covered stools in one corner a formicatopped table to seat eight near the door in the corner opposite the bar a curtainedoff alcove the diningroom of the suite internal doors opened off right and lefthand walls where the general roughed it when he came out to the oilrig vyland was there waiting for us he seemed to have recovered his equanimity and i had to admit that that smooth urbane face with its neatly trimmed moustache and distinguished sprinkling of irongrey at the temples belonged right there in that room close the door he said to larry then turned to me and nodded towards the curtained alcove you eat there talbot sure i agreed the hired help i eat in the kitchen you eat there for the same reason that you saw no one on your way through the corridors coming here think we want the drillingrig crew running around shouting that theyve just seen talbot the wanted murderer dont forget they have radios here and the chopper delivers papers every day i think we might have the steward in now general dont you i went quickly to my seat at the tiny table behind the curtain and sat down i felt shaken i should have felt relieved to know that royale had not been suspicious that hed merely been checking to see that the coast was clear before we went into the generals room but i was more concerned about my own slipup my attention was so taken up with immediate problems that i had forgotten that i was playing the part of a murderer had i been a genuine and wanted killer id have kept my face hidden walked in the middle of the group and peered fearfully round every corner wed come to i had done none of those things how long would it be before it occurred to royale to wonder why i had done none of those things the outside door opened and someone a steward i assumed entered once again it was the general who was the host the man in charge with vyland his employee and guest the generals ability to switch roles his unfailing command of himself in all circumstances impressed me more every time i noticed it i was beginning to hope that perhaps it might be a good thing to let the general in on something of what was happening to seek his help in a certain matter i was certain now he could carry off any deception any duplicity where the situation demanded it but he might as well have been a thousand miles away for any hope i had of contacting him the general finished giving his orders for lunch the door closed behind the departing steward and for perhaps a minute there was complete silence then someone rose to his feet and crossed the room and the next i heard was the sound of bottles and glasses clinking trifles like murder and forcible coercion and underwater recovery of millions werent going to get in the way of the observance of the customs of the old southern hospitality i would have taken long odds that it was the general himself who was acting as barman and i was right i would have taken even longer odds that he would pass up talbot the murderer and i was wrong the alcove curtain was pushed back and the general himself set down a glass before me he remained bent over my tiny table for a couple of seconds and the look he gave me wasnt the look you give a known murderer who has at one time kidnapped your daughter and threatened her with death it was a long slow considering speculative look and then incredibly but unmistakably the corner of his mouth twitched in a smile and his eye closed in a wink next moment he was gone the curtain falling into place and shutting me off from the company i hadnt imagined it i knew i hadnt imagined it the general was on to me how much he was on to me i couldnt guess any more than i could guess at the reasons that had led to the discovery of what he knew or suspected one thing i was sure of he hadnt learned from his daughter id impressed her enough with the necessity for complete secrecy there was a rumble of conversation in the room and i became aware that it was general ruthven himself who held the floor its damnably insulting and utterly ridiculous he was saying in a voice that id never beard before a dry icy voice that i could just see being brought to bear for maximum effect in quelling an unruly board of directors i dont blame talbot murderer though he is this gunwaving this guarding has got to stop i insist on it vyland good god man its so utterly unnecessary and i didnt think a man like you would go in for cheaply melodramatic stuff like this the general was warming to his theme of making a stand against being shepherded around at pistol point or at least against constant surveillance look at the weather man no one can move from here in the next twelve hours at least were not in the position to make any trouble and you know im the last man in the world to want to i can vouch personally for my daughter and kennedy the general was sharp sharp as a needle sharper than either vyland or royale he was a bit late in the day in making ms stand against surveillance i guessed what he was really after was the power of freedom of movement possibly for himself even more possibly for his chauffeur and what was more he was getting it vyland was agreeing with the reservation that when he and royale went in the bathyscaphe the general his chauffeur and mary should remain in the room above the pillar along with the rest of vylands men i still had no idea how many men vyland actually had aboard the rig but it seemed likely that apart from larry gbatti and his friend there were at least three others and they would be men in the mould of gbatti conversation broke off short as a knock came again to the door a steward or stewards set down covers made to serve but were told by the general to go as the door closed he said mary i wonder if you would take something to talbot there came the soft sound of the rubbing of chair legs on the carpet then kennedys voice saying if i might be permitted sir thank you kennedy just a minute while my daughter serves it out by and by the curtain was pushed to one side and kennedy carefully said a plate in front of me beside the plate he laid a small blue leathercovered book straightened looked at me expressionlessly and left he was gone before i had realised the significance of what he had done he knew very well that whatever concessions in freedom of movement the general had gained did not apply to me i was going to be under eye and gun for sixty seconds every minute sixty minutes every hour and that our last chance for talking was gone but not our last chance for communication not with that little book lying around it wasnt strictly a book it was that cross between a diary and an account book with a tiny pencil stuck in the loop of leather which garages and cardealers dole out in hundreds of thousands usually at christmas time to the more solvent of their customers nearly all chauffeurs carried one for entering up in the appropriate spaces the cost of petrol oil services repairs mileage and fuel consumption none of those things interested me all that interested me was the empty spaces in the diary pages and the little blue pencil with one eye on the book and one on the curtain and both ears attuned to the voices and sounds beyond that curtain i wrote steadily for the better part of five minutes feeding myself blindly with fork in left hand while with my right i tried to set down in the briefest time and the shortest compass everything i wanted to tell kennedy when i was finished i felt reasonably satisfied there was still a great deal left to chance but it was the best i could do accepting of chances was the essence of this game perhaps ten minutes after i had finished writing kennedy brought me in a cup of coffee the book was nowhere to be seen but he didnt hesitate his hand went straight under the crumpled napkin in front of me closed over the little book and slid it smoothly inside his tunic i was beginning to have a great deal of confidence indeed in simon kennedy five minutes later vyland and royale marched me back to the other side of the rig negotiating the hurricane blast that swept across the open welldeck was no easier this time than it had been the last and in the intervening halfhour the darkness had deepened until it was almost as black as night at twenty past three i dropped once more down into the bathyscaphe and pulled the hatch cover tight behind me chapter x at half past six i left the bathyscaphe i was glad to leave if you have no work to occupy you and apart from a task lasting exactly one minute i hadnt done a stroke that afternoon the interior of a bathyscaphe has singularly little to offer in the way of entertainment and relaxation i left cibatti to screw down the hatch in the floor of the pillar and climbed alone up the hundred and eighty iron rungs to the compartment at the top royale was there alone finished talbot he asked all i can do down there i need paper pencil the book of instructions and if im right and i think i am i can have those engines going within five minutes of getting down there again wheres vyland the general called for him five minutes ago good old general dead on the dot theyve gone off somewhere i dont know where it doesnt matter thisll only take me half an hour at the most you can tell him well be ready to go shortly after seven now i want some paper and peace and quiet for my calculations wheres the nearest place wont this do royale asked mildly ill get cibatti to fetch some paper if you imagine im going to work with cibatti giving me the cold cod eye all the time youre mistaken i thought a moment we passed a regular office a few yards along the passage on the way back here it was open proper desk and everything all the paper and rules i need whats the harm royale shrugged and stood aside to let me pass as i went out cibatti emerged through the trunking from the pillar and before wed gone ten feet along the passage i heard the solid thudding home of a bolt the turning of a key in the lock behind us cibatti took his keeper of the castle duties very seriously indeed halfway along the passage an opened door led into a small fairly comfortably furnished room i looked over my shoulder at royale saw his nod and went in the room looked as if it had been used as an architects office for there were a couple of large drawing boards on easels topped by strip lighting i passed those up in favour of a big leathercovered desk with a comfortable armchair behind it royale looked round the room the way royale would always look round a room it was impossible to imagine royale sitting down anywhere with his back to a door overlooked by a window or with light in his eyes he would have behaved the same in a childrens nursery in this case however he seemed to be examining the room more with an eye to its qualifications as a prison and what he saw must have satisfied him apart from the doorway through which we had just entered the only other point of egress from the room was through the plateglass window that overlooked the sea he picked a chair directly under the central overhead light lit a cigarette and sat there quietly the lamplight gleaming off his dark blond slick hair his expressionless face in shadow he was no more than six feet from me and he had nothing in his hands and he could have had that little black gun out and two little holes drilled through me before i covered half the distance towards his chair besides violence wasnt on the cards just then not at least for me i spent ten minutes in scribbling down figures on a sheet of paper fiddling with a slide rule consulting a wiring diagram and getting nowhere at all i didnt conceal the fact that i was getting nowhere at all i clicked my tongue in impatience scratched my head with the end of my pencil compressed my lips and looked with mounting irritation at the walls the door the window but mostly i looked in irritation at royale eventually he got it he would have been hard pressed not to get it my presence here bothering you talbot what well no not exactly i just dont seem to be getting not working out as easily as you thought it would eh i stared at him in irritable silence if he wasnt going to suggest it i would have to but he saved me the trouble maybe im just as anxious as you to get this thing over i guess youre one of those characters who dont like distraction and i seem to be distracting you he rose easily to his feet glanced at the paper in front of me picked up his chair with one hand and made for the door ill wait outside i said nothing just nodded briefly he took the key from the inside of the door went out into the passage shut the door and locked it i got up crossed to the door on cat feet and waited i didnt have to wait long within a minute i heard the sound of feet walking briskly along the passage outside the sound of somebody saying sorry mac in a pronounced and unmistakably american accent and then almost in the same instant the solid faintly hollow sounding impact of a heavy blow that had me wincing in vicarious suffering a moment later the key turned in the lock the door opened and i helped drag a heavy load into the room the load was royale and he was out cold as a flounder i hauled him inside while the oilskinned figure whod lifted him through the door reversed the key and turned it in the lock at once he started throwing off souwester coat and leggings and beneath everything his maroon uniform was as immaculate as ever not at all bad i murmured both the sap and the american accent youd have fooled me it fooled royale kennedy bent and looked at the already purpling bruise above royales temple maybe i hit him too hard he was as deeply concerned as i would have been had i accidentally trodden on a passing tarantula hell live hell live it must have been a long deferred pleasure for you i had shed my own coat and was struggling into the oilskin rigout as fast as i could everything fixed get the stuff in the workshop look mr talbot he said reproachfully i had three whole hours fair enough and if our friend here shows any sign of coming to ill just kind of lean on him again kennedy said dreamily i grinned and left id no idea how long the general could detain vyland on whatever spurious errand hed called him away but i suspected it wouldnt be very long vyland was beginning to become just that little bit anxious about the time factor maybe i hadnt done myself any good by pointing out that the government agents might only be waiting for the weather to moderate before coming out to question the general but with vyland pointing ms gun at me and threatening to kill me i had had to reach out and grasp the biggest straw i could find the wind on the open welldeck shrieked and gusted as powerfully as ever but its direction had changed and i had to fight my way almost directly against it it came from the north now and i knew then that the centre of the hurricane must have passed somewhere also to the north of us curving in on tampa it looked as if the wind and the seas might begin to moderate within a few hours but right then the wind was as strong as it had ever been and on my way across i had my head and shoulders so far hunched into the wind that i was looking back the way i came i fancied in the near darkness that i saw a figure clawing its way along the lifeline behind me but i paid no attention people were probably using that line all day long the time for circumspection for the careful reconnoitering of every potential danger in my path was past it was all or nothing now arrived at the other side i strode down the long corridor where i had whispered to kennedy earlier in the afternoon turned right at its end instead of left as we had done before stopped to orientate myself and headed in the direction of the broad companionway which mary had said led up to the actual drilling deck itself there were several people wandering around one of the open doors i passed gave on to a recreation room full of blue smoke and crowded with men obviously all work on drilling and the upper deck was completely stopped it didnt worry the drillers their tenday tour of duty was paid from the time they left shore till they set foot on it again and it didnt worry me for it was to the working deck i was going and the absence of all traffic that id find up there would make my task all the easier rounding another corner i all but cannoned into a couple of people who seemed to be arguing rather vehemently about something or other vyland and the general vyland was the man who was doing the talking but he broke off to give me a glare as i apologised for bumping him and continued down the passage i was certain he could not have recognised me my souwester had been pulled right down to my eyes the high flyaway collar of my oilskin was up to my nose and best disguise of all i had dispensed with my limp but for all that i had the most uncomfortable sensation between the shoulder blades until i had rounded another corner and was lost to their sight i wasnt sure whether this obvious argument between the general and vyland was a good thing or not if the general had managed to get him deeply interested in some controversial subject of immediate and personal importance to both then well and good but if vyland had been expostulating over what he regarded as some unnecessary delay things might get very rough indeed if he got back to the other side of the rig before i did i didnt like to think what the consequences would be so i didnt think about them instead i broke into a run regardless of the astonished looks from some passersby at a complete loss to understand the reason for this violent activity on what was in effect a wellpaid holiday reached the companionway and went up two steps at a time mary tightly wrapped in a hooded plastic raincoat was waiting behind the closed doors at the top of the steps she shrank back and gave a little gasp as i stopped abruptly in front of her and pulled down the collar of my oilskin for a moment to identify myself you she stared at me you your bad leg whats happened to your limp never had one local colour guaranteed to fool the most suspicious kennedy told you what i wanted you for a a watchdog to keep guard thats it i dont want a bullet or a knife in my back in that radio shack sorry it had to be you but there was no one eke wheres the shack through the door she pointed about fifty feet that way come on i grabbed the door handle incautiously twisted it open and if i hadnt had a strong grip on it id have been catapulted head over heels to the foot of the stairs as it was the hammerblow blast of that shrieking wind smashed both door and myself back against the bulkhead with a force that drove all the breath out of my lungs in an explosive gasp and would possibly have stunned me if the souwester hadnt cushioned the impact as the back of my head struck painfully against the steel for a moment i hung there my head a kaleidoscopic whirl of shooting colour bent double against the hurricane force of the wind whooping painfully as i fought to overcome the shock of the blow and me sucking effect of the wind and to draw some breath into my aching lungs then i straightened up and lurched out through the door pulling mary behind me twice i tried to heave the door close but against the sustained pressure of that wind i couldnt even pull it halfway to i gave it up they could and no doubt very shortly would send up a platoon from below to heave it shut i had more urgent things to attend to it was a nightmare of a night a dark howling nightmare i screwed my eyes almost shut against the hurricanedriven knifelash of the rain and stared up into the black sky two hundred feet above my head i could just distinguish the intermittent flicker of the derricktop aircraft warning lights utterly unnecessary on a night such as this unless there were some lunatic pilots around and quite useless as far as giving any illumination at decklevel was concerned the absence of light was a mixed blessing but on the whole i felt favourable i might run into dangerous even crippling obstacles because i couldnt see where i was going but on the other hand no one else could see where i was going either arm in arm we lurched and staggered across the deck like a couple of drunks heading for a square patch of light shining on the deck from a concealed window we reached a door on the south side on the near corner and sheltered from the wind and i was on the point of bending down and having a squint through the keyhole when mary caught the handle pushed the door and walked into a small unit corridor feeling rather foolish i straightened and followed she pulled the door softly to the entrance door is on the far end on the right she whispered shed reached both arms up round my neck to murmur in my ear her voice couldnt have been heard a foot away i think theres someone inside i stood stock still and listened with her arms still round my neck given a more favourable time i could have stayed there all night but the time wasnt favourable i said couldnt it be that they just leave that light on to guide the operator to the shack when his callup bell rings i thought i heard a movement she whispered no time to play it safe stay out in the passage i murmured itll be all right i gave her hands a reassuring squeeze as i disengaged them from my neck reflecting bitterly that talbot luck was running typically true to form padded up the passage opened the door and walked into the radio room for a moment i stood there blinking in the brightness of the light but not blinking so fast that i couldnt see a big burly character sitting at the radio table whirling round in his seat as the door opened and even if i couldnt have seen him id still have heard him a split second later as he sent his seat toppling backward with a crash and leapt to his feet spinning so as to face me with a speed so remarkable in so big a man in so very big a man he was taller than i was a good bit wider heavier and younger he had that bluejowled blackeyed blackhaired very tough face that you occasionally see in first or second generation italianamericans and if he was a genuine radioman i was the queen of sheba whats all the panic about i demanded shortly it was my best american accent and it was terrible the boss has a message for you what boss he asked softly a build like a heavyweight champion and a face to match doesnt necessarily mean a mind like a moron and this boy was no moron lets have a look at your face mac what the hells biting you i demanded i turned down the collar of my coat is that what you want now the hat he said quietly i took off the hat and flung it in his face just as i heard him spit out the solitary word talbot i was into a dive even as i threw the hat and i hit him fair and square in the middle with the point of my left shoulder it was like hitting the trunk of a tree but he wasnt as well anchored as a tree and he went over his head and shoulders crashed against the far wall with a crash that shook the radio shack to its metal foundations that should have been that but it wasnt i would have sworn that boy didnt even blink he brought up one knee in a vicious jab that would have been a sad farewell for me had it landed where it had been intended to land it didnt it caught me on the chest and upper arm but even so it had sufficient power behind it to knock me over on one side and the next moment we were rolling across the floor together punching kicking clawing and gouging the marquess of queensberry wouldnt have liked it at all i was under two big disadvantages the heavy oilskins hampered my movements and although they helped absorb some of the impact of his jolting shortarm jabs they also because of their constricting effect robbed my own blows of much of their power and while he was obviously more than willing to turn the entire radio shack into a shambles of broken furniture and fittings that was the last thing i wanted everything literally everything depended on rny keeping that radio intact and we had both rolled against the radio table now myself underneath where i could have a good view of one of the legs splintering and caving in under the combined weight of our bodies against it i wasnt feeling any too good by this time i had just the evidence of my own eyes to show me that this lad was only equipped with arms and fists just like anyone else and not a couple of flexible sledgehammers which was what it felt like but the sight of that tottering radiotable made me desperate a particularly vicious clubbing blow to the lower ribs didnt make it at all hard for me to gasp out in pain and fall back limply to the floor and while he was taking advantage of my cooperation and time off to wind up his right sledgehammer to drive me through the floor i brought up my knee and simultaneously chopped him across the exposed neck with the edge of my right hand and all the power those hampering oilskins would permit by all the rules he should have gone out like a light only he had never read any of the rules but i had hurt him though the grunt of agony was as genuine as mine had been faked and he was momentarily dazed just long enough to let me squirm out from under and roll over and over until i brought up against the halfopen doorway through which i had entered i might have nailed him then back where we had been but i wasnt going to take even the chance of touching the few splintered pieces of table leg which were all that kept the transmitter from crashing on to the steel deck he was tough all right by the time i was on my feet he was on his shaken but still on ms feet for a moment i thought he had lost all taste for the hand to hand stuff the heavy wooden chair he had picked up and was bringing whistling over his shoulder certainly made it seem so but when i ducked and heard the chair smash to pieces on the door jamb behind it turned out that this was only his longrange artillery bombardment and that the assault troops were moving in later later in this case was almost right away but i managed to avoid his wild flailing bullrush and whirled round to meet his next charge it never came he was crouching there facing me teeth showing and his eyes a couple of wicked slits in his dark latin face hands pressed against the wall behind him ready to help him in his takeoff when i saw a slender wrist appearing in the doorway behind him high up at the end of the wrist was a whitegloved hand and gripped in the hand was a broken chairleg mary ruthven hit him as i would have taken long odds that she would hit mm a hesitant experimental tap on the head that wouldnt have dazed a cockroach but for all that it had the galvanic effect of an electric shock he whipped his head round to locate the source of this fresh threat and as he did i moved in with two long steps and hit him with everything i had on the neck just below the ear my knuckles socketing solidly into the hollow behind the back of his left jawbone one of the most deadly blows in boxing it could easily have dislocated his jaw or broken his neck and with any normal man might well have done just that but he was phenomenally tough he crashed back against the steel bulkhead and started to slide down towards the floor eyes unfocused in his head but even as he slid he made a last despairing effort to fling himself at me and wrap his arms around my legs to bring me down but his coordination his timing were gone i had time to step back as his face came down near my right foot i saw no reason why i shouldnt bring the two into contact and every reason why i should so i did he lay spreadeagled face downwards on the floor silent and still i was far from silent myself my breath was coming in great heaving gasps as if i had just run a mile and i hadnt even run a hundred yards in years my arms my hands my face were wet with sweat and it was this that made me think to get out a handkerchief and rub it all over my face but there was no blood there and i couldnt feel any bruise it would have been very difficult indeed to explain away a black eye or bleeding nose to vyland when i met him later i tucked the handkerchief away and looked at the girl in the doorway the hand that still held the chairleg was trembling slightly her eyes wide her lips pale and what little expression there was on her face couldnt easily have been misconstrued as the beginnings of a worshipping admiration did you did you have to use your boot she asked shakily what did you expect me to use i asked savagely the palm of my hand to smooth his fevered brow be your age lady that guy never heard of little lord fauntleroy hed have chopped me into bits and fed me to the barracuda if hed had half the chance now just you stand by with your shillelagh there and clout mm if he bats an eyelid but hard this time not i added hastily lest she suspect me of being a thought ungracious that im not grateful for what youve already done i turned round already a precious minute had been lost since i had come into the shack and found what i was looking for right away several pegs on the walls were festooned with tightlyrolled coils of wire and flex material for antenna leads and radio repairs i picked a nice flexible roll of flex and within a minute i had the radio operator trussed like a chicken ready for the broiler passed a slip knot round his neck and tied the end of it to a cupboard handle there could be some bells or pushes or phones he might try to reach but hed soon give it up when he found that all he was doing was strangling himself i gave the matter of a gag only a passing thought there may be those who know how to draw a happy median line between suffocating a man and making a gag loose enough to permit breathing without at the same time letting the victim be heard a hundred yards away but im not one of them besides with that great hurricane howling outside he could holler away till he got laryngitis and nobody below deck would ever hear him i reached for the only other chair in the shack and sat down before the radio it was a standard aircrafttype transmitter i knew it well and i knew how to operate it i switched on tuned it on the wavelength the sheriff had given me through kennedy and clamped on a pair of headphones i wouldnt have long to wait i knew that the police were keeping a twentyfour hour watch on their short wave receivers within three seconds of the end of my callup sign the headphones crackled in my ears police headquarters sheriff prendergast here please go ahead i threw the transmitter switch from manual to microphone car nineteen reporting the agreed subterfuge wasnt necessary for identification every police car in the county had been warned to stay off the air and the sheriff knew it could only be me but in these days of enthusiastic radio hams airwave eavesdroppers abound and i wouldnt have put it past vylands organisation to maintain a permanent listening watch on the police wavelengths i continued suspect answering to description detained near ventura crossroads shall we bring him in negative the voice crackled a pause weve found our man please release suspect i felt as if someone had given me a million dollars almost without realising it i relaxed heavily against the backrest of the chair the strain of the keyedup tension of the past fortyeight hours had been far greater than i had realised the sheer mental relief the depth of satisfaction i experienced then surpassed anything i had ever known car nineteen i said again even to myself my voice didnt sound quite steady would you repeat that please release your suspect prendergast said slowly and distinctly we have found our man repeat we have found the transmitter leapt backwards about two inches a great jagged hole appeared in the centre of the timing band and the radio shack seemed to explode about my ears so deafening so shattering was the effect of a heavy gun being fired in that confined space i didnt jump more than a couple of feet and after i came down i got to my feet the normal way but slowly carefully i didnt want anyone getting too nervous and whoever had pulled that stupid trick unnecessarily smashing the set and tipping off the cops that something had gone wrong was very nervous indeed almost as nervous as i felt as i turned slowly round and saw who my guest was it was larry and the smoking colt in his hand was lined up as nearly as his shaking hand would permit on a spot somewhere between my eyes it looked as large as a howitzer his lank black hair was plastered wetly over his forehead and the coalblack eye behind that wavering barrel was jerking and burning and crazy as a loons one eye i couldnt see the other i couldnt see any part of him except half his face his gunhand and a left forearm crooked round mary ruthvens neck the rest of him was hidden behind the girl i looked at her reproachfully fine watchdog you are i said mildly shut up larry snarled a cop eh a john a dirty crawling doublecrossing screw he called me several names all unprintable his voice a venomous hiss of hate theres a young lady here friend i murmured lady a tramp he tightened his grip around her neck as if it gave him pleasure and i guessed he had at some time mistakenly tried to make time with her and the roof had fallen in on him thought you were clever talbot didnt you you thought you knew all the answers you thought you had us all fooled didnt you cop but you didnt have me fooled talbot ive been watching you ive been following you every second since we came out to the rig he was jazzed up to the eyebrows shaking and jumping as if he had the st vituss dance and his voice held all the venomous and vindictive triumph of the consistently ignored and derided nonentity who has been proved right in the end while all those who despised him have been proved wrong it was larrys night to sing and he wasnt going to miss out a single note but i had listened to pleasanter voices didnt know that i knew that you were in cahoots with kennedy did you cop he went ranting on and with this tramp i was watching you when you came up from the bathyscaphe ten minutes ago i saw that smoothtalking chauffeur give it to royale on the head and how did you know it was kennedy i interrupted he was dressed up i listened outside the door mug i could have finished you off there and then but i wanted to see what you were up to think i care if royale gets sapped down he broke off suddenly and swore as the girl went limp on him he tried to hold her up but heroin is not substitute for protein when it comes to building muscle and even her slight weight was too much for him he could have lowered her gently but he didnt he stood back abruptly and let her collapse heavily on the floor i took half a step forward fists clenched till they hurt murder in my heart larry bared his teeth and grinned at me like a wolf come and get it copper come and get it he whispered i looked from him to the floor and back again and my hands slowly unclenched scared arent you copper yellow arent you copper sweet on her arent you copper just like that pansy kennedy is sweet on her he laughed a high falsetto giggle carrying the overtones of madness im afraid a little accident is going to happen to kennedy when i get back over to the other side whos going to blame me for gunning him down when i see him sapping royale all right i said wearily youre a hero and a great detective lets go see vyland and get it over with were going to get it over with he nodded his voice was suddenly very quiet and i think i liked it even less that way but youre not going to see vyland copper youre never going to see anyone again im going to kill you talbot im letting you have it now my mouth felt as if someone had gone over it with a roll of highabsorbancy blottingpaper i could fed the slow heavy beat of my heart and the sweat coming on the palms of my hands he meant every word he said he was going to squeeze the trigger of that heavy colt and if he lived to be a hundred nothing would ever give him half so much pleasure again finish but i managed to keep my voice steady so youre going to kill me i said slowly why because i hate your lousy rotten stinking guts talbot thats why he whispered a whisper with a shake in it a horrible sound because youve ridden me and laughed at me from the moment we met hophead this junky that always asking about my syringe because youre sweet on this dame here and if i cant get her no one will and because i hate cops he didnt like me i could see that even when he wasnt talking his mouth was working and twitching like an epileptics hed just told me things that i knew hed never tell another and i knew why dead men tell no tales and thats what id be any second now dead dead as herman jablonsky jablonsky in two feet of earth talbot in feet of water not that it made any difference where you slept when it was all over and it made things no better to reflect that the end was going to come at the hands of a quivering mass of dopedup neuroses disguised as a human being youre going to let me have it now my eye never lifted off that jumping trigger finger thats it he giggled in the guts low down so i can watch you flop around for a while youll scream and youll scream and youll scream and no one will ever hear it how do you like it copper hophead i said softly id nothing to lose what his face was a mask of disbelief he went into a crouch over his gun that would have been laughable in different circumstances it wasnt any strain at all not to laugh what did you say copper junky i said distinctly youre all doped up so that you dont know what youre doing what are you going to do with the body it was the first time id ever thought of myself as a coarse and i didnt care for the feeling very much two of you couldnt lift me out of here and if they find me shot in this cabin theyll know it was you who did it and then youll be for the high jump because they still need my services very badly more than ever you wont be popular larry boy he nodded cunningly as if he had just thought up all this himself thats right copper he murmured i cant shoot you in here can i well have to go outside wont we copper near the edge where i can shoot you and shove you into the sea thats it i agreed this was macabre this arrangement for my own tidy disposal but i wasnt going as crazy as larry i was gambling on my last hope but the gamble was crazy enough and then theyll all be running around and looking for you larry said dreamily and ill be running around and looking for you too and all the time be laughing to myself and thinking about you and the barracuda down among the seaweed there and knowing that im smarter than any one of them you have a charming mind i said havent i now again that high falsetto giggle and i could feel the hairs rise on the back of my neck he poked at mary with his foot but she didnt stir the dame will keep till i come back i wont be long will i copper come on you first and dont forget i have a torch and a gun im not likely to forget neither mary nor the radio operator had stirred i was pretty sure that the operator wouldnt stir for a long time i could still feel the ache in my fist and foot but i wasnt at all sure about mary i wasnt even sure that she wasnt faking her breathing seemed much too quick and irregular for an unconscious person come on now larry said impatiently he thrust the gun painfully into the small of my back out i went out through the door along the passage and through the outer door on to the wind and rainswept deck beyond the outer door had opened on the sheltered side of the radio shack but in a moment we would be exposed to the piledriving blast of that wind and i knew that when that moment came it would be then or never it was then urged on by the revolver in my back i moved round the corner of the shack crouched low and barrelling forward into that great wind as soon as it struck me larry wasnt so prepared not only was he slightly built but he was standing upright and the sudden wavering and jerking of the torch beam on the deck by my feet was intimation enough to me that the wind had caught mm offbalance perhaps sent mm staggering several feet backward i lowered my head still farther until i was in the position of a hundred yards sprinter in the first two steps of the race and lurched forward into the wind almost at once i realised that i had miscalculated i had miscalculated the strength of the wind running into that hurricane was like running through a barrel of molasses and i had also forgotten that while a seventy mile an hour wind offers an almost insuperable resistance to a human being it offers relatively none to a heavy lead slug from a colt with a muzzle velocity of mph id got maybe eight yards when the frantically searching torch beam picked me up and steadied on me and managed to cover perhaps another two before larry fired gangsters and hoodlums are notoriously the worlds worst marksmen their usual method being to come within a couple of yards before firing or spraying the landscape with a sufficient hail of bullets to make the law of averages work for them and i had heard a hundred times that those boys couldnt hit a barn door at ten paces but maybe larry had never heard of this or maybe the rule applied only to barn doors a mulekick is nothing compared to the slamming stopping power of a fortyfive it caught me high up on the left shoulder and spun me round in a complete circle before dropping me in my tracks but it was this that saved my life even as i fell i felt the sharp tug on my oilskin collar as another slug passed through it those werent warning shots that larry was firing he was out to kill and kill he would if i had remained another couple of seconds on that deck again i heard the muffled boom of the colt even at ten yards i could hardly hear it over the howling power of that wind and saw sparks strike off the deck inches from my face and heard the screaming whir of the spent bullets ricocheting off into the darkness of the night but the sparks gave me hope it meant that larry was using full metaljacketed slugs the kind cops use for firing through car bodies and locked doors and that made an awful sight cleaner wound than a mushrooming softnose maybe it had passed clear through the shoulder i was on my feet and running again i couldnt see where i was running to and i didnt care all that mattered was running from a blinding buffering gust of rain whistled across the deck and made me shut both eyes tight and i loved it if i had my eyes shut so had larry still with my eyes shut i bumped into a metal ladder i grabbed it to steady myself and before i properly realised what i was doing i was ten feet off the ground and climbing steadily maybe it was just mans ageold instinct to climb high to get out of danger that started me off but it was the realisation that this ladder must lead to some sort of platform where i might fend off larry that kept me going it was a wicked exhausting climb normally even in that giant wind it wouldnt have given me much trouble but as it was i was climbing completely onehanded my left shoulder didnt hurt much it was still too numb for that the real pain would come later but for the moment the entire arm seemed to be paralysed and every time i released a rung with my right hand and grabbed for the one above the wind pushed me out from the ladder so that my fingers hooked round the next rung usually at the full extent of my arm then i had to pull myself close with my one good arm and start the process all over again after id climbed about forty rungs my right arm and shoulder were beginning to feel as if they were on fire i took a breather hooked my forearm over a rung and looked down one look was enough i forgot about the pain and weariness and started climbing faster than ever hunching my way upwards like a giant koala bear larry was down there at the foot of the ladder flickering his torch in all directions and even with that birdbrain of his it was only going to be a matter of time until it occurred to him to shine that torch upwards it was the longest ladder i had ever climbed it seemed endless and i knew now that it must be some part of the drilling derrick the kidder i was now almost sure that led up to the monkey board that narrow shelf where a man guided the halfton sections of the drill pipe as it came from the ground into the storage racks behind the only thing i could remember about the monkey was the cheerless fact that it was devoid of handrails those would only get in the way of the man guiding the heavy drill sections into place a jarring vibrating clang as if the iron ladder had been struck by a sledgehammer was larrys way of announcing that he had caught sight of me the bullet had struck the rung on which my foot rested and for one bad moment i thought it had gone through my foot when i realised it hadnt i took another quick look down larry was coming up after me i couldnt see him but i could see the torch clutched in one hand making regularly erratic movements as he swarmed his way up the ladder making about three times the speed i was it wasnt in character this larry could never have been accused of having an excess of courage either he was loaded to the eyes or he was driven by fear fear that i should escape and vyland find out that he had been trying to murder me and there was the further possibility and a very strong one that larry had only one or two shells left in his gun he couldnt afford not to make those count i became gradually aware of lightness above and around me i thought at first that this must be a glow cast from the aircraft warning lights on the top of the derrick but in the same instant as the thought occurred i knew it to be wrong the top of the derrick was still over a hundred feet above where i was i took another breather screwed my eyes almost shut against the stinging lash of the rain and peered upwards into the murky gloom there was a platform not ten feet above my head with a light shining off feebly to the right it wasnt much of a light but enough to let me see something of the dark maze of girders that was the derrick enough to let me see a dark shadow above and also to the right which looked like some tiny cabin and then larrys torch steadied and shone vertically upwards and i saw something that made me feel slightly sick the platform above was no solid sheetmetal but open grillework through which a persons every move could be seen gone were my hopes of waiting till larrys head appeared above the level of the platform and then kicking it off his shoulders i glanced downwards larry was no more than ten feet below and both his gun and torch were levelled on me could see the dull glint of light on the barrel and the dark hole in the middle where death hid one little pull on the trigger finger and that dark hole would be a streaking tongue of fire in the darkness of the night curtains for talbot wondered vaguely stupidly if my eyes would have time to register the bright flame before the bullet and the oblivion it carried with it closed my eyes for ever and then slowly i realised that larry wasnt going to fire not even larry was crazy enough to fire not then the pound deadweight of my falling body would have brushed him off that ladder like a fly and from that tenstory height neither of us would have bounced off that steel deck enough so that anyone would notice i kept on climbing and reached the top had it been a solid platform there i dont think i would have managed to pull myself on to it against that wind my one good hand would just have scrabbled about on the smooth metal surface until exhaustion overtook me and i fell back off the ladder tout as it was i managed to hook my fingers in the openwork steel grille and drag myself on to the platform larry was close behind he gestured with his torch and i got his meaning i moved to one side past the little cabin at the corner where a lamp on a recessed shelf threw a faint light that was cut off abruptly at waist level and waited slowly carefully his eyes never leaving my face larry came over the top and straightened to his feet i moved farther along the monkeyboard slowly backwards with my face to larry on my right i could dimly make out the big pipe storage racks on my left the edge of the monkey board no handrail just a sheer drop of a hundred feet then i stopped the gallery of the monkeyboard seemed to run all the way round the outside of the derrick and it would have suited larry just fine to have me out on the northern edge where wind or no wind a good shove or a slug might have sent me tumbling direct into the sea a hundred and fifty feet below larry came close to me hed switched off his torch now the fixed light on the cabin side might leave the lowermost three feet in darkness but it was enough for him and he wouldnt want to take even the remote chance of anyone spotting a flickering torchlight and wondering what any crazy person should be doing up on the monkeyboard in that hurricane wind and with all the work stopped he halted three feet away he was panting heavily and he had his wolf grin on again keep going talbot he shouted i shook my head this is as far as im going i hadnt really heard him the response was purely automatic i had just seen something that made me feel icecold colder by far than the biting lash of that rain i had thought down in the radio shack that mary ruthven had been playing possum and now i knew i had been right she had been conscious she must have taken off after us immediately we had left there was no mistaking at all that gleaming darkblonde head those heavily plaited braids that appeared over the top of the ladder and moved up into the night you fool i thought savagely you crazy crazy little fool i had no thought for the courage it must have taken to make that climb for the exhausting nightmare it must have been even for the hope it held out for myself i could feel nothing but bitterness and resentment and despair and behind all of those the dim and steadily growing conviction that id count the world well lost for mary ruthven get going larry shouted again so you can shove me into the sea no turn round so you can sap me with that gun and they find me lying on the deck beneath no suspicion of foul play she was only two yards away now wont do larry boy shine your torch on my shoulder my left shoulder the flash clicked oa and i heard again that maniac giggle so i did get you hey talbot you got me she was right behind him now that great wind had swept away any incautious sound she might have made i had been watching her out of the corner of my eye but now i suddenly looked straight at her over larrys shoulder my eyes widening in hope try again copper larry giggled cant catch me twice that way throw your arms round his neck or his legs i prayed or throw your coat over his head but dont dont dont go for his gunhand she went for his gunhand she reached round his right side and i plainly heard the smack as her right hand closed over his right wrist for a moment larry stood stockstill had he jumped or twisted or moved i would have been on to him like an express train but he didnt the very unexpectedness of the shock temporarily petrified him it petrified his gun hand too it was still pointing straight at me and it was still levelled at my heart when he made a violent grab for marys right wrist with his left hand a jerk up with his left hand a jerk down with his right and his gunhand was free then he moved a little to his left jerked her forward a foot pinned her against the storage racks to the right and started to twist her wrist away from him he knew who he had now and the wolf grin was back on his face and those coalblack eyes and the gun were levelled on me all the time for five maybe ten seconds they stood there straining fear and desperation gave the girl strength she would never normally have had but larry too was desperate and he could bring far more leverage to bear there was a halfstifled sob of pain and despair and she was on her knees before him then on her side larry still holding her wrist i couldnt see her now only the faint sheen of her hair she was below the level of the faint light cast by the lamp all i could see was the madness in the face of the man opposite me and the light shining from the shelf of the little cabin a few feet behind him i lifted the heel of my right shoe off the ground and started to work my foot out of it with the help of my left foot it wasnt even a chance come here cop larry said stonily come here or ill give the girl friends wrist just another little turn and then you can wave her goodbye he meant it it would make no difference now he knew he would have to kill her anyway she knew too much i moved two steps closer my heel was out of the right shoe he thrust the barrel of the colt hard against my mouth i felt a tooth break and the salt taste of blood from a gashed upper lip on the inside i twisted my face away spat blood and he thrust the revolver deep into my throat scared cop he said softly his voice was no more than a whisper but i heard it above the voice of that great wind maybe it was true enough this business of the abnormally heightened sensitivity of those about to die and i was about to die i was scared all right i was scared right to the depths as i had never been scared before my shoulder was beginning to hurt and hurt badly and i wanted to be sick that damned revolver grinding into my throat was sending waves of nausea flooding through me i drew my right foot back as far as i could without upsetting my balance my right toe was hooked over the tongue of the shoe you cant do it larry i croaked the pressure on my larynx was agonising the gunsight jabbing cruelly into the underside of my chin kill me and theyll never get the treasure im laughing he was too a horrible maniacal cackle see me cop im laughing id never see any of it anyway larry the junky never does the white stuff thats all my old man ever gives his everloving son vyland id known for hours my father god damn his soul the gun shifted pointed at my lower stomach so long cop my right foot was already swinging forward smoothly accelerating but unseen to larry in the darkness ill tell him goodbye from you i said the shoe clattered against the corrugated iron of the little hut even as i spoke larry jerked his head to look over his right shoulder to locate the source of this fresh menace for a split second of time before he started to swing round again the back of his left jawbone was exposed to me just as that of the radio operator had been only a few minutes before i hit him i hit him as if he were a satellite and i was going to send him into orbit round the moon i hit him as if the lives of every last man woman and child in the world depended on it i hit him as i had never hit anyone in my life before as i knew even as i did it that i could never hit anyone again there came a dull muffled snapping noise and the colt fell from his hands and struck the grille at my feet for two or three seconds larry seemed to stand there poised then with the unbelievably slow irrevocable finality of a toppling factory chimney he fell out into space there was no terrorstricken screaming no wild flailing of arms and legs as he fell to the steel deck a hundred feet below larry had been dead his neck broken even before he had started to fall chapter xi eight minutes after larry had died and exactly twenty minutes after i had left kennedy and royale in the cabin i was back there giving the hurriedly prearranged knock the door was unlocked and i passed quickly inside kennedy immediately turned the key again while i looked down at royale spreadeagled and unconscious on the deck hows the patient been i inquired my breath was coming in heaving gasps the exertions of the past twenty minutes and the fact that id run ae the way back there hadnt helped my respiration any restive kennedy grinned i had to give him another sedative then his eyes took me in and the smile slowly faded as he looked first at the blood trickling from my mouth then at the hole in the shoulder of the oilskin you look bad youre hurt trouble i nodded but its all over now all taken care of i was wriggling out of my oilskins as fast as i could and i wasnt liking it at all i got through on the radio everything is going fine so far that is fine thats wonderful the words were automatic kennedy was pleased enough to hear my news but he was far from pleased with the looks of me carefully gently he was helping me out of the oilskins and i heard the quick indrawing of breath as he saw where id torn my shirtsleeve off at the shoulder the redstained wads of gauze with which mary had plugged both sides of the wound the bullet had passed straight through missing the bone but tearing half the deltoid muscle away in the brief minute wed stopped in the radio shack after wed come down that ladder again my god that must hurt not much not much it didnt there were a couple of little men working on piecetime rates perched on either side of my shoulder and sawing away with a crosscut as if their lives depended on it and my mouth didnt fed very much better the broken tooth had left an exposed nerve that sent violent jolts of pain stabbing up through my face and head every other second normally the combination would have had me climbing the walls but today wasnt a normal day you cant carry on like this kennedy persisted youre losing blood and can anyone see that ive been hit in the teeth i asked abruptly he crossed to a washbasin wet a handkerchief and wiped my face clear of blood i dont think so he said consideringly tomorrow your upper lip will be double its size but it hasnt started coming up yet he smiled without humour and as long as the wound in your shoulder doesnt make you laugh out loud no one can see that one of your teeth is broken fine thats all i need you know ive got to do this i was slipping oft the oilskin leggings and had to reposition the gun in my waistband kennedy beginning to dress up in the oilskins himself saw it larrys i nodded he did the damage another nod and larry he wont need any more heroin where hes gone i struggled painfully into my coat more than ever grateful that id left it oft before going i broke his neck kennedy regarded me long and thoughtfully you play kind of rough dont you talbot not half as rough as youd have been i said grimly hed mary on her hands and knees on the monkeyboard of the derrick a hundred feet above the deck and he was proposing that she go down again without benefit of the ladder he stopped in the middle of tying the last button on his oilskin crossed in two quick strides grabbed me by the shoulders then released them again at my quick exclamation of pain sorry talbot damn foolish of me his face wasnt as brown as usual eyes and mouth were creased with worry how is she all right shes all right i said wearily shell be across here in ten minutes time and youll see for yourself youd better get going kennedy theyll be back any minute thats right he murmured half an hour the general said its nearly up you youre sure shes all right sure im sure i said irritably then at once regretted the irritation this man i could get to like very much i grinned at him never yet saw a chauffeur so worried about his employer im off he said he didnt feel like smiling he reached for a leather notecase lying beside my papers on the desk and thrust it into an inside pocket mustnt forget this unlock the door will you and see if the coast is clear i opened the door saw that it was clear and gave him the nod he got his hands under royales armpits dragged him through the doorway and dumped him unceremoniously in the passageway outside beside the overturned chair royale was stirring and moaning he would be coming to any moment now kennedy looked at me for a few moments as if searching for something to say then he reached out and tapped me lightly on the good shoulder good luck talbot he murmured i wish to god i was coming with you i wish you were i said feelingly dont worry its just about over now i wasnt even kidding myself and kennedy knew it i nodded to him went inside and closed the door i heard kennedy turn the key in the lock and leave it there i listened but i didnt even hear his footsteps as he left for so big a man he was as silent as he was fast now that i was alone with nothing to do the pain struck with redoubled force the pain and the nausea came at me in alternate waves i could feel the shores of consciousness advancing and receding it would have been so easy just to let go but i couldnt let go not now it was too late now i would have given anything for some injection to kill the pain something to see me through the next hour or so i was almost glad when less than two minutes after kennedy had left i heard the sound of approaching footsteps we had cut things pretty fine i heard an exclamation the footsteps broke into a run and i went and sat behind my desk and picked up a pencil the overhead light i had switched off and now i adjusted the angle extension lamp on the wall so that it shone directly overhead throwing my face in deep shadow maybe as kennedy had said my mouth didnt show that it had been hit but it certainly felt as if it showed and i didnt want to take any chances the key scraped harshly in the lock the door crashed open and bounced off the bulkhead and a thug id never seen before built along the same lines as cibatti jumped into the room hollywood had taught him all about opening doors in situations like this if you damaged the panels or hinges or plaster on the wall it didnt matter it was the unfortunate proprietor who had to pay up in this case as the door was made of steel all he had damaged was his toe and it didnt require a very close student of human nature to see that there was nothing he would have liked better than to fire off that automatic he was waving in his hand but all he saw was me with a pencil in my hand and a mildly inquiring expression on my face he scowled at me anyway then turned and nodded to someone in the passageway vyland and the general came in halfcarrying a now conscious royale it did my heart good just to look at him as he sat heavily in a chair between myself a couple of nights ago and kennedy tonight we had done a splendid job on him it promised to be the biggest facial bruise i had ever seen already it was certainly the most colourful i sat there and wondered with a kind of detached interest for i could no longer afford to think of royale with anything except detachment whether the bruise would still be there when he went to the electric chair i rather thought it would you been out of this room this evening talbot vyland was rattled and edgy and he was giving his urbane top executives voice a rest sure i dematerialised myself and oozed out through the keyhole i gazed at royale with interest whats happened to the boy friend derrick fall on him it wasnt talbot royale pushed away vylands supporting hand fumbled under his coat and brought out his gun his tiny deadly little gun that would always be the first thought in royales mind he was about to shove it back when a thought occurred to him and he broke open the magazine intact all the deadly little cupronickel shells there he replaced the magazine in the automatic and the gun in his holster and then almost as an afterthought felt in his inside breast pocket there was a couple of flickers of his one good eye that a highly imaginative character might have interpreted as emotions of dismay then relief as he said to vyland my wallet its gone your wallet there was no mistaking vylands feeling it was one of pure relief a hitandrun thief your wallet on my rig an outrage a damnable outrage the old boys moustache was waffling to and fro he had the method school whacked any day god knows i hold no brief for you royale but on my rig ill have a search instituted right away and the culprit you can save yourself the trouble general i interrupted dryly the culprits got the money safely in his pants pocket and the wallets at the bottom of the sea besides anyone who takes money away from royale deserves a medal you talk too much friend vyland said coldly he looked at me in a thoughtful way i didnt like at all and went on softly it could have been a coverup a red herring maybe royale was knocked out for some other reason altogether a reason you might know something about talbot i felt cold vyland was nobodys fool and i hadnt looked for this if they got suspicious and started searching me and found either larrys gun or the wound and they would be bound to find both then this was definitely talbots farewell appearance next moment i felt colder still royale said maybe it was a plant rose groggiiy to his feet crossed over to my desk and stared down at the papers in front of me this was it i remembered now the far too carefully casual glance royale had given the papers as he had left the room id covered maybe half a sheet with letters and figures before he had gone and hadnt added a single letter or figure since it would be ae the proof that royale would ever want i kept looking at his face not daring to glance down at the papers wondering how many bullets royale could pump into me before i could even start dragging larrys cannon from my waistband and then incredulously i heard royale speak were barking up the wrong tree talbots in the clear hes been working mr vyland pretty well nonstop i should say i glanced at the papers in front of me where id left half a page of scribbled figures and letters there were now two and a half pages they had been written with the same pen and it would have taken a pretty close look to see that they hadnt been written by the same hand and it was upside down to royale the scribbled nonsense was as meaningless as my own had been but it was enough it was more than enough it was my passport to life given me by kennedy whose acute foresight in this case had far outstripped my own i wished i had met kennedy months ago ok so its somebody short of cash vyland was satisfied the matter dismissed from his mind how did you make out talbot were getting pushed for time no worry i assured him all worked out guaranteed five minutes buttoningup down in the scaphe and were set to go excellent vyland looked pleased but that was only because he didnt know what i knew he turned to the thug who had kicked the door open the generals daughter and his chauffeur youll find them in the generals stateroom theyre to come here at once ready talbot ready i got to my feet a bit shakily but compared to royale i looked positively healthy and nobody noticed ive had a long hard day vyland i could do with something to fortify me before we go below ill be surprised if cibatti and his friend havent enough supplies to stock a bar vyland was seeing the end of the road he was all good humour now come along we trooped out into the corridor and along to the door of the room that gave access to the caisson vyland gave his secret knock i was glad to note that it was still the same and we went inside vyland had been right cibatti and his friend did indeed do themselves well in the liquor line and by the time i had three stiff fingers of scotch inside me the two little men sawing with the crosscut on my shoulder had given up the piecework and were back on time rates and i no longer felt like banging my head against the wall it seemed logical to expect that the improvement might be maintained if i poured myself another shot of anaesthetic and id just done this when the door opened and the thug vyland had sent to the other side of the rig appeared ushering in mary and kennedy my heart had been through a lot that night heavy overtime stuff to which it wasnt accustomed but it only required one look at mary and it started doing its handsprings again my mind wasnt doing handsprings though i looked at her face and my mind was filled with ail sorts of pleasant thoughts about what id like to do to vyland and royale there were big bluishdark patches under her eyes and she looked white and strained and more than a little sick id have taken any odds that that last half hour with me had scared and shaken her as shed never been scared and shaken before it had certainly scared and shaken me enough but neither vyland nor royale seemed to notice anything amiss people forced to associate with them and not scared and shaken would be the exception rather than the rule kennedy didnt look scared and shaken he didnt look anything at all except the perfect chauffeur but royale wasnt any more fooled than i was he turned to cibatti and his sidekick and said just go over this bird here will you and see that hes not wearing anything that he shouldnt be wearing vyland gave him a questioning look he may be as harmless as he looks but i doubt it royale explained hes had the run of the rig this afternoon he might just possibly have picked up a gun and if he has he might just possibly get the drop on cibatti and the others when they werent looking royale nodded to the door in the convex wall i just wouldnt fancy climbing a hundred feet up an iron ladder with kennedy pointing a gun down the way all the time they searched kennedy and found nothing royale was smart all right you could have put in your eye all the bits he missed but he just wasnt smart enough he should have searched me we dont want to hurry you talbot vyland said with elaborate sarcasm right away i said i sent down the last of the anaesthetic frowned owlishly at the notes in my hand folded them away in a pocket and turned towards the entrance door to the pillar i carefully avoided looking at mary the general or kennedy vyland touched me on my bad shoulder and if it hadnt been for the anaesthetic id have gone through the deckhead as it was i jumped a couple of inches and the two lumberjacks on my shoulder started up again sawing away more industriously than ever getting nervous arent we vyland sneered he nodded at a mechanism on the table a simple solenoid switch that id brought up from the scaphe forgotten something havent you no we wont be needing that any more right on your way you first watch them real close cibatti wont you ill watch them boss cibatti assured him he would too hed bend his gun over the head of the first person to breathe too deeply the general and kennedy werent going to pull any fast ones when vyland and royale were down there with me in the bathyscaphe theyd stay there under gunpoint until we returned i was sure that vyland would even have preferred to have the general with us in the bathyscaphe as extra security but apart from the fact that the scaphe held only three in comfort and vyland would never move into the least danger without his hatchetman by his side that rung descent was far too much for the old general to look at it almost proved too much for me too before i was halfway down my shoulder arm and neck felt as if they were bathed in a mould of molten lead and the waves of fiery pain were shooting up into my head and there the fire turned to darkness and down into my chest and stomach and there they turned to nausea several times the pain and the darkness and the nausea all but engulfed me i had to cling on desperately with my one good hand until the waves subsided and full consciousness returned with every rung descended the periods of darkness grew longer and awareness shorter and i must have descended the last thirty or forty rungs like an automaton from instinct and memory and some strange sort of subconscious willpower the only point in my favour was that courteous as ever they had sent me down first so that i wouldnt have to fight the temptation of dropping something heavy oa their heads and so they werent able to see how i was suffering by the time i had reached the platform at the bottom and the last of them cibattis friend who was to close the platform hatch had arrived i was at least able to stand up without swaying my face i think must have been the colour of paper and it was bathed in sweat but the illumination from the tiny lamp at the foot of that cylindrical tomb was so faint that there was little danger of vyland or royale detecting anything unusual i suspected that royale wouldnt be feeling so good after the trip either any man who has sustained a blow or blows sufficient to put him away for half an hour isnt going to be feeling on top of his form a mere fifteen minutes after he recovers as for vyland i had a faint suspicion that he was more than a little scared and that his primary concern at the moment would be himself and the journey that lay ahead of us the platform hatch was opened and we clambered down through the entrance flooding chamber of the bathyscaphe into the steel ball below i took the greatest care to favour my bad shoulder when i was negotiating the sharp almost rightangle bend into the observation chamber and the journey wasnt any more than agonising i switched on the overhead light and made for the circuit boxes leaving vyland to secure the floodingchamber hatch half a minute later he wriggled into the observation chamber and shut the heavy wedgeshaped circular door behind him they were both suitably impressed by the profusion and confusion of the wires dangling from the circuit boxes and if they werent equally impressed by the speed and efficiency with which barely consulting my notes i buttoned them all back in place again they ought to have been fortunately the circuit boxes were no higher than waist level my left arm was now so far gone that i could use it only from the elbow downwards i screwed home the last lead shut the box covers and started to test all the circuits vyland watched me impatiently royale was watching me with a face which in its expressionlessness and battered appearance was a fair match for the great sphinx of giza but i remained unmoved by vylands anxiety for haste i was in this bathyscaphe too and i was in no mind to take chances then i turned on the control rheostats for the two batterypowered engines turned to vyland and pointed at a pair of flickering dials the engines you can hardly hear them in here but theyre running just as they should ready to go yes he licked his lips ready when you are i nodded turned the valve control to flood the entrance chamber pointed to the microphone which rested on a bracket at headheight between royale and myself and turned the wallswitch to the on position maybe youd like to give the word to blow the air from the retaining rubber ring he nodded gave the necessary order and replaced the microphone i switched it off and waited the bathyscaphe had been rocking gently through maybe a three or four degree arc in a foreandaft line when suddenly the movement ceased altogether i glanced at the depth gauge it had been registering erratically we were close enough to the surface for it to be affected by the great deeptroughed waves rolling by overhead but even so there could be no doubt that the average depths of the readings had perceptibly increased weve dropped clear of the leg i told vyland i switched on the vertical searchlight and pointed through the plexiglas window at our feet the sandy bottom was now only a fathom away what direction quick i dont want to settle in that straight ahead just how youre pointing i made the interlock switch for the two engines advanced to halfspeed and adjusted the planes to give us the maximum forward lift it was little enough not more than two degrees unlike the lateral rudder the depth planes on the bathyscaphe gave the bare minimum of control being quite secondary for the purpose of surfacing and diving i slowly advanced the engines to maximum almost due southwest vyland was consulting a slip of paper he had brought from his pocket course є true what do you mean true he snapped angrily now that he had his wishes answered and the bathyscaphe a going concern vyland didnt like it at all claustrophobic at a guess is that the true direction or is it for this compass i asked patiently for this compass has it been corrected for deviation he consulted his slip of paper again yes and bryson said that as long as we took off straight in this direction the metal in the rigs legs wouldnt affect us i said nothing bryson the engineer who had died from the bends where was he now not a couple of hundred feet away i felt pretty certain to drill an oilwell maybe two and a half miles deep theyd have needed at least six thousand bags of cement and the two bucketsful of that needed to ensure that bryson would remain at the bottom of the ocean until long after he was an unidentifiable skeleton wouldnt even have been missed five hundred and twenty metres vyland was saying from the leg weve left to the plane the first mention ever of a plane horizontal distance that is allowing for the drop to the bottom of the deep about six hundred and twenty metres or so bryson said where does this deep begin about twothirds of the distance from here at a hundred and forty feet almost the same depth as the rig is standing in then it goes down about thirty degrees to four hundred and eighty feet i nodded but said nothing i had always heard that you couldnt fed two major sources of pain at the same time but people were wrong you could my arm shoulder and back were a wide sea of pain a pain punctuated by jolting stabbing spearpoints of agony from my upper jaw i didnt feel like conversation i didnt feel like anything at all i tried to forget the pain by concentrating on the job on hand the towrope attaching us to the pillar was i had discovered wound round an electrically driven power drum but the power was unidirectional only for reeling in the wire on the return journey as we were moving just then it was being paid out against a weak spring carrying with it the insulated phone cable which ran through the centre of the wire and the number of revolutions made by the drum showed on a counter inside the observation chamber giving us a fairly accurate idea of the distancee covered it also gave us an idea of our speed the maximum the bathyscaphe could do was two knots but even the slight drag offered by the towcable paying out behind reduced this to one knot but it was fast enough we hadnt far to go vyland seemed more than content to leave the running of the bathyscaphe to me he spent most of his time peering rather apprehensively out of a side window royales one good cold unwinking eye never left me he watched every separate tiny movement and adjustment i made but it was only pure habit i think his ignorance of the principles and controls of the bathyscaphe were pretty wee complete they must have been even when i turned the intake control of the carbon dioxide absorption apparatus right down to its minimum operating figure it meant nothing to him we were drifting slowly along about ten feet above the floor of the sea nose tilted slightly upwards by the drag of the wire our guiderope dangling down below the observation chamber and just brushing the rock and coral formations or dragging over a spongebar the darkness of the water was absolute but our two searchlights and the light streaming out through the plexiglas windows gave us light enough to see by one or two groupers loafed lazily by the windows absentmindedly intent on their own business a snakebodied barracuda writhed its lean grey body towards us thrust its evil head against a side window and stared in unblinkingly for almost a minute a school of what looked like spanish mackerel kept us company for some time then abruptly vanished in an exploding flurry of motion as a bottlenosed shark cruised majestically into view propelling itself along with a barely perceptible motion of its long powerful tail but for the most part the seafloor seemed deserted perhaps the storm raging above had sent most fish off to seek deeper waters exactly ten minutes after we had left the seafloor abruptly dropped away beneath us in what seemed in the sudden yawning darkness that our searchlight could not penetrate an almost vertical cliffface i knew this to be only illusion vyland would have surveyed the ocean bed a dozen times and if he said the angle was only є it was almost certainly so but nevertheless the impression of a sudden bottomless chasm was overwhelming this is it vyland said in a low voice on his smooth polished face i could make out the faint sheen of sweat take her down talbot later i shook my head if we start descending now that towrope were trailing is going to pull our tail right up our searchlights cant shine ahead only vertically downwards want that we should crash our nose into some outcrop of rock that we cant see want to rupture the forard gasoline tank dont forget the shell of those tanks is only thin sheet metal it only needs one split tank and well have so much negative buoyancy that we can never rise again you appreciate that dont you vyland his face gleamed with sweat he wet his lips again and said do it your way talbot i did it my way i kept on course є until the towwire recorder showed metres stopped the engine and let our slight preponderance of negative buoyancy which our forward movement and angled planes had so far overcome take over we settled gradually in a maddeningly deliberate slow motion the fathometer needle hardly appearing to move the hanging weight of the towwire aft tended to pull us astern and at every ten fathoms between thirty and seventy i had to ease ahead on the motors and pay out a little more wire at exactly seventysix fathoms our searchlights picked up the bed of the sea no rock or coral or sponge bars here just little patches of greyish sand and long black stretches of mud i started the two motors again advanced them almost to halfspeed trimmed the planes and began to creep forward very slowly indeed we had to move only five yards brysons estimate had been almost exactly right with metres showing on the towwire indicator i caught a glimpse of something thrusting up from the bed of the sea almost out of our line of vision to the left it was the tailplane of an aircraft we had overshot our target to the right the nose of the plane was pointing back in the direction from which we had come i put the motors in reverse started up the towwire drum backed about twenty yards then came forward again angling to the left arrived at what i judged to be the right spot i put the motors momentarily into reverse then cut them out altogether slowly surely the bathyscaphe began to sink the dangling guide rope touched bottom but this lessening of weight failed to overcome the slight degree of negative buoyancy as it should have done and the base of the observation chamber sank heavily into the black mud of the ocean floor only fifteen minutes had elapsed since id turned down the intake control of the carbon monoxide absorption unit but already the air in the cabin was growing foul neither vyland nor royale seemed to be affected maybe they thought that that was the normal atmospheric condition but they probably didnt even notice it both of them were completely absorbed in what could be seen brightly illuminated by the forard searchlight through our forard observation window i was absorbed in it myself god only knew a hundred times i had wondered how id feel how id react when i finally saw if ever i saw what was lying halfburied in the mud outside anger i had expected anger and fury and horror and heartbreak and maybe more than a little of fear but there was none of those things in me not any more i was aware only of pity and sadness of the most abysmal melancholy i had ever known maybe my reactions were not what i had expected because my mind was befogged by the swirling mists of pain but i knew it wasnt that and it made things no better to know that the pity and the melancholy were no longer for others but for myself melancholy for the memories that were all i would ever have the pity a selfpity of a man irretrievably lost in his loneliness the plane had sunk about four feet into the mud the right wing had vanished it must have broken off on impact with the water the left wingtip was gone but the tail unit and fuselage were still completely intact except for the riddled nose the starred and broken glass that showed how the dc had died we were close up to the fuselage the bow of the bathyscaphe was overhanging the sunken cabin of the plane and the observation chamber no more than six feet distant from those shattered windows and almost on the same level behind the smashed windscreens i could see two skeletons the one in the captains seat was still upright leaning against the broken side window and held in position by the seat belt the one in the copilots seat was bent far over forward and almost out of sight wonderful eh talbot isnt that just something vyland his claustrophobic fear in momentary abeyance was actually rubbing his hands together after all this time but its been worth it its been worth it and intact too i was scared it might have been scattered all over the floor of the sea should be no bother for an experienced salvage man like yourself eh talbot he didnt wait for an answer but turned away immediately to stare out the window and gloat wonderful he repeated again just wonderful its wonderful i agreed i was surprised at the steadiness the indifference in my own voice with the exception of the british frigate de braak sunk in a storm off the delaware coast in its probably the biggest underwater treasure in the western hemisphere ten million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in gold specie emeralds and uncut diamonds yes sir vyland had forgotten he was an urbane top executive and he was back at the handwashing again ten million two hundred and his voice trailed off slowly faltered to a stop how how did you know that talbot he whispered i knew it before you ever heard of it vyland i said quietly both of them had turned away from the window and were staring at me vyland with a mixture of puzzlement suspicion and the beginnings of fear royale with his one good cold flat marbled eye wider than i had ever seen it youre not quite so smart as the general im afraid vyland neither am i for that matter he caught on to me this morning vyland ive worked out why do you know why vyland do you want to know why what are you talking about he demanded hoarsely hes smart is the general i went on as if i hadnt heard the interruption he saw when we landed on the rig this morning that i only hid my face until i was certain that a certain person wasnt among the reception committee and that then i didnt bother any longer careless of me i admit but that tipped him off to the fact that i wasnt a murderer if i were id have hidden my face from everybody and it also tipped him off to the fact that i had been out on the rig before and was frightened someone there would recognise me he was right on both counts i wasnt a murderer and i had been out on the rig before in the very early hours of this morning vyland had nothing to say the shattering effect of my words the limitless avenues of dark possibilities they were opening up had him completely off balance too confused even to begin to put his conflicting thoughts into words and the general noticed something else i went on he noticed that when you were telling me about this salvage job that i never once asked the first the most obvious question in the world what was the treasure to be salvaged what kind of vessel or aircraft the treasure was in if any i never once asked one of those questions did i vyland again careless of me wasnt it vyland but you never noticed but general ruthven noticed and he knew there could be only one answer i already knew there was a pause of perhaps ten seconds then vyland whispered who are you talbot no friend of yours vyland i smiled at him as near as my aching upper jaw would allow youre going to die vyland youre going to die in agony and youre going to use your last breath on earth cursing my name and the day you ever met me another silence deeper even than the one that had gone before i wished i could smoke but it was impossible inside that cabin and heaven only knew the air there was foul enough already our breathing was already unnaturally quickened and sweat was beginning to trickle down our faces let me tell you a little story i went on its not a fairy story but well start it with once upon a time for all that once upon a time there was a certain country with a very small navy a couple of destroyers a frigate a gunboat not much of a navy is it vyland so the rulers decided to double it they were doing pretty well in the petroleum and coffee export markets and they thought they could afford it mind you they could have spent the money in a hundred more profitable ways but this was a country much given to revolution and the strength of any current government largely depended on the strength of the armed forces under their control lets double our navy they said who said vyland he tried to speak but only a croak came out he wet his lips and said colombia however did you know i wonder thats it colombia they arranged to get a couple of secondhand destroyers from britain some frigates minesweepers and gunboats from the united states considering that those secondhand ships were almost brand new they got them dead cheap dollars but then the snag colombia was in a state of threatened revolution civil war and anarchy the value of the peso was tumbling abroad and britain and the united states to whom a combined payment was to be made refused to deliver against the peso no international bank would look at colombia so it was agreed that the payment be made in kind some previous government had imported for industrial purposes two million dollars worth of uncut brazilian diamonds which had never been used to that was added about two and a half million dollars worth of colombian gold near enough two tons in lb ingots the bulk of the payment however was in cut emeralds i need hardly remind you vyland that the muzo mines in the eastern andes are the most famous and important source of emeralds in the world or perhaps you know vyland said nothing he pulled out his display handkerchief and mopped his face he looked sick no matter and then came the question of transport it was supposed to have been flown out to tampa on its first leg by an avianca or lansa freighter but all the domestic national airlines were temporarily grounded at the beginning of may when the new elections were coming up some members of the permanent civil service were desperately anxious to get rid of this money in case it fell into the wrong hands so they looked around for a foreignowned freight airline operating only external flights they picked on the transcarib air charter co lloyds agreed to transfer the insurance the transcarib freighter filed a false flight plan and took off from barranquilla heading for tampa via the yucatan strait there were only four people in that plane vyland there was the pilot a twin brother of the owner of the transcarib line there was the copilot who also doubled as navigator and a woman and a small child whom it was thought wiser not to leave behind in case things went wrong at the elections and it was found out the part played by the transcarib in getting the money out of the country they filed a false flight plan vyland but that didnt do them any good at all for one of those noble and highminded civil servants who had been so anxious to pay the debt to britain and america was as crooked as they come and a creature of yours vyland he knew of the true flight plan and radioed you you were in havana and youd everything laid on hadnt you vyland how do you know all this vyland croaked because i am i was the owner of the transcarib air charter co i felt unutterably tired i dont know whether it was because of the pain or the foul air or just because of the overwhelming sense of the emptiness of living i was grounded at belize in british honduras at the time but i managed to pick them up on the radio after they had repaired it they told me then that someone had tried to blow up the plane but i know now that wasnt quite true all they had tried to do was to wreck the radio to cut the dc off from the outer world they almost succeeded but not quite you never knew did you vyland that someone was in radio contact with that plane just before it was shot out of the sky but i was just for two minutes vyland i looked at him slowly consideringly emptily two little minutes that mean you die tonight vyland stared at me with sick terror in his eyes he knew what was coming all right or thought he knew he knew now who i was he knew now what it was to meet a man who had lost everything a man to whom pity and compassion were no longer even words slowly as if at the expense of great effort and pain he twisted his head to look at royale but for the first time ever there was no comfort no security no knowledge of safety to be found there for the incredible was happening at last royale was afraid i halfturned and pointed at the shattered cabin of the dc take a good look vyland i said quietly take a good look at what youve done and feel proud of yourself in the captains seat that skeleton was once peter talbot my twin brother the other is elizabeth talbot she was my wife vyland in the back of the plane will be all thats left of a very little boy john talbot my son he was three and a half years old ive thought a thousand times about how my little boy died vyland the bullets that killed my wife and brother wouldnt have got him hed have been alive till the plane hit the water maybe two or three minutes the plane tumbling and falling all through the sky vyland and the little boy sobbing and screaming and terrified out of his mind and his mother not coming when he called her name when he called her name over and over again but she couldnt come could she vyland she was sitting in her seat dead and then the plane hit the water and even then perhaps johnny was still alive maybe the fuselage took time to sink it happens that way often you know vyland or it had air trapped inside it when it sank i wonder how long it was before the waters closed over him cant you see it vyland three years old screaming and struggling and dying and no one near him and then the screaming and struggling stopped and my little boy was drowned i looked out at the smashed plane cabin for a long time or what seemed like a long time and when i turned away vyland caught my right arm i pushed him off and he fell on the duckboard floor staring up at me with wide panicstricken eyes his mouth was open his breathing coming in quick harsh gasps and his entire body was trembling royale was still in control of himself but only just ivoryknuckled hands rested on his knees and his eyes were moving constantly about the observation chamber a hunted animal seeking a way to escape ive waited a long time for this vyland i went on ive waited two years and four months and i dont believe ive ever thought for five minutes about anything else in all that time ive nothing left to live for vyland you can understand that ive had enough i suppose its macabre but id kind of like to stay here beside them ive stopped kidding myself about the point in carrying on living theres none not any more so i might as well stay here theres no point now because all thats kept me going was the promise i made myself on the third of may that id never rest again till id sought out and destroyed the man who had destroyed life for me that ive done and theres no more now it should spoil it for me i suppose the thought that youll be here also but on the other hand i suppose its kind of fitting the killers and their victims all together in the end youre mad vyland whispered youre mad what are you saying only this remember that electrical switch that was left on the table the one you asked about and i said we wont be needing that any more well we wont not any more that was the master control for the ballast release switches and without it the ballast release is completely jinxed and without releasing ballast we can never rise again here we are vyland and here we stay for ever chapter xii the sweat poured down our faces in rivulets the temperature had risen to almost є fahrenheit the air was humid and now almost indescribably foul our hoarse rasping gasps as we fought for oxygen was the only sound in that tiny steel ball resting on the floor of the gulf of mexico feet below the level of the sea you jinxed it vylands voice was a weak incredulous whisper his eyes nearcrazed with fear were were stuck here here in this his voice faded away as he turned his head and started looking around with all the terrorstricken desperation of a cornered rat about to die which was ail he was theres no way out vyland i assured him grimly only through that entrance hatch maybe you want to try opening it at this depth there can only be a pressure of fifty tons or so on the outside of it and if you could open it well youd be flattened half an inch thick against the opposite bulkhead dont take it too badly vyland the last few minutes will be agony such as youve never believed man could know youll be able to see your hands and your face turning blue and purple in the last few seconds before all the major blood vessels in your lungs start to rupture but soon after that youll stop it stop it vyland screamed for gods sake stop it get us out of here talbot get us out of here ill give you anything you like one million two millions five millions you can have it all talbot you can have it all his mouth and face worked like a maniacs his eyes were staring out of his head you make me sick i said dispassionately i wouldnt get you out if i could vyland and it was just in case that i might be tempted that i left the control switch up in the rig weve got fifteen maybe twenty minutes to live if you can call the screaming agony well know living or rather the agony youll know i put my hand to my coat ripped off the central button and thrust it into my mouth i wont know a thing ive been prepared for this for months thats no button vyland its a concentrated cyanide capsule one bite on that and ill be dead before i know im dying that got him dribbling from a corner of his mouth and babbling incoherently he flung himself on me with what purpose in mind i dont know he was too crazed to know himself but i had been expecting it a heavy spanner lay to hand and id picked it up and swung it before he even touched me it wasnt much of a blow but it was enough he reeled backwards struck us head against the casing and collapsed heavily on the floor that left royale he was halfsitting halfcrouched on his little canvas stool his sphinxlike control had completely snapped he knew he had only minutes to live and his face was working overtime making up for all those expressions it hadnt used in those many years he saw closing in on himself what he had meted out to so many victims over so long a time and the talons of fear were squeezing deep reaching for the innermost corners of his mind he wasnt panicstricken yet not completely out of control as vyland had gone but his capacity for reason for thought was gone ail he could think to do was what he always thought to do in an emergency and that was of using his deadly little black gun he had it out now and it was pointing at me but i knew it meant nothing it was purely a reflex action and he had no intention of using it for the first time royale had met a problem that couldnt be solved by a squeeze of the trigger finger youre scared royale arent you i said softly it was an effort now even to speak my normal breathing rate of about sixteen was now up to fifty and it was difficult to get the time to force out a word he said nothing just looked at me and all the devils in hell were in the depth of those black eyes for a second time in fortyeight hours and this time in spite of the humidity the foul and evilsmelling air in that cabin i could have sworn i caught the smell of newturned moist fresh earth the smell you get from an open grave the big bad hatchetman i whispered huskily royale royale the killer think of all the people who used to tremble who still do tremble whenever they hear the breath of your name dont you wish they could see you now dont you royale dont you wish they could see you trembling you are trembling royale arent you youre terrified as youve never been terrified in your life arent you royale again he said nothing the devils were still in his eyes but they werent watching me any more they were riding herd on royale they were digging deep into the dark recesses of that dark mind the shift and play of expression on his contorted face was evidence enough that they were pulling him every which way but the overall pull was towards the dark precipice of complete breakdown of that overmastering fear that wears the cloak of insanity like it royale i said hoarsely cant you fed your throat your lungs starting to hurt i can feel mine and i can see your face starting to turn blue not much yet just starting under the eyes the eyes and the nose they always show up first i thrust my hand into my display pocket brought out a little rectangle of polished chrome a mirror royale dont you want to look in it dont you want to see damn you to hell talbot he knocked the mirror flying out of my hand his voice was halfway between a sob and a scream i dont want to die i dont want to die but your victims did didnt they royale i could no longer speak intelligibly it took me four or five breaths to pant out that one sentence they all had their minds bent on suicide and you just helped them out of the depths of the kindness of your heart isnt that it royale youre going to die talbot his voice was a frenzied croak the shaking gun was lined up on my heart its coming to you now im laughing im laughing out loud ive got a cyanide tablet between my teeth my chest was hurting the inside of the observation chamber was beginning to swim before my eyes i knew i couldnt last out much longer go ahead i gasped go ahead and pull the trigger he looked at me with crazy unfocused eyes that had hardly any contact left with reality and fumbled the little black gun back into its holster the beating hed taken over his head was now beginning to take its toll he was in even worse state than i was he began to sway in his seat and suddenly fell forward on to his hands and knees shaking his head from side to side as if to clear away a fog i leaned across him barely conscious myself closed my fingers over the control knob of the cartoon dioxide absorption unit and turned it from minimum all the way up to maximum it would take two minutes perhaps three before there would be any noticeable improvement maybe the best part of ten minutes before the atmosphere inside that chamber was anything like back to normal right then it made no difference at all i bent over royale youre dying royale i gasped out how does it feel to die royale tell me please how does it fed how does it feel to be buried in a tomb five hundred feet beneath the surface of the sea how does it feel to know that youll never breathe that wonderful clean fresh air of the world above again how does it feel to know that youll never see the sun again how does it feel to die tell me royale how does it feel i bent still closer to him tell me royale how would you like to live he didnt get it he was that far gone how would you like to live royale i almost had to shout the words i want to live his voice was a harsh moan of pain his clenched right fist was beating weakly on the deck of the chamber oh god i want to live maybe i can give you life yet maybe youre down on your hands and knees arent you royale youre begging for your life arent you royale ive sworn id see the day when you were on your hands and knees begging for your life and now youre doing just that arent you royale damn you talbot his voice was a hoarse despairing agonised shout he was swaying on his hands and knees now his head turning from side to side his eyes screwed shut down there on the floor the air must have been foul and contaminated to a degree almost completely without oxygen and his face was really beginning to show the first tinges of blue he was breathing with the rapidity of a panting dog each brief indrawn breath a whoop of agony get me out of here for gods sake get me out of here youre not dead yet royale i said in his ear maybe you will see the sun again but maybe you wont i lied to vyland royale the master switch for the ballast release is still in position i just altered a couple of wires thats all it would take you hours to find out which two i could fix it in thirty seconds he stopped swaying his head looked up at me with a bluetinged sweatsheened face with bloodshot feardarkened eyes that carried far back in them the faintest flicker of hope get me out of here talbot he whispered he didnt know whether there was any hope or whether this was just a further refinement of torture i could do it royale couldnt i see ive got the screwdriver right here i showed it to him smiled down without any compassion but ive still got this cyanide tablet in my mouth royale i showed him the button gripped between my teeth dont a hoarse cry dont bite on that youre mad talbot mad god youre not human coming from royale that was good who killed jablonsky i asked quietly it was becoming easier to breathe now but not down where royale was i did i killed him royale moaned how i shot him through the head he was asleep and then we buried him in the kitchen garden royale was still moaning and swaying but he was putting everything he could muster into his reeling thoughts to try to express them coherently his nerve for the moment was gone beyond recall he was talking for his life and he knew it whos behind vyland nobody whos behind vyland i repeated implacably nobody his voice was almost a scream he was so desperate to convince me there were two men a cuban minister in the government and houras a permanent civil servant in colombia but not now what happened to them they were they were eliminated royale said wearily i did it who else did you eliminate since youve been working for vyland nobody i showed him the button between my teeth and he shuddered the pilot the pilot flying the fighter that shot down this plane he he knew too much thats why we could never find that pilot i nodded my god youre a sweet bunch but you made a mistake royale didnt you you shot him too soon before hed told you exactly where the dc had crashed vyland give you orders for all this he nodded did you hear my question i demanded vyland gave me orders for all of that there was a brief silence i stared out the window saw some strange sharklike creature swim into sight stare incuriously at both bathyscaphe and plane then vanish into the stygian blackness beyond with a lazy flick of its tail i turned and tapped royale on the shoulder vyland i said try to bring him round while royale stooped over his employer i reached above him for the oxygen regenerating switch i didnt want the air getting too fresh too soon after maybe a minute or so royale managed to bring vyland to vylands breathing was very distressed he was pretty far gone in the first stages of anoxia but for all that he still had some breath left for when he opened his eyes stared wildly around and saw me with the button still between my teeth he started screaming time and again a horrible nervedrilling sound in that tiny confined metal space i reached forward to smack his face to jolt him out of his panicstricken hysteria but royale got there first royale had had his tiny fleeting glimpse of hope and he meant to play that hope to the end of the way he lifted his hand and he wasnt any too gentle with vyland stop it royale shook him violently stop it stop it stop it talbot says he can fix this machine do you hear me talbot says he can fix it slowly the screaming died away and vyland stared at royale with eyes where the first faint flicker of comprehension was beginning to edge in on the fear and the madness what did you say he whimpered hoarsely what was that royale talbot says he can fix this machine royale repeated urgently he says he lied to us he says that switch he left up top wasnt important he can fix it he can fix it you you can fix it talbot vylands eyes widened until i could see a ring of white ae round the irises his shaking voice was a prayer the whole curve of his body a gesture of supplication he wasnt even daring to hope yet his mind had gone too deeply into the shadow of the valley of death even to glimpse the light above or rather he didnt dare to look in case there was no light there you can get us out of this now even now you maybe i will maybe i wont my voice for all its rasping hoarseness had just the right shade of indifference ive said id rather stay down here i mean id rather stay here it all depends come here vyland he rose trembling to his feet and crossed to where i was standing his legs his whole body were shaking so violently that he could barely support himself i caught him by the lapels with my good hand and pulled him close theres maybe five minutes air left vyland perhaps less just tell me and tell me quickly the part you played in this business up until the time you met the general hurry it up get us out of here he moaned theres no air no air my lungs are going i cant i cant breathe he was hardly exaggerating at that the foul air was rasping in and out his throat with the frequency of a normal heartbeat i cant talk i cant talk damn you talk royale had him round the throat from behind was shaking him to and fro till vylands head bounced backwards and forwards like that of a broken doll talk do you want to die vyland do you think i want to die because of you talk vyland talked in less than three gasping coughing choking minutes hed told me all i ever wanted to know how he had struck a deal with a cuban service minister and had a plane standing by for weeks how he had suborned the officer in charge of a radar tracking station in western cuba how he suborned a very senior civil servant in colombia how the plane had been tracked intercepted and shot down and how he had had royale dispose of those who had served his purposes he started to talk of the general but i held up my hand ok thatll do vyland get back to your seat i reached for the carbon dioxide switch and turned it up to maximum whats that youre doing vyland whispered bringing a little fresh air into the place getting rather stuffy down here dont you think they stared at each other then at me but remained silent fury i would have expected chagrin and violence but there was nothing of any of those fear was still the single predominating emotion in their minds and they knew that they were still completely at my mercy who who are you talbot vyland croaked i suppose you might call me a cop i sat down on a canvas chair i didnt want to start the delicate job of taking the bathyscaphe up till the air and my mind was completely clear i used to be a bona fide salvage man working with my brother the man or whats left of the man out there in the captains seat vyland we were a good team we struck gold off the tunisian coast and used the capital to start our own airline we were both wartime bomber pilots we both had civilian licences we were doing very well vyland until we met you after youd done this i jerked a thumb in the direction of the broken weed and barnacleencrusted plane i went back to london i was arrested they thought id something to do with this it didnt take long to clear that up and have lloyds of london whod lost the whole insurance packet take me over as a special investigator they were willing to spend an unlimited sum to get even a percentage of their money back and because state money was involved both the british and american governments were behind me solidly behind me nobody ever had a better backing the americans even went the length of assigning a topflight cop wholetime to the job the cop was jablonsky that jolted them badly they had lost sufficient of their immediate terror of death had come far enough back into the world of reality to appreciate what i was saying and what that meant they stared at each other then at me i couldnt have asked for a more attentive audience that was a mistake wasnt it gentlemen i went on shooting jablonsky thats enough to send you both to the chair judges dont like people who murder cops it may not be complete justice but its true murder an ordinary citizen and you may get off with it murder a cop and you never do not that that matters we know enough to send you to the chair six times over i told them how jablonsky and i had spent well over a year mostly in cuba looking for traces of the bullion how we had come to the conclusion that it still hadnt been recovered not one of the cut emeralds had appeared anywhere in the worlds markets interpol would have known in days and we were pretty certain i continued why the money hadnt been recovered why only one reason it had been lost in the sea and someone had been a mite hasty in killing off the only person who knew exactly where it was the pilot of the fighter plane our inquiries had narrowed down to the west coast of florida somebody was looking for money sunk in the water for that they needed a ship the generals temptress did just fine but for that you also needed an extremely sensitive depth recorder and there is where you made your one and fatal mistake vyland we had requested every major marine equipment supplier in europe and north america to notify us immediately they sold any special depthfinding equipment to any vessels other than naval mercantile or fishing you are following me i trust they were following me all right they were three parts back to normal now and there was murder in their eyes in the fourmonth period concerned no fewer than six of those ultrasensitive recorders had been sold privately all to owners of very large yachts two of those yachts were on a round the world cruise one was in rio one was in long island sound one on the pacific coast and the sixth was plodding up and down the west coast of florida general blair ruthvens temptress it was brilliant i admit it what better cover could you ever have had for quartering every square yard of sea off the florida coast without arousing suspicion while the generals geologists were busy setting off their little bombs and making seismological maps of the undersea rock strata you were busy mapping every tiniest contour of the ocean floor with the depth recorder it took you almost six weeks because you started operating too far to the north we were watching your every move even then and had fitted out a special boat for night prowling that was the boat i came out on early this morning well you found the plane you even spent three nights dragging for it with grapples but all you could drag up was a small section of the left wingtip i gestured through the window you can see how comparatively recent that break is how do you know all this vyland whispered because i had secured a job as a replacement engineer aboard the temptress i ignored the startled oath the involuntary clenching of vylands hands you and the general thought you had seen me aboard that havana salvage vessel but you hadnt though i had been with the firm i was five weeks on the temptress and it wasnt till i left that i dyed my hair this hellish colour had a plastic surgeon fix up this scar and affected a limp even so you werent very observant were you vyland you should have cottoned on so there you were you knew where the treasure was but you couldnt get your hands on it anyone who started using diving bells and all the complicated recovery gear necessary for a job like this would have been putting a noose round his own neck but then someone had another brilliant idea this one id wager anything came from the mind of our deceased engineer friend bryson hed read all about those bathyscaphe trials that were being carried out in the west indies and came up with the idea of using it in conjunction with this rig the air was almost back to normal inside the observation chamber and though the atmosphere was still stuffy and far too warm for comfort there was plenty of oxygen in the air and breathing was no longer any problem royale and vyland were getting their meanness and courage back with the passing of every moment so you see everyone was having brilliant ideas i continued but the real beauty the one thats brought you two to the end of the road was jablonskys it was jablonsky who thought that it would be real kind and helpful of us if we could provide a bathyscaphe for you to do the job vyland swore softly and vilely looked slowly at royale then back to me you mean he began it was all laid on i said tiredly i was taking no pleasure in any of this the french and british navies were carrying out tests with it in the gulf of lions but they readily agreed to continue those tests out here we made sure that it got terrific publicity we made sure that its advantages were pointed out time and time again that not even the biggest moron could fail to understand how good it was for stealthy underwater salvage and recovery of buried treasure we knew it would be only a matter of time before the temptress turned up and she did so we left it in a nice lonely place but before we left it i jinxed it so thoroughly that no one apart from the electrician whod wired it in the first place and myself could ever have got it going again you had to have someone to unjinx it didnt you vyland wasnt it a fortunate coincidence that i happened to turn up at the right time incidentally i wonder what our friends the field foreman and petroleum engineer are going to say when they find that theyve spent the better part of three months drilling a couple of miles away from where the geologists told them to i suppose it was you and bryson who altered the reference navigation marks on the charts to bring you within shouting distance of the treasure and miles away from where the oil strata me at the present rate theyll end up with the pipe in the indian ocean and still no oil youre not going to get off with this vyland said savagely by god youre not shut up i interrupted contemptuously shut up or ill turn a knob here pull a switch there and have the two of you grovelling on your hands and knees and begging for your lives as you were doing not five minutes ago they could have killed me there and then they could have watched me die in screaming agony and the tears of joy would have rolled down their cheeks nobody had ever talked like this to them before and they had just no idea what to say what to do about it for their lives were still in my hands then after a long moment vyland leaned back in his stool and smiled his mind was working again i suppose talbot that you were entertaining some idea of turning us over to the authorities is that it he waited for a reply but when none came he went on if you were id change my mind about it for such a clever cop talbot youve been very blind in one spot im sure you wouldnt want to be responsible for the deaths of two innocent people would you now talbot what are you talking about i asked slowly im talking about the general vyland flicked a glance at royale a glance for the first time empty of fear a look of triumph general blair ruthven the general his wife and his younger daughter do you know what im talking about talbot whats the generals wife got to do my god and for a moment i thought you had us the relief in vylands face was an almost tangible quality you fool talbot you blind fool the general did it never occur to you to think how we got him to come in with us did it never occur to you to wonder why a man like that would let us use his yacht his rig and anything else we wanted to didnt it talbot didnt it well i thought you thought he sneered you poor fool old ruthven had to help us whether he wanted to or not he helped us because he knew the lives of his wife and young daughter depended on us his wife and young daughter but but theyve had a legal separation havent they the general and his wife i mean i read all about it sure sure you read all about it vyland his terror forgotten was almost jovial now so did a hundred million others the general made good and sure mat the story got around it would have been just too bad if the story hadnt got around theyre hostages talbot weve got them in a place of safety where theyll stay till were finished here or else you you kidnapped them at last the penny drops vyland sneered sure we kidnapped them you and royale me and royale you admit it a federal and capital offence kidnapping you freely and openly admit it is that it thats it why shouldnt we admit it vyland blustered but he had become suddenly uneasy so youd better forget about the cops and any ideas you have about delivering us to them besides how do you think youre going to get us up the caisson and off the rig without being chopped into little pieces i reckon youre mad talbot the generals wife and daughter i mused as if i hadnt heard him it wasnt a bad idea youd have let them go in the end you couldnt afford not to it would have been the lindbergh case ten times over had you tried anything on the other hand you knew the general wouldnt start anything afterwards it would only be his word against yours and up your sleeve you always carried the trump card royale as long as royale walked the face of america the general would never speak this whole operation probably cost him a cool million for the general a bagatelle compared to the value of wife and children a sweet setup correct i hold the trumps talbot yes i said absently and every day just on noon you sent a coded telegram in the generals company code to your watchdogs who kept an eye on mrs ruthven and jean you see vyland i even know the daughters name and if the coded telegram didnt arrive in twentyfour hours they had instructions to shift them to another place a safer hideout atlanta wasnt too safe im afraid vylands face was grey his hands beginning to shake again his voice came as a strained whisper what are you saying i only caught on twentyfour hours ago i replied wed been blind wed been checking every outgoing cable from marble springs for weeks but forgot all about the inland telegrams when i did catch on a message to judge mollison from me through kennedy remember that fight we had i slipped it to him then started off what must have been the most concentrated and ruthless man hunt for years the fbi would stop at nothing not since jablonsky got his and obviously they stopped at nothing mrs ruthven and jean are safe and well your friends vyland are under lock and key and talking their heads off to beat the rap this last bit was guesswork but i thought my guess wouldnt be so far out youre making this up vyland said huskily fear was back in his face and he was clutching at straws youve been under guard all day and if you were up in the radio shack and could see the state of that creature of yours who tried to stop me from putting through a radio call to the sheriff you wouldnt say that it was kennedy who gave royale here his sore head it was kennedy who dragged him inside the room and kept on making those calculations on the papers on my desk while i went up to attend to things you see i didnt dare move till they were free but they are free i looked at the grey and stricken and hunted face and looked away again it wasnt a pretty sight the time had come to get back i had found out all i wanted to know got all the evidence i would ever want i opened up a circuit box unbuttoned and repositioned four wires closed the box again and pulled the first of the four electromagnetic releases for the lead shot ballast it worked two clouds of grey pellets showered mistily by the side observation windows and disappeared into the black mud on the seabed it worked but the lightening of the weight made no difference the bathyscaphe didnt budge i pulled the second switch emptied the second pair of containers still we remained immovable we were sunk pretty deep into that mud how deep i didnt know but this had never happened before on tests i sat down to work out if there was any factor i had forgotten and now that the strain was over the pain was back in my shoulder and mouth and i wasnt thinking so well any more i removed the button from between my teeth and absentmindedly placed it in a pocket was was that cyanide vylands face was still grey dont be silly antlerhorn best quality i rose pulled the other two switches simultaneously they worked but again nothing happened i looked at vyland and royale and saw reflected in their faces the fear that was beginning to touch my own mind god i thought how ironic it would be if after all i had said and done we were to die down here there was no point in putting off the moment of decision i started up both motors inclined the planes to the maximum upwards elevation started up the towrope motor and at the same moment pressed the switch that jettisoned the two big electric batteries mounted on the outside of the scaphe they fell simultaneously with a thud that jarred the bathyscaphe sending up a dark spreading cloud of black viscouslooking mud for two moments of eternity nothing happened the bolt was shot the last hope was gone when all in a second the scaphe trembled broke suction aft and started to rise i heard vyland sobbing with relief and terror i switched off the engines and we rose steadily smoothly on an even keel now and again starting the towrope motor to take in some slack we were about a hundred feet up when royale spoke so it was all a plant taltoot you never had any intention of keeping us down there his voice was an evil whisper the one good side of his face back to its expressionless normal again thats it i agreed why talbot to find out exactly where the treasure was but that was really secondary i knew it wasnt far away a government survey ship could have found it in a day why talbot he repeated in the same monotone because i had to have evidence i had to have evidence to send you both to the chair up till now we had no evidence whatsoever all along the way your back trail was divided into a series of watertight compartments with locked doors royale locked the doors by killing everybody and anybody who might talk incredibly there wasnt a single solitary thing we could pin on you there wasnt a person who could split on you for the sufficient reason that all those who could were dead the locked doors but you opened them all today fear was the key to all the doors youve got no evidence talbot royale said its only your word against ours and you wont live to give your word i expected something like that i nodded we were at a depth of about feet now getting your courage back royale arent you but you dont dare do anything you cant get this scaphe back to the rig without me and you know it besides i have some concrete evidence taped under my toes is the bullet that killed jablonsky they exchanged quick startled looks shakes you doesnt it i know it all i even dug jablonskys body up in the kitchen garden that bullet will match up with your automatic royale that alone would send you to the chair give it to me talbot give it to me now the flat marbled eyes were glistening his hand sliding for his gun dont be stupid what are you going to do with it throw it out the window you cant get rid of it you know it and even if you could theres something else that you can never get rid of the real reason for our trip today the reason that means you both die there was something in my tone that got them royale was very still vyland still grey still shaking they knew without knowing why that the end had come the towrope i said the wire with the microphone cable leading back to the speaker in the rig you see the microphone switch here you see its at off i jinxed it i fixed it this afternoon so that the microphone was always live thats why i made you speak up made you repeat most things thats why i dragged you vyland close up to me so that you were right against the mike when you were making your confession every word thats been spoken down here today every word were speaking now is going through live to that speaker and every word is being taken down three times by a taperecorder by a civil stenographer and by a police stenographer from miami i phoned the police on the way back from the rig this morning they were aboard the rig before daylight which probably accounts for the field foreman and the petroleum engineer looking so nervous when we came aboard today theyve been bidden for twelve hours but kennedy knew where they were and at lunchtime vyland i gave kennedy your secret knock cibatti and his men would have fallen for it they were bound to and its all over now they said nothing there was nothing they could say at least not yet not until the full significance of what i had said had become irrevocably clear to them and dont worry about the tape recording i went on theyre not normally acceptable as court evidence but those will be every statement you made was volunteered by yourselves think back and youll see that and therell be at least ten witnesses inside the caisson who can swear to the genuineness of the recordings who will swear that they could not have come from any source other than the bathyscaphe any prosecutor in the union will call for and get a verdict of guilty without the jury leaving the box you know what that means so royale had his gun out he must have had some crazy notion of trying to snap the towrope and sailing the scaphe off to safety so we were all wrong about you talbot so you were smarter than we were all right i admit it you have what it takes but youll never live to hear the jury give their verdict as well hung for a sheep as a lamb his trigger finger began to tighten so long talbot i wouldnt i said not if i were you wouldnt you like to be able to grip the armrests of the electric chair with both hands when the time comes its no good talking talbot i said look down the barrel i advised him if you want to blow your hand off you know what to do when you were unconscious this evening kennedy used a hammer and punch to jam a lead cylinder right down the barrel do you think id be so crazy as to come down here and you with a loaded gun in your hand dont take my word for it royale just pull the trigger he squinted down the barrel and his face twisted into a malevolent mask of hate he was using up ten years quota of expressions in one day and he was telegraphing his signals i knew that gun was coming before he did i managed to dodge the gun struck the plexiglas behind me and fell harmlessly to the floor at my feet no one tampered with my gun vyland said hoarsely he was almost unrecognisable as the smooth urbane slightly florid top executive hed been his face was haggard now curiously aged and covered in a greyish sheen of sweat made a mistake at last havent you talbot his breath was coming in brief shallow gasps youre not going he broke off hand halfway inside his coat and stared down into the muzzle of the heavy colt pointing in between his eyes where where did you get that it its larrys gun was you should have searched me shouldnt you not kennedy fools sure its larrys gun that dopeheaded junky who claimed he was your son i looked steadily at him i didnt want any gunfire feet below sea level i didnt know what might happen i took it off him this evening vyland just about an hour ago just before i killed him just just before just before i killed him i broke his neck with something between a sob and a moan vyland flung himself at me across the width of the chamber but his reactions were slow his movements even slower and he collapsed soundlessly to the floor as the barrel of larrys colt caught him across the temple tie him up i said to royale there was plenty of spare flex lying around and royale wasnt fool enough to get tough about it he tied him up while i was blowing gasoline through a valve and slowing our ascent about feet and just as hs finished and before he could straighten i let him have it behind the ear with the butt of larrys colt if ever there had been a time for playing it like a gentleman that time was long gone i was now so weak so lost in that flooding sea of pain that i knew it would be impossible for me to bring that scaphe back to the rig and watch royale at the same time i doubted whether i could even make it at all i made it but only just i remember easing the hatch of the bathyscaphe up inside the caisson asking through the mike in a slurred stumbling voice that wasnt mine for the annular rubber ring to be inflated and then lurching across to twist open the handle of the entrance door i dont remember any more i am told they found the three of us lying unconscious on the floor of the bathyscaphe epilogue i walked down the courthouse steps out into the still warm october sunshine theyd just sentenced royale to death and everybody knew there would be no appeal no reversal of the decision the jury as i had prophesied had convicted without leaving the box the trial hadlasted only one day and during that entire day royale had sat as though carved from stone his eyes fixed on the same spot for hour after interminable hour that spot had been me those blank flat marbled eyes had been as expressionless as ever they hadnt even altered a fraction when the prosecution had played the recording of royale begging for his life on his hands and knees in the scaphe at the bottom of the sea they hadnt altered when the death sentence had come tout for all the lack of expression a blind man could have read his message eternitys a long time talbot his eyes had said eternity is forever but ill be waiting let him wait eternity was too long for me to worry about they hadnt sentenced vyland for they never even had the chance to try him on the way up the caisson from the bathyscaphe steps from the bottom vyland had simply let go his grip on the ladder and leaned back into space he hadnt even screamed on the long way down i passed the general and his wife on the steps i had met mrs ruthven for the first time on my first day out of hospital which had been yesterday she had been very charming and gracious and endlessly grateful they had offered me everything from a job at the top of the tree in ruthvens oil companies to enough money to last any man half a dozen lifetimes but id just smiled and thanked them and turned them all down there was nothing in them for me all the fancy directorships and money in the world couldnt buy me back the days that were gone and money couldnt buy the only thing i wanted out of the world today mary ruthven was standing on the sidewalk beside her fathers sand and beige rollsroyce she was dressed in a plain white simple onepiece dress that couldnt have cost more than a thousand bucks her braided wheatcoloured hair was piled high on her head and i had never seen her looking so lovely behind her was kennedy for the first time i saw him dressed in a lounge suit dark blue and immaculately cut and when you saw him like that it was impossible to imagine him any other way his chauffeuring days were over the general knew how much the ruthven family owed him and you couldnt pay a debt like that with chauffeurs wages i wished him all the luck in the world he was a nice guy i halted at the foot of the steps a little wind was blowing in from the blue sparkling shimmer that was the gulf of mexico sending tiny little dust devils and small pieces of paper dancing across the street mary saw me hesitated a moment then came across the sidewalk to where i was standing her eyes seemed dark and curiously blurred but maybe i was imagining it she murmured something i couldnt make out what it was then suddenly careful not to hurt my left arm still in its sling she put her two arms round my neck pulled down my head and kissed me next moment she was gone making her way back to the rolls like a person who couldnt see too well kennedy looked at her coming towards him then lifted his eyes to mine his face still and empty of all expression i smiled at him and he smiled back a nice guy i walked down the street along towards the shore and turned into a bar i hadnt intended to i didnt really need a drink but the bar was there so i went in anyway i had a couple of drinks double scotches but it was just a waste of good liquor i left and made my way down to a bench by the shore an hour two hours i dont know how long i sat there the sun sank down close to the rim of the ocean the sea and the sky turned to orange and gold and i could see faintly on the horizon and weirdly silhouetted against this flaming backdrop the massively grotesque angularity of the oilrig x x i supposed that would always be a part of me now that and the brokenwinged dc that lay yards to its southwest buried under feet of water for better or for worse it would always be a part of me for worse i thought for worse it was all over and done with and empty now and it all meant nothing for that was all that was left the sun was on the rim of the sea now and the western world a great red flame a flame that would soon be extinguished and vanish as if it had never been and so it had been with my red rose before it had turned to white the sun was gone and the night rushed across the sea with the dark came the cold so i rose stiffly to my feet and walked back to the hotel
