every man in his humour introduction the greatest of english dramatists except shakespeare the first literary dictator and poetlaureate a writer of verse prose satire and criticism who most potently of all the men of his time affected the subsequent course of english letters such was ben jonson and as such his strong personality assumes an interest to us almost unparalleled at least in his age ben jonson came of the stock that was centuries after to give to the world thomas carlyle for jonsons grandfather was of annandale over the solway whence he migrated to england jonsons father lost his estate under queen mary having been cast into prison and forfeited he entered the church but died a month before his illustrious son was born leaving his widow and child in poverty jonsons birthplace was westminster and the time of his birth early in he was thus nearly ten years shakespeares junior and less well off if a trifle better born but jonson did not profit even by this slight advantage his mother married beneath her a wright or bricklayer and jonson was for a time apprenticed to the trade as a youth he attracted the attention of the famous antiquary william camden then usher at westminster school and there the poet laid the solid foundations of his classical learning jonson always held camden in veneration acknowledging that to him he owed all that i am in arts all that i know and dedicating his first dramatic success every man in his humour to him it is doubtful whether jonson ever went to either university though fuller says that he was statutably admitted into st johns college cambridge he tells us that he took no degree but was later master of arts in both the universities by their favour not his study when a mere youth jonson enlisted as a soldier trailing his pike in flanders in the protracted wars of william the silent against the spanish jonson was a large and rawboned lad he became by his own account in time exceedingly bulky in chat with his friend william drummond of hawthornden jonson told how in his service in the low countries he had in the face of both the camps killed an enemy and taken opima spolia from him and how since his coming to england being appealed to the fields he had killed his adversary which had hurt him in the arm and whose sword was ten inches longer than his jonsons reach may have made up for the lack of his sword certainly his prowess lost nothing in the telling obviously jonson was brave combative and not averse to talking of himself and his doings in jonson returned from abroad penniless soon after he married almost as early and quite as imprudently as shakespeare he told drummond curtly that his wife was a shrew yet honest for some years he lived apart from her in the household of lord albany yet two touching epitaphs among jonsons epigrams on my first daughter and on my first son attest the warmth of the poets family affections the daughter died in infancy the son of the plague another son grew up to manhood little credit to his father whom he survived we know nothing beyond this of jonsons domestic life how soon jonson drifted into what we now call grandly the theatrical profession we do not know in marlowe made his tragic exit from life and greene shakespeares other rival on the popular stage had preceded marlowe in an equally miserable death the year before shakespeare already had the running to himself jonson appears first in the employment of philip henslowe the exploiter of several troupes of players manager and fatherinlaw of the famous actor edward alleyn from entries in henslowes diary a species of theatrical account book which has been handed down to us we know that jonson was connected with the admirals men for he borrowed pounds of henslowe july paying back s d on the same day on account of his share in what is not altogether clear while later on december of the same year henslowe advanced s to him upon a book which he showed the plot unto the company which he promised to deliver unto the company at christmas next in the next august jonson was in collaboration with chettle and porter in a play called hot anger soon cold all this points to an association with henslowe of some duration as no mere tyro would be thus paid in advance upon mere promise from allusions in dekkers play satiromastix it appears that jonson like shakespeare began life as an actor and that he ambled in a leather pitch by a playwagon taking at one time the part of hieronimo in kyds famous play the spanish tragedy by the beginning of jonson though still in needy circumstances had begun to receive recognition francis meres well known for his comparative discourse of our english poets with the greek latin and italian poets printed in and for his mention therein of a dozen plays of shakespeare by title accords to ben jonson a place as one of our best in tragedy a matter of some surprise as no known tragedy of jonson from so early a date has come down to us that jonson was at work on tragedy however is proved by the entries in henslowe of at least three tragedies now lost in which he had a hand these are page of plymouth king robert ii of scotland and richard crookback but all of these came later on his return to henslowe and range from august to june returning to the autumn of an event now happened to sever for a time jonsons relations with henslowe in a letter to alleyn dated september of that year henslowe writes i have lost one of my company that hurteth me greatly that is gabriel spencer for he is slain in hogsden fields by the hands of benjamin jonson bricklayer the last word is perhaps henslowes thrust at jonson in his displeasure rather than a designation of his actual continuance at his trade up to this time it is fair to jonson to remark however that his adversary appears to have been a notorious fireeater who had shortly before killed one feeke in a similar squabble duelling was a frequent occurrence of the time among gentlemen and the nobility it was an impudent breach of the peace on the part of a player this duel is the one which jonson described years after to drummond and for it jonson was duly arraigned at old bailey tried and convicted he was sent to prison and such goods and chattels as he had were forfeited it is a thought to give one pause that but for the ancient law permitting convicted felons to plead as it was called the benefit of clergy jonson might have been hanged for this deed the circumstance that the poet could read and write saved him and he received only a brand of the letter t for tyburn on his left thumb while in jail jonson became a roman catholic but he returned to the faith of the church of england a dozen years later on his release in disgrace with henslowe and his former associates jonson offered his services as a playwright to henslowes rivals the lord chamberlains company in which shakespeare was a prominent shareholder a tradition of long standing though not susceptible of proof in a court of law narrates that jonson had submitted the manuscript of every man in his humour to the chamberlains men and had received from the company a refusal that shakespeare called him back read the play himself and at once accepted it whether this story is true or not certain it is that every man in his humour was accepted by shakespeares company and acted for the first time in with shakespeare taking a part the evidence of this is contained in the list of actors prefixed to the comedy in the folio of jonsons works but it is a mistake to infer because shakespeares name stands first in the list of actors and the elder knowell first in the dramatis personae that shakespeare took that particular part the order of a list of elizabethan players was generally that of their importance or priority as shareholders in the company and seldom if ever corresponded to the list of characters every man in his humour was an immediate success and with it jonsons reputation as one of the leading dramatists of his time was established once and for all this could have been by no means jonsons earliest comedy and we have just learned that he was already reputed one of our best in tragedy indeed one of jonsons extant comedies the case is altered but one never claimed by him or published as his must certainly have preceded every man in his humour on the stage the former play may be described as a comedy modelled on the latin plays of plautus it combines in fact situations derived from the captivi and the aulularia of that dramatist but the pretty story of the beggarmaiden rachel and her suitors jonson found not among the classics but in the ideals of romantic love which shakespeare had already popularised on the stage jonson never again produced so fresh and lovable a feminine personage as rachel although in other respects the case is altered is not a conspicuous play and save for the satirising of antony munday in the person of antonio balladino and gabriel harvey as well is perhaps the least characteristic of the comedies of jonson every man in his humour probably first acted late in the summer of and at the curtain is commonly regarded as an epochmaking play and this view is not unjustified as to plot it tells little more than how an intercepted letter enabled a father to follow his supposedly studious son to london and there observe his life with the gallants of the time the real quality of this comedy is in its personages and in the theory upon which they are conceived ben jonson had theories about poetry and the drama and he was neither chary in talking of them nor in experimenting with them in his plays this makes jonson like dryden in his time and wordsworth much later an author to reckon with particularly when we remember that many of jonsons notions came for a time definitely to prevail and to modify the whole trend of english poetry first of all jonson was a classicist that is he believed in restraint and precedent in art in opposition to the prevalent ungoverned and irresponsible renaissance spirit jonson believed that there was a professional way of doing things which might be reached by a study of the best examples and he found these examples for the most part among the ancients to confine our attention to the drama jonson objected to the amateurishness and haphazard nature of many contemporary plays and set himself to do something different and the first and most striking thing that he evolved was his conception and practice of the comedy of humours as jonson has been much misrepresented in this matter let us quote his own words as to humour a humour according to jonson was a bias of disposition a warp so to speak in character by which some one peculiar quality doth so possess a man that it doth draw all his affects his spirits and his powers in their confluctions all to run one way but continuing jonson is careful to add but that a rook by wearing a pied feather the cable hatband or the threepiled ruff a yard of shoetie or the switzers knot on his french garters should affect a humour o it is more than most ridiculous jonsons comedy of humours in a word conceived of stage personages on the basis of a ruling trait or passion a notable simplification of actual life be it observed in passing and placing these typified traits in juxtaposition in their conflict and contrast struck the spark of comedy downright as his name indicates is a plain squire bobadills humour is that of the braggart who is incidentally and with delightfully comic effect a coward brainworms humour is the finding out of things to the end of fooling everybody of course he is fooled in the end himself but it was not jonsons theories alone that made the success of every man in his humour the play is admirably written and each character is vividly conceived and with a firm touch based on observation of the men of the london of the day jonson was neither in this his first great comedy nor in any other play that he wrote a supine classicist urging that english drama return to a slavish adherence to classical conditions he says as to the laws of the old comedy meaning by laws such matters as the unities of time and place and the use of chorus i see not then but we should enjoy the same licence or free power to illustrate and heighten our invention as they the ancients did and not be tied to those strict and regular forms which the niceness of a few who are nothing but form would thrust upon us every man in his humour is written in prose a novel practice which jonson had of his predecessor in comedy john lyly even the word humour seems to have been employed in the jonsonian sense by chapman before jonsons use of it indeed the comedy of humours itself is only a heightened variety of the comedy of manners which represents life viewed at a satirical angle and is the oldest and most persistent species of comedy in the language none the less jonsons comedy merited its immediate success and marked out a definite course in which comedy long continued to run to mention only shakespeares falstaff and his rout bardolph pistol dame quickly and the rest whether in henry iv or in the merry wives of windsor all are conceived in the spirit of humours so are the captains welsh scotch and irish of henry v and malvolio especially later though shakespeare never employed the method of humours for an important personage it was not jonsons fault that many of his successors did precisely the thing that he had reprobated that is degrade the humour into an oddity of speech an eccentricity of manner of dress or cut of beard there was an anonymous play called every woman in her humour chapman wrote a humourous days mirth day humour out of breath fletcher later the humourous lieutenant and jonson besides every man out of his humour returned to the title in closing the cycle of his comedies in the magnetic lady or humours reconciled with the performance of every man out of his humour in by shakespeares company once more at the globe we turn a new page in jonsons career despite his many real virtues if there is one feature more than any other that distinguishes jonson it is his arrogance and to this may be added his selfrighteousness especially under criticism or satire every man out of his humour is the first of three comical satires which jonson contributed to what dekker called the poetomachia or war of the theatres as recent critics have named it this play as a fabric of plot is a very slight affair but as a satirical picture of the manners of the time proceeding by means of vivid caricature couched in witty and brilliant dialogue and sustained by that righteous indignation which must lie at the heart of all true satire as a realisation in short of the classical ideal of comedy there had been nothing like jonsons comedy since the days of aristophanes every man in his humour like the two plays that follow it contains two kinds of attack the critical or generally satiric levelled at abuses and corruptions in the abstract and the personal in which specific application is made of all this in the lampooning of poets and others jonsons contemporaries the method of personal attack by actual caricature of a person on the stage is almost as old as the drama aristophanes so lampooned euripides in the acharnians and socrates in the clouds to mention no other examples and in english drama this kind of thing is alluded to again and again what jonson really did was to raise the dramatic lampoon to an art and make out of a casual burlesque and bit of mimicry a dramatic satire of literary pretensions and permanency with the arrogant attitude mentioned above and his uncommon eloquence in scorn vituperation and invective it is no wonder that jonson soon involved himself in literary and even personal quarrels with his fellowauthors the circumstances of the origin of this poetomachia are far from clear and those who have written on the topic except of late have not helped to make them clearer the origin of the war has been referred to satirical references apparently to jonson contained in the scourge of villainy a satire in regular form after the manner of the ancients by john marston a fellow playwright subsequent friend and collaborator of jonsons on the other hand epigrams of jonson have been discovered and variously charging playwright reasonably identified with marston with scurrility cowardice and plagiarism though the dates of the epigrams cannot be ascertained with certainty jonsons own statement of the matter to drummond runs he had many quarrels with marston beat him and took his pistol from him wrote his poetaster on him the beginnings of them were that marston represented him on the stage footnote the best account of this whole subject is to be found in the edition of poetaster and satiromastrix by j h penniman in belles lettres series shortly to appear see also his earlier work the war of the theatres and the excellent contributions to the subject by h c hart in notes and queries and in his edition of jonson here at least we are on certain ground and the principals of the quarrel are known histriomastix a play revised by marston in has been regarded as the one in which jonson was thus represented on the stage although the personage in question chrisogonus a poet satirist and translator poor but proud and contemptuous of the common herd seems rather a complimentary portrait of jonson than a caricature as to the personages actually ridiculed in every man out of his humour carlo buffone was formerly thought certainly to be marston as he was described as a public scurrilous and profane jester and elsewhere as the grand scourge or second untruss that is satirist of the time joseph hall being by his own boast the first and marstons work being entitled the scourge of villainy apparently we must now prefer for carlo a notorious character named charles chester of whom gossipy and inaccurate aubrey relates that he was a bold impertinent fellowa perpetual talker and made a noise like a drum in a room so one time at a tavern sir walter raleigh beats him and seals up his mouth that is his upper and nether beard with hard wax from him ben jonson takes his carlo buffone ie jester in every man in his humour sic is it conceivable that after all jonson was ridiculing marston and that the point of the satire consisted in an intentional confusion of the grand scourge or second untruss with the scurrilous and profane chester we have digressed into detail in this particular case to exemplify the difficulties of criticism in its attempts to identify the allusions in these forgotten quarrels we are on sounder ground of fact in recording other manifestations of jonsons enmity in the case is altered there is clear ridicule in the character antonio balladino of anthony munday pageantpoet of the city translator of romances and playwright as well in every man in his humour there is certainly a caricature of samuel daniel accepted poet of the court sonneteer and companion of men of fashion these men held recognised positions to which jonson felt his talents better entitled him they were hence to him his natural enemies it seems almost certain that he pursued both in the personages of his satire through every man out of his humour and cynthias revels daniel under the characters fastidious brisk and hedon munday as puntarvolo and amorphus but in these last we venture on quagmire once more jonsons literary rivalry of daniel is traceable again and again in the entertainments that welcomed king james on his way to london in the masques at court and in the pastoral drama as to jonsons personal ambitions with respect to these two men it is notable that he became not pageantpoet but chronologer to the city of london and that on the accession of the new king he came soon to triumph over daniel as the accepted entertainer of royalty cynthias revels the second comical satire was acted in and as a play is even more lengthy elaborate and impossible than every man out of his humour here personal satire seems to have absorbed everything and while much of the caricature is admirable especially in the detail of witty and trenchantly satirical dialogue the central idea of a fountain of selflove is not very well carried out and the persons revert at times to abstractions the action to allegory it adds to our wonder that this difficult drama should have been acted by the children of queen elizabeths chapel among them nathaniel field with whom jonson read horace and martial and whom he taught later how to make plays another of these precocious little actors was salathiel pavy who died before he was thirteen already famed for taking the parts of old men him jonson immortalised in one of the sweetest of his epitaphs an interesting sidelight is this on the character of this redoubtable and rugged satirist that he should thus have befriended and tenderly remembered these little theatrical waifs some of whom as we know had been literally kidnapped to be pressed into the service of the theatre and whipped to the conning of their difficult parts to the caricature of daniel and munday in cynthias revels must be added anaides impudence here assuredly marston and asotus the prodigal interpreted as lodge or more perilously raleigh crites like aspermacilente in every man out of his humour is jonsons selfcomplaisant portrait of himself the just wholly admirable and judicious scholar holding his head high above the pack of the yelping curs of envy and detraction but careless of their puny attacks on his perfections with only too mindful a neglect the third and last of the comical satires is poetaster acted once more by the children of the chapel in and jonsons only avowed contribution to the fray according to the authors own account this play was written in fifteen weeks on a report that his enemies had entrusted to dekker the preparation of satiromastix the untrussing of the humorous poet a dramatic attack upon himself in this attempt to forestall his enemies jonson succeeded and poetaster was an immediate and deserved success while hardly more closely knit in structure than its earlier companion pieces poetaster is planned to lead up to the ludicrous final scene in which after a device borrowed from the lexiphanes of lucian the offending poetaster marstoncrispinus is made to throw up the difficult words with which he had overburdened his stomach as well as overlarded his vocabulary in the end crispinus with his fellow dekkerdemetrius is bound over to keep the peace and never thenceforward malign traduce or detract the person or writings of quintus horatius flaccus jonson or any other eminent man transcending you in merit one of the most diverting personages in jonsons comedy is captain tucca his peculiarity has been well described by ward as a buoyant blackguardism which recovers itself instantaneously from the most complete exposure and a picturesqueness of speech like that of a walking dictionary of slang it was this character captain tucca that dekker hit upon in his reply satiromastix and he amplified him turning his abusive vocabulary back upon jonson and adding an immodesty to his dialogue that did not enter into jonsons conception it has been held altogether plausibly that when dekker was engaged professionally so to speak to write a dramatic reply to jonson he was at work on a species of chronicle history dealing with the story of walter terill in the reign of william rufus this he hurriedly adapted to include the satirical characters suggested by poetaster and fashioned to convey the satire of his reply the absurdity of placing horace in the court of a norman king is the result but dekkers play is not without its palpable hits at the arrogance the literary pride and selfrighteousness of jonsonhorace whose ningle or pal the absurd asinius bubo has recently been shown to figure forth in all likelihood jonsons friend the poet drayton slight and hastily adapted as is satiromastix especially in a comparison with the better wrought and more significant satire of poetaster the town awarded the palm to dekker not to jonson and jonson gave over in consequence his practice of comical satire though jonson was cited to appear before the lord chief justice to answer certain charges to the effect that he had attacked lawyers and soldiers in poetaster nothing came of this complaint it may be suspected that much of this furious clatter and giveandtake was pure playing to the gallery the town was agog with the strife and on no less an authority than shakespeare hamlet ii we learn that the childrens company acting the plays of jonson did so berattle the common stagesthat many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and dare scarce come thither several other plays have been thought to bear a greater or less part in the war of the theatres among them the most important is a college play entitled the return from parnassus dating in it a muchquoted passage makes burbage as a character declare why heres our fellow shakespeare puts them all down aye and ben jonson too o that ben jonson is a pestilent fellow he brought up horace giving the poets a pill but our fellow shakespeare hath given him a purge that made him bewray his credit was shakespeare then concerned in this war of the stages and what could have been the nature of this purge among several suggestions troilus and cressida has been thought by some to be the play in which shakespeare thus put down his friend jonson a wiser interpretation finds the purge in satiromastix which though not written by shakespeare was staged by his company and therefore with his approval and under his direction as one of the leaders of that company the last years of the reign of elizabeth thus saw jonson recognised as a dramatist second only to shakespeare and not second even to him as a dramatic satirist but jonson now turned his talents to new fields plays on subjects derived from classical story and myth had held the stage from the beginning of the drama so that shakespeare was making no new departure when he wrote his julius caesar about therefore when jonson staged sejanus three years later and with shakespeares company once more he was only following in the elder dramatists footsteps but jonsons idea of a play on classical history on the one hand and shakespeares and the elder popular dramatists on the other were very different heywood some years before had put five straggling plays on the stage in quick succession all derived from stories in ovid and dramatised with little taste or discrimination shakespeare had a finer conception of form but even he was contented to take all his ancient history from norths translation of plutarch and dramatise his subject without further inquiry jonson was a scholar and a classical antiquarian he reprobated this slipshod amateurishness and wrote his sejanus like a scholar reading tacitus suetonius and other authorities to be certain of his facts his setting and his atmosphere and somewhat pedantically noting his authorities in the margin when he came to print sejanus is a tragedy of genuine dramatic power in which is told with discriminating taste the story of the haughty favourite of tiberius with his tragical overthrow our drama presents no truer nor more painstaking representation of ancient roman life than may be found in jonsons sejanus and catiline his conspiracy which followed in a passage in the address of the former play to the reader in which jonson refers to a collaboration in an earlier version has led to the surmise that shakespeare may have been that worthier pen there is no evidence to determine the matter in we find jonson in active collaboration with chapman and marston in the admirable comedy of london life entitled eastward hoe in the previous year marston had dedicated his malcontent in terms of fervid admiration to jonson so that the wounds of the war of the theatres must have been long since healed between jonson and chapman there was the kinship of similar scholarly ideals the two continued friends throughout life eastward hoe achieved the extraordinary popularity represented in a demand for three issues in one year but this was not due entirely to the merits of the play in its earliest version a passage which an irritable courtier conceived to be derogatory to his nation the scots sent both chapman and jonson to jail but the matter was soon patched up for by this time jonson had influence at court with the accession of king james jonson began his long and successful career as a writer of masques he wrote more masques than all his competitors together and they are of an extraordinary variety and poetic excellence jonson did not invent the masque for such premeditated devices to set and frame so to speak a court ball had been known and practised in varying degrees of elaboration long before his time but jonson gave dramatic value to the masque especially in his invention of the antimasque a comedy or farcical element of relief entrusted to professional players or dancers he enhanced as well the beauty and dignity of those portions of the masque in which noble lords and ladies took their parts to create by their gorgeous costumes and artistic grouping and evolutions a sumptuous show on the mechanical and scenic side jonson had an inventive and ingenious partner in inigo jones the royal architect who more than any one man raised the standard of stage representation in the england of his day jonson continued active in the service of the court in the writing of masques and other entertainments far into the reign of king charles but towards the end a quarrel with jones embittered his life and the two testy old men appear to have become not only a constant irritation to each other but intolerable bores at court in hymenaei the masque of queens love freed from ignorance lovers made men pleasure reconciled to virtue and many more will be found jonsons aptitude his taste his poetry and inventiveness in these byforms of the drama while in the masque of christmas and the gipsies metamorphosed especially is discoverable that power of broad comedy which at court as well as in the city was not the least element of jonsons contemporary popularity but jonson had by no means given up the popular stage when he turned to the amusement of king james in volpone was produced the silent woman in the alchemist in the following year these comedies with bartholomew fair represent jonson at his height and for constructive cleverness character successfully conceived in the manner of caricature wit and brilliancy of dialogue they stand alone in english drama volpone or the fox is in a sense a transition play from the dramatic satires of the war of the theatres to the purer comedy represented in the plays named above its subject is a struggle of wit applied to chicanery for among its dramatis personae from the villainous fox himself his rascally servant mosca voltore the vulture corbaccio and corvino the big and the little raven to sir politic wouldbe and the rest there is scarcely a virtuous character in the play question has been raised as to whether a story so forbidding can be considered a comedy for although the plot ends in the discomfiture and imprisonment of the most vicious it involves no mortal catastrophe but jonson was on sound historical ground for volpone is conceived far more logically on the lines of the ancients theory of comedy than was ever the romantic drama of shakespeare however repulsive we may find a philosophy of life that facilely divides the world into the rogues and their dupes and identifying brains with roguery and innocence with folly admires the former while inconsistently punishing them the silent woman is a gigantic farce of the most ingenious construction the whole comedy hinges on a huge joke played by a heartless nephew on his misanthropic uncle who is induced to take to himself a wife young fair and warranted silent but who in the end turns out neither silent nor a woman at all in the alchemist again we have the utmost cleverness in construction the whole fabric building climax on climax witty ingenious and so plausibly presented that we forget its departures from the possibilities of life in the alchemist jonson represented none the less to the life certain sharpers of the metropolis revelling in their shrewdness and rascality and in the variety of the stupidity and wickedness of their victims we may object to the fact that the only person in the play possessed of a scruple of honesty is discomfited and that the greatest scoundrel of all is approved in the end and rewarded the comedy is so admirably written and contrived the personages stand out with such lifelike distinctness in their several kinds and the whole is animated with such verve and resourcefulness that the alchemist is a new marvel every time it is read lastly of this group comes the tremendous comedy bartholomew fair less clear cut less definite and less structurally worthy of praise than its three predecessors but full of the keenest and cleverest of satire and inventive to a degree beyond any english comedy save some other of jonsons own it is in bartholomew fair that we are presented to the immortal caricature of the puritan zealintheland busy and the littlewits that group about him and it is in this extraordinary comedy that the humour of jonson always open to this danger loosens into the rabelaisian mode that so delighted king james in the gipsies metamorphosed another comedy of less merit is the devil is an ass acted in it was the failure of this play that caused jonson to give over writing for the public stage for a period of nearly ten years volpone was laid as to scene in venice whether because of the success of eastward hoe or for other reasons the other three comedies declare in the words of the prologue to the alchemist our scene is london cause we would make known no countrys mirth is better than our own indeed jonson went further when he came to revise his plays for collected publication in his folio of he transferred the scene of every man in his humour from florence to london also converting signior lorenzo di pazzi to old knowell prospero to master welborn and hesperida to dame kitely dwelling i the old jewry in his comedies of london life despite his trend towards caricature jonson has shown himself a genuine realist drawing from the life about him with an experience and insight rare in any generation a happy comparison has been suggested between ben jonson and charles dickens both were men of the people lowly born and hardly bred each knew the london of his time as few men knew it and each represented it intimately and in elaborate detail both men were at heart moralists seeking the truth by the exaggerated methods of humour and caricature perverse even wrongheaded at times but possessed of a true pathos and largeness of heart and when all has been said though the elizabethan ran to satire the victorian to sentimentality leaving the world better for the art that they practised in it in the year of the death of shakespeare jonson collected his plays his poetry and his masques for publication in a collective edition this was an unusual thing at the time and had been attempted by no dramatist before jonson this volume published in a carefully revised text all the plays thus far mentioned excepting the case is altered which jonson did not acknowledge bartholomew fair and the devil is an ass which was written too late it included likewise a book of some hundred and thirty odd epigrams in which form of brief and pungent writing jonson was an acknowledged master the forest a smaller collection of lyric and occasional verse and some ten masques and entertainments in this same year jonson was made poet laureate with a pension of one hundred marks a year this with his fees and returns from several noblemen and the small earnings of his plays must have formed the bulk of his income the poet appears to have done certain literary hackwork for others as for example parts of the punic wars contributed to raleighs history of the world we know from a story little to the credit of either that jonson accompanied raleighs son abroad in the capacity of a tutor in jonson was granted the reversion of the office of master of the revels a post for which he was peculiarly fitted but he did not live to enjoy its perquisites jonson was honoured with degrees by both universities though when and under what circumstances is not known it has been said that he narrowly escaped the honour of knighthood which the satirists of the day averred king james was wont to lavish with an indiscriminate hand worse men were made knights in his day than worthy ben jonson from to the close of the reign of king james jonson produced nothing for the stage but he prosecuted what he calls his wonted studies with such assiduity that he became in reality as by report one of the most learned men of his time jonsons theory of authorship involved a wide acquaintance with books and an ability as he put it to convert the substance or riches of another poet to his own use accordingly jonson read not only the greek and latin classics down to the lesser writers but he acquainted himself especially with the latin writings of his learned contemporaries their prose as well as their poetry their antiquities and curious lore as well as their more solid learning though a poor man jonson was an indefatigable collector of books he told drummond that the earl of pembroke sent him pounds every first day of the new year to buy new books unhappily in his library was destroyed by fire an accident seriocomically described in his witty poem an execration upon vulcan yet even now a book turns up from time to time in which is inscribed in fair large italian lettering the name ben jonson with respect to jonsons use of his material dryden said memorably of him he was not only a professed imitator of horace but a learned plagiary of all the others you track him everywhere in their snowbut he has done his robberies so openly that one sees he fears not to be taxed by any law he invades authors like a monarch and what would be theft in other poets is only victory in him and yet it is but fair to say that jonson prided himself and justly on his originality in catiline he not only uses sallusts account of the conspiracy but he models some of the speeches of cicero on the roman orators actual words in poetaster he lifts a whole satire out of horace and dramatises it effectively for his purposes the sophist libanius suggests the situation of the silent woman a latin comedy of giordano bruno il candelaio the relation of the dupes and the sharpers in the alchemist the mostellaria of plautus its admirable opening scene but jonson commonly bettered his sources and putting the stamp of his sovereignty on whatever bullion he borrowed made it thenceforward to all time current and his own the lyric and especially the occasional poetry of jonson has a peculiar merit his theory demanded design and the perfection of literary finish he was furthest from the rhapsodist and the careless singer of an idle day and he believed that apollo could only be worthily served in singing robes and laurel crowned and yet many of jonsons lyrics will live as long as the language who does not know queen and huntress chaste and fair drink to me only with thine eyes or still to be neat still to be dressed beautiful in form deft and graceful in expression with not a word too much or one that bears not its part in the total effect there is yet about the lyrics of jonson a certain stiffness and formality a suspicion that they were not quite spontaneous and unbidden but that they were carved so to speak with disproportionate labour by a potent man of letters whose habitual thought is on greater things it is for these reasons that jonson is even better in the epigram and in occasional verse where rhetorical finish and pointed wit less interfere with the spontaneity and emotion which we usually associate with lyrical poetry there are no such epitaphs as ben jonsons witness the charming ones on his own children on salathiel pavy the childactor and many more and this even though the rigid law of mine and thine must now restore to william browne of tavistock the famous lines beginning underneath this sable hearse jonson is unsurpassed too in the difficult poetry of compliment seldom falling into fulsome praise and disproportionate similitude yet showing again and again a generous appreciation of worth in others a discriminating taste and a generous personal regard there was no man in england of his rank so well known and universally beloved as ben jonson the list of his friends of those to whom he had written verses and those who had written verses to him includes the name of every man of prominence in the england of king james and the tone of many of these productions discloses an affectionate familiarity that speaks for the amiable personality and sound worth of the laureate in growing unwieldy through inactivity jonson hit upon the heroic remedy of a journey afoot to scotland on his way thither and back he was hospitably received at the houses of many friends and by those to whom his friends had recommended him when he arrived in edinburgh the burgesses met to grant him the freedom of the city and drummond foremost of scottish poets was proud to entertain him for weeks as his guest at hawthornden some of the noblest of jonsons poems were inspired by friendship such is the fine ode to the memory of sir lucius cary and sir henry moryson and that admirable piece of critical insight and filial affection prefixed to the first shakespeare folio to the memory of my beloved master william shakespeare and what he hath left us to mention only these nor can the earlier epode beginning not to know vice at all be matched in stately gravity and gnomic wisdom in its own wise and stately age but if jonson had deserted the stage after the publication of his folio and up to the end of the reign of king james he was far from inactive for year after year his inexhaustible inventiveness continued to contribute to the masquing and entertainment at court in the golden age restored pallas turns the iron age with its attendant evils into statues which sink out of sight in pleasure reconciled to virtue atlas figures represented as an old man his shoulders covered with snow and comus the god of cheer or the belly is one of the characters a circumstance which an imaginative boy of ten named john milton was not to forget pans anniversary late in the reign of james proclaimed that jonson had not yet forgotten how to write exquisite lyrics and the gipsies metamorphosed displayed the old drollery and broad humorous stroke still unimpaired and unmatchable these too and the earlier years of charles were the days of the apollo room of the devil tavern where jonson presided the absolute monarch of english literary bohemia we hear of a room blazoned about with jonsons own judicious leges convivales in letters of gold of a company made up of the choicest spirits of the time devotedly attached to their veteran dictator his reminiscences opinions affections and enmities and we hear too of valorous potations but in the words of herrick addressed to his master jonson at the devil tavern as at the dog the triple tun and at the mermaid we such clusters had as made us nobly wild not mad and yet each verse of thine outdid the meat outdid the frolic wine but the patronage of the court failed in the days of king charles though jonson was not without royal favours and the old poet returned to the stage producing between and the staple of news the new inn the magnetic lady and the tale of a tub the last doubtless revised from a much earlier comedy none of these plays met with any marked success although the scathing generalisation of dryden that designated them jonsons dotages is unfair to their genuine merits thus the idea of an office for the gathering proper dressing and promulgation of news wild flight of the fancy in its time was an excellent subject for satire on the existing absurdities among newsmongers although as much can hardly be said for the magnetic lady who in her bounty draws to her personages of differing humours to reconcile them in the end according to the alternative title or humours reconciled these last plays of the old dramatist revert to caricature and the hard lines of allegory the moralist is more than ever present the satire degenerates into personal lampoon especially of his sometime friend inigo jones who appears unworthily to have used his influence at court against the brokendown old poet and now disease claimed jonson and he was bedridden for months he had succeeded middleton in as chronologer to the city of london but lost the post for not fulfilling its duties king charles befriended him and even commissioned him to write still for the entertainment of the court and he was not without the sustaining hand of noble patrons and devoted friends among the younger poets who were proud to be sealed of the tribe of ben jonson died august and a second folio of his works which he had been some time gathering was printed in bearing in its various parts dates ranging from to it included all the plays mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs excepting the case is altered the masques some fifteen that date between and another collection of lyrics and occasional poetry called underwoods including some further entertainments a translation of horaces art of poetry also published in a vicesimo quarto in and certain fragments and ingatherings which the poet would hardly have included himself these last comprise the fragment less than seventy lines of a tragedy called mortimer his fall and three acts of a pastoral drama of much beauty and poetic spirit the sad shepherd there is also the exceedingly interesting english grammar made by ben jonson for the benefit of all strangers out of his observation of the english language now spoken and in use in latin and english and timber or discoveries made upon men and matter as they have flowed out of his daily reading or had their reflux to his peculiar notion of the times the discoveries as it is usually called is a commonplace book such as many literary men have kept in which their reading was chronicled passages that took their fancy translated or transcribed and their passing opinions noted many passages of jonsons discoveries are literal translations from the authors he chanced to be reading with the reference noted or not as the accident of the moment prescribed at times he follows the line of macchiavellis argument as to the nature and conduct of princes at others he clarifies his own conception of poetry and poets by recourse to aristotle he finds a choice paragraph on eloquence in seneca the elder and applies it to his own recollection of bacons power as an orator and another on facile and ready genius and translates it adapting it to his recollection of his fellowplaywright shakespeare to call such passages which jonson never intended for publication plagiarism is to obscure the significance of words to disparage his memory by citing them is a preposterous use of scholarship jonsons prose both in his dramas in the descriptive comments of his masques and in the discoveries is characterised by clarity and vigorous directness nor is it wanting in a fine sense of form or in the subtler graces of diction when jonson died there was a project for a handsome monument to his memory but the civil war was at hand and the project failed a memorial not insufficient was carved on the stone covering his grave in one of the aisles of westminster abbey o rare ben jonson felix e

praised to be the happiest and most precious wit that ever was familiar with art now by our ladys blessed son i swear i rather think him most unfortunate in the possession of such holy gifts being the

patience as any other man for he used to take physic and oft taking physic makes a man a very patient creature but signior prospero had your swaggering epistle here arrived in my fathers hands at such an hour of his patience i mean when he had taken physic it is to be doubted whether i should have read sweet villain here but what my wise cousin nay then ill furnish our feast with one gull more

speak to serve my turn lor ju your turn why cousin a gentleman of so fair sort as you are of so true carriage so special good parts of so dear and choice estimation one whose lowest condition bears the stamp of a great spirit nay more a man so graced gilded or rather to use a more fit metaphor tinfoiled by nature not that you have a leaden constitution coz although perhaps a little inclining to that temper and so the more apt to melt with pity when you fall into the fire of rage but for your lustre only which reflects as bright to the world as an old alewifes pewter again a good time and will you now with nice modesty hide such real ornaments as these and shadow their glory as a milliners wife doth her wrought stomacher with a smoky lawn or a black cyprus come come for shame do not wrong the quality of your dessert in so poor a kind but let the idea of what you are be portrayed in your aspect that men may read in your looks here within this place is to be seen the most admirable rare and accomplished work of nature cousin what think you of this step marry i do think of it and i will be more melancholy and gentlemanlike than i have been i do ensure you lor ju why this is well

trust my life into his hands i have so strong opinion of his love if need were giu god send me never such need but you said you had somewhat to tell me what ist tho faith brother i am loath to utter it as fearing to abuse your patience but that i know your judgment more direct able to sway the nearest of affection giu come come what needs this circumstance tho i will not say what honour i ascribe unto your friendship nor in what dear state i hold your love let my continued zeal the constant and religious regard that i have ever carried to your name my carriage with your sister all contest how much i stand affected to your house giu you are too tedious come to the matter come to the matter tho then without further ceremony thus my brother prospero i know not how of late is much declined from what he was and greatly alterd in his disposition when he came first to lodge here in my house neer trust me if i was not proud of him methought he bare himself with such observance so true election and so fair a form and what was chief it shewd not borrowd in him but all he did became him as his own and seemd as perfect proper and innate unto the mind as colour to the blood but now his course is so irregular so loose affected and deprived of grace and he himself withal so far fallen off from his first place that scarce no note remains to tell mens judgments where he lately stood hes grown a stranger to all due respect forgetful of his friends and not content to stale himself in all societies he makes my house as common as a mart a theatre a public receptacle for giddy humour and diseased riot and there as in a tavern or a stews he and his wild associates spend their hours in repetition of lascivious jests swear leap and dance and revel night by night control my servants and indeed what not giu faith i know not what i should say to him so god save me i am een at my wits end i have told him enough one would think if that would serve well he knows what to trust to for me let him spend and spend and domineer till his heart ache an he get a penny more of me ill give him this ear tho nay good brother have patience giu sblood he mads me i could eat my very flesh for anger i marle you will not tell him of it how he disquiets your house tho o there are divers reasons to dissuade me but would yourself vouchsafe to travail in it though but with plain and easy circumstance it would both come much better to his sense and savour less of grief and discontent you are his elder brother and that title confirms and warrants your authority which seconded by your aspect will breed a kind of duty in him and regard whereas if i should intimate the least it would but add contempt to his neglect heap worse on ill rear a huge pile of hate that in the building would come tottering down and in her ruins bury all our love nay more than this brother if i should speak he would be ready in the heat of passion to fill the ears of his familiars with oft reporting to them what disgrace and gross disparagement i had proposed him and then would they straight back him in opinion make some loose comment upon every word and out of their distracted phantasies contrive some slander that should dwell with me and what would that be think you marry this they would give out because my wife is fair myself but lately married and my sister here sojourning a virgin in my house that i were jealous nay as sure as death thus they would say and how that i had wrongd my brother purposely thereby to find an apt pretext to banish them my house giu mass perhaps so tho brother they would believe it so should i like one of these penurious quacksalvers but try experiments upon myself open the gates unto mine own disgrace lend bareribbd envy opportunity to stab my reputation and

courses well he shall hear ont and that tightly too an i live ifaith tho but brother let your apprehension then run in an easy current not transported with heady rashness or devouring choler and rather carry a persuading spirit whose powers will pierce more gently and allure th imperfect thoughts you labour to reclaim to a more sudden and resolved assent giu ay ay let me alone for that i

first it begins solely to work upon the phantasy filling her seat with such pestiferous air as soon corrupts the judgment and from thence sends like contagion to the memory still each of other

it is blessed eternal and most true divine indeed if you will look on poesy as she appears in many poor and lame patchd up in remnants and old worn rags half starved for want of her peculiar food sacred invention then i must confirm both your conceit and censure of her merit but view her in her glorious ornaments attired in the majesty of art set high in spirit with the precious taste of sweet philosophy and which is most crownd with the rich traditions of a soul that hates to have her dignity profaned with any relish of an earthly thought oh then how proud a presence doth she bear then is she like herself fit to be seen of none but grave and consecrated eyes nor is it any blemish to her fame that such lean ignorant and blasted wits such brainless gulls should utter their stoln wares with such applauses in our vulgar ears or that their slubberd lines have current pass from the fat judgments of the multitude but that this barren and infected age should set no difference twixt these empty spirits and a true poet than which reverend name nothing can more adorn humanity enter with torches clem ay lorenzo but election is now governed altogether by the influence of humour which instead of those holy flames that should direct and light the soul to eternity hurls forth nothing but smoke and congested vapours that stifle her up and bereave her of all sight and motion but she
